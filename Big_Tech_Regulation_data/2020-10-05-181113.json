Munster noted that changes in the way Apple reports its financial results will benefit it in the coming year, allowing the company to distance itself from Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google in the group known as FAANG. </p><p>Last month, Apple said that it would stop disclosing the number of iPhones it sells each quarter, an announcement that was interpreted by many investors and analysts as a sign that the company believed its smartphone sales are declining. However, Munster thinks this will benefit the company by focusing investors' attention on its overall revenue and earnings growth instead. The changes should also highlight the growing importance of Apple's services business, he said. 'We believe the theme of Apple as a Service will slowly take root in 2019,' Munster wrote. Apple will also benefit from simply not being Facebook, Google, or Amazon, he said. All three of those companies are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny over their data-collection practices and market dominance. 'Facebook, Google, and Amazon will be facing regulatory headwinds,' Munster said.Munster also mentioned that 5G will be the biggest new iPhone feature to come in the next couple of years since the larger-screen iPhone 6 in 2014.

Mr Murdoch and News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson have both been critical of Google and Facebook's practices, with the latter last week knocking their \"smugness\".</p><p>The submission has been made public just days after US senator Elizabeth Warren, a candidate for the Democrats in the 2020 presidential elections, announced her plans for big tech companies to be broken up on competition grounds.</p><p>Following a 12-month inquiry, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission last year said Google and Facebook's market power was adversely affecting traditional publishing companies.</p><p>The ACCC announced a string of measures, including establishing a new ombudsman to monitor consumer complaints and another new body to oversee the algorithms that power Google's search engine and Facebook's news feed, as well as the tech giants' conduct in the advertising market.</p><p>News Corp argues the ACCC should be given these powers, rather than new agencies.</p><p>Google has an advertising partnership with The Age.

It found in it its draft report last year that Google and Facebook market dominance had affected traditional publishing companies.</p><p>In its submission, News Corp said it supported the ACCC's recommendations to regulate digital platforms and address the lack of transparency of algorithms, but it would like the regulator to go further by forcing Google to sell its search engine, or retain Google Search and divest the rest of its businesses to a third party.</p><p>Failing a sell-off, the publisher called for Google's business units to be \"functionally\" separated and regulated to prevent abuse of market power.</p><p>\"Google's position as 'gatekeeper' via Google Search and its market power in the 'ad tech stack' creates real and serious threats to the ability of publishers such as News Corp Australia to generate sufficient returns in order to viably fund news and journalism,\" News said.</p><p>With its call to break up the tech giant, News Corp has made itself an unlikely ally on the issue with US Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, who last week called for the break-up of big tech companies.</p><p>\"Google enjoys overwhelming market power in both online search and ad tech services and is abusing its dominant position to the detriment of consumers, advertisers and publishers,\" News Corp said.</p><p>A central News Corp gripe targets Google's use of \"snippets\" - excerpts of publisher-created content including text, images and video - that appear in Google's search results.</p><p>The ACCC's preliminary report found the use of snippets did not adversely affect click-through rates, but New Corp disagreed, saying the ACCC should \"increase regulation\", which could include \"requiring digital platforms to compensate publishers for the use of the content\".</p><p>Google's advertising power, through its \"ad tech supply chain\", is also in News Corp's sights.

During the three-day event \u2013 which was held in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province \u2013 Robin Li, CEO of search engine firm Baidu, told the audience that he is an early-riser. \u201cI wake up early every day,\u201d he admitted. \u201cMore often than not, I\u2019m up at 5am and then I will start to panic. I think about all the opportunities there are in the tech industry and how there is no way I can do everything and will have to narrow my focus.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Li isn\u2019t the only one with a lot on his mind. Jack Ma, too, says he has been losing sleep, although his problem is slightly different \u2013 how best to spend Alibaba\u2019s cash.</p><p>\u201cAs our business continues to grow, all the profits we make ought to be spent on helping improve the lives of others. If you are really rich and yet you can\u2019t spend the money well, what\u2019s the point of having so much,\u201d asked the chairman of Alibaba Group.</p><p>Leading names from firms worth $2.5 trillion gathered to hear the views of the Chinese internet tycoons (Premier Li Keqiang also made an appearance). But it was another attendee \u2013 Fang Binxing \u2013 who offered the timely reminder of why it might be a little paradoxical to hold a global internet conference in\u2008China.</p><p>Fang, of course, is the man credited with creating the Great Firewall \u2013 the technology that segregates China\u2019s internet from the rest of the web, blocking unwanted foreign sites. Somewhat deliciously, this filter was deactivated at the Wuzhen event, with attendees enjoying unfettered access to forbidden sites including Facebook and YouTube.</p><p>The temporary access didn\u2019t last beyond the conference itself, although the people of Wuzhen are now benefiting from a free Wi-Fi service that was installed for the delegates.</p><p>Wuzhen \u00ad\u2013 a canal town with architecture dating back to the Ming Dynasty \u2013 is little known internationally. But in many ways it symbolises China\u2019s own development in the tech world, says National Business Daily. While the country is known for its 5,000-year history, it now wants to be recognised as home to some of the world\u2019s biggest tech firms.</p><p>Or as Tencent\u2019s Pony Ma put it: \u201cOut of the world\u2019s 10 largest internet companies six are from the US but China accounts for four. Compared to the industrial revolution era, the gap between China and the rest of the world in advanced technology has narrowed significantly.\u201d</p><p>The state-run newspaper China Press made a similar point: \u201cThe speed of China\u2019s mobile and internet development is nothing short of extraordinary. No matter how many big tech bosses show up, or how many new contracts are signed during the conference, what\u2019s important is that China wants the world to see where its internet sector is at today.\u201d</p><p>The gathering in Wuzhen was also a \u201ccoming out party\u201d for the people who regulate China\u2019s interent, suggests The Paper, a website. Lu Wei, director of the new internet regulator (established in February), said China wants the World Internet Conference to become the industry\u2019s answer to the World Economic Forum of Davos.</p><p>Lu also took the stage to explain his regulatory mission: to ensure that China\u2019s internet is clean and controlled.</p><p>It was a message that required a metaphor, though not one likely to get Silicon Valley executives too excited.</p><p>\u201cCyberspace should be free and open, with rules to follow and always following the rule of law,\u201d Lu proclaimed. \u201cJust like this place (Wuzhen), crowded with tourists but perfectly ordered.\u201d</p><p>Quite how \u201cfree and open\u201d the Chinese internet is today wasn\u2019t one of the topics up for debate at the event. Perhaps that explains why the only major international tech boss at the conference was Paul Jacobs, the chairman of smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm.

Saturday, Dec. 19: Sarah Cashmore, Marianne Watchel Monday: Nakita Valerio Tuesday: Cara Taylor Wednesday: Teresa Spinelli, The Dart sisters Thursday: Guy Lavallee Today: Thom Bennett</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Live music venues come and go in Edmonton.</p><p>Just as another one seems to put down roots, BAM! it gets axed; usually because a) it's getting kicked out of its space or b) it's no longer financially viable.</p><p>For years, we seemed OK with these losses. We'd cry at the news of another closure - \"Oh no! I saw ______ there! My past is being obliterated!\" - but ultimately, we'd just end up shrugging our shoulders as the Sidetrack Cafe, Seedy's, kHz, Elevation Room, New City, and yes, even Red's/Edmonton Event Centre disappeared from our lives.</p><p>In 2015, however, our vanishing venues finally got top billing. We lost five more rooms - the Roxy, The ARTery, The Pawn Shop, Wunderbar, and SPACE. Two filmmakers unveiled their documentary, Dead Venues, about some of Edmonton's former hallowed halls. And one ambitious musician, Thom Bennett, decided to put an end to the phenomenon, or at the very least, slow it down.</p><p>He's the chief gardener behind ELM, or the Edmonton Live Music Initiative, a partnership between the City of Edmonton, Edmonton Arts Council and Alberta Music.</p><p>Bennett wants to grow a vibrant and stable music scene by making it easier for venues to operate, and therefore, nurture the city's performers. He proposes to do so with a series of financial incentives and zoning/licensing changes - perhaps even creating a live music district on par with the world-famous Sixth Street in Austin, Texas.</p><p>\"Frankly, it took me a long time to realize that, in the arts industry, you need to be your own boss,\" he says. \"You have to have the chutzpah or the fire to make something happen instead of waiting around for it to happen. I think I spent a large part of my career waiting and complaining instead of doing something about it. So I just decided to do something about it.\"</p><p>Bennett, 37, was also a bit of a late bloomer as a musician. He was 17 when he got his first drum kit, then enrolled in MacEwan's music program after a two-year stint in the University of Alberta's environmental sciences program.</p><p>Nowadays, he plays with one of Edmonton's most successful jazz acts, AB/Trio, and performs/records with dozens of musicians - from soul-pop vocalist Ann Vriend to Kubasonics, an Ukrainian folk band.</p><p>Bennett pitched the ELM Initiative to Coun. Scott McKeen in January, weeks before the City of Edmonton bought The ARTery's dilapidated building and forced the venue to leave due to structural issues. The city plans to tear down the building and use the site as storage during construction of the Valley Line LRT. \"Thom's an astute guy with a comprehensive view of live music and the issues around it,\" says McKeen. \"So he didn't just shill for musicians, or venues, but talked about the state of affairs and how government could be a force for good. Instantly, we started brainstorming ideas and he ran with them.\"</p><p>In October, ELM held its first brainstorming session with more than 40 venue owners, gig promoters, musicians, journalists, publicists, festival directors, politicians and city bureaucrats. They talked about a range of issues, from permits to marketing to audience behaviour. Do people even care about live music anymore?</p><p>Bennett also introduced two of his main ideas - extending alcohol sales and offering grants for venues. As part of a pilot project, three venues will receive grants to cover half of their musicians' fees for six months. For every $1 invested in the arts, there's a return of $12, according to some economic impact studies.</p><p>\"If musicians are getting paid less, they don't have as much time to work on their craft, and then the quality goes down and people don't want to come out and then musicians get paid even less,\" says Bennett. \"It's a downward spiral. You need to invest more money to get more quality.\"</p><p>As fruitful as the session was, Bennett still has to iron out some of the adversarial relationships within Edmonton's music scene. Artists don't always think venues have their best interests at heart. Some venue owners don't think it's fair for their competitors to get grants. And some owners, present and potential, think the city itself is hindering progress. The Aviary, most recently, was denied a development permit because it didn't have any parking stalls.</p><p>Bennett is now planning to work with the city to devise a business licence for live music venues, which might also end up solving some of the current zoning issues.</p><p>At the moment, there is no category exclusively for live music venues.</p><p>The Mercury Room, for example, is classified as a restaurant. Other available licences include spectator entertainment establishment, after-hours dance club, and premises offering alcohol sales.</p><p>ELM is also making headway on changing Alberta liquor regulations to benefit venues. Earlier this month, the legislature passed a motion to allow MLA David Shepherd to explore some possibilities, including extending alcohol sales by an hour to 3 a.m., or giving venues a price reduction on their booze.</p><p>Licensing, grants and zoning are definitely not part of the glamorous side of music, but Bennett knows those subjects are essential - to musicians and Edmonton as a whole.</p><p>\"I didn't get into music for the money. I love what I do and I want to keep doing what I love every day. But at the same time, there's a huge economic benefit to having a healthy music scene - it attracts people here, it keeps people here, both artists and people who want to live in a vibrant community. That's why Austin has such a big tech community. It's a young population that works in tech and they want to go out and they want to do stuff. I think (Edmonton) is starting to wake up in that respect.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ssperounes@postmedia.com\">ssperounes@postmedia.com</email> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

The extraordinary boom valued Elon Musk's electric car business at $464 billion during the peak at the end of August, when only six U.S. companies were worth more.</p><p><br/>Unfortunately for Tesla's devoted followers and retail investors who keep an account of their profits, the increase in market value has very little to do with higher vehicle sales.<br/>Rather, these are partly old financial speculations. If that feverish feeling suddenly cools, stocks could be vulnerable to another massive sale. Tesla's stock has fallen 16% since early September, incinerating $75 billion in paper earnings, and fell by about 15% in pre-market operations tuesday when the company was not added to the S&amp;P; 500 index. The news that General Motors Co. has taken a $2 billion stake in Tesla's rival Nikola Corp. will not have helped.<br/>Not everyone accepts the argument that SoftBank's huge derivatives bets drove the epic rise in technology stocks, including Tesla, as the Financial Times reported last week. But it is certainly plausible that speculative purchases of buying options, which give the investor the right to buy a stock at a specific price, by a much larger cohort of retailers and other investors, played a role in the uptick.<br/>When brokers sell short-term buying options, they often need to cover their exposure by buying the underlying stocks. It can be evidenced how a cycle of price increases could be perpetuated.<br/>Purchase options purchases have been buoyant lately, and the volumes in Tesla's stock negotiations have been staggering: nearly $65 billion of its shares changed hands in just one day in mid-July, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla's recent 5/1 stock split seemed specifically designed to encourage more purchases by making the nominal cost of stock cheaper. Shares gained about 80% after the announcement in early August.<br/>The earnings of the stock were much higher than those of most major technology (see chart below), and also challenged any simple explanation. Unlike the Amazon.com Inc., for example, Tesla has not obtained a material benefit from the pandemic. By contrast, his car plant in California had to close for a while.<br/>And while some investors perceive high-cap technology stocks like Alphabet Inc., with their massive cash flows and entrenched market positions, such as shelters, Tesla also doesn't match that description either.<br/>If we eliminate the benefit of selling pollution regulatory credits to rival manufacturers, Tesla's auto business continues to generate losses and faces increasing competition as industry giants begin mass-producing their own electric vehicles.<br/>To be fair, Tesla has built an attractive brand and car features and automated driving features improve the longer it has it. It has also improved its manufacture; a new Shanghai plant began operations in a very short time.<br/>Meanwhile, tesla's $5 billion stock sale announced last week will help pay for its spending plans, including new factories in Germany and Texas, and provides a safety net in casefinancial setbacks. The company's inflated valuation means that the issuance of all these shares will hardly dilute shareholders.<br/>While Tesla has repeatedly shown that it can raise massive sums of money, it has not yet shown that it can generate decent yields on that capital.<br/>Its current market capitalization of US$390 billion\u2014four times that of Volkswagen AG, the world's largest automaker\u2014remains impossible to justify under any normal metric. Most analysts are optimistic about big tech, but une enthusiasts with Tesla. The average target price implies that stocks will fall more than 30%.<br/>Wall Street analysts have consistently made a mistake this year, but even Musk believes Tesla's share price is \"too high.\" His intervention on Twitter was in May, when market capitalization was less than 40% of the current one.<br/>Ideally, Tesla would gradually integrate with its high valuation by generating much higher revenue, profits and cash flow in the coming years. However, speculative bubbles tend to deflate suddenly, particularly if there is unexpected bad news. Tesla investors craved inclusion in the S&amp;P; 500, which was expected to trigger even more stock purchases by index tracking funds. But, strangely, Tesla isn't on the new list.<br/>In the real world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the avalanche of rival new electric cars coming to market. That might explain why Tesla's revenue growth has been so mediocre lately.  <br/>Competition is most evident in Europe, where there is stricter regulation. Tesla's European sales and market share have declined this year, and this regardless of the departure of several Volkswagen electric SUVs at interesting prices. The VW group will likely outperform Tesla to become the world's largest electric car manufacturer in a couple of years.<br/>Musk is a master at maintaining enthusiasm, either by announcing new product categories such as the Cybertruck van, or by alluding to new technologies such as fully automated driving. And yet the company's current automated driving capabilities have received mixed reviews.<br/>Tesla Battery Day at the end of this month will likely offer an additional boost of investor enthusiasm. But to keep the stock price high, Musk will need to be in shape.<br/>Original Note:The Tesla Hype Machine Is Looking Shaky: Chris Bryant<br/>\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-14312016</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T1-N7T1-DY1R-B3J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"922\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0004B4V</classCode><className>SOFTBANK TECHNOLOGY CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC000581R</classCode><className>TESLA AS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC7373 COMPUTER INTEGRATED SYSTEMS DESIGN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

Why did you choose Citi  to write a book, James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well it's the classic too big to fail bank.  It was -- my co- author Vern McKinley who brought the idea to me and the lesson here is  really amazing.  You had a really strong healthy vibrant institution.  It  was so strong it even bailed out the government at times when it was a  completely free institution with no taxpayer backing.  Then --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- about a hundred years ago we get the Federal Reserve, we get  the safety net, taxpayer standing behind it and it's a series of crisis  ever since.  So it's a -- it's a real lesson about the corrosive nature of  the safety net.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's -- and it's an important book because it's important  to tell us exactly what happened in history.  \"Borrowed Time\" is the -- is  the name.  Congrats to you, we're going to talk a lot about your new book - -</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this morning James Freeman.  First though our top story  right now and that is Wall Street and Washington telling Tesla, \"Show me  the money.\"  The Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating  where the CEO Elon Musk's tweet yesterday was truthful.</p><p>He tweeted Tuesday this, \"I'm considering taking Tesla private at $420 a  share.  Funding secured.\"  Joining us right now is Mainstay Capital  Management CEO, Chief Investment Strategist David Kudla.  David, good to  see you this morning.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, CEO, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I'm glad you're here because you shorted Tesla over the  past two days and you've been watching this company and covering it for a  long time, your reaction to what has taken place David.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, if we look at what's happened over the past couple  of days the stock never approached $420, the apparent deal price.  It  reached the high of $387 after that tweet came out two days ago, in  premarket today it's more than $20.00 off that price.</p><p>So the market is losing faith in this deal.  And if we look at the merits  of it, I own a very small company by comparison, if I were going to sell it  and arrive at a price, it would take more than a week of discussion to do  that.  If I were doing the largest LBO in history they said they talked  about, the board talked about this last week to arrive at a price in secure  funding, I think it would take a lot longer than one week.  It's just hard  to believe this is real.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean he said funding secured which really was a head- scratcher because you're talking about something like $75 billion, right,  to get to a $420 price.</p><p>KUDLA:  Right.  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you -- so you're questioning whether or not the  funding is secured.</p><p>KUDLA:  Yes.  I think everybody is questioning that.  And now as we know,  the SEC is questioning it and why all the mystery?  If he knows the price  or Tesla knows the price and why all the mystery on who is the buyer or who  are the buyers?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It was pretty clear yesterday that the Securities and  Exchange Commission was going to be knocking on the company's door after  that tweet James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think this may be a question for a Securities lower but  it may come down to -- a lot is going to hinge on this word secure.  Does  this mean he made a few calls and he was confident he could get the money  or does he probably need a letter from a bank saying, \"You have the X  billion?\"</p><p>KUDLA:  Well James, if you look at the details that came out later on the  blog and on the memo and rather than adding more detail or more certainty,  it was a little bit more -- a little bit more vague. </p><p>You know, he talked about -- it almost look like more of a letter of intent  or a plan to have a plan rather than adding more certainty to the original  tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Kristina, we know that he's wanting to stick it to  the shorts for some time.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.  And right now the latest numbers of the shorts  consist of 20 percent of the float.  But I wanted to focus on Saudi Arabia  given that the Financial Times yesterday came out or two days ago came out  with the fact that they increased their share of Tesla or the portfolio of  Tesla.</p><p>And so isn't that a sign of confidence and that possibly other sovereign  wealth funds like Norway for example given they have $1 trillion, couldn't  they be one of the backers of Tesla?  </p><p>KUDLA:  There is -- there's a lot of money out there sloshing around  whether it's sovereign wealth funds, whether it's private equity, looking  for deals.  But the question is, who's going to invest in this company?</p><p>You know, a lot of times they're looking for companies that are cash-rich  or have at least they have positive cash flows.  This is a company that has  a negative cash flow, herding for money.  Even if this deal were to be done  needs more financing.  So who's going to do this deal?  They've had talk --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think this is just a mistake?  I mean, was this just a  mistake on Elon Musk's part?  What the heck happened.</p><p>KUDLA:  We don't know.  He -- you know, he's done things on Twitter before,  he had a prank on April Fool's Day, he's made jokes on Twitter.  We really  don't know yet.  But we know -- but we don't know anything more about the  deal and that's odd.  It was odd how it came about --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>KUDLA:  -- and it's odd that we don't know anything further.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, your thoughts?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well David, I sometimes wonder, are we taking Twitter too  seriously?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I mean, my thoughts now it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- the president tweets something, Elon Musk tweets something  and it becomes the focus of a major federal investigation.  Maybe people  ought to step back, lighten up and say, \"Twitter is for amusement.  It is  not necessarily a declaration of some legal document.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then he shouldn't have put the company up for sale on Twitter.</p><p>KUDLA:  It's a -- but he said --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:   And then what about the president who constantly --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well I think a lot of these tweets are for amusement as well.  </p><p>KUDLA:  But Mike --</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think we really should not the company has said that invest --  they've officially said investors can look to his Twitter feed for  additional information about the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's right.  They said this --</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's official channel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, an official channel.</p><p>KUDLA:  They said it's an official channel and investors, Mike, investors  traded on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  People put money on stake based on what the company has said is an  official news outlet for additional information on the company.</p><p>People went long on those two days, shorts went in and covered positions,  there was people that traded on this information.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLA:  So they took it seriously.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking  into it right now.</p><p>KUDLA:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the legal implications?  I mean, we're going to speak  with Harvey Pitt coming up in the program, he's my special guest, former  Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  But from your  standpoint as an investor, what do you want to see happen now?  </p><p>KUDLA:  We'll --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been shorting it the last two days, right?  But you were  not short going into it.</p><p>KUDLA:  We had -- we've had short positions on.  We've traded the  volatility in Tesla because as the stock has been hiked up and gone up,  it's been a good short.  The air comes out of the stock, you can cover a  profit.  We play the volatility in the stock.</p><p>And we think it was an opportunity to short the last couple of days because  we don't think this would be able to go through.  Even if there is secured  funding there's a lot of ways that a deal like this can fall apart. </p><p>Then you go back to the company fundamentals which we just don't think are  that good.  There's a liquidity problem, there's a sustained profitability  problem, and you got a lot of competition online -- or coming online in the  next one, two, three, four years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's China.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  Competitive market and we've been raising a lot of  questions.  But shouldn't it be noted that they do seem to have lately been  hitting their production targets, David?  I mean on an operating basis,  isn't there a better story on this company than there has been?</p><p>KUDLA:  I guess it depends how you look at the numbers.  They built 5,000  cars for one week at the end of June by pulling out all the stops and using  parts that were desperately needed for service parts.</p><p>We have people waiting for service parts for weeks and months.  All the  measures that are taking using a tent for their third general assembly  line, manufacturing process --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well what's wrong with tent?  I mean, if that's how you build the  cars who cares what the -- what the roof is?</p><p>KUDLA:  If you -- for people that know automotive manufacturing that walk  through those plans or look at how these cars are being built, the mistakes  that are being made, you know, this is not as Elon Musk said  revolutionizing manufacturing.</p><p>They're having a lot of problems with building cars, having a lot of  problems in execution and now, you know, Elon Musk talked about production  hell, now they're facing warranty service hell and customers are having  problems with the service centers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLA:  There are a lot of issues and once they work through that, they've  got all this competition coming online.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And somebody said yesterday when we were talking about  this that China wants to own this market, the E.V. market, electric --</p><p>KUDLA:  They've made a national priority.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  Let me ask you about the price of the stock,  it's at $370 right now, you've been shorting it.  What do you think is the  right price for this company?</p><p>KUDLA:  A lot lower.  In premarket we're down to about $365, $362 --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's $365 right now.  So what's the -- what's the right price?  </p><p>KUDLA:  Well look, Elon Musk himself has said its real car company.  People  want to say it's an energy company that builds cars or it's a technology  (INAUDIBLE) cars.  Ninety percent of the revenues come from building and  selling cars.</p><p>Car companies trade -- around the world trade at multiple of six to twelve.   P.E. multiple six to twelve and right now Tesla trades at a multiple of  infinity.  OK.  Some day if they do get the profitability they won't trade  at a multiple of $300 or $400.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow. </p><p>KUDLA:  They trade a multiple a lot lower.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>KUDLA:  So the stock price should be well below $400, well below $300.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well below $300 as well.  OK.  So we'll watch that.  Broader  market, recent technology route on Facebook earnings, the sector has  bounced back but we're looking at real volatility.  Would you buy any of  these names in tech?</p><p>KUDLA:  We are still strong supporters of technology.  We had a great first  quarter earnings, second quarter with more than 80 percent of companies  reporting, technology earnings are coming in very strong, again, about 31  percent earnings growth.</p><p>With everything going on with tax reform, business new regulation, CAPEX is  strong, tech -- we want second growth stories in this economy, technology  we think is the best place to be for secular growth.  We think that story  keeps getting better.</p><p>We want to own tech, it's our favorite sector this year, continues to do  well, we -- and we -- it's continued to do well for us and we think it's a  leadership sector as we go forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll leave it there.  David, we'll be watching that  as well as Tesla.  Good to see you this morning, thanks so much.  </p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  David Kudla.  Be sure to tune in at 8:00a.m. Eastern for my  interview with the former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  Harvey Pitt, my special guest this morning.  So we will talk about what the  implications are as a result of that tweet on Tesla with Harvey Pitt.</p><p>First though coming up, fear and panic, powerful aftershocks rocking  Indonesia this morning just days after a deadly earthquake killed hundreds  of people.  We have the very latest there. </p><p>And then the deal is off, Rite Aid and Albertsons abandoning their merger,  why things broke down?  Next right here, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Aftershocks are slamming Indonesia this morning  following a series of deadly earthquake.  Cheryl Casone on headlines now,  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Well Maria, good morning.  Since Sunday, more than 350 aftershocks  have kept survivors on edge.  The death toll on Indonesia's tourist island  of Lombok has surpassed 300 after the latest earthquake.  </p><p>A 5.9 magnitude tremor shook Lombok less than a week after the area was  devastated by Sunday's 7.0 quake.  As rescue efforts continue that death  toll we should say is expected to rise.</p><p>Well back here at home, another police officer is in the hospital after  being shot  This time Jacksonville, Florida.  Official say the suspect was  walking by a Waffle House where he fired at a passing patrol car.  No one  in the car was hurt, police chased the suspect, a gun fight ensued.  </p><p>One officer and the suspect had been hospitalized both with gunshot wounds  but neither suffered luckily like threatening injuries.</p><p>Well, Albertsons and Rite Aid are calling off their $24 billion merger,  this comes after shareholders complain that the takeover undervalued Rite  Aid.  Albertsons says it's unwilling to change the terms of the merger and  Rite Aid said its committed to moving forward as a standalone company.  The  deal would have created a new company with around $83 billion in annual  sales.</p><p>And then there's this, a major discrepancy in how much oil the Saudis are  producing.  The Wall Street Journal reports the Saudis have told OPEC it  cut output in July but estimates from the U.S. government and independent  agencies say that they boosted production amounted to a huge difference of  as much as half a million barrels a day.</p><p>And the Journal says that this news causing a lot of confusion in the  markets about, Maria, how much oil is actually reaching the consumer.   Another change in what Saudi is today, that is for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure is and that's why we're seeing oil prices.  I mean,  what a move yesterday.  I was reading actually in the Journal, oil prices  dropping significantly yesterday.  Your thoughts on what's going on this  morning in terms of oil James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  It seems like there's kind of unexpected inventory glut --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- it's happening while U.S. production after surging seems to be  kind of falling off a little.  But I guess looking long-term I just get  very optimistic seeing as how number of reports out this week showing the  U.S. is going to be a net exporter of petroleum within five years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pretty incredible.  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Complete energy independence basically somewhere in the 2020,  2021 timeframe.  And it's the -- this fracking revolution we've been  talking about it for years but it has profound very positive effects for  the economy.</p><p>PARTSINEVOLOS:  Did you see -- I think it was a few days ago, maybe in the  last week that Texas would be the third -- very soon the third largest  country to be -- to export oil just given how much is coming out of there.</p><p>And, yes, I think it's definitely going to climb -- I think the United  States will fill the glut.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the priorities of the Trump Administration.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well -- and you're going to be in a lot of trouble with people  in Texas, they think they're the number one economy in the world.  So just  so you know.</p><p>PARTSINEVOLOS:  I think the number one in the United States for sure and  it's just talking about oil, I'm not talking about the economy.  There's so  much oil they're getting out there, they're doing quite well.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes they are.  But I do think that what James is saying is  incredibly important that we're independent.  Many people laugh when we  talked about America being energy independent within 10 years but we're  already there.</p><p>And it's a significant ability not only to provide energy, it's a national  security issue.  The fact that we don't have to go hand-in-hand to the  Saudis and beg for them to be nice to us when they've been financing  terrorism around the world for decades.  This is huge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it is huge.  All right.  We'll keep talking about that.   We'll take a short break.  When we come back, a man is arrested in  connection with one of wildfires that's scorching Southern California.   We'll tell you why police believe he did it.  We'll bring you that next.</p><p>And then too big to fail over and over again, a new book by our contributor  today, James Freeman.  Taking a deep dive into Citi Groups crisis field  history.  We're going to talk about that when we come right back.  There's  the stock at $72.89, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big bank, even bigger story.  James Freeman is  out with a new book chronically the history of one of America's largest  financial institutions.</p><p>The book is titled, \"Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and  Bailouts at Citi.\"  James, congratulations on the book, we're so happy  you're here to talk about it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Great.  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us the takeaway that you have in borrowed time.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think the big takeaway is the regulation and government  support through history doesn't work.  We look at a bank that it's been  there two centuries.</p><p>The first century it's an independent organization, there's no federal  backstop, there's no taxpayer exposure.  Knowing that they are going to  accept the consequences of failure you had very careful bankers running a  very strong bank.</p><p>People -- most Americans have never heard of.  Moses Taylor, James  Stillman, they built the largest bank in the country and wasn't necessarily  fun to work there.  Stillman, you know, he roomed by absolute fear.</p><p>He was a maniac about examining their credit risks and demanding  information from people they were going to lend to.  It was such a strong  bank, so highly capitalized that they actually rescued the government a  couple times in the 1890s.  </p><p>Then once the taxpayer safety net comes in, political operators start  running the bank.  And within years of the Federal Reserve being created,  Citi is there borrowing heavily from the New York Fed.  Now, we'd love to  know all the details about that but Fed won't share the documents, they've  probably been destroyed.</p><p>This is kind of an ongoing problem where the Federal Reserve hides and then  destroys documents related to their supervision of banks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And in recent years you really saw how strong or weak the bank  is especially when it was tested during the financial crisis.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  The weakest of the bank.  It needed the biggest bank  bailout.  $45 billion direct government investment, hundreds of billions of  more in debt guarantees various other assistance.</p><p>And it was a complete failure.  And I think it's the -- it's the government  backstop which is the root of it because a lot of people during the crisis  they like to say that this or that particular instrument or Wall Street  gambling was the cause.</p><p>But you look at Citi and we were able to pull one document out of the FDIC  it showed problems across the bank from the most complex financial  instrument and the -- in moral street trading to the most simple loan.  </p><p>So it was -- the underlying problem is the government safety net which  encourages risk taking and government policies driving people into housing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  James, congratulations on the book.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh, thanks.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Frankly, I was delighted to find out what the topic was.  When I  saw the title \"Borrow Time\" I thought it was my medical report, so I'm  delighted to hear that it wasn't.</p><p>But I think your book is more a message than just a book and the message is  that when banks operate with prudence and they operate the old fashion way  where they stand up for themselves and they're responsible.</p><p>The stock holders and to their employees and to their customers, that's a  solid bank.  But when they start depending upon the government and know the  government's going to bail them out, they operate at a level of greed that  you expose in this book.</p><p>I think it's an incredibly valuable message that I hope people in  government will read because the politicians need to not make this mistake  again by providing all of this safety net for these banks who operate like  these guys operated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well thanks.  And I'm hoping this is maybe a moment where it's a  good time.  Banks are healthy again, they're strong, they're making money,  they're returning capital to shareholders which maybe should make taxpayers  a little nervous.</p><p>But I think it is a good time to say let's start peeling back that safety  net.  I understand if the government said tomorrow everything's change and  we're going to let everyone fail, it would be a little chaotic.</p><p>So you start a phase withdrawal.  Policies, laws, regulations, you start  making it clear that we're going to let people fail again and, you know,  there's a -- obviously bankruptcy was not an option anyone wanted in '08.</p><p>But the beauty of that is it does allow new competitors, more innovative  competitors to arise and it allows people to suffer investors, to suffer  the consequences of their decisions.</p><p>You know, this is not about -- obviously you can your deposit insurance,  it's about making investors who make bad decisions live with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVOLOS:  Just quickly, you just said there were problems across the  board, they were quite obvious.  So then why do you think the government  bailed them out?</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's funny, it's kind of a mid -- even some of the people doing  the bailouts, Sheila Bair who's running the FDIC was kind of saying, you  know, where's the analysis and where's the real argument that we really  should rescue these guys.</p><p>And it was just kind of presumed and this is -- one of the reason we wrote  the book is to show that this kind of too big to fail mentality was built  over decades.  It wasn't just, oh wait, someone decided a bank like Citi  has to be saved.  It was just presumed.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said that if it's not too big to fail, I  don't know what is.  But there's no analysis to say we couldn't live  without Citi.  And I think you look at this economy where a lot of these  institutions we probably could live without.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, someone who was against TARP, one of the few republicans  who openly was against it and I still am, I want to say thanks for exposing  and peeling the onion back a little bit and letting people realize that  this wasn't the absolute -- if we don't do this, you know, it's Armageddon. </p><p>And I think that's what we were told in a way, I never believed it then.  I  think your book helps to point out, would it have been disastrous?  Yes.   But would it have been the end of the world?  Probably not, just the end of  some very bad banking procedures.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks.  You know, it really went well beyond Citi.  As you point  out, you go back March of '08, the government decided to rescue the  creditors of Bear Stearns, not even a bank.  Maybe the 17th largest  institution in the financial industry.  I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it because we were in a moment of time -- in time that  they were worried that the lights were going to go out on G.E. and that,  you know, things were coming to a halt given that the buck broke?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  There was definitely a lot of fear and it was based on gut  instinct more than -- more than math I would say.  </p><p>But -- and I understand it was difficult because I think the government can  create a problem that big where one reason it was so challenging, as you  look roughly 20 years before the, Drexel Burnham big investment bank  failed, life went on.  </p><p>But in '08 you had the government pushing everybody in the housing  investment, rewarding banks for holding AAA-rated mortgage bank security.   So you had the same problem across the industry.  </p><p>So I understand the fear of letting all of these institutions take a hit  and have to recognize their losses.  But, I think, certainly, the bailout  culture was building over time whereas the governor said the -- knowing the  safety net was there, made these banks run at very high levels of leverage.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And it was an election year.  Let's not forget that.  That's a  big motive there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Freeman, the book is Borrowed Time, Two Centuries of  Booms, Busts, and Bailouts of Citi, go check it out, James Freeman,  congratulations again.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A very important book.  Coming up, from blue wave to flameout,  why Bernie Sanders and the left are losing in the run-up to the midterms,  this comes as Nancy Pelosi says the votes for Democrats this fall, gives  leverage to people coming to this country, illegally.  Her controversial  comments and the backlash, coming up, right after this short break, stay  with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thank you so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, Happy Thursday, it is Thursday,  August 9th, your top stories right now, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Wall Street's mixed this morning, as investors are waiting for earnings  from Coca-Cola, Viacom and Gannett.  Futures indicating a flat opening this  morning, Dow Industrials up about 16 points, as you can see, S&amp;P 500 is up  three and the NASDAQ right now, up nine points, eye on earnings.</p><p>Mixed close yesterday, on Wall Street, for the major averages, check it  out.  Dow Industrials losing 45 points, the S&amp;P also negative and the  NASDAQ yesterday, at the close, up 4-1/2 points.</p><p>In Europe this morning, we are seeing some activity on the downside.  FT- 100 down 47 points, in London, down two-thirds of one percent, the CAC  Quarante in Paris, is down seven points, but the DAX Index in Germany, up,  as you can see, 52, that's almost one-half of one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher, Hang Seng and the Shanghai  Composite, higher, the Chinese index, the Shanghai, up almost two percent,  bouncing back on hopes of stimulus against U.S. tariffs.  </p><p>Fires are raging in California this morning, authorities arresting a man in  connection with the fire that burned over 4,000 acres, the alleged  threatening e-mails he sent coming up this morning.</p><p>And looking for leverage, House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says that a  vote for Democrats in the midterm elections can change the tide on the  immigration debate, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES:  We are not going to be able to get it done under the  Republican leadership in Congress.  We believe that we will have leverage  when we win in November.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The immigration debate, coming up this morning.  Plus, there's  this, rides over New York City Council, passing regulations limiting Uber  and Lyft.  The number of cars on the road, capped.  We break it down, what  regulators are telling Uber this morning.  </p><p>Fox on top, 21st Century Fox, nearly doubling its quarterly profit, this  ahead of a deal with Walt Disney, to sell most of its entertainment assets.   We are crunching the numbers on 21st Century Fox this morning, put the  stock at 45, 46.</p><p>And he shoots, he scores, a Harlem Globetrotter, flying high with an  incredible trick shot from an airplane, getting a ride in there, too.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning, but first, our top story  this half an hour, and that is socialism's popularity is in a slump, many  of the primary candidates backed up by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez, not even coming close to winning the nominations.</p><p>Joining me right now to discuss that is Former Trump Campaign  Communications Director, Bryan Lanza and Democratic Strategist, Robin Biro.   Good to see you both, thank you so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>BRYAN LANZA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MERCURY:  Good morning, thank you.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think, Robin, let me kick it off with you.   What do you think happened in the primaries?  Why are these socialists arm  of the Democrats not doing well in your view?</p><p>BIRO:  In my view, they're just not resonating with, as you know, your  everyday Americans.  I still think that Ocasio-Cortez was a geographic  anomaly.  You know, you know, a heavily-left-leaning district, a very left- leaning candidate.  </p><p>I did not believe that the party itself lock, stock, and barrel, was going  that far left.  And I'm glad to see that six out of seven of these, Bernie  and Ocasio-Cortez candidates did not win.  </p><p>So, you know, I hope that, sort of, changes the narrative that we're all  losing our minds and drifting toward socialism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, in other words, you're saying that this is a negative for  the party, because it feels like anybody in the party who is, sort of,  moderate or not extreme left, is not resonating.  I mean, you have to come  up with these things like abolish ICE, in terms of getting the blessing of  the leadership.</p><p>BIRO:  Oh, well -- let's -- we are about to run into a topic talking about  Nancy Pelosi.  And I think the leadership is out of touch with, you know,  your average American.  What I'm saying is that, moderate candidates are  the ones that are winning and moderate candidates, like -- I'm not a  candidate, but moderates like me, are winning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BIRO:  They are the ones with the stronger message.  These far-left  candidates are out of touch with everyday Americans, that's why they didn't  win and I'm glad that they didn't.  It's just it's a bad formula for my  party to have candidates this far to the left.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, speaking about a touch, Bryan, Nancy Pelosi claims that a  vote for a Democrat in November will give leverage to illegal immigrants.  </p><p>LANZA:  Unbelievable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It proves once again, where her priorities lie, with illegals.   Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PELOSI:  We are not going to be able to get it done under the Republican  leadership in Congress.  We believe that we will have leverage when we win  in November, because it gives us hope to -- because of the leverage it  gives to families who may have followed -- dad may have gone home for a  family funeral and now can't come back into the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts, Bryan?</p><p>LANZA:  I mean, I think it's just shameful that the leader of the  Democratic Party's prioritizing illegal immigrants over everything else.   You know why she wants leverage for?  She wants leverage to abolish ICE.   She wants leverage for open borders, and she wants leverage for amnesty.</p><p>The American people do not want leverage for illegal aliens coming into  this country.  They want to focus on the American workers who are working  very hard to get themselves out of, you know, whatever socio-economic  condition they're in and work up the economic ladder.  Nancy Pelosi doesn't  believe in the American people, she believes in the foreign dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts going into the midterms, Bryan?</p><p>LANZA:  I think this is good.  I mean, it exposes, you know, whether it's  Bernie Sanders or Nancy Pelosi, it really exposes the energy of Democratic  Party and just how far-left it is.  You know, sort of the radical  progressives are taking a food hold in the party.  </p><p>They may not have all the seats today, but that's where the energy is, and  that's where the leaders of the Democratic Party are talking about.  They  are talk about abolishing ICE.  They're talking about raising taxes.  </p><p>They're talking about open borders.  I think those principles and values  are out of context with the American people.  And I think we're going to  have an election in November to prove that they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think, Robin, if a blue wave does in fact  happen in November, it may not have impact or support the people think,  take a look at Democratic congressional nominee, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,  she's waffling on whether she even sees a leader of the Democrat Party.   This is an interview with CNN.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, HOST CNN:  Whom do you believe to be the head of the  Democratic Party?</p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK:  Well, I  don't think that there's any one head.  You know, we are a collective, this  is a movement.  And I don't think parties are ever about one person, but  they're about how the contributions that each one person gives to the  party.  So, I think that there are really exciting folks in the party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robin, there is a leader, Tom Perez, was the head of the  Democratic National Committee, right?</p><p>BIRO:  Yes, I really, honestly, just can't with her.  You know, I was  affirmed -- I was firmly opposed to Bernie Sanders, I've been opposed to  Ocasio-Cortez, anybody that far to the left, I think, is on the fringe and  does not represent what middle America, most Americans believe.  </p><p>And I agree with Bryan, that, you know, people like Nancy Pelosi are pretty  much out of touch.  I think she makes a strong case for recall, go ahead,  Calexit.  So, you know, I think we need some better leadership.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think is going on then, Robin?  I mean, is it  because they -- the Democrats are not sure what to do with Donald Trump as  President?  </p><p>BIRO:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have they just given up on moderation, I mean, it does seem  that --</p><p>BIRO:  Yes, let me tell you --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  the party has been hijacked, right?</p><p>BIRO:  It has, and let me tell you exactly what's going on.  The party did  swing somewhat to the left, in response to Donald Trump.  But I think what  we're seeing now, Maria, is that it's levelling out, we're getting back to  our roots, we're getting back to winning strategies, we are in red states,  we're running moderates, that's what just happened in Ohio, he came  incredibly close.</p><p>So, you know, we are getting back to a good strategy here.  And like I  said, geographically, Ocasio-Cortez won in a very left-leaning district, so  that, I understand.  I still insist that's a geographic anomaly.  I do not  think the party itself lock, stock, and barrel, is all swinging toward  Democratic socialism.  That was just proven wrong on Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will -- we will leave it there and watch this.   Great to see you both, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>LANZA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bryan, thank you.</p><p>BIRO:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robin, thank you very much.  We have some breaking news right  now that we want to talk about, and apparently, the Sinclair deal with  Tribune is off.  The Tribune media deal -- Sinclair deal is dead.  Tribune  saying that the $3.9 billion deal can no longer move forward after comments  from FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, your thoughts?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I think -- you know, all these mergers have frightened a  lot of people into feeling there was going to be almost a monopolistic  approach to media.  And the FCC, obviously, has been nervous about it, and  I think we are seeing the results of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But in an environment where AT&amp;T and Time Warner are getting  together, and obviously, Fox selling the entertainment assets.  But bigger,  sort of, identity of this is the AT&amp;T deal, your thoughts, James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think that deal ought to go through.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's kind of nutty the government is appealing on this one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But why is it being --</p><p>FREEMAN:  You know, I don't think Ajit Pai is some hyper regulator who's  eager to break up business deals.  I think this was more about a sincere  belief that based on the correct reading of the law.  It shouldn't be  allowed to go through.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Too much concentration?</p><p>FREEMAN:  It gets into -- I think a fairly technical compliance issue, not  sort of a big picture that too much -- too much concentration in media, but  I think he is correctly applying the law even though it's obviously not the  result that many of the shareholders would have wanted.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Did you guys hear about this, just previously, that critics  have said that Ajit has actually changed the FCC rules to benefit Sinclair?   It's in an article.  Did you talk about that at all?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  OK.  And the FCC inspector general is actually  investigating that particular matter, whether rules have been changed, but  now, I guess that's nullified, given that this deal hasn't gone through.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Maria, I think we need to be more concerned about what's  happening with the social media companies becoming monopolistic rather than  the traditional legacy companies, because the audiences for broadcast and  traditional cable are beginning to dwindle and things are moving more to  the social media platforms.  That ought to strike --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk more about that because there's really the  spotlight now on social media, so we'll talk more about that.  We'll take a  break.  When we come back, pumping the brakes, New York becomes the first  major city to cap the number of drivers working for companies like Lyft and  Uber.</p><p>And taking the skyhook to a whole new level, a Harlem Globetrotter makes a  basket from a plane, back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A suspect is in custody this morning for  allegedly starting the so-called \"holy fire,\" which has burned more than  six square miles in Southern California.  Cheryl Casone with the details  now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  One of several fires still burning, Maria, in California.  Maria,  51-year-old, Forrest Gordon Clark is behind bars today on suspicion of  arson.  He's also charged with a threat to terrorize and resisting arrest.   Investigators believe the fire was an intentional act but they're still  figuring out how exactly he started it.  According to Orange County  register, Clark owns a cabin in the area of the fires and sent the e-mail  to fire officials warning this place will burn.  The fire started Monday  but is only five percent contained right now.  </p><p>Well, 21st Century Fox reporting better than expected earnings after the  closing bell last night.  The company's results easily beating the street's  estimates driven by growth and its cable, and film business.  Higher fees  from cable and satellite distributors also helping to boosting profits.   21st Century Fox is preparing to close major deal to sell most of its  entertainment assets Walt Disney for $71 billion shares of 21st Century  Fox, the parent of the Fox Business Network, of 31 percent so far this  year.  </p><p>And then finally, check this out, A Harlem Globe Trotter makes ultimate sky  hook when he scores a basket from an airplane.  This incredible footage  shows Bull Bullard pulling up a shoot from a two-person plane.  The plane  going 70 miles an hour, as a past over hoop in the middle of the runway, he  drops the ball, nothing but net, anybody ask yourself, why do this?  Why  not?  It's the Globe Trotters, man, they love this stuff.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, why not?  I love it.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, screeching of a new rule capping the number of ride- hailing drivers in New York City, what this really means next?  Back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  -- one year while they  conduct research and try to figure things out.  New York City mayor,  Democrat Bill de Blasio, says this, he says our city is directfully  confronting a crisis that is driving working New Yorkers into poverty, and  our streets into gridlock.  The traffic angle is certainly true, I think,  everybody would agree with that.  But how about fixing the subways?   There's no incentive to take a subway particularly on a hot day in August,  right?    So, what about mass transit and what about the communities and further  parts of the city that don't have access to mass transportation?  They rely  on the for-hire vehicles many times.  You also look at business angles of  all of this, because Uber and Lyft, they're looking to IPO Uber the second- half of the year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  The latest valuations for these companies, and we can show them  to you, estimated at $62 billion for Uber, about $15 billion for Lyft.   This is big money and this, especially being such a big city like New York  City, if it ripples effects in other places, can certainly hurt them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what was it that triggered this?  I mean, was there a  catalyst that made the leadership in New York feel that there's just too  much congestion?  I feel like congestion has been the situation for a long  time?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  True, it's been a little bit worse.  If you look at the exact  numbers of how many cars are on the road, the ride-hailing vehicles and the  taxis, the numbers have gone up.  But we've also seen traditional yellow  cab drivers commit suicide because they're unable to make a living when  they are competing with these for-hire vehicle.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  There's been eight suicides so far.  And also, part of this  deal that these ride-share drivers will earn $17.22 an hour.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Thank you for bringing that up.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes, so at least there's a threshold there.  I do agree  that -- it's not only Lyft.  Via is taking off in New York too.  Are you  familiar with these --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, and also for Via.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  It's a carpooling service, that is carpooling versus Uber,  you can do Uber versus Uber Pool -- Uber Black.  So, there's a lot of  different elements whereas Via is just carpooling, and they're everywhere.   But I agree, why -- you don't want us to take that kind of transportation?   I get around with the city bikes but public transit needs to be improved.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  You do have congestion pricing tolls into the city.  I know no  one likes to pay tolls but that was one idea that de Blasio didn't want  that.  Obviously, we don't want anyone committing suicide but taxi cabs  don't like the competition.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, they don't and the value of their medallion has plummeted.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It went from one million to 200,000.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of happy Uber and Lyft customers in the city.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But Uber will work with the city and other cities around the  world, and hopefully figure this out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yesterday we had a story where, you know, Governor Cuomo wants  to give three months off of bereavement, you know, there's that.  And now,  today we're getting pushed back on Uber, your thoughts on New York and  business?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's just not a place where people can do business.  I mean, it  really isn't, why are so many people move out of New York?  That's why.  I  mean, I was just saying to Lauren a moment ago, the reason I come here, as  seldom as I have to is because -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  You have to come here.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, it's because it's not a place where it's easy to get around,  it's incredibly expensive and it's not getting better.  It's getting worse.   That's unfortunate.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, there's no law of the universe that says financial companies  even have to stay here.  (INAUDIBLE) Bernstein recently announcing it's  moving its headquarters, always been in New York to Nashville.  So, might  want to think about trading customers a little better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you know what, we've talked about this going into the tax  cut plan and there's been no change there.  So, it almost feels like that's  OK with de Blasio and he doesn't care.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  We're running the same experiment in New Jersey, you would have  thought changes in federal tax law would make a lot of these blue states  politicians want to get more competitive.  And so far, they are resisting;  I guess to use their favorite word, but people are going to leave.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Big story.  Thank you, Lauren.  We'll take a short  break.  When we come back, disturbing trend: Teenagers are getting cosmetic  surgery to look like their favorite Snapchat filters.  More on that, next  hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA right here.

And joining me to break  it all down -- Fox Business Network's Kristina Partsinevelos is with us,  the Wall Street Journal for assistant editorial page editor James Freeman,  and former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike  Huckabee.  Great to see everybody this morning.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Thank you.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's on your mind?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  You know what's really cool is we talk about all these people  coming back into the job force.  The quit rate has also gone up.  So people  who already have a job are having an easier time finding new jobs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That shows confidence.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you quit and you want another job it shows confidence.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Isn't there a trend of ghosting now at job interviews?   Ghosting, meaning you either don't show up, or you get hired and you don't  show up to your first day of work either and they don't even tell the  employer?  There was an article written about it that it's happening more  and more often.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Well that is -- that is confident.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  There are jobs -- but they can't find the workers.  They have to  use ghost workers instead.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Ghost like dating -- you go to a restaurant and she doesn't  show up.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Is that what that is.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  That's what it is.  That's what ghosting is.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I've been out of the dating scene for a couple of decades now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>First we have this breaking news.  The Tribune Media-Sinclair deal is dead.   Tribune saying said that the $3.9 billion deal can no longer move forward  after comments from the Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit  Pai.  Pai said last month that he had, quote, \"serious concerns about the  transaction\".</p><p>Joining us right now, by telephone, is Mediatech Capital Partners managing  partner Porter Bibb.  Porter -- great to see you this morning.  Thanks so  much for calling in.  Your thoughts on this deal being dead this morning.  </p><p>PORTER BIBB, MANAGING PARTNER, MEDIATECH CAPITAL PARTNERS (via telephone):   Well, this deal was killed by Ajit Pai about three weeks ago, Maria, when  he indicated the FCC would probably not approve it.  And we haven't heard  from Justice -- the Justice Department would have blocked the deal as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there another competitor in the wings, waiting to come in  for Tribune or for Sinclair?  </p><p>BIBB:  There has to be.  There has to be because there is no question that  Tribune is a seller.  This was nearly $4 billion transaction.  And Sinclair  had an articulated plan to build a competitor basically to the Fox News  Network, a conservative-centric television network that would have had more  stations than any other single entity owned in the United States as part of  their network.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Porter -- James Freeman here at the \"Wall Street Journal\".  I'm  wondering if you could give us a sense of how this happened because I think  Ajit Pai has generally shown he's not eager to intervene in the  marketplace.  He just went through a very tough time basically making sure  that the FCC, his commission, would not be the uber-regulator of the  Internet.</p><p>Was this a sloppy filing by Sinclair?   Or is this Pai in this case at  least overstepping?  </p><p>BIBB:  It's hard to read and I agree with your perception.  The FCC under  Pai has tried to stay out of business matters but I think Justice  Department's challenge against the Time Warner, AT&amp;T merger has influenced  Pai a little bit and also influenced other members, other commissioners on  the FCC.</p><p>It's really a difficult call to try to read what was in their minds.  And I  agree with you, this seemed like a contradictory posture for the FCC to be  adopting.</p><p>However, the idea of a single entity, Sinclair, owning basically the  majority of television stations in this country is not a hard situation to  try to challenge.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  Ok.</p><p>Sinclair down 1.25 percent this morning.  Porter we just got Viacom  earnings out.  Obviously this is a week of media earnings.  Give us your  sort of 30,000 feet look at what's happening in media today and what you've  learned based on these earnings.  Viacom revenue missed their expectations  at $3.24 billion in revenue.  The estimate was $3.26 billion.</p><p>But that's just one part of the story.  Your thoughts on how this business  has changed.  </p><p>BIBB:  Well, the business has changed radically and scale I guess is the  byword of the day.  Viacom and CBS are going to have to come back together  to get scale and then they will be acquired by maybe Verizon which has made  an offer six, seven months ago -- a tentative offer for the combined  companies.</p><p>There are other buyers out there.  But you have to have scale to compete in  this new landscape that the media business has become.  It takes content  and distribution capability as well as scale on every other level.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Porter, I know you cover Tesla.  You called it yesterday.   You told us when you were here on set that you thought the Securities and  Exchange Commission would in fact be inquiring as to the Tesla tweet, the  Elon Musk tweet saying that he's considering taking the company private,  funding secured at $420 a share.</p><p>Your thoughts on where this goes.  </p><p>BIBB:  I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop at the SEC.  They have not  been particularly aggressive on challenging situations like Elon Musk's --  what I consider outrageous disclosure without any substance or fact behind  it.</p><p>The issue with his announcement really hinges on funding.  And he has not  made any disclosures regarding whether he's got funding or not.  Mr. Musk  basically stuck it to the shorts and where it all goes is going to be a  very interesting scenario because he really cannot take this company  private if he wants to avoid shareholder litigation.  That is going to last  a lifetime.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you think ultimately it goes private?  I mean, there  obviously are going to be shareholder lawsuits coming.  Do you see any  opportunity for funding being secured?  I mean what are we talking about  here?  $75 billion?  </p><p>BIBB:  That was the starting point.  One wants to know if he wants to go  private and if he's looking for investors, whether it's Saudis or anybody  else.  Why would he want to pay 20 or 30 percent more than he has to?   Because the stock is going to go back down to earth at some point in the  near future and that's when he should be looking at taking it private if he  wants to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the stock never reached that $420 a share -- James Freeman.  </p><p>BIBB:  Never.  That's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You would think that when he says $420 a share that the stock  would rally to $420.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, that's why I'm wondering.  Porter -- it seems like the  tough thing is finding the money.  If he actually has secured the funding,  what would be the shareholder litigation?  Wouldn't they be thrilled that  he was buying -- picking a property?  </p><p>BIBB:  If he can find the money.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  You think they might sue if they find out he doesn't have  the money and this was just a tease on Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's sticking it to the shorts.  </p><p>BIBB:  That's right.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Do you not think that if he doesn't sell, if he's trying to  increase the share price, if he holds onto his shares, proves that he has  funding, then he's ok.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  If he proves that he has funding.  We're talking about  $80 billion.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  I know.  </p><p>BIBB:  But look where the price was three or four months ago, was back down  in the $270 range.  If he's going to find financing and make an offer to  take the company private, why wouldn't he go at a more realistically-based   price level than $420.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Do you think that 420 is a joke then?  Some people have  said that.  This isn't the first time he talked about being private; he did  it in 2017, November.  </p><p>You have to take your hat off to Elon Musk.  He's a fantastic promoter.   He's a visionary.  And what he says is not to be taken seriously unless he  can deliver.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Porter -- are you telling clients right now to sell the  stock?  </p><p>BIBB:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You bet.  All right.  Porter -- great to talk with you, thank  you so much.</p><p>BIBB:  Ok.  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Porter Bibb -- Mediatech joining us there.</p><p>Switching gears to renewed Russia tensions -- Reuters is reporting that the  Kremlin is rejecting accusations of involvement in the nerve agent attack  on a former Russian spy and his daughter in the U.K.  That's in response  to, of course, fresh sanctions yesterday from the United States following  the poisoning.</p><p>The Kremlin calling the new sanctions, quote, \"categorically unacceptable  and illegal under international law\" slamming Washington as an  unpredictable actor on the international stage.</p><p>Joining us now, Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle.  Lea -- good morning  to you.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE:  Fox News correspondent:  Good morning to you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, that's exactly what I would expect from Russia.  Russia  tends to lie, deny and counter-accuse, when the U.S. State Department comes  out with an announcement like Heather Nauert came out with basically saying  that Russia did use a nerve agent.  This is in violation of international  law that triggers sanctions under the Chemical and Biological Weapons  Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991.  We come out and say that  because we have some pretty solid proof and some pretty solid evidence.   That was already there.</p><p>But for, you know, for Russia to say no, we didn't do it; no, it wasn't us;  or no, we didn't use this nerve agent -- completely to be expected.  Of  course that's what they're going to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about this -- Governor?  I mean that was  pretty aggressive of the U.S. to slap the sanctions on Russia.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I guess I'm trying to figure out if the President is so  the puppet of Vladimir Putin, he has really cut the strings.  I mean I've  never seen the United States push so hard back against Russia.  I can't  remember a time in my lifetime when we have been this tough on them.  And I  don't know why the President is not getting credit for just saying we're  not going to take it anymore.  Why isn't he?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.  I think the President's not getting credit for that  because of the big riff we have in our domestic politics in the United  States.  It's because this is what the other side has been using to attack  the President.</p><p>But I'll go over what Secretary Pompeo said back on July 25th, you know,  213 sanctions we've imposed on Russians and individuals, 60 Russian spies,  expelled, Russia's Consulate in Seattle, closed.  Also San Francisco, the  150 military exercises that we've conducted in Europe this year.  More than  $11 billion put towards European deterrence initiatives.  Defensive weapons  that we've made available to Ukraine and Georgia.</p><p>There's been a big change in this administration, you're your point.  And  it comes down to our politics in the United States.  That's why the  President is getting hit so hard on Russia.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  This is not symbolic.  These are things that are really hurting  Russia, hurting them economically at a time were they were already hurting  economically.  It's hurting them politically, it's hurting them on the  world stage.  I mean these are not just, again, symbolic gestures.  These  are substantive measures that are sticking it to Russia in a very, very  harsh way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul implies on Twitter that he  delivered a letter from President Trump to Vladimir Putin.  The Senator  tweeted this.  I was honored to deliver a letter from President Trump to  President Vladimir Putin's administration.  The letter emphasized the  importance of further engagement in various areas including countering  terrorism, enhancing legislative dialogue and resuming culture exchanges.  </p><p>Just as it was going on the dynamics, this is strengthening the  relationship with the U.K. because the U.K. has asked for these sanctions.   This is improving relations with NATO and other allies.  And I think that  that's what United States needs right now.</p><p>When you brought up President Trump and why they're not saying great for  him, maybe this is actually showing a divide or difference between the  President and the administration over Russia because this has been a topic  before that there may not be agreeing on what needs to be done and how  Russia needs to be treated.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I don't think the sanction would be put in place if  President Trump didn't want to.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I would disagree with that and I would say that the president  has had to defend his legitimacy because of the politics involved from the  very start.  But it seems to me from the actions that are taken that  they're very much working together.  But it seems to me from the actions  that are being taken, they're very much State Department, the establishment  of the global engagement center, You look at the State Department and the  establishment of the global Engagement center which is going to be  countering propaganda from state actors like Russia and working on things  like that, there's a lot the administration is doing and that's led by the  President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Lea great to see you -- thanks you so much.</p><p>We're taking a break.   When we come back, battling the blaze, more  harrowing of the firenado swirling in the sky, that's coming up next.</p><p>Then hack attack, the details after the cyber criminals reportedly seized  control of the PGA of America's computer service.

The hurricane, now a cat 3 is weakening.  That tropical storm warning has  actually been dropped.  But dangerous surf and rip currents are still a  threat on the Island's beaches.</p><p>Meanwhile check out what firefighters saw as a fire tore through a British  plastics factory.  The firefighters captured this amazing video.  They  named it a firenado.  It's really incredible.</p><p>It's a whirl wind of flames that's created when hot air meets cold and the  fire is whipped upwards into the sky.  This was 50 feet high.  Nobody was  hurt.  But people living 26 miles away said they could actually see the  thick, black smoke in the sky.  I don't think we've seen anything like this  before.</p><p>Well, Amazon is hiring and some of the jobs have a nice like perk.  It's  looking to fill more than 200 virtual jobs.

Did you not remember  like 10 years ago, 15 years ago, you could get a clip-on extension.  And  you just put on -- if you have your hair in a ponytail and then you have  this luscious long hair -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I sort of liked that for women.  But man bun -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  It's so obviously fake because it's a synthetic crap  material.  I'm sorry -- I'm really against this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  What about you?  Would you -- would you -- </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I just ordered one.  I just ordered one.  Next time I'm on the  show I'm going to be wearing it because I'm getting a little thinner up  here.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Did they find your color?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  What's that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Man bun?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I'm going to try the blonde one.  I think it's ideal when  you want a party on the weekend but be all business on Monday morning.  I  mean in the old days you had to wear the mullet all the time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.

Computer servers  that belonged to the PGA of America were hacked this week.  Officials  locked out of critical files that relate to the PGA championship and  upcoming Ryder Cup.</p><p>Now this isn't about financial information getting stoned but rather  creative materials, promotional banners, logos for various platforms  including digital signage around the Bell Reef Country Club where the PGA  championship is this week.  Stolen files include development of logos; also  for future PGA championships.</p><p>Now while the hackers didn't demand a specific dollar amount, a bitcoin  wallet number was included within computer messages, ransom note in part  reads \"your network has been penetrated.  All files on each host encrypted  with a strong algorithm, may lead to the impossibility of recovery of  certain files.

The  DOW Industrials down 45 points and the S&amp;P was down almost one point.  The  NASDAQ was the winner, up just four points, so very much -- so close to  where they started the day.  </p><p>In Europe this morning money is leaving stocks.  FT-100 down about 60  points, 57 points lower, three quarters of one percent.

We will show you that coming up.  </p><p>First, our top story this half an hour, and that is an immigration  showdown.  A Texas judge hearing arguments from 10 states who claim that  the Obama era DACA program is unconstitutional.  Joining me right now is  Texas Congressman Roger Williams.  Congressman, it's good to see you this  morning.  You oversee a border state.  How vital is this slack down to  DACA?  </p><p>REP. ROGER WILLIAMS (R), TEXAS:  Well, I think we've got to come up with --  that DACA.  Of course, a lot of us think that it was done -- it was done  illegally.  But the biggest problem here in Texas is we have to secure the  border.  The president's trying to do that.  I think we need more border  patrol and we need more technology.  But we also need to let those who are  coming up to understand that we have a law, we need to adhere to the law  and it's better to come through the ports of entry rather than between and  let us handle your issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think, can you give us a view of in fact what's  happening at the border right now?  You're in Texas.  You actually see it  up close and personal.  Can you characterize the immigration story for us  today and why there isn't an agreement on both sides of the aisle?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, the issue at the border, I was Secretary of State of Texas  under Governor Perry and dealt with this issue a lot.  So, it's not new.   The issue is you always have folks coming up frankly for a better life and  some coming over here to hurt Americans, to harm Americans, but the issue  down there is the fact that we have folks that are in many -- in many cases  unaccompanied, they're younger, we've seen it.  We've done a pretty good  job in rebuilding the families back that were separated.  But you have a  lot of folks that just they're here illegally like I say and you've got --  you've got to address that.</p><p>And I think to that we've got to remind ourselves too, there's a lot of  folks not coming over here for -- to get a job or the quality of life,  they're coming over here as I said earlier to harm Americans, terrorists  and that's why it's so important to secure this border.  I believe we  secure it with more boots on the ground.  </p><p>Now, why haven't we done this?  I mean, we debated this in congress.   You've got two sides.  You've got Democratic side that frankly I believe  wants to promote illegal behavior and keep our borders not secure.  On our  side, the Republican side, we've had a hard time coming up with a plan.  I  supported the Goodlatte amendment which you're very familiar with.  We've  talked about that in the past.  I think it would have begun to address the  issues.  So, we've got to get back up in September.  We've got to get  serious about it.  And we've got to come up with a solution that keeps our  borders secure and keeps our sovereignty.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it's just a head scratcher as to why the Democrats wouldn't  want the same thing.  I mean, Nancy Pelosi claims that a vote for a  Democrat in November will give leverage to illegal immigrants, this is what  she says.  She's proving once again where her priorities lie, with  illegals.  Listen to this, sir.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your  reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  We are not going to be  able to get it done under the Republican leadership in congress.  We  believe that we will have leverage when we win in November.  Because it  gives hope to -- because of the leverage it gives to families who may have  followed dad going home for a family funeral and now can't come back into  the country. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is this about, congressman?  I mean, is this about votes  that she's trying to get?  Why wouldn't she want to keep the borders  secure?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think it's totally about votes.  I think that they would  rather have this president, this administration fail than America succeed.   I think it's totally about votes.  I lived down here all my life.  I know  what's -- I know -- I know what's going on, like all -- like most Texans.  </p><p>And the fact of the matter is that I would like for Nancy Pelosi to go with  me to where we address homeless veterans.  We have so many homeless  veterans that need assistance, much more before those that frankly come to  break our laws.  So, I think it's all politically driven.  I think they  think they can get more votes and we need to address what we're supposed to  address as public officials and secure our borders and address the law of  the land which they're not doing.  It's all driven by political  grandstanding.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a lot of grandstanding.  And this whole resist movement  continues.  Do you think this gone -- this is going to impact midterm  elections coming November?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I think it will.  I think, I know people in Texas where I  travel around and certainly my district, they want secure borders for  crying out loud.  We all -- regardless of your party preference, you swore  to uphold the letter of the law, the constitution, and that's what we've  got to do.  I mean, it's there.  Whether you agree with it or not, the law  is the law.  So, I think it's going to be an issue that's frankly will be a  winning issue for Republicans and we've got to talk about it, not be  fearful of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then why are we still talking about a blue wave?  What are  your expectations for the midterm elections?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't think there's going to be a blue wave.  I don't  really know what a blue wave is unless it means all Republicans lose.  But  I think that frankly, I think we keep seats in the House.  I think we -- it  might be minimal.  But at the same time, I think we could gain seats in the  -- in the Senate.  </p><p>But the issues are this.  The issues are Americans are better off than  they've been in many, many years.  Americans regardless of Republican or  Democrat, they have more money in their pockets, they're spending more  money.  They're realizing a lot of great things the country has to offer  with the tax cuts we passed, reducing the regulations, banks now can  breathe, banks can do business and compete and compete for customers.   We've got a lot of great things happening in this country.  And I think  people recognize that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People recognize that but the left is not recognizing it and  even the mainstream media is driving the bus on the -- on the not  recognizing it.  They're talking about Michael Cohen and Russia and all  this other things that are really not important to the American people.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, it's to divert.  I mean, we've got a lot of people that  don't think frankly like I do but it's interesting because when you talk  about tax cuts alone, Democrats are spending the tax cuts.  Democrats have  more money in their pocket.  </p><p>And so, I think at the end of the day, people will realize that famous  saying, you're better off today than you were yesterday.  I think they will  come along that way.  </p><p>But I will say this to my colleagues in the Republican Party, we've got to  do a better job of promoting the things we've got to -- we've done.  We've  got to be more retail.  We've got to be more offensive.  We can't be  defensive.  We've got a lot to talk about.  </p><p>This country has done a lot of things under President Trump.  I represent  fort hood.  The military is beginning to get much more -- it becoming  stronger, we're training more.  We've got great kids, just got back from  Iraq.  So, there's a lot going for us on this side as we move in to  November.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I'm surprised you're not hearing more conversation  about 4.1 percent economic growth.  You know, you've got some successes  that you're not really hearing discussed.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, that's right and I go back, I've been in business 47  years, still own a business.  The economy is good.  We look at -- look at  more jobs, and (INAUDIBLE) four percent GDP, you look at unemployment down  around maybe possibly less than four percent.  There's opportunity  everywhere.  </p><p>And those people always talked about minimum wage.  People who are on  minimum wage under Barack Obama, they're making more money now because  we're competing for a workforce and it's driving wages up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  So, it is a good -- it's -- we can talk about a lot of things.   But the press is the press.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And they drive a separate issue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the wage is up 2.8 percent year over year.  That's  obviously very positive.  But congressman, I've got to get your reaction to  this insider trading charges against New York representative Chris Collins,  your colleague.  He's defending himself.  He did so yesterday.  Here's what  he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK:  The charges that have been levied  against me are meritless and I will mount a vigorous defense in court to  clear my name.  I look forward to being fully vindicated and exonerated,  ending any and all questions relating to my affiliation with Innate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction as Collins is not going to be serving on the  House Energy and other committees per Paul Ryan until this is resolved,  sir.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I mean, I'm sorry about this.  I'm sorry that this has  happened.  I do know Chris.  He came in with me in 2012 into congress.  And  he's got a road ahead of him.  He's a fighter.  He's a battler.  I don't  know the facts.  I just learned them yesterday on the news.  So, I pray for  him and his family and hope everything gets resolved.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask about the looming trade dispute with China.  They're  answering back to President Trump's tariff threat with new tariffs of their  own on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.  Where do you think this is headed  in terms of the spat with China?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I mean, I think you've got two heavyweights battling each  other right now.  I am as you know, a small business owner.  I'm not that  excited about tariffs.  I think there's different ways to go.  I think no  tariffs would be great.  President Trump is talking about that.  But  tariffs are -- we've had the biggest tax cut we've had in many, many years.   Tariffs do raise the price of cost of goods sold.  </p><p>So, I hope that at the end of the day, I understand the China issue is  major, we need to -- we need to fix that, but I hope that we focus on  opportunity and the fact that of letting the cost of goods sold go through  competition, let people decide who they want to do business with and I just  don't think tariffs are the way to do that.  I talked to the White House  the other day about if we can't do tariffs, you know, can we do quotas.   We've got a history of quotas which frankly does not raise the cost of  goods sold.  </p><p>So, there's still a lot of opportunity out there.  And the White House is  willing to talk to people like me and others about other ideas.  And I'm  grateful for that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you have any sense of when we might see the next deal  logged in terms of a trade deal, perhaps Mexico is on the horizon, we keep  hearing that perhaps that's close.  Any thoughts on the next deal that we  might see?  </p><p>Because markets are giving this president, I guess, some breathing room in  terms of his negotiation on these tariffs but at some point they're going  to want to see a real deal.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, you're right.  And you know, in business you have the --  you get -- you get ready for the sale but some point -- some point in time  you have to close the sale.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And I think that Mexico could be the very next one.  Mexico is  our partner, is our neighbor.  There's a lot of -- a lot of things we can  coordinate with Mexico.  So, I'd like to see a deal there.  But I'm with  you.  I think a deal's around the corner, I haven't been told that.  But  when you negotiate, you negotiate for a reason and you negotiate for an end  and the president does it better than anybody.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Congressman, it's good to  see you this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Congressman Roger Williams joining us.</p><p>Coming up, Mickey Mouse to the rescue, details on the new way Disney is  helping parents get their kids to sleep.

And we're  going to tell you about it, coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The footwear maker Crocs is closing the last of  its manufacturing plants.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  This is  interesting, the company says it's already closed its plant in Mexico and  one in Italy is going to close soon.  But it's unclear how they're going to  continue to produce their products.  </p><p>In addition, the company's executive vice president and CFO Carrie Teffner  is leaving.  The news was announced on the Earnings Call.  </p><p>Now, the company grew second quarter earnings and revenue by 4.7 percent  year over year.  Crocs became popular among hospital, restaurant workers,  boating fans and others, people that are on their feet all day, after they  launched in 2002.  Shares of Crocs are actually up 44 percent for the year.   The question is, where are they going to be making their shoes?  </p><p>All right, well, Disney is launching a sleep hotline to help parents put  their restless kids to bed.  The company even listed a sleep coach to help  with the hotline.  The Parents pick up the phone, they dial 8777-MICKEY.   They're going to be greeted by Mickey Mouse to tell the child it's time to  hit the hay.  There's other familiar voices you may know, Minnie Mouse,  Donald and Daisy Duck even Goofy.  You only get one character per call, so  choose wisely.  </p><p>Disney reported 77 percent of parents have a tough time getting the kids  down at night.  They're hoping this will maybe help them out.  Shares of  Disney are six percent higher so far for the year.  </p><p>And then there's this, how would you like to drive around in what I'm about  to show you?  This is the work of formula -- former Formula One driver  Tarso Marques, it's called the TMC Dumont.  It's got a 300-horsepower Rolls  Royce aircraft engine.  But the biggest thing, 36-inch hubless wheels,  these are the largest wheels ever made for a motorcycle.  It was recently  awarded the Best in Show at the Daytona Beach Bike Week Show.  So, there's  something for you if you want to ride around in that little puppy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really not exercise, you're sitting there, it's like a  motorcycle, right?  </p><p>CASONE:  It's like a motorcycle.  Yes, with the Rolls Royce engine, so,  that's fun.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  300 horsepower.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  (INAUDIBLE) That is -- that thing could go probably 300 miles an  hour.  Not that you would, but 300-horsepower is absurd for a motorcycle.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I think we  still need to talk about Crocs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you upset about Crocs?  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, this -- could this be the death of Crocs?  Maybe a  lot of people are rejoicing outside because they're -- they haven't  announced.  It's unclear where their production facilities are going to be.   And they just launched the croc heel.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Not too long ago.  The women that are watching today, will  you wear the croc heel?  I wonder.  I wonder if it's going to -- I don't  know.  Could this be the end?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, contract manufacturing, yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you say maybe they're outsourcing.  You're not sure?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I mean, yes.  Well, we have to assume it's contract  manufacturing somewhere since they didn't announce the end of the company  as far as I know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I want Disney to come up with a sleep line for adults.   Forget the kids.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  You want somebody to call?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I want to be able to call Mickey and say I'm having a hard time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Minnie?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I guess, it all state a Mickey fan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You can -- you can do it.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, that's what we'll do.  We'll create a new hot line for  adults.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt will join me.  We're  talking Tesla, he's weighing in on the Securities and Exchange Commission  reportedly examining Elon Musk's tweet on Tesla private.  That according to  the Wall Street Journal this morning.</p><p>Then, suffering for a selfie, a new rise in plastic surgery patients asking  to look like their Snapchat filters.  Wait until you hear this.  Back in a  minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A disturbing new trend to tell you about,  teenagers are seeking plastic surgery to look like their filtered selfies.   People suffering from Snapchat Dysmorphia look for enhanced facial features  like those produced by photo filters.  </p><p>Joining us now is assistant professor of Dermatology at Boston University,  Dr. Neelam Vashi.  Dr. Vashi, good to see you this morning.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  </p><p>What can you tell us about this disturbing trend?  </p><p>DR. NEELAM VASHI, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF DERMATOLOGY, BOSTON UNIVERSITY:   Sure.  So, Snapchat Dysmorphia is a new phenomenon that we are seeing in  clinic.  It's a phenomenon of increased scrutiny over selfies and this new  trend we're seeing that has patients seeking out cosmetic procedures to not  only improve their look in selfies but also to look like filtered and  altered versions of themselves with perfect hair and unblemished skin,  smaller noses, fuller lips, bigger eyes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is from teenagers?  </p><p>VASHI:  So, my patient population, I treat adults.  And so, what I am  seeing in clinic these days is a younger patient population.  And so, the  patients who are in their 20's to early 30's are often bringing in selfies.   They want to -- you know, firstly improve their look in a traditionally  taken selfie or look like an altered version of themself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Dr. Vashi, this is Mike Huckabee.  First of all, not everybody  can look as beautiful as I do.  So, I realize plastic surgery is necessary  for some people.  But in all honesty, this done on a teenager, would this  not even constitute some level of malpractice if teenagers are having their  faces completely reshaped for reasons that have nothing to do with any  medical reason other than they want a line taken out?  I mean, for a  teenager to make this decision, I just find that frightening.  </p><p>VASHI:  So, I don't treat teenagers for this reason.  And I think that most  cosmetic dermatologists like myself and plastic surgeons also do not treat  teenagers in this type of fashion.  Yes, for medical reasons, such as a  nasal defect or cleft lip or palette younger kids and teenagers will get  plastic surgery but nor for cosmetic reasons.  </p><p>The -- we're calling Snapchat Dysmorphia a trigger to something more  serious called body dysmorphic disorder.  And body dysmorphic disorder does  actually present in the young teens years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VASHI:  But Patients don't present to clinics until their early 30s and  that's because they don't have the means to obtain a plastic surgery or  some kind of cosmetic procedure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VASHI:  And also, younger than 18 they need a patient consent.  Not only do  they have to have the means to have this type of treatment, they also have  to have a patient consent to obtain any -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Body dysmorphic disorder.  Kristina, they're blaming it on this  study, the study published in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery viewpoint, found  that apps like Snapchat and photo editing Facetune are to blame for this.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Facetune, so, we were talking about this before.  This is a  trend I've seen for quite some time which is why I almost don't trust  almost any photo online.  Because with some of these apps that you can but  in the app store, you can shrink your waist, you can shrink your arms, you  can change -- you can make your skin flawless, make your eye lashes longer,  make your teeth whiter, you can completely alter your online self.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Which I think is what is contributing to a lot of these  younger women and older woman wanting to change their facial features.  I  think it's horrible.  And it needs to stop.  But I guess, you got to delete  the apps or make them really, really expensive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I don't know about the apps.  I mean, the apps certainly  you can change the picture.  But to actually take the picture and go to a  dermatologist and say make me look like this, I want to have plastic  surgery, that's where the horrible part of the story comes in.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, doctor, I'm wondering in terms of the scale here, how much  of your practice is now people coming in with specifically this issue?   They want to look like they do in an app?  </p><p>VASHI:  So, I get both.  I get patients who will bring in a selfie and say  they want to improve the look of the selfie.  They say they'll have a  facial asymmetry or a groove in the face.  </p><p>And then, I also have patients who do come in with a filtered photograph.   I had one patient come in with the crown of flowers from Snapchat, saying  she wanted to look like that filtered photograph.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, that's incredible.  Dr. Vashi, thanks so much.  We  appreciate your time this morning.  We'll be watching that.</p><p>VASHI:  You're very welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, trouble for Tesla, we've got Harvey Pitt former  chairman of the SEC weighing in, coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

Good Thursday  morning.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday,  August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Show  me the money, that's the call to Tesla from Wall Street and Washington.   The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly launching a probe into  Elon Musk's tweet about going private.</p><p>My interview with former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt is coming up this morning  to talk about that.  Escalating trade tensions weighing on global  investors.  Futures edging higher this morning, Dow Industrials up 20  points.  S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ up just fractionally three points higher.   This after a mixed performance yesterday on Wall Street, the NASDAQ was the  gain top performer with the gain of four points on the session.</p><p>The Dow Industrials down 45 at the close yesterday.  In Europe this  morning, markets are mixed.  Take a look at the European indices and we are  looking at some pressure on stocks this morning, in Europe, as well.  FT- 100 down 50 points, three quarters of one percent.  The CAC quarante down a  quarter of a percent, 15 points lower.  And the DAX Index in Germany down  18 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks finished mostly higher, the standout was China,  Shanghai Composite up about two percent.  A pair of merger deals dead.   First up, Sinclair's takeover of Tribune has been called off this morning  following recent comments from SEC Chairman Ajit Pai.  Plus, the Rite-Aid  and Albertson's deal also terminated.  The company say investor pushback is  to blame, that deal also off for now.</p><p>The media sector in focus.  We are watching earnings from Viacom and 21st  Century Fox.  We are breaking down the numbers there.  And as you can see  both stocks are higher this morning. A front row seat to a natural  disaster.  Check out this unbelievable video taken on chairlift of a  volcano erupting.  And as you can see it, it's pretty extraordinary.  Plus,  this outfit is going viral this morning.</p><p>But Instagram user cannot figure out if it's a dress or is it a bikini.  We  report you decide.  Let us know what you think.  You send us tweet on that.   All stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network Kristina Partsinevelos is with us, the Wall  Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman is here and  former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee. </p><p>Great to see you everybody this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Good to be with you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thanks.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Looking forward to your Harvey Pitt  interview, makes sense of this Elon Musk tweets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  What are the most important questions here?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, it's funny.  You think about these public statements being  so careful and then he fires off what looked like very casual comments but  I -- but I think it is a question.  What does he need to show secure  funding?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And does this mean he's now obligated to bid for $120 now that  he's teased it on Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And where is he going to get that money?  I mean, who has  that money to acquire and take the company private? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Should be -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's $75 billion.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  What about -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  And Harvey is the guy to answer these questions. </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Institutional investors.  So (INAUDIBLE) fact that their  share stake is five percent, one of the largest after Elon Musk when you  talk about insiding -- insiders and then you have five massive  institutional accounts like T. Rowe, these guys have big part.  So it's  either going to be existing shareholders, institutional investors or some  really rich guys from Silicon Valley.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Won't be me, let me just -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Or sovereign wealth fund. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see.  We know that the shorts certainly took a hit  on that which is what he was intending.  Our top story, Musk is under the  microscope this morning.  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that  Securities and Exchange Commission is in fact probing Elon Musk's tweet to  find out if it was truthful.  This after the Tesla CEO tweeted two o days  ago this and considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share.</p><p>Funding secured and with that, the stock rallied.  Joining me right now is  former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt.  Great to see you, Harvey.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>HARVEY PITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION:  Good to be with  you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think as a former chairman of the Securities and  Exchange Commission.  What is the SEC looking at?  Tell us where you see  potential wrongdoing here.</p><p>PITT:  Well, the entire announcement was highly problematic, and  unprecedented and it's important to realize it's not the medium but it's  the message.  Going private transactions are usually announced in advance  of the market opening or after the market closing.  They're not announced  in the middle day.  Mr. Musk tweeted in the middle of the day.  In addition  it's not the CEO who announces this, but it is the board.</p><p>It's the company that makes this announcement.  But here it was the CEO.   What's more important is he stressed that he already had funding to pay  $420 a share.  But no efforts have yet been done to find out whether it's  in the shareholders best interest to take the company private, and, if so,  at what price, so all of this raises two fundamental questions.  First, was  he trying to artificially influence the price of the stock?</p><p>If he was that would be manipulation.  Second, does he really have the  money in hand? And is it binding commitment that would give him almost $70  billion in what would be at the largest going private transaction in U.S.  history?  That would be fraud if those things were not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  the SEC then needs to better understand what he was  referring to when he said $420 and funding secured.  Where would that money  come from? </p><p>PITT:  Well, it could come from either a consortium of banks, it could come  from foreign sovereign investor.  I mean -- the company did receive the big  cash infusion from Saudi Arabia the day that earnings were announced this  past week.  So it's possible that that kind of money might exist.  It's a  large amount and it would take a great deal of effort to put it together.   But it's not impossible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Having said that, it's un-- it's unwise to be tweeting about  this in middle of the day creating activity in the stock.  Do you think the  SEC is also looking at that given the fact that on the Saudi Arabia  investment news, the stock gets rallied right before this announcement.  It   was up seven percent going into tweet and then up 11 percent after the  tweet.  </p><p>PITT:  It's definitely the wrong way to do this kind of thing.  It may not  be per se illegal, but it is definitely highly problematic and it could be  illegal depending on what his intentions were when he made the  announcement.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is there a deadline here, Harvey, in terms of when he would  have to reveal his source of funding?  I mean, if he says funding secured  does the SEC want an answer now in terms of whether or not it's secured and  how long does he have to come up with whatever deal he was referring to? </p><p>PITT:  No.  I think he is required to demonstrate that at the time of his  tweet he already had a legally binding commitment for $420 a share.  That  would be the requirement, so the SEC can request or subpoena documents  asking for proof as to what his financing was and what the legal basis was  for his suggestion that it was secured which is a very strong term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very strong term.  What's the penalty, Harvey, if Musk was just  -- I don't want to say lying but coming up with an idea that perhaps wasn't  necessarily intact funding secured, what's the penalty?  </p><p>PITT:  Well, we don't of course know if the facts are yet but the penalties  are quite serious.  If he committed fraud or manipulated the market, he  would be liable both civilly for an extreme amount of damages but also he  could have potential criminal liability as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why criminal? </p><p>PITT:  Because almost every violation of the Federal securities laws is  both a civil problem that the SEC pursues and also a potential criminal  issue that the Department of Justice pursues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  And so when do you expect we'll hear more about this?   I mean, for example, when are we going to better -- have a clearer idea  whether or not there was in fact funding in place?</p><p>PITT:  I would believe that the next set of announcements will come at some  point from Tesla itself.  The company will probably organize a special  committee of independent directors who will then indicate exactly where  matters stand and whether they are going to pursue Musk's suggest that the  company go private.  I don't think we will hear from the SEC until it has  completed its investigation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about shareholder lawsuits, Harvey, are you expecting that  to also be an issue here?  Because I know that the short sellers loss at  lot of money on that as the stock went up and that's basically what I  assumed Elon Musk wanted to do because he's been sticking it to shorts and  he's, you know, uncomfortable with some of the criticism that the company  has received.</p><p>You saw a very upsetting conference call recently where he pushed back on  some of the criticism and the short sellers questioning about his burn  rate, how much cash is he burning?  So, are you expecting shareholder  lawsuits?  </p><p>PITT:  I think they are inevitable.  It's just a matter of time before  lawsuits are filed because of the enormous fluctuation in the price of the  stock.  I would think the shorts will bring a lawsuit against Mr. Musk and  Tesla.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there any precedence here, Harvey?  Have you ever seen  something like this before?  </p><p>PITT:  I've never seen anything like this kind of announcement.  I have  seen short sellers, sue certainly companies and I have certainly seen  companies sue short sellers.  It's a fact of life that if you're public,  you're going to get criticism and the shorts are people you just have to  live with. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And, obviously, that's what they are doing.  They're  critical of the company.  They're shorting the stock.  I mean, that's why  they exist.  So you're expecting the SEC to be asking questions about the  funding.  Any other questions coming from the SEC in your view?</p><p>PITT:  Well, I think they will look into why the board didn't make an  announcement sooner, why they waited for Mr. Musk to go for -- forward, and  I think they will also try to determine what kinds of behind-the-scenes  activities were taken by the company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So in other words, background because the board is saying yes,  Harvey Pitt, the board is saying yes, that Elon Musk has discussed the  potential of going private with us before.  But there is no mention of any  $420 price.  </p><p>PITT:  No.  And where that price comes from is very hard to understand.  It  may be a very good price, but in terms of an economic analysis it may turn  out that it's not as good a price as should be paid for this company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  I mean, when you're talking about $420 a share,  that's like $70 billion, right?  $75 billion? </p><p>PITT:  Yes.  And unprecedented amount of money, it truly is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Harvey, it's great to see  you again.  Hope you'll come back soon.  Thanks so much for your insights  this morning.  </p><p>PITT:  Sure.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Harvey Pitt joining us there.  And we'll take a short break.   When we come back.  The Tribune Media-Sinclair deal is dead.  Tribune says  that the $3.9 deal can no longer move forward after comments from SEC  Chairman Ajit Pai.  The latest coming up there.  Then half dress, half  bikini?  The new dress causing confusion online.  That's coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tribute Media called off its buyout by Sinclair  Broadcast Group.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Two deals that are dead  today, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We got two deals, that is  right, Maria.  First to Tribune, they've terminated their $3.9-billion deal  and they're suing Sinclair for breach of contract for not doing enough to  win approval from regulators.  You may remember last month, SEC Chairman  Ajit Pai said he had serious concerns about the merger.  Take a look at the  stocks, shares of Sinclair right now, they are lower in the premarket  trading.</p><p>Down more than three percent.  Tribune Media, not really trading it but  shares down more than 20 percent so far this year.  So two stocks to watch  now.  We're also watching shares of Rite-Aid right now.  The stock plunging  more than 10 percent in the premarket.  The sell-off coming after Rite-Aid  and Albertsons called off their $24 billion merger.  Some big Rite-Aid  shareholders plan to vote against the deal today.</p><p>Rite-Aid and Albertsons wanted to team up in order to compete better  against CBS, Walgreens and potentially as you know Amazon has been trying  to get into the pharmaceutical business as well. </p><p>All right.  Check this out.  A volcanic eruption in Chile gets a rider on a  ski list, the front row seat to the action all on tape.  The eruption shot  up a 5,000 foot column of dust and ash as he was filming all of this with  his cell phone.  This comes from a volcano complex that's in the Andes  Mountain but pretty incredible pictures and pretty close.  </p><p>And finally there is this.  We've seen some pretty weird fashion trends in  the last year, upside down shorts, plastic jeans.  Well, here is a new one.   This is a bikini and it's a dress, all in one.  This comes from the fashion  brand, PrettyLittleThing.  And after having one of their models wear it on  Instagram picture, people started to freak out.</p><p>There it is.  We'll let you decide.  Looks like she couldn't decide on what  to wear so she cut both in half and sewed them together.  Maybe.  Here's  another comment.  She's going to dinner, clubbing and swimming all at once.   Yes.  The whole thing goes for $35.00 maybe.  Maria, you could wear it with  some crack heels?  You know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  That would be an interesting pairing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure would.  So is it a -- is it a dress or is it a bikini?</p><p>CASONE:  It's both.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's both.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Because --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Why not have both?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're getting your money for it.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Remember the black or blue dress or is it blue or white  dress? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Same thing.  But I know about you.  I think, Governor, it  would look better own you with man-bun, crack heels.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Pretty sure it wouldn't.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Going to be strong with the man-bun.  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You got to really loving this man-bun.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- I would feel naked.  Oh.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  If I wear that without the man-bun I would just feel just naked.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You thought of either of us wearing that is something that there  are television sets across America that are going to be off mode.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't want that.  We don't want that.  Coming up.  Viacom is  reporting quarterly earnings this morning.  We're breaking down those  numbers coming up next.  Big week for media.  Then overhauling the Oscars.   Details on new changes coming to the academy awards quarterly including the  addition of a popular film category, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Both parent company of the Fox Business Network, 21st Century  Fox quarterly profit nearly doubled due to cable and film strength.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching the stock  and the overall market this morning.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  we talked about 21st Century Fox, our parent and it beat on top and bottom  line.  The analyst have to optimism there as you noted in those particular  areas and that's exactly what came.  In fact it did better than expected.   Deadpool 2, the strength of Fox News just among the reasons why we did see  it beat the 18 percent year over year.</p><p>Revenue increase, strong double-digit growth across all the segments and  the new and obviously what happened, the transaction, Disney and the new  Fox transactions, that -- they say unlocked enormous shareholder value.  In  fact when you take a look at the stock over the fiscal year it's about 75  percent gain, that clearly outpaces the S&amp;P 500.  And the media group which  actually has declined over that period.</p><p>Of course, there's still locked in the -- in the bidding war with CMSCA and  that would be Comcast, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You check that?</p><p>PETALLIDES:  We'll watch that.  So that is the big difference.  Also, last  but not least, we're taking a look at Viacom this morning and that came in  profit top revenue fell and there was the slump in ad sales which fell  short.  And that number which I did talk about the increased shareholder  value I did get from the 21st Century Fox headlines themselves.  Back to  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic.  Thank you so much.  Nicole, we'll be watching  all of that.  Switching gears to the censorship of conservatives on social  media.  It has the attention of lawmakers now including House Majority  Leader Kevin McCarthy who talked to us about this as well as House  Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes who want - both want answers on action.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  I want to see bias  stop, especially going after conservatives.  I mean, just look at three  points that showed up in Google right before the primary election in  California.  The party of Lincoln, the party of Reagan, that's not what it  said, it said Nazism.  </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I don't  know what Twitter is up to.  It sure looks to me like they're censoring  people and they ought -- they ought to stop it and we're looking at any  legal remedies that we can go through.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So that was Devin Nunes and Kevin McCarthy.  Kevin  McCarthy was talking about remember right before the primary elections in  California.  You Googled GOP California and in the search results got  Naziism.  Your thoughts, Governor.  I know this is an important topic to  you. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it really is an important topic.  We talk about Russian  interference.  I'm worried about social media interference.  How are they  manipulating elections, how are they manipulating the information and the  question comes as somebody who doesn't really like government regulation  and intervention, we're headed there.</p><p>We're going to get it because social media platforms are no longer just  social media where people chit-chat about their yoga classes and their  daughter's wedding, they're now the place where people get news, they are  public utilities just like electricity, water, cable television and  telephone.  And so government is going to step in at some point.  I think  sooner than later and they're going to regulate them.</p><p>The social media companies will rue the day when they started favoring one  point of view over another.  But here's why that matters.  Would Americans  tolerate it if you paid differently for your electricity, your water or  your telephone based on your political view of where you went to church?   You would be outraged.  Liberal conservative or independent, you'd be  outraged.  That's what we're seeing today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's also so-called, shadowed banning, James, I mean --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I mean, I had put out a tweet about James Clapper  basically admitting on CNN that President Obama directed the Intelligence  Agencies to launch investigation for the special counsel on the Trump- Russia and I -- and I -- and basically Jim Clapper -- James Clapper  admitted it on CNN.  So I tweeted that out, it got no life, no -- and I  thought, you know, this is something that I know my followers care about.</p><p>And I felt to myself, hmm, is that shadow banning?  I don't know.  I wonder  if my followers saw that tweet or if it just went on deaf ears.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, we've had a bunch of these teases where certainly  conservative viewpoints seem to be suppressed.  The answers from Silicon  Valley generally are often not denials but sort of saying, well, it wasn't  intentional, it's the algorithm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But somebody programs the algorithm change.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, I agree.  I think there's enough ear to say there is a  problem of bias.  It's -- I think it -- I'm hoping first there's a consumer  remedy, we've seen user growth surprisingly kind of flattened --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  In these recent earnings reports but I'm hoping it can be  disciplined either through customer behavior or maybe it has to be private  litigation as opposed to creating a new Federal internet regulator and I  think that's the big danger here is that the big tech giants are trying to  cut a deal with both parties in Washington that gives them liability  protection but it also sets up the Federal Trade Commission to have huge  powers over the internet.</p><p>And this could -- this is actually a deal that could happen, very quickly,  I think, and that is the anger I see for innovation because the utility  model you don't get a lot of innovation out of the phone company, the water  company, et cetera.  So I'm hoping there is a market remedy for this and  maybe consumers, you know, are starting to say I want -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I mean, I wish there was a market remedy, I would much rather  see it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But these companies are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some competition.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- hearing the bells.  I mean, they're bringing it upon  themselves because they are actively suppressing the points of view of  certain people and when they do that, the market is going to rise up and I  think -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  What about Alex Jones and certain hate groups, they're  censoring certain things that are clearly fake, if you want to say it, fake  news and he is discounting Sandy Hook and the children and families there.   So when he's -- when somebody is putting out inaccurate facts that have  been proven to be wrong then why not get rid of him?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, that's a fun --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, this is why we're talking about it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- user organization.  But of course, these social media  companies have enjoyed a lot of legal protection on the basis that they are  not news organizations, that it's an open platform anyone in public.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Now that they're making those kind of judgments, they better be  ready for different treatment --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And the first amendment protects stupidity, it protects outrages  speech.  I don't like it but it does protect it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  We got the PPI on the  other side of this break.  Stay with us.  Producer Price Index, we'll take  a look at inflation.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday,  August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  We  are just getting the Producer Price Index out.  It is unchanged.  A gain of  three-tenths of a percent was expected, and that's what it looks like this  morning, unchanged on the Producer Price Index.  Not a major reaction from  markets this morning.  We've been looking at a fractional move all morning.   Dow Industrials right now up 20 points, S&amp;P 500 up three, and the NASDAQ up  4-1/2.  Initial jobless claims also out right now, down 6,000.  </p><p>Global markets action in Europe this morning, take a look at European  indices, obviously down across the board.  FT-100 down 50 points, that's  two-thirds of one percent.  The CAC Quarante is down a quarter of a  percent, 16 points lower, and the DAX Index in Germany is flat, down six  points.  In Asia Overnight, the standout was China.  Chinese markets  bouncing back on hopes to the stimulus against U.S. tariffs.  Shanghai  Composite up almost two percent.  And PPI is out, unchanged on the session  versus a two-tenths of a percent estimate, James Freeman.  Your thoughts on  where we are on inflation.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Pretty benign environment right now, the economy is  humming, fast growth but inflation not yet raging even though the Feds  still has this huge balance sheet they acquired in the wake of the  financial crisis.  So, I think the hope here is that as we transition back  to the real economy, we can do it without an inflation surge.  And so far  so good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And year-over-year, Kristina, on inflation on the PPI is 3.3  percent, very much in step with what we've been -- what we've been  expecting.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.  And if anything, maybe this can add to the argument  that wage growth hasn't been climbing higher.  So, now that inflation is  staying relatively flat, that's OK because of wage growth not climbing high  enough or lasted a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wages have just been creeping up, the 2.8 percent higher  year-over-year on wages, we'll keep following that and any impact on  markets this morning.  We have breaking news right now out of North Korea.   North Korea says that if the Trump administration, \"adheres to all  scenarios,\" then there's no chance of progress on denuclearization.  Blake  Burman is live at the White House this morning with more on that.  Blake,  good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria, good morning to you as well.  This obviously raises more questions  about just how intent North Korea is on resolving the issue of  denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  The headline that is coming out this  morning is that the North Koreans say that if the Trump administration  adheres to old scenarios, it cannot expect any progress on  denuclearization, something that the White House certainly will watch  throughout the day.  And of course, the upcoming weeks and months as the  President right now is in Bedminster, New Jersey for a week off on what the  White House is characterizing as a working vacation.</p><p>Meantime, here in Washington later today, the Vice President Mike Pence  will lay out what the administration hopes to deploy in the upcoming years  that being a sixth branch of the military, the Space Force.  The President  said earlier this summer that he wanted the military to build out this new  branch of government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now, our destiny beyond the  Earth is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national  security.  When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely  have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in  space.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  The Air Force already though has a robust presence patrolling  outer space especially as it relates to the use and deployment of  satellites.  That responsibility would go to the Space Force which would be  responsible for conducting war plans for space, but there are many  questions here, including how the military would be reshaped.  The defense  secretary James Mattis admitting earlier this week that they are still  trying to work out on how the actual organization would take place within  the military.  By the way, Maria, there is also the congressional issue on  this one as well because a sixth branch of the military would need  Congressional approval and, of course, Congressional funding.  We will hear  from the Vice President later today, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman with the  latest there.  Joining us right now is Fox News Legal Analyst and author of  the new book, \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton  and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett is with us.  Gregg, great to see  you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  And as I read the title and as I report  on what has teken place in the 2016 election.  It seems exactly accurate in  terms of what happened.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.  Well, you would know because you have done so much to  further the story yourself.  I wrote this book because actually I became  incensed in outraged, the top officials at the FBI and the Department of  Justice were abusing their positions of power to subvert the rule of law,  and undermine the democratic process, and I think I lay out a fairly  persuasive case here of the facts, the evidence, and the law, that this was  a cesspool of corruption.  And by the way, it still is, because they  continue to cover it up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the latest has a real focus on Bruce Ohr, the number three  guy at the DOJ, whose wife worked for Fusion GPS.</p><p>JARRETT:  I mean, talk about an incestuous collection of corrupt acts.  You  know, the FBI knew that Christopher Steele, who phonied up the anti-Trump  dossier, was already on the payroll of Hillary Clinton, he was on the  payroll of the FBI.  And when the FBI finally fired Christopher Steele,  their regulations say you can't have any more contact with him, so they  were very devious.  They used Bruce Ohr at the Department of Justice as the  conduit, the intermediary.  The FBI continued to receive Christopher Steele  information, spying on Trump after he was inaugurated for several months  thereafter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know, what gets me, Governor, is, you know, it feels  like the left in their hatred of President Trump, so much they've thrown  out all ideals, they've thrown out values of, you know, the law of the  land, and it was OK to spy on Carter Page, oh, because it's Trump.  You  know, it's OK to abuse your power at the top of the FBI, oh, it's Trump.   It's incredible.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it is incredible.  And Gregg, congratulations on the book.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It reads like a novel.  The frightening thing is that it's not  fiction, it's fact, and you lay out an incredibly compelling case in a  chronological order, which I think is a great value to the reader.  So,  it's a -- it's a powerful book.  We've seen the weaponization of the  agencies of our federal government going after a presidential candidate in  a fashion we've never seen before, the highest levels.  But when they are  using their own power in this way, to create a false dossier, on which the  warrant is obtained, legally, does that not put them with the fruit of the  poisonous tree, and so that whatever they end up would be able to be pushed  back because they got it illegally?</p><p>JARRETT:  Yes, absolutely, under the exclusionary rule, it would be  excluded as evidence.  The law enforcers became the lawbreakers.  And  what's outrageous is --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's powerful statement.</p><p>JARRETT:  Yes, they're not being investigated and prosecuted.  I lay out  myriad of potential crimes here, by people like Andrew McCabe, James Comey,  and you know, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and the list goes on and on, things  like abusive power which is a felony.  Obstruction of justice, they  obstructed their own investigation to clear Hillary Clinton.  And on the  same day they cleared her, Comey is standing in front of cameras, his FBI  is meeting secretly in London with Christopher Steele to begin the frame  job on President Trump, then-candidate Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  And you say that this all started when then-FBI director  Jim Comey cleared Hillary Clinton in the e-mail server probe back in 2016.   Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  Although, we did not find clear  evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws  governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that  they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly- classified information.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, while they were putting together a narrative about Donald  Trump, they were very easy on Hillary Clinton.  And they basically did not  investigate.</p><p>JARRETT:  Absolutely.  And it was one deception, and I believe, lie after  another from James Comey as you saw there on that very day.  He had  originally written it, Hillary Clinton committed crimes.  He wrote it down  twice, gross negligence, but his staff said, well, you can't clear her if  you put that in your statement, so they sit down at Peter Strzok's computer  and they expunge from Comey's statements, those incriminating words and  other allegations of criminality by Hillary Clinton.  The swamp didn't want  to be drained.  And a potential President Trump jeopardized their ambitions  and positions of power, so they sought to damage his candidacy, and when  they didn't do that and he was elected, they sought to undo the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  And the -- when you talk about the swamp going after now- President Trump, but then-candidate Trump, do we have a sense yet of  exactly when this began?  There seems to have been I think a real challenge  for Congressional investigators figuring out when was the real beginning of  whether it was intelligence or law enforcement assets descending on the  Trump campaign?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is what Devin Nunes is investigating right now, what  happened before actual launch of the investigation, which, of course, was  July 2016?</p><p>JARRETT:  Some of the documents that Devin Nunes is trying to get his hands  on that Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray will not hand over the origins  of the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, it looks to me like, the FBI  began spying on the Trump campaign seven months before they formally signed  the papers launching the investigation.  And by the way, when they signed  those papers, they violated their own FBI guidelines, there was no probable  cause, no evidence of crimes, no plausible intelligence for  counterintelligence probe, they broke the law and the rules.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think there'll be any accountability here?  </p><p>JARRETT:  Not with Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein at the helm of the  Department of Justice.  And that's a sad commentary on our system of  justice right now.  But Sessions is utterly feckless and Rosenstein, I  think, is trying to continue to cover up his own wrongdoing.  This is a guy  who should have recused himself the moment he appointed Mueller.  You can't  be a prosecutor and a key witness all rolled into one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because he OK'd the fourth FISA warrant.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's right.  And you can only do that when you have new  evidence.  The best we can tell so far, they have no new evidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there wasn't any evidence from the get-go, it was just the  dossier.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's right.  And the FBI knew that the dossier was totally  fabricated.  You can read it online, I've read it a hundred times.  I never  failed to laugh.  You know, it is the work of an amateur dime novelist in  junior high school.  And even Christopher Steele who wrote it, said, in  court papers under oath in Great Britain, which I dug up, and it's in the  book, that it's unverifiable because it was a guy who told a guy, who told  the guy, who told me.  Triple, quadruple hearsay based on anonymous  sources.  You can't use that sort of thing in a court of law.  Get the FBI  and DOJ, use it to gain a warrant to wiretap -- that's abuse of power to  fraud on the court.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this is one political party spying on the -- on their  opponent, there on the left.</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.  And where's the outrage over Hillary Clinton paying for  all of this?  Now, that is a violation of the law.  The Trump Tower  meeting, perfect legal.  All the media has to do is read the federal  campaign election act.  Foreign nationals may participate in American  political campaigns and providing any information is not a thing of value.   But stonewalling to Congress is something I do not understand why it  continues.  They have a constitutional obligation to give Congress what it  wants.  And Congress should use the power of the purse and cut off the  money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Into the oversight agency.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's the only way to have.  Yes.  Absolutely.  But I blame  Congress because for decades, whenever the Department of Justice and FBI  didn't want to hand over documents, they just said we're not going to do  it, and Congress never took action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>JARRETT:  So, it's been habitual.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, the President could order all of this declassified.</p><p>JARRETT:  And he should.  I think he is considering it, but you know, there  are -- there are those advising him not to.  He should absolutely order  declassification of a FISA application documents, the Gang of Eight  documents and the origin documents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The American people have a right to know and they want to know.   \"The Russia Hoax,\" is the book, \"The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary  Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  Great to see you.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have breaking news right now we want to get to, Russian  Foreign Ministry is saying this, Moscow will work on retaliatory measures  in response to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia, it's according to  Reuters this morning.  The U.S. imposed new sanctions tied to the nerve  agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter, that of course,  breaking this week.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Uber and Lyft hitting a roadblock in New York  City.  The city council voted to limit the number of vehicles on the  streets.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to  weigh in.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  You  know, I think there's a backlash coming to this thing.  As you say, the  Mayor of New york is imposing a cap on the number of Uber and Lyft cars  allowed in the city.  In my opinion, that leaves a lot of wait times and to  higher prices.  But there's something else going on here, yellow cabs have  often been accused (INAUDIBLE) regular taxicabs in New York City often  accused of not picking up people of color because of their color.  Uber has  a way out.  </p><p>Uber doesn't care what color you are, Uber doesn't care what your ethnicity  is, they pick you up, it's all electronic.  Well, that is going to be  capped at the -- basically at the doings of the willing of the taxi  industry.  I think there's a backlash coming here from the minorities.   Worse yet, I think there's going to be -- I think New York City will be  used as a template as a test case for other cities in America and around  the world, which want to fence in Uber, because they are devastating the  local taxi industry.  I think this is the wrong decision on so many levels,  and I hope it's withdrawn, I don't think it will be but it should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meaning there's a lot of backlash because, you know, look what  happened to the taxis.  The prices of the medallion plummeted.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, the medallion was 2 -- was 1.3 million in 2013, and now it's  between 160 and 250,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's a huge loss of capital for the taxi owners and this is  their way of pushing back.  But I think the pushback is very detrimental to  many, many people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that.  Stu, I know you'll have more on  that in about 10 minutes.  We'll see you then top of the hour \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.   Join Stuart in the next few minutes.  But first, overhauling the Oscars,  details on the new changes coming to the Academy Awards including the  addition of a popular film category, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  -- arts and sciences cutting  the link to the show and introducing a category for outstanding achievement  in popular film.  Critics have complained that the broadcast is too long,  too boring, too political, too condescending -- oh, maybe that's just my  view.</p><p>Audiences would appear to agree, giving me telecast, its lowest ratings on  record last February when a mere 26.5 million people tuned in.  Remember,  the Super Bowl got 107 million.  Academy CEO Dawn Hudson said the board is,  quote, committed to producing an entertaining show in three hours.  Wow.   Three -- it takes you three hours?  The move was met with a frenzy of  criticism, particularly from in the street journalists.  Atlantic reporter  David Sims called the (INAUDIBLE) award, the Black Panther memorial award  for movie that were afraid won't get a big picture -- best picture  nominations.  Other called it lazy, ham-handed.  In recent years, hit films  like \"Wonder Woman\" have been snubbed by Oscar, although blockbusters from  the past like \"Gone With the Wind\" were heavily recognized.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, good changes?</p><p>WILLIS:  Not the right changes necessary (INAUDIBLE) always a good idea.   Can we do this in like 30 minutes or something?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three hours.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You can get a kidney replacement in less time and it's not as  painful as watching the Oscars.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on the changes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  People like -- I remember when I was a kid, I used to love  watching it because you'd never know who would win and you'd sit around  together, and then the outfits, so I don't think that they're really going  to shorten it that much, but they have lost viewership, for sure, because  there's --</p><p>WILLIS:  It's brutal.  I always (INAUDIBLE) 4 million people every single  night, OK?  I mean, think about it.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  But also the performance.  The performances and the actors  and the comedians in between sets, those are -- that's pretty decent stuff,  and sometimes there's controversy that comes out of it, so that's what I  would watch for.  I don't watch it, but --</p><p>WILLIS:  I thought you'd see the fashion and would be happy.  That's all I  really need.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think beyond the suffocating politics, they just -- you have  too many movies that almost no one in the television audience has seen so I  understand what they're trying to do here.  Maybe they ought to just  recognize some of these films that a lot of Americans think were the best  pictures: \"American Sniper\" -- I mean, most people would say that's a great  movie, right?</p><p>WILLIS:  Right.  Well, this popcorn award, that's what they're trying to  do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The popular film.</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes, popular film.  But you know, that's sort of like a ghetto for  popular -- you know, like, though, it should really win the major  categories.  You know what I mean?  It should be elevated to the level of  \"Gone With the Wind,\" lots of very popular movies in previous years won  those awards, not anymore.</p><p>FREEMAN:  People don't watch the Oscars, though, because they want a  political lecture that insults half of America.  They want to -- they want  to escape from all of that and have entertainment.  When the celebrities go  up there and lecture us and preach to us and point their fingers --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  They don't do that all the time during Oscars.  I'm going  to fight back against that.  If you watch the full show --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's become much more political.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  -- not all politics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it has become much more political.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It doesn't have to be all politics, but when all the politics  they have is negative toward half the population, what happens?  People say  I'll watch paint dry before I'll sit here and watch this.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  There's always going to be something that's going to offend  somebody out there, and usually, politics makes for good comedy.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But their ratings are tanking.  It's not working.  Maybe they  should listen to us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gerri, good stuff.</p><p>WILLIS:  I'm staying 30 minutes.  I think I'm going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Stay with  us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel right  now.  Governor Huckabee?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I want to say thanks to James Freeman for writing a book called  \"Borrowed Time,\" and giving really powerful insight into the financial  crisis, I think it's a very, very important book, people need to read it,  and I hope they will.  James, I want it to be a bestseller.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks, Governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \" Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and Bailouts at  Citi.\"  Check out the book.  Congratulations.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I just want to say that the Governor is very handsome and very  charming man.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  And a model American citizen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kristina?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, I'm not going to -- I'm going to take a serious route  just because we haven't been able to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, this is serious.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is serious stuff right here.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  You bring a wonderful book and you're a gorgeous man.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Now, the timing just seems so awkward.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us.  This is an important story, too.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  This is an important story, but you guys are great.  Saudi  Arabia and Canada, the relations going on between both those countries,  Canada foreign affairs minister tweeting about the human rights -- two  human rights activists in Saudi.  Saudi is saying, you can't tell us  anything and what to do.  So, I think that's just a big story, a big story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll follow that.  Kristina Partsinevelos, James  Freeman, Mike Huckabee, great to see, everybody.  Thank you so much.  Great  show, everybody.  We'll see you again tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is now.   Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  And good morning, everyone.

And you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations on the book.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh, thank you.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:   Woo-hoo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"Borrowed Times\" -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- \"Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and Bailouts at Citi.\"</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Oh, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just published a couple of days ago.  Why did you choose Citi  to write a book, James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well it's the classic too big to fail bank.  It was -- my co- author Vern McKinley who brought the idea to me and the lesson here is  really amazing.  You had a really strong healthy vibrant institution.  It  was so strong it even bailed out the government at times when it was a  completely free institution with no taxpayer backing.  Then --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- about a hundred years ago we get the Federal Reserve, we get  the safety net, taxpayer standing behind it and it's a series of crisis  ever since.  So it's a -- it's a real lesson about the corrosive nature of  the safety net.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's -- and it's an important book because it's important  to tell us exactly what happened in history.  \"Borrowed Time\" is the -- is  the name.  Congrats to you, we're going to talk a lot about your new book - -</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this morning James Freeman.  First though our top story  right now and that is Wall Street and Washington telling Tesla, \"Show me  the money.\"  The Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating  where the CEO Elon Musk's tweet yesterday was truthful.</p><p>He tweeted Tuesday this, \"I'm considering taking Tesla private at $420 a  share.  Funding secured.\"  Joining us right now is Mainstay Capital  Management CEO, Chief Investment Strategist David Kudla.  David, good to  see you this morning.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, CEO, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I'm glad you're here because you shorted Tesla over the  past two days and you've been watching this company and covering it for a  long time, your reaction to what has taken place David.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, if we look at what's happened over the past couple  of days the stock never approached $420, the apparent deal price.  It  reached the high of $387 after that tweet came out two days ago, in  premarket today it's more than $20.00 off that price.</p><p>So the market is losing faith in this deal.  And if we look at the merits  of it, I own a very small company by comparison, if I were going to sell it  and arrive at a price, it would take more than a week of discussion to do  that.  If I were doing the largest LBO in history they said they talked  about, the board talked about this last week to arrive at a price in secure  funding, I think it would take a lot longer than one week.  It's just hard  to believe this is real.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean he said funding secured which really was a head- scratcher because you're talking about something like $75 billion, right,  to get to a $420 price.</p><p>KUDLA:  Right.  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you -- so you're questioning whether or not the  funding is secured.</p><p>KUDLA:  Yes.  I think everybody is questioning that.  And now as we know,  the SEC is questioning it and why all the mystery?  If he knows the price  or Tesla knows the price and why all the mystery on who is the buyer or who  are the buyers?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It was pretty clear yesterday that the Securities and  Exchange Commission was going to be knocking on the company's door after  that tweet James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think this may be a question for a Securities lower but  it may come down to -- a lot is going to hinge on this word secure.  Does  this mean he made a few calls and he was confident he could get the money  or does he probably need a letter from a bank saying, \"You have the X  billion?\"</p><p>KUDLA:  Well James, if you look at the details that came out later on the  blog and on the memo and rather than adding more detail or more certainty,  it was a little bit more -- a little bit more vague. </p><p>You know, he talked about -- it almost look like more of a letter of intent  or a plan to have a plan rather than adding more certainty to the original  tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Kristina, we know that he's wanting to stick it to  the shorts for some time.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.  And right now the latest numbers of the shorts  consist of 20 percent of the float.  But I wanted to focus on Saudi Arabia  given that the Financial Times yesterday came out or two days ago came out  with the fact that they increased their share of Tesla or the portfolio of  Tesla.</p><p>And so isn't that a sign of confidence and that possibly other sovereign  wealth funds like Norway for example given they have $1 trillion, couldn't  they be one of the backers of Tesla?  </p><p>KUDLA:  There is -- there's a lot of money out there sloshing around  whether it's sovereign wealth funds, whether it's private equity, looking  for deals.  But the question is, who's going to invest in this company?</p><p>You know, a lot of times they're looking for companies that are cash-rich  or have at least they have positive cash flows.  This is a company that has  a negative cash flow, herding for money.  Even if this deal were to be done  needs more financing.  So who's going to do this deal?  They've had talk --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think this is just a mistake?  I mean, was this just a  mistake on Elon Musk's part?  What the heck happened.</p><p>KUDLA:  We don't know.  He -- you know, he's done things on Twitter before,  he had a prank on April Fool's Day, he's made jokes on Twitter.  We really  don't know yet.  But we know -- but we don't know anything more about the  deal and that's odd.  It was odd how it came about --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>KUDLA:  -- and it's odd that we don't know anything further.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, your thoughts?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well David, I sometimes wonder, are we taking Twitter too  seriously?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I mean, my thoughts now it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- the president tweets something, Elon Musk tweets something  and it becomes the focus of a major federal investigation.  Maybe people  ought to step back, lighten up and say, \"Twitter is for amusement.  It is  not necessarily a declaration of some legal document.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then he shouldn't have put the company up for sale on Twitter.</p><p>KUDLA:  It's a -- but he said --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:   And then what about the president who constantly --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well I think a lot of these tweets are for amusement as well.  </p><p>KUDLA:  But Mike --</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think we really should not the company has said that invest --  they've officially said investors can look to his Twitter feed for  additional information about the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's right.  They said this --</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's official channel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, an official channel.</p><p>KUDLA:  They said it's an official channel and investors, Mike, investors  traded on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  People put money on stake based on what the company has said is an  official news outlet for additional information on the company.</p><p>People went long on those two days, shorts went in and covered positions,  there was people that traded on this information.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLA:  So they took it seriously.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking  into it right now.</p><p>KUDLA:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the legal implications?  I mean, we're going to speak  with Harvey Pitt coming up in the program, he's my special guest, former  Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  But from your  standpoint as an investor, what do you want to see happen now?  </p><p>KUDLA:  We'll --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been shorting it the last two days, right?  But you were  not short going into it.</p><p>KUDLA:  We had -- we've had short positions on.  We've traded the  volatility in Tesla because as the stock has been hiked up and gone up,  it's been a good short.  The air comes out of the stock, you can cover a  profit.  We play the volatility in the stock.</p><p>And we think it was an opportunity to short the last couple of days because  we don't think this would be able to go through.  Even if there is secured  funding there's a lot of ways that a deal like this can fall apart. </p><p>Then you go back to the company fundamentals which we just don't think are  that good.  There's a liquidity problem, there's a sustained profitability  problem, and you got a lot of competition online -- or coming online in the  next one, two, three, four years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's China.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  Competitive market and we've been raising a lot of  questions.  But shouldn't it be noted that they do seem to have lately been  hitting their production targets, David?  I mean on an operating basis,  isn't there a better story on this company than there has been?</p><p>KUDLA:  I guess it depends how you look at the numbers.  They built 5,000  cars for one week at the end of June by pulling out all the stops and using  parts that were desperately needed for service parts.</p><p>We have people waiting for service parts for weeks and months.  All the  measures that are taking using a tent for their third general assembly  line, manufacturing process --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well what's wrong with tent?  I mean, if that's how you build the  cars who cares what the -- what the roof is?</p><p>KUDLA:  If you -- for people that know automotive manufacturing that walk  through those plans or look at how these cars are being built, the mistakes  that are being made, you know, this is not as Elon Musk said  revolutionizing manufacturing.</p><p>They're having a lot of problems with building cars, having a lot of  problems in execution and now, you know, Elon Musk talked about production  hell, now they're facing warranty service hell and customers are having  problems with the service centers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLA:  There are a lot of issues and once they work through that, they've  got all this competition coming online.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And somebody said yesterday when we were talking about  this that China wants to own this market, the E.V. market, electric --</p><p>KUDLA:  They've made a national priority.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  Let me ask you about the price of the stock,  it's at $370 right now, you've been shorting it.  What do you think is the  right price for this company?</p><p>KUDLA:  A lot lower.  In premarket we're down to about $365, $362 --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's $365 right now.  So what's the -- what's the right price?  </p><p>KUDLA:  Well look, Elon Musk himself has said its real car company.  People  want to say it's an energy company that builds cars or it's a technology  (INAUDIBLE) cars.  Ninety percent of the revenues come from building and  selling cars.</p><p>Car companies trade -- around the world trade at multiple of six to twelve.   P.E. multiple six to twelve and right now Tesla trades at a multiple of  infinity.  OK.  Some day if they do get the profitability they won't trade  at a multiple of $300 or $400.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow. </p><p>KUDLA:  They trade a multiple a lot lower.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>KUDLA:  So the stock price should be well below $400, well below $300.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well below $300 as well.  OK.  So we'll watch that.  Broader  market, recent technology route on Facebook earnings, the sector has  bounced back but we're looking at real volatility.  Would you buy any of  these names in tech?</p><p>KUDLA:  We are still strong supporters of technology.  We had a great first  quarter earnings, second quarter with more than 80 percent of companies  reporting, technology earnings are coming in very strong, again, about 31  percent earnings growth.</p><p>With everything going on with tax reform, business new regulation, CAPEX is  strong, tech -- we want second growth stories in this economy, technology  we think is the best place to be for secular growth.  We think that story  keeps getting better.</p><p>We want to own tech, it's our favorite sector this year, continues to do  well, we -- and we -- it's continued to do well for us and we think it's a  leadership sector as we go forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll leave it there.  David, we'll be watching that  as well as Tesla.  Good to see you this morning, thanks so much.  </p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  David Kudla.  Be sure to tune in at 8:00a.m. Eastern for my  interview with the former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  Harvey Pitt, my special guest this morning.  So we will talk about what the  implications are as a result of that tweet on Tesla with Harvey Pitt.</p><p>First though coming up, fear and panic, powerful aftershocks rocking  Indonesia this morning just days after a deadly earthquake killed hundreds  of people.  We have the very latest there. </p><p>And then the deal is off, Rite Aid and Albertsons abandoning their merger,  why things broke down?  Next right here, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Aftershocks are slamming Indonesia this morning  following a series of deadly earthquake.  Cheryl Casone on headlines now,  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Well Maria, good morning.  Since Sunday, more than 350 aftershocks  have kept survivors on edge.  The death toll on Indonesia's tourist island  of Lombok has surpassed 300 after the latest earthquake.  </p><p>A 5.9 magnitude tremor shook Lombok less than a week after the area was  devastated by Sunday's 7.0 quake.  As rescue efforts continue that death  toll we should say is expected to rise.</p><p>Well back here at home, another police officer is in the hospital after  being shot  This time Jacksonville, Florida.  Official say the suspect was  walking by a Waffle House where he fired at a passing patrol car.  No one  in the car was hurt, police chased the suspect, a gun fight ensued.  </p><p>One officer and the suspect had been hospitalized both with gunshot wounds  but neither suffered luckily like threatening injuries.</p><p>Well, Albertsons and Rite Aid are calling off their $24 billion merger,  this comes after shareholders complain that the takeover undervalued Rite  Aid.  Albertsons says it's unwilling to change the terms of the merger and  Rite Aid said its committed to moving forward as a standalone company.  The  deal would have created a new company with around $83 billion in annual  sales.</p><p>And then there's this, a major discrepancy in how much oil the Saudis are  producing.  The Wall Street Journal reports the Saudis have told OPEC it  cut output in July but estimates from the U.S. government and independent  agencies say that they boosted production amounted to a huge difference of  as much as half a million barrels a day.</p><p>And the Journal says that this news causing a lot of confusion in the  markets about, Maria, how much oil is actually reaching the consumer.   Another change in what Saudi is today, that is for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure is and that's why we're seeing oil prices.  I mean,  what a move yesterday.  I was reading actually in the Journal, oil prices  dropping significantly yesterday.  Your thoughts on what's going on this  morning in terms of oil James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  It seems like there's kind of unexpected inventory glut --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- it's happening while U.S. production after surging seems to be  kind of falling off a little.  But I guess looking long-term I just get  very optimistic seeing as how number of reports out this week showing the  U.S. is going to be a net exporter of petroleum within five years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pretty incredible.  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Complete energy independence basically somewhere in the 2020,  2021 timeframe.  And it's the -- this fracking revolution we've been  talking about it for years but it has profound very positive effects for  the economy.</p><p>PARTSINEVOLOS:  Did you see -- I think it was a few days ago, maybe in the  last week that Texas would be the third -- very soon the third largest  country to be -- to export oil just given how much is coming out of there.</p><p>And, yes, I think it's definitely going to climb -- I think the United  States will fill the glut.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the priorities of the Trump Administration.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well -- and you're going to be in a lot of trouble with people  in Texas, they think they're the number one economy in the world.  So just  so you know.</p><p>PARTSINEVOLOS:  I think the number one in the United States for sure and  it's just talking about oil, I'm not talking about the economy.  There's so  much oil they're getting out there, they're doing quite well.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes they are.  But I do think that what James is saying is  incredibly important that we're independent.  Many people laugh when we  talked about America being energy independent within 10 years but we're  already there.</p><p>And it's a significant ability not only to provide energy, it's a national  security issue.  The fact that we don't have to go hand-in-hand to the  Saudis and beg for them to be nice to us when they've been financing  terrorism around the world for decades.  This is huge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it is huge.  All right.  We'll keep talking about that.   We'll take a short break.  When we come back, a man is arrested in  connection with one of wildfires that's scorching Southern California.   We'll tell you why police believe he did it.  We'll bring you that next.</p><p>And then too big to fail over and over again, a new book by our contributor  today, James Freeman.  Taking a deep dive into Citi Groups crisis field  history.  We're going to talk about that when we come right back.  There's  the stock at $72.89, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big bank, even bigger story.  James Freeman is  out with a new book chronically the history of one of America's largest  financial institutions.</p><p>The book is titled, \"Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and  Bailouts at Citi.\"  James, congratulations on the book, we're so happy  you're here to talk about it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Great.  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us the takeaway that you have in borrowed time.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think the big takeaway is the regulation and government  support through history doesn't work.  We look at a bank that it's been  there two centuries.</p><p>The first century it's an independent organization, there's no federal  backstop, there's no taxpayer exposure.  Knowing that they are going to  accept the consequences of failure you had very careful bankers running a  very strong bank.</p><p>People -- most Americans have never heard of.  Moses Taylor, James  Stillman, they built the largest bank in the country and wasn't necessarily  fun to work there.  Stillman, you know, he roomed by absolute fear.</p><p>He was a maniac about examining their credit risks and demanding  information from people they were going to lend to.  It was such a strong  bank, so highly capitalized that they actually rescued the government a  couple times in the 1890s.  </p><p>Then once the taxpayer safety net comes in, political operators start  running the bank.  And within years of the Federal Reserve being created,  Citi is there borrowing heavily from the New York Fed.  Now, we'd love to  know all the details about that but Fed won't share the documents, they've  probably been destroyed.</p><p>This is kind of an ongoing problem where the Federal Reserve hides and then  destroys documents related to their supervision of banks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And in recent years you really saw how strong or weak the bank  is especially when it was tested during the financial crisis.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  The weakest of the bank.  It needed the biggest bank  bailout.  $45 billion direct government investment, hundreds of billions of  more in debt guarantees various other assistance.</p><p>And it was a complete failure.  And I think it's the -- it's the government  backstop which is the root of it because a lot of people during the crisis  they like to say that this or that particular instrument or Wall Street  gambling was the cause.</p><p>But you look at Citi and we were able to pull one document out of the FDIC  it showed problems across the bank from the most complex financial  instrument and the -- in moral street trading to the most simple loan.  </p><p>So it was -- the underlying problem is the government safety net which  encourages risk taking and government policies driving people into housing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  James, congratulations on the book.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh, thanks.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Frankly, I was delighted to find out what the topic was.  When I  saw the title \"Borrow Time\" I thought it was my medical report, so I'm  delighted to hear that it wasn't.</p><p>But I think your book is more a message than just a book and the message is  that when banks operate with prudence and they operate the old fashion way  where they stand up for themselves and they're responsible.</p><p>The stock holders and to their employees and to their customers, that's a  solid bank.  But when they start depending upon the government and know the  government's going to bail them out, they operate at a level of greed that  you expose in this book.</p><p>I think it's an incredibly valuable message that I hope people in  government will read because the politicians need to not make this mistake  again by providing all of this safety net for these banks who operate like  these guys operated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well thanks.  And I'm hoping this is maybe a moment where it's a  good time.  Banks are healthy again, they're strong, they're making money,  they're returning capital to shareholders which maybe should make taxpayers  a little nervous.</p><p>But I think it is a good time to say let's start peeling back that safety  net.  I understand if the government said tomorrow everything's change and  we're going to let everyone fail, it would be a little chaotic.</p><p>So you start a phase withdrawal.  Policies, laws, regulations, you start  making it clear that we're going to let people fail again and, you know,  there's a -- obviously bankruptcy was not an option anyone wanted in '08.</p><p>But the beauty of that is it does allow new competitors, more innovative  competitors to arise and it allows people to suffer investors, to suffer  the consequences of their decisions.</p><p>You know, this is not about -- obviously you can your deposit insurance,  it's about making investors who make bad decisions live with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVOLOS:  Just quickly, you just said there were problems across the  board, they were quite obvious.  So then why do you think the government  bailed them out?</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's funny, it's kind of a mid -- even some of the people doing  the bailouts, Sheila Bair who's running the FDIC was kind of saying, you  know, where's the analysis and where's the real argument that we really  should rescue these guys.</p><p>And it was just kind of presumed and this is -- one of the reason we wrote  the book is to show that this kind of too big to fail mentality was built  over decades.  It wasn't just, oh wait, someone decided a bank like Citi  has to be saved.  It was just presumed.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said that if it's not too big to fail, I  don't know what is.  But there's no analysis to say we couldn't live  without Citi.  And I think you look at this economy where a lot of these  institutions we probably could live without.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, someone who was against TARP, one of the few republicans  who openly was against it and I still am, I want to say thanks for exposing  and peeling the onion back a little bit and letting people realize that  this wasn't the absolute -- if we don't do this, you know, it's Armageddon. </p><p>And I think that's what we were told in a way, I never believed it then.  I  think your book helps to point out, would it have been disastrous?  Yes.   But would it have been the end of the world?  Probably not, just the end of  some very bad banking procedures.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks.  You know, it really went well beyond Citi.  As you point  out, you go back March of '08, the government decided to rescue the  creditors of Bear Stearns, not even a bank.  Maybe the 17th largest  institution in the financial industry.  I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it because we were in a moment of time -- in time that  they were worried that the lights were going to go out on G.E. and that,  you know, things were coming to a halt given that the buck broke?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  There was definitely a lot of fear and it was based on gut  instinct more than -- more than math I would say.  </p><p>But -- and I understand it was difficult because I think the government can  create a problem that big where one reason it was so challenging, as you  look roughly 20 years before the, Drexel Burnham big investment bank  failed, life went on.  </p><p>But in '08 you had the government pushing everybody in the housing  investment, rewarding banks for holding AAA-rated mortgage bank security.   So you had the same problem across the industry.  </p><p>So I understand the fear of letting all of these institutions take a hit  and have to recognize their losses.  But, I think, certainly, the bailout  culture was building over time whereas the governor said the -- knowing the  safety net was there, made these banks run at very high levels of leverage.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And it was an election year.  Let's not forget that.  That's a  big motive there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Freeman, the book is Borrowed Time, Two Centuries of  Booms, Busts, and Bailouts of Citi, go check it out, James Freeman,  congratulations again.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A very important book.

We break it down, what  regulators are telling Uber this morning.  </p><p>Fox on top, 21st Century Fox, nearly doubling its quarterly profit, this  ahead of a deal with Walt Disney, to sell most of its entertainment assets.   We are crunching the numbers on 21st Century Fox this morning, put the  stock at 45, 46.</p><p>And he shoots, he scores, a Harlem Globetrotter, flying high with an  incredible trick shot from an airplane, getting a ride in there, too.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning, but first, our top story  this half an hour, and that is socialism's popularity is in a slump, many  of the primary candidates backed up by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez, not even coming close to winning the nominations.</p><p>Joining me right now to discuss that is Former Trump Campaign  Communications Director, Bryan Lanza and Democratic Strategist, Robin Biro.   Good to see you both, thank you so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>BRYAN LANZA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MERCURY:  Good morning, thank you.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think, Robin, let me kick it off with you.   What do you think happened in the primaries?  Why are these socialists arm  of the Democrats not doing well in your view?</p><p>BIRO:  In my view, they're just not resonating with, as you know, your  everyday Americans.  I still think that Ocasio-Cortez was a geographic  anomaly.  You know, you know, a heavily-left-leaning district, a very left- leaning candidate.  </p><p>I did not believe that the party itself lock, stock, and barrel, was going  that far left.  And I'm glad to see that six out of seven of these, Bernie  and Ocasio-Cortez candidates did not win.  </p><p>So, you know, I hope that, sort of, changes the narrative that we're all  losing our minds and drifting toward socialism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, in other words, you're saying that this is a negative for  the party, because it feels like anybody in the party who is, sort of,  moderate or not extreme left, is not resonating.  I mean, you have to come  up with these things like abolish ICE, in terms of getting the blessing of  the leadership.</p><p>BIRO:  Oh, well -- let's -- we are about to run into a topic talking about  Nancy Pelosi.  And I think the leadership is out of touch with, you know,  your average American.  What I'm saying is that, moderate candidates are  the ones that are winning and moderate candidates, like -- I'm not a  candidate, but moderates like me, are winning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BIRO:  They are the ones with the stronger message.  These far-left  candidates are out of touch with everyday Americans, that's why they didn't  win and I'm glad that they didn't.  It's just it's a bad formula for my  party to have candidates this far to the left.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, speaking about a touch, Bryan, Nancy Pelosi claims that a  vote for a Democrat in November will give leverage to illegal immigrants.  </p><p>LANZA:  Unbelievable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It proves once again, where her priorities lie, with illegals.   Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PELOSI:  We are not going to be able to get it done under the Republican  leadership in Congress.  We believe that we will have leverage when we win  in November, because it gives us hope to -- because of the leverage it  gives to families who may have followed -- dad may have gone home for a  family funeral and now can't come back into the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts, Bryan?</p><p>LANZA:  I mean, I think it's just shameful that the leader of the  Democratic Party's prioritizing illegal immigrants over everything else.   You know why she wants leverage for?  She wants leverage to abolish ICE.   She wants leverage for open borders, and she wants leverage for amnesty.</p><p>The American people do not want leverage for illegal aliens coming into  this country.  They want to focus on the American workers who are working  very hard to get themselves out of, you know, whatever socio-economic  condition they're in and work up the economic ladder.  Nancy Pelosi doesn't  believe in the American people, she believes in the foreign dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts going into the midterms, Bryan?</p><p>LANZA:  I think this is good.  I mean, it exposes, you know, whether it's  Bernie Sanders or Nancy Pelosi, it really exposes the energy of Democratic  Party and just how far-left it is.  You know, sort of the radical  progressives are taking a food hold in the party.  </p><p>They may not have all the seats today, but that's where the energy is, and  that's where the leaders of the Democratic Party are talking about.  They  are talk about abolishing ICE.  They're talking about raising taxes.  </p><p>They're talking about open borders.  I think those principles and values  are out of context with the American people.  And I think we're going to  have an election in November to prove that they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think, Robin, if a blue wave does in fact  happen in November, it may not have impact or support the people think,  take a look at Democratic congressional nominee, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,  she's waffling on whether she even sees a leader of the Democrat Party.   This is an interview with CNN.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, HOST CNN:  Whom do you believe to be the head of the  Democratic Party?</p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK:  Well, I  don't think that there's any one head.  You know, we are a collective, this  is a movement.  And I don't think parties are ever about one person, but  they're about how the contributions that each one person gives to the  party.  So, I think that there are really exciting folks in the party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robin, there is a leader, Tom Perez, was the head of the  Democratic National Committee, right?</p><p>BIRO:  Yes, I really, honestly, just can't with her.  You know, I was  affirmed -- I was firmly opposed to Bernie Sanders, I've been opposed to  Ocasio-Cortez, anybody that far to the left, I think, is on the fringe and  does not represent what middle America, most Americans believe.  </p><p>And I agree with Bryan, that, you know, people like Nancy Pelosi are pretty  much out of touch.  I think she makes a strong case for recall, go ahead,  Calexit.  So, you know, I think we need some better leadership.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think is going on then, Robin?  I mean, is it  because they -- the Democrats are not sure what to do with Donald Trump as  President?  </p><p>BIRO:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have they just given up on moderation, I mean, it does seem  that --</p><p>BIRO:  Yes, let me tell you --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  the party has been hijacked, right?</p><p>BIRO:  It has, and let me tell you exactly what's going on.  The party did  swing somewhat to the left, in response to Donald Trump.  But I think what  we're seeing now, Maria, is that it's levelling out, we're getting back to  our roots, we're getting back to winning strategies, we are in red states,  we're running moderates, that's what just happened in Ohio, he came  incredibly close.</p><p>So, you know, we are getting back to a good strategy here.  And like I  said, geographically, Ocasio-Cortez won in a very left-leaning district, so  that, I understand.  I still insist that's a geographic anomaly.  I do not  think the party itself lock, stock, and barrel, is all swinging toward  Democratic socialism.  That was just proven wrong on Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will -- we will leave it there and watch this.   Great to see you both, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>LANZA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bryan, thank you.</p><p>BIRO:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robin, thank you very much.  We have some breaking news right  now that we want to talk about, and apparently, the Sinclair deal with  Tribune is off.  The Tribune media deal -- Sinclair deal is dead.  Tribune  saying that the $3.9 billion deal can no longer move forward after comments  from FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, your thoughts?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I think -- you know, all these mergers have frightened a  lot of people into feeling there was going to be almost a monopolistic  approach to media.  And the FCC, obviously, has been nervous about it, and  I think we are seeing the results of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But in an environment where AT&amp;T and Time Warner are getting  together, and obviously, Fox selling the entertainment assets.  But bigger,  sort of, identity of this is the AT&amp;T deal, your thoughts, James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think that deal ought to go through.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's kind of nutty the government is appealing on this one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But why is it being --</p><p>FREEMAN:  You know, I don't think Ajit Pai is some hyper regulator who's  eager to break up business deals.  I think this was more about a sincere  belief that based on the correct reading of the law.  It shouldn't be  allowed to go through.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Too much concentration?</p><p>FREEMAN:  It gets into -- I think a fairly technical compliance issue, not  sort of a big picture that too much -- too much concentration in media, but  I think he is correctly applying the law even though it's obviously not the  result that many of the shareholders would have wanted.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Did you guys hear about this, just previously, that critics  have said that Ajit has actually changed the FCC rules to benefit Sinclair?   It's in an article.  Did you talk about that at all?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  OK.  And the FCC inspector general is actually  investigating that particular matter, whether rules have been changed, but  now, I guess that's nullified, given that this deal hasn't gone through.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Maria, I think we need to be more concerned about what's  happening with the social media companies becoming monopolistic rather than  the traditional legacy companies, because the audiences for broadcast and  traditional cable are beginning to dwindle and things are moving more to  the social media platforms.  That ought to strike --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk more about that because there's really the  spotlight now on social media, so we'll talk more about that.  We'll take a  break.  When we come back, pumping the brakes, New York becomes the first  major city to cap the number of drivers working for companies like Lyft and  Uber.</p><p>And taking the skyhook to a whole new level, a Harlem Globetrotter makes a  basket from a plane, back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A suspect is in custody this morning for  allegedly starting the so-called \"holy fire,\" which has burned more than  six square miles in Southern California.  Cheryl Casone with the details  now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  One of several fires still burning, Maria, in California.  Maria,  51-year-old, Forrest Gordon Clark is behind bars today on suspicion of  arson.  He's also charged with a threat to terrorize and resisting arrest.   Investigators believe the fire was an intentional act but they're still  figuring out how exactly he started it.  According to Orange County  register, Clark owns a cabin in the area of the fires and sent the e-mail  to fire officials warning this place will burn.  The fire started Monday  but is only five percent contained right now.  </p><p>Well, 21st Century Fox reporting better than expected earnings after the  closing bell last night.  The company's results easily beating the street's  estimates driven by growth and its cable, and film business.  Higher fees  from cable and satellite distributors also helping to boosting profits.   21st Century Fox is preparing to close major deal to sell most of its  entertainment assets Walt Disney for $71 billion shares of 21st Century  Fox, the parent of the Fox Business Network, of 31 percent so far this  year.  </p><p>And then finally, check this out, A Harlem Globe Trotter makes ultimate sky  hook when he scores a basket from an airplane.  This incredible footage  shows Bull Bullard pulling up a shoot from a two-person plane.  The plane  going 70 miles an hour, as a past over hoop in the middle of the runway, he  drops the ball, nothing but net, anybody ask yourself, why do this?  Why  not?  It's the Globe Trotters, man, they love this stuff.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, why not?  I love it.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, screeching of a new rule capping the number of ride- hailing drivers in New York City, what this really means next?  Back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  -- one year while they  conduct research and try to figure things out.  New York City mayor,  Democrat Bill de Blasio, says this, he says our city is directfully  confronting a crisis that is driving working New Yorkers into poverty, and  our streets into gridlock.  The traffic angle is certainly true, I think,  everybody would agree with that.  But how about fixing the subways?   There's no incentive to take a subway particularly on a hot day in August,  right?    So, what about mass transit and what about the communities and further  parts of the city that don't have access to mass transportation?  They rely  on the for-hire vehicles many times.  You also look at business angles of  all of this, because Uber and Lyft, they're looking to IPO Uber the second- half of the year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  The latest valuations for these companies, and we can show them  to you, estimated at $62 billion for Uber, about $15 billion for Lyft.   This is big money and this, especially being such a big city like New York  City, if it ripples effects in other places, can certainly hurt them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what was it that triggered this?  I mean, was there a  catalyst that made the leadership in New York feel that there's just too  much congestion?  I feel like congestion has been the situation for a long  time?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  True, it's been a little bit worse.  If you look at the exact  numbers of how many cars are on the road, the ride-hailing vehicles and the  taxis, the numbers have gone up.  But we've also seen traditional yellow  cab drivers commit suicide because they're unable to make a living when  they are competing with these for-hire vehicle.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  There's been eight suicides so far.  And also, part of this  deal that these ride-share drivers will earn $17.22 an hour.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Thank you for bringing that up.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes, so at least there's a threshold there.  I do agree  that -- it's not only Lyft.  Via is taking off in New York too.  Are you  familiar with these --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, and also for Via.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  It's a carpooling service, that is carpooling versus Uber,  you can do Uber versus Uber Pool -- Uber Black.  So, there's a lot of  different elements whereas Via is just carpooling, and they're everywhere.   But I agree, why -- you don't want us to take that kind of transportation?   I get around with the city bikes but public transit needs to be improved.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  You do have congestion pricing tolls into the city.  I know no  one likes to pay tolls but that was one idea that de Blasio didn't want  that.  Obviously, we don't want anyone committing suicide but taxi cabs  don't like the competition.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, they don't and the value of their medallion has plummeted.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It went from one million to 200,000.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of happy Uber and Lyft customers in the city.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But Uber will work with the city and other cities around the  world, and hopefully figure this out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yesterday we had a story where, you know, Governor Cuomo wants  to give three months off of bereavement, you know, there's that.  And now,  today we're getting pushed back on Uber, your thoughts on New York and  business?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's just not a place where people can do business.  I mean, it  really isn't, why are so many people move out of New York?  That's why.  I  mean, I was just saying to Lauren a moment ago, the reason I come here, as  seldom as I have to is because -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  You have to come here.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, it's because it's not a place where it's easy to get around,  it's incredibly expensive and it's not getting better.  It's getting worse.   That's unfortunate.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, there's no law of the universe that says financial companies  even have to stay here.  (INAUDIBLE) Bernstein recently announcing it's  moving its headquarters, always been in New York to Nashville.  So, might  want to think about trading customers a little better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you know what, we've talked about this going into the tax  cut plan and there's been no change there.  So, it almost feels like that's  OK with de Blasio and he doesn't care.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  We're running the same experiment in New Jersey, you would have  thought changes in federal tax law would make a lot of these blue states  politicians want to get more competitive.  And so far, they are resisting;  I guess to use their favorite word, but people are going to leave.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Big story.  Thank you, Lauren.  We'll take a short  break.  When we come back, disturbing trend: Teenagers are getting cosmetic  surgery to look like their favorite Snapchat filters.  More on that, next  hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA right here.

And joining me to break  it all down -- Fox Business Network's Kristina Partsinevelos is with us,  the Wall Street Journal for assistant editorial page editor James Freeman,  and former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike  Huckabee.  Great to see everybody this morning.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Thank you.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's on your mind?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  You know what's really cool is we talk about all these people  coming back into the job force.  The quit rate has also gone up.  So people  who already have a job are having an easier time finding new jobs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That shows confidence.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you quit and you want another job it shows confidence.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Isn't there a trend of ghosting now at job interviews?   Ghosting, meaning you either don't show up, or you get hired and you don't  show up to your first day of work either and they don't even tell the  employer?  There was an article written about it that it's happening more  and more often.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Well that is -- that is confident.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  There are jobs -- but they can't find the workers.  They have to  use ghost workers instead.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Ghost like dating -- you go to a restaurant and she doesn't  show up.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Is that what that is.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  That's what it is.  That's what ghosting is.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I've been out of the dating scene for a couple of decades now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>First we have this breaking news.  The Tribune Media-Sinclair deal is dead.   Tribune saying said that the $3.9 billion deal can no longer move forward  after comments from the Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit  Pai.  Pai said last month that he had, quote, \"serious concerns about the  transaction\".</p><p>Joining us right now, by telephone, is Mediatech Capital Partners managing  partner Porter Bibb.  Porter -- great to see you this morning.  Thanks so  much for calling in.  Your thoughts on this deal being dead this morning.  </p><p>PORTER BIBB, MANAGING PARTNER, MEDIATECH CAPITAL PARTNERS (via telephone):   Well, this deal was killed by Ajit Pai about three weeks ago, Maria, when  he indicated the FCC would probably not approve it.  And we haven't heard  from Justice -- the Justice Department would have blocked the deal as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there another competitor in the wings, waiting to come in  for Tribune or for Sinclair?  </p><p>BIBB:  There has to be.  There has to be because there is no question that  Tribune is a seller.  This was nearly $4 billion transaction.  And Sinclair  had an articulated plan to build a competitor basically to the Fox News  Network, a conservative-centric television network that would have had more  stations than any other single entity owned in the United States as part of  their network.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Porter -- James Freeman here at the \"Wall Street Journal\".  I'm  wondering if you could give us a sense of how this happened because I think  Ajit Pai has generally shown he's not eager to intervene in the  marketplace.  He just went through a very tough time basically making sure  that the FCC, his commission, would not be the uber-regulator of the  Internet.</p><p>Was this a sloppy filing by Sinclair?   Or is this Pai in this case at  least overstepping?  </p><p>BIBB:  It's hard to read and I agree with your perception.  The FCC under  Pai has tried to stay out of business matters but I think Justice  Department's challenge against the Time Warner, AT&amp;T merger has influenced  Pai a little bit and also influenced other members, other commissioners on  the FCC.</p><p>It's really a difficult call to try to read what was in their minds.  And I  agree with you, this seemed like a contradictory posture for the FCC to be  adopting.</p><p>However, the idea of a single entity, Sinclair, owning basically the  majority of television stations in this country is not a hard situation to  try to challenge.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  Ok.</p><p>Sinclair down 1.25 percent this morning.  Porter we just got Viacom  earnings out.  Obviously this is a week of media earnings.  Give us your  sort of 30,000 feet look at what's happening in media today and what you've  learned based on these earnings.  Viacom revenue missed their expectations  at $3.24 billion in revenue.  The estimate was $3.26 billion.</p><p>But that's just one part of the story.  Your thoughts on how this business  has changed.  </p><p>BIBB:  Well, the business has changed radically and scale I guess is the  byword of the day.  Viacom and CBS are going to have to come back together  to get scale and then they will be acquired by maybe Verizon which has made  an offer six, seven months ago -- a tentative offer for the combined  companies.</p><p>There are other buyers out there.  But you have to have scale to compete in  this new landscape that the media business has become.  It takes content  and distribution capability as well as scale on every other level.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Porter, I know you cover Tesla.  You called it yesterday.   You told us when you were here on set that you thought the Securities and  Exchange Commission would in fact be inquiring as to the Tesla tweet, the  Elon Musk tweet saying that he's considering taking the company private,  funding secured at $420 a share.</p><p>Your thoughts on where this goes.  </p><p>BIBB:  I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop at the SEC.  They have not  been particularly aggressive on challenging situations like Elon Musk's --  what I consider outrageous disclosure without any substance or fact behind  it.</p><p>The issue with his announcement really hinges on funding.  And he has not  made any disclosures regarding whether he's got funding or not.  Mr. Musk  basically stuck it to the shorts and where it all goes is going to be a  very interesting scenario because he really cannot take this company  private if he wants to avoid shareholder litigation.  That is going to last  a lifetime.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you think ultimately it goes private?  I mean, there  obviously are going to be shareholder lawsuits coming.  Do you see any  opportunity for funding being secured?  I mean what are we talking about  here?  $75 billion?  </p><p>BIBB:  That was the starting point.  One wants to know if he wants to go  private and if he's looking for investors, whether it's Saudis or anybody  else.  Why would he want to pay 20 or 30 percent more than he has to?   Because the stock is going to go back down to earth at some point in the  near future and that's when he should be looking at taking it private if he  wants to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the stock never reached that $420 a share -- James Freeman.  </p><p>BIBB:  Never.  That's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You would think that when he says $420 a share that the stock  would rally to $420.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, that's why I'm wondering.  Porter -- it seems like the  tough thing is finding the money.  If he actually has secured the funding,  what would be the shareholder litigation?  Wouldn't they be thrilled that  he was buying -- picking a property?  </p><p>BIBB:  If he can find the money.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  You think they might sue if they find out he doesn't have  the money and this was just a tease on Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's sticking it to the shorts.  </p><p>BIBB:  That's right.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Do you not think that if he doesn't sell, if he's trying to  increase the share price, if he holds onto his shares, proves that he has  funding, then he's ok.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  If he proves that he has funding.  We're talking about  $80 billion.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  I know.  </p><p>BIBB:  But look where the price was three or four months ago, was back down  in the $270 range.  If he's going to find financing and make an offer to  take the company private, why wouldn't he go at a more realistically-based   price level than $420.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Do you think that 420 is a joke then?  Some people have  said that.  This isn't the first time he talked about being private; he did  it in 2017, November.  </p><p>You have to take your hat off to Elon Musk.  He's a fantastic promoter.   He's a visionary.  And what he says is not to be taken seriously unless he  can deliver.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Porter -- are you telling clients right now to sell the  stock?  </p><p>BIBB:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You bet.  All right.  Porter -- great to talk with you, thank  you so much.</p><p>BIBB:  Ok.  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Porter Bibb -- Mediatech joining us there.</p><p>Switching gears to renewed Russia tensions -- Reuters is reporting that the  Kremlin is rejecting accusations of involvement in the nerve agent attack  on a former Russian spy and his daughter in the U.K.  That's in response  to, of course, fresh sanctions yesterday from the United States following  the poisoning.</p><p>The Kremlin calling the new sanctions, quote, \"categorically unacceptable  and illegal under international law\" slamming Washington as an  unpredictable actor on the international stage.</p><p>Joining us now, Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle.  Lea -- good morning  to you.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE:  Fox News correspondent:  Good morning to you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, that's exactly what I would expect from Russia.  Russia  tends to lie, deny and counter-accuse, when the U.S. State Department comes  out with an announcement like Heather Nauert came out with basically saying  that Russia did use a nerve agent.  This is in violation of international  law that triggers sanctions under the Chemical and Biological Weapons  Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991.  We come out and say that  because we have some pretty solid proof and some pretty solid evidence.   That was already there.</p><p>But for, you know, for Russia to say no, we didn't do it; no, it wasn't us;  or no, we didn't use this nerve agent -- completely to be expected.  Of  course that's what they're going to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about this -- Governor?  I mean that was  pretty aggressive of the U.S. to slap the sanctions on Russia.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I guess I'm trying to figure out if the President is so  the puppet of Vladimir Putin, he has really cut the strings.  I mean I've  never seen the United States push so hard back against Russia.  I can't  remember a time in my lifetime when we have been this tough on them.  And I  don't know why the President is not getting credit for just saying we're  not going to take it anymore.  Why isn't he?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.  I think the President's not getting credit for that  because of the big riff we have in our domestic politics in the United  States.  It's because this is what the other side has been using to attack  the President.</p><p>But I'll go over what Secretary Pompeo said back on July 25th, you know,  213 sanctions we've imposed on Russians and individuals, 60 Russian spies,  expelled, Russia's Consulate in Seattle, closed.  Also San Francisco, the  150 military exercises that we've conducted in Europe this year.  More than  $11 billion put towards European deterrence initiatives.  Defensive weapons  that we've made available to Ukraine and Georgia.</p><p>There's been a big change in this administration, you're your point.  And  it comes down to our politics in the United States.  That's why the  President is getting hit so hard on Russia.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  This is not symbolic.  These are things that are really hurting  Russia, hurting them economically at a time were they were already hurting  economically.  It's hurting them politically, it's hurting them on the  world stage.  I mean these are not just, again, symbolic gestures.  These  are substantive measures that are sticking it to Russia in a very, very  harsh way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul implies on Twitter that he  delivered a letter from President Trump to Vladimir Putin.  The Senator  tweeted this.  I was honored to deliver a letter from President Trump to  President Vladimir Putin's administration.  The letter emphasized the  importance of further engagement in various areas including countering  terrorism, enhancing legislative dialogue and resuming culture exchanges.  </p><p>Just as it was going on the dynamics, this is strengthening the  relationship with the U.K. because the U.K. has asked for these sanctions.   This is improving relations with NATO and other allies.  And I think that  that's what United States needs right now.</p><p>When you brought up President Trump and why they're not saying great for  him, maybe this is actually showing a divide or difference between the  President and the administration over Russia because this has been a topic  before that there may not be agreeing on what needs to be done and how  Russia needs to be treated.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I don't think the sanction would be put in place if  President Trump didn't want to.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I would disagree with that and I would say that the president  has had to defend his legitimacy because of the politics involved from the  very start.  But it seems to me from the actions that are taken that  they're very much working together.  But it seems to me from the actions  that are being taken, they're very much State Department, the establishment  of the global engagement center, You look at the State Department and the  establishment of the global Engagement center which is going to be  countering propaganda from state actors like Russia and working on things  like that, there's a lot the administration is doing and that's led by the  President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Lea great to see you -- thanks you so much.</p><p>We're taking a break.

The firefighters captured this amazing video.  They  named it a firenado.

We're expecting a flat opening for  the broader averages, DOW Industrials down just three points, S&amp;P is up two  and the NASDAQ up seven.  </p><p>It was a mixed close yesterday on Wall Street for the major averages.  The  DOW Industrials down 45 points and the S&amp;P was down almost one point.  The  NASDAQ was the winner, up just four points, so very much -- so close to  where they started the day.  </p><p>In Europe this morning money is leaving stocks.

We will show you that coming up.  </p><p>First, our top story this half an hour, and that is an immigration  showdown.  A Texas judge hearing arguments from 10 states who claim that  the Obama era DACA program is unconstitutional.  Joining me right now is  Texas Congressman Roger Williams.  Congressman, it's good to see you this  morning.  You oversee a border state.  How vital is this slack down to  DACA?  </p><p>REP. ROGER WILLIAMS (R), TEXAS:  Well, I think we've got to come up with --  that DACA.  Of course, a lot of us think that it was done -- it was done  illegally.  But the biggest problem here in Texas is we have to secure the  border.  The president's trying to do that.  I think we need more border  patrol and we need more technology.  But we also need to let those who are  coming up to understand that we have a law, we need to adhere to the law  and it's better to come through the ports of entry rather than between and  let us handle your issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think, can you give us a view of in fact what's  happening at the border right now?  You're in Texas.  You actually see it  up close and personal.  Can you characterize the immigration story for us  today and why there isn't an agreement on both sides of the aisle?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, the issue at the border, I was Secretary of State of Texas  under Governor Perry and dealt with this issue a lot.  So, it's not new.   The issue is you always have folks coming up frankly for a better life and  some coming over here to hurt Americans, to harm Americans, but the issue  down there is the fact that we have folks that are in many -- in many cases  unaccompanied, they're younger, we've seen it.  We've done a pretty good  job in rebuilding the families back that were separated.  But you have a  lot of folks that just they're here illegally like I say and you've got --  you've got to address that.</p><p>And I think to that we've got to remind ourselves too, there's a lot of  folks not coming over here for -- to get a job or the quality of life,  they're coming over here as I said earlier to harm Americans, terrorists  and that's why it's so important to secure this border.  I believe we  secure it with more boots on the ground.  </p><p>Now, why haven't we done this?  I mean, we debated this in congress.   You've got two sides.  You've got Democratic side that frankly I believe  wants to promote illegal behavior and keep our borders not secure.  On our  side, the Republican side, we've had a hard time coming up with a plan.  I  supported the Goodlatte amendment which you're very familiar with.  We've  talked about that in the past.  I think it would have begun to address the  issues.  So, we've got to get back up in September.  We've got to get  serious about it.  And we've got to come up with a solution that keeps our  borders secure and keeps our sovereignty.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it's just a head scratcher as to why the Democrats wouldn't  want the same thing.  I mean, Nancy Pelosi claims that a vote for a  Democrat in November will give leverage to illegal immigrants, this is what  she says.  She's proving once again where her priorities lie, with  illegals.  Listen to this, sir.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your  reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  We are not going to be  able to get it done under the Republican leadership in congress.  We  believe that we will have leverage when we win in November.  Because it  gives hope to -- because of the leverage it gives to families who may have  followed dad going home for a family funeral and now can't come back into  the country. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is this about, congressman?  I mean, is this about votes  that she's trying to get?  Why wouldn't she want to keep the borders  secure?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think it's totally about votes.  I think that they would  rather have this president, this administration fail than America succeed.   I think it's totally about votes.  I lived down here all my life.  I know  what's -- I know -- I know what's going on, like all -- like most Texans.  </p><p>And the fact of the matter is that I would like for Nancy Pelosi to go with  me to where we address homeless veterans.  We have so many homeless  veterans that need assistance, much more before those that frankly come to  break our laws.  So, I think it's all politically driven.  I think they  think they can get more votes and we need to address what we're supposed to  address as public officials and secure our borders and address the law of  the land which they're not doing.  It's all driven by political  grandstanding.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a lot of grandstanding.  And this whole resist movement  continues.  Do you think this gone -- this is going to impact midterm  elections coming November?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I think it will.  I think, I know people in Texas where I  travel around and certainly my district, they want secure borders for  crying out loud.  We all -- regardless of your party preference, you swore  to uphold the letter of the law, the constitution, and that's what we've  got to do.  I mean, it's there.  Whether you agree with it or not, the law  is the law.  So, I think it's going to be an issue that's frankly will be a  winning issue for Republicans and we've got to talk about it, not be  fearful of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then why are we still talking about a blue wave?  What are  your expectations for the midterm elections?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't think there's going to be a blue wave.  I don't  really know what a blue wave is unless it means all Republicans lose.  But  I think that frankly, I think we keep seats in the House.  I think we -- it  might be minimal.  But at the same time, I think we could gain seats in the  -- in the Senate.  </p><p>But the issues are this.  The issues are Americans are better off than  they've been in many, many years.  Americans regardless of Republican or  Democrat, they have more money in their pockets, they're spending more  money.  They're realizing a lot of great things the country has to offer  with the tax cuts we passed, reducing the regulations, banks now can  breathe, banks can do business and compete and compete for customers.   We've got a lot of great things happening in this country.  And I think  people recognize that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People recognize that but the left is not recognizing it and  even the mainstream media is driving the bus on the -- on the not  recognizing it.  They're talking about Michael Cohen and Russia and all  this other things that are really not important to the American people.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, it's to divert.  I mean, we've got a lot of people that  don't think frankly like I do but it's interesting because when you talk  about tax cuts alone, Democrats are spending the tax cuts.  Democrats have  more money in their pocket.  </p><p>And so, I think at the end of the day, people will realize that famous  saying, you're better off today than you were yesterday.  I think they will  come along that way.  </p><p>But I will say this to my colleagues in the Republican Party, we've got to  do a better job of promoting the things we've got to -- we've done.  We've  got to be more retail.  We've got to be more offensive.  We can't be  defensive.  We've got a lot to talk about.  </p><p>This country has done a lot of things under President Trump.  I represent  fort hood.  The military is beginning to get much more -- it becoming  stronger, we're training more.  We've got great kids, just got back from  Iraq.  So, there's a lot going for us on this side as we move in to  November.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I'm surprised you're not hearing more conversation  about 4.1 percent economic growth.  You know, you've got some successes  that you're not really hearing discussed.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, that's right and I go back, I've been in business 47  years, still own a business.  The economy is good.  We look at -- look at  more jobs, and (INAUDIBLE) four percent GDP, you look at unemployment down  around maybe possibly less than four percent.  There's opportunity  everywhere.  </p><p>And those people always talked about minimum wage.  People who are on  minimum wage under Barack Obama, they're making more money now because  we're competing for a workforce and it's driving wages up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  So, it is a good -- it's -- we can talk about a lot of things.   But the press is the press.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And they drive a separate issue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the wage is up 2.8 percent year over year.  That's  obviously very positive.  But congressman, I've got to get your reaction to  this insider trading charges against New York representative Chris Collins,  your colleague.  He's defending himself.  He did so yesterday.  Here's what  he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK:  The charges that have been levied  against me are meritless and I will mount a vigorous defense in court to  clear my name.  I look forward to being fully vindicated and exonerated,  ending any and all questions relating to my affiliation with Innate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction as Collins is not going to be serving on the  House Energy and other committees per Paul Ryan until this is resolved,  sir.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I mean, I'm sorry about this.  I'm sorry that this has  happened.  I do know Chris.  He came in with me in 2012 into congress.  And  he's got a road ahead of him.  He's a fighter.  He's a battler.  I don't  know the facts.  I just learned them yesterday on the news.  So, I pray for  him and his family and hope everything gets resolved.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask about the looming trade dispute with China.  They're  answering back to President Trump's tariff threat with new tariffs of their  own on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.  Where do you think this is headed  in terms of the spat with China?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I mean, I think you've got two heavyweights battling each  other right now.  I am as you know, a small business owner.  I'm not that  excited about tariffs.  I think there's different ways to go.  I think no  tariffs would be great.  President Trump is talking about that.  But  tariffs are -- we've had the biggest tax cut we've had in many, many years.   Tariffs do raise the price of cost of goods sold.  </p><p>So, I hope that at the end of the day, I understand the China issue is  major, we need to -- we need to fix that, but I hope that we focus on  opportunity and the fact that of letting the cost of goods sold go through  competition, let people decide who they want to do business with and I just  don't think tariffs are the way to do that.  I talked to the White House  the other day about if we can't do tariffs, you know, can we do quotas.   We've got a history of quotas which frankly does not raise the cost of  goods sold.  </p><p>So, there's still a lot of opportunity out there.  And the White House is  willing to talk to people like me and others about other ideas.  And I'm  grateful for that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you have any sense of when we might see the next deal  logged in terms of a trade deal, perhaps Mexico is on the horizon, we keep  hearing that perhaps that's close.  Any thoughts on the next deal that we  might see?  </p><p>Because markets are giving this president, I guess, some breathing room in  terms of his negotiation on these tariffs but at some point they're going  to want to see a real deal.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, you're right.  And you know, in business you have the --  you get -- you get ready for the sale but some point -- some point in time  you have to close the sale.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And I think that Mexico could be the very next one.  Mexico is  our partner, is our neighbor.  There's a lot of -- a lot of things we can  coordinate with Mexico.  So, I'd like to see a deal there.  But I'm with  you.  I think a deal's around the corner, I haven't been told that.  But  when you negotiate, you negotiate for a reason and you negotiate for an end  and the president does it better than anybody.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Congressman, it's good to  see you this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Congressman Roger Williams joining us.</p><p>Coming up, Mickey Mouse to the rescue, details on the new way Disney is  helping parents get their kids to sleep.  That's coming up next.  </p><p>And then flying high, the new motorcycle powered by an aircraft engine,  check this out.  It's taking the internet by storm this morning.  And we're  going to tell you about it, coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The footwear maker Crocs is closing the last of  its manufacturing plants.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  This is  interesting, the company says it's already closed its plant in Mexico and  one in Italy is going to close soon.  But it's unclear how they're going to  continue to produce their products.  </p><p>In addition, the company's executive vice president and CFO Carrie Teffner  is leaving.  The news was announced on the Earnings Call.  </p><p>Now, the company grew second quarter earnings and revenue by 4.7 percent  year over year.  Crocs became popular among hospital, restaurant workers,  boating fans and others, people that are on their feet all day, after they  launched in 2002.  Shares of Crocs are actually up 44 percent for the year.   The question is, where are they going to be making their shoes?  </p><p>All right, well, Disney is launching a sleep hotline to help parents put  their restless kids to bed.  The company even listed a sleep coach to help  with the hotline.  The Parents pick up the phone, they dial 8777-MICKEY.   They're going to be greeted by Mickey Mouse to tell the child it's time to  hit the hay.  There's other familiar voices you may know, Minnie Mouse,  Donald and Daisy Duck even Goofy.  You only get one character per call, so  choose wisely.  </p><p>Disney reported 77 percent of parents have a tough time getting the kids  down at night.  They're hoping this will maybe help them out.  Shares of  Disney are six percent higher so far for the year.  </p><p>And then there's this, how would you like to drive around in what I'm about  to show you?  This is the work of formula -- former Formula One driver  Tarso Marques, it's called the TMC Dumont.  It's got a 300-horsepower Rolls  Royce aircraft engine.  But the biggest thing, 36-inch hubless wheels,  these are the largest wheels ever made for a motorcycle.  It was recently  awarded the Best in Show at the Daytona Beach Bike Week Show.  So, there's  something for you if you want to ride around in that little puppy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really not exercise, you're sitting there, it's like a  motorcycle, right?  </p><p>CASONE:  It's like a motorcycle.  Yes, with the Rolls Royce engine, so,  that's fun.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  300 horsepower.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  (INAUDIBLE) That is -- that thing could go probably 300 miles an  hour.  Not that you would, but 300-horsepower is absurd for a motorcycle.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I think we  still need to talk about Crocs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you upset about Crocs?  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, this -- could this be the death of Crocs?  Maybe a  lot of people are rejoicing outside because they're -- they haven't  announced.  It's unclear where their production facilities are going to be.   And they just launched the croc heel.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Not too long ago.  The women that are watching today, will  you wear the croc heel?  I wonder.  I wonder if it's going to -- I don't  know.  Could this be the end?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, contract manufacturing, yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you say maybe they're outsourcing.  You're not sure?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I mean, yes.  Well, we have to assume it's contract  manufacturing somewhere since they didn't announce the end of the company  as far as I know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I want Disney to come up with a sleep line for adults.   Forget the kids.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  You want somebody to call?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I want to be able to call Mickey and say I'm having a hard time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Minnie?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I guess, it all state a Mickey fan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You can -- you can do it.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, that's what we'll do.  We'll create a new hot line for  adults.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt will join me.  We're  talking Tesla, he's weighing in on the Securities and Exchange Commission  reportedly examining Elon Musk's tweet on Tesla private.  That according to  the Wall Street Journal this morning.</p><p>Then, suffering for a selfie, a new rise in plastic surgery patients asking  to look like their Snapchat filters.  Wait until you hear this.  Back in a  minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A disturbing new trend to tell you about,  teenagers are seeking plastic surgery to look like their filtered selfies.   People suffering from Snapchat Dysmorphia look for enhanced facial features  like those produced by photo filters.  </p><p>Joining us now is assistant professor of Dermatology at Boston University,  Dr. Neelam Vashi.  Dr. Vashi, good to see you this morning.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  </p><p>What can you tell us about this disturbing trend?  </p><p>DR. NEELAM VASHI, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF DERMATOLOGY, BOSTON UNIVERSITY:   Sure.  So, Snapchat Dysmorphia is a new phenomenon that we are seeing in  clinic.  It's a phenomenon of increased scrutiny over selfies and this new  trend we're seeing that has patients seeking out cosmetic procedures to not  only improve their look in selfies but also to look like filtered and  altered versions of themselves with perfect hair and unblemished skin,  smaller noses, fuller lips, bigger eyes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is from teenagers?  </p><p>VASHI:  So, my patient population, I treat adults.  And so, what I am  seeing in clinic these days is a younger patient population.  And so, the  patients who are in their 20's to early 30's are often bringing in selfies.   They want to -- you know, firstly improve their look in a traditionally  taken selfie or look like an altered version of themself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Dr. Vashi, this is Mike Huckabee.  First of all, not everybody  can look as beautiful as I do.  So, I realize plastic surgery is necessary  for some people.  But in all honesty, this done on a teenager, would this  not even constitute some level of malpractice if teenagers are having their  faces completely reshaped for reasons that have nothing to do with any  medical reason other than they want a line taken out?  I mean, for a  teenager to make this decision, I just find that frightening.  </p><p>VASHI:  So, I don't treat teenagers for this reason.  And I think that most  cosmetic dermatologists like myself and plastic surgeons also do not treat  teenagers in this type of fashion.  Yes, for medical reasons, such as a  nasal defect or cleft lip or palette younger kids and teenagers will get  plastic surgery but nor for cosmetic reasons.  </p><p>The -- we're calling Snapchat Dysmorphia a trigger to something more  serious called body dysmorphic disorder.  And body dysmorphic disorder does  actually present in the young teens years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>VASHI:  But Patients don't present to clinics until their early 30s and  that's because they don't have the means to obtain a plastic surgery or  some kind of cosmetic procedure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VASHI:  And also, younger than 18 they need a patient consent.  Not only do  they have to have the means to have this type of treatment, they also have  to have a patient consent to obtain any -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Body dysmorphic disorder.  Kristina, they're blaming it on this  study, the study published in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery viewpoint, found  that apps like Snapchat and photo editing Facetune are to blame for this.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Facetune, so, we were talking about this before.  This is a  trend I've seen for quite some time which is why I almost don't trust  almost any photo online.  Because with some of these apps that you can but  in the app store, you can shrink your waist, you can shrink your arms, you  can change -- you can make your skin flawless, make your eye lashes longer,  make your teeth whiter, you can completely alter your online self.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Which I think is what is contributing to a lot of these  younger women and older woman wanting to change their facial features.  I  think it's horrible.  And it needs to stop.  But I guess, you got to delete  the apps or make them really, really expensive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I don't know about the apps.  I mean, the apps certainly  you can change the picture.  But to actually take the picture and go to a  dermatologist and say make me look like this, I want to have plastic  surgery, that's where the horrible part of the story comes in.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, doctor, I'm wondering in terms of the scale here, how much  of your practice is now people coming in with specifically this issue?   They want to look like they do in an app?  </p><p>VASHI:  So, I get both.  I get patients who will bring in a selfie and say  they want to improve the look of the selfie.  They say they'll have a  facial asymmetry or a groove in the face.  </p><p>And then, I also have patients who do come in with a filtered photograph.   I had one patient come in with the crown of flowers from Snapchat, saying  she wanted to look like that filtered photograph.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, that's incredible.  Dr. Vashi, thanks so much.  We  appreciate your time this morning.  We'll be watching that.</p><p>VASHI:  You're very welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, trouble for Tesla, we've got Harvey Pitt former  chairman of the SEC weighing in, coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

Good Thursday  morning.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday,  August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Show  me the money, that's the call to Tesla from Wall Street and Washington.   The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly launching a probe into  Elon Musk's tweet about going private.</p><p>My interview with former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt is coming up this morning  to talk about that.  Escalating trade tensions weighing on global  investors.  Futures edging higher this morning, Dow Industrials up 20  points.  S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ up just fractionally three points higher.   This after a mixed performance yesterday on Wall Street, the NASDAQ was the  gain top performer with the gain of four points on the session.</p><p>The Dow Industrials down 45 at the close yesterday.  In Europe this  morning, markets are mixed.  Take a look at the European indices and we are  looking at some pressure on stocks this morning, in Europe, as well.  FT- 100 down 50 points, three quarters of one percent.  The CAC quarante down a  quarter of a percent, 15 points lower.  And the DAX Index in Germany down  18 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks finished mostly higher, the standout was China,  Shanghai Composite up about two percent.  A pair of merger deals dead.

The company say investor pushback is  to blame, that deal also off for now.</p><p>The media sector in focus.  We are watching earnings from Viacom and 21st  Century Fox.  We are breaking down the numbers there.  And as you can see  both stocks are higher this morning. A front row seat to a natural  disaster.  Check out this unbelievable video taken on chairlift of a  volcano erupting.  And as you can see it, it's pretty extraordinary.  Plus,  this outfit is going viral this morning.</p><p>But Instagram user cannot figure out if it's a dress or is it a bikini.  We  report you decide.  Let us know what you think.  You send us tweet on that.   All stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network Kristina Partsinevelos is with us, the Wall  Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman is here and  former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee. </p><p>Great to see you everybody this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Good to be with you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thanks.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Looking forward to your Harvey Pitt  interview, makes sense of this Elon Musk tweets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  What are the most important questions here?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, it's funny.  You think about these public statements being  so careful and then he fires off what looked like very casual comments but  I -- but I think it is a question.  What does he need to show secure  funding?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And does this mean he's now obligated to bid for $120 now that  he's teased it on Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And where is he going to get that money?  I mean, who has  that money to acquire and take the company private? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Should be -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's $75 billion.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  What about -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  And Harvey is the guy to answer these questions. </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Institutional investors.  So (INAUDIBLE) fact that their  share stake is five percent, one of the largest after Elon Musk when you  talk about insiding -- insiders and then you have five massive  institutional accounts like T. Rowe, these guys have big part.  So it's  either going to be existing shareholders, institutional investors or some  really rich guys from Silicon Valley.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Won't be me, let me just -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Or sovereign wealth fund. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see.  We know that the shorts certainly took a hit  on that which is what he was intending.  Our top story, Musk is under the  microscope this morning.  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that  Securities and Exchange Commission is in fact probing Elon Musk's tweet to  find out if it was truthful.  This after the Tesla CEO tweeted two o days  ago this and considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share.</p><p>Funding secured and with that, the stock rallied.  Joining me right now is  former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt.  Great to see you, Harvey.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>HARVEY PITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION:  Good to be with  you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think as a former chairman of the Securities and  Exchange Commission.  What is the SEC looking at?  Tell us where you see  potential wrongdoing here.</p><p>PITT:  Well, the entire announcement was highly problematic, and  unprecedented and it's important to realize it's not the medium but it's  the message.  Going private transactions are usually announced in advance  of the market opening or after the market closing.  They're not announced  in the middle day.  Mr. Musk tweeted in the middle of the day.  In addition  it's not the CEO who announces this, but it is the board.</p><p>It's the company that makes this announcement.  But here it was the CEO.   What's more important is he stressed that he already had funding to pay  $420 a share.  But no efforts have yet been done to find out whether it's  in the shareholders best interest to take the company private, and, if so,  at what price, so all of this raises two fundamental questions.  First, was  he trying to artificially influence the price of the stock?</p><p>If he was that would be manipulation.  Second, does he really have the  money in hand? And is it binding commitment that would give him almost $70  billion in what would be at the largest going private transaction in U.S.  history?  That would be fraud if those things were not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  the SEC then needs to better understand what he was  referring to when he said $420 and funding secured.  Where would that money  come from? </p><p>PITT:  Well, it could come from either a consortium of banks, it could come  from foreign sovereign investor.  I mean -- the company did receive the big  cash infusion from Saudi Arabia the day that earnings were announced this  past week.  So it's possible that that kind of money might exist.  It's a  large amount and it would take a great deal of effort to put it together.   But it's not impossible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Having said that, it's un-- it's unwise to be tweeting about  this in middle of the day creating activity in the stock.  Do you think the  SEC is also looking at that given the fact that on the Saudi Arabia  investment news, the stock gets rallied right before this announcement.  It   was up seven percent going into tweet and then up 11 percent after the  tweet.  </p><p>PITT:  It's definitely the wrong way to do this kind of thing.  It may not  be per se illegal, but it is definitely highly problematic and it could be  illegal depending on what his intentions were when he made the  announcement.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is there a deadline here, Harvey, in terms of when he would  have to reveal his source of funding?  I mean, if he says funding secured  does the SEC want an answer now in terms of whether or not it's secured and  how long does he have to come up with whatever deal he was referring to? </p><p>PITT:  No.  I think he is required to demonstrate that at the time of his  tweet he already had a legally binding commitment for $420 a share.  That  would be the requirement, so the SEC can request or subpoena documents  asking for proof as to what his financing was and what the legal basis was  for his suggestion that it was secured which is a very strong term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very strong term.  What's the penalty, Harvey, if Musk was just  -- I don't want to say lying but coming up with an idea that perhaps wasn't  necessarily intact funding secured, what's the penalty?  </p><p>PITT:  Well, we don't of course know if the facts are yet but the penalties  are quite serious.  If he committed fraud or manipulated the market, he  would be liable both civilly for an extreme amount of damages but also he  could have potential criminal liability as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why criminal? </p><p>PITT:  Because almost every violation of the Federal securities laws is  both a civil problem that the SEC pursues and also a potential criminal  issue that the Department of Justice pursues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  And so when do you expect we'll hear more about this?   I mean, for example, when are we going to better -- have a clearer idea  whether or not there was in fact funding in place?</p><p>PITT:  I would believe that the next set of announcements will come at some  point from Tesla itself.  The company will probably organize a special  committee of independent directors who will then indicate exactly where  matters stand and whether they are going to pursue Musk's suggest that the  company go private.  I don't think we will hear from the SEC until it has  completed its investigation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about shareholder lawsuits, Harvey, are you expecting that  to also be an issue here?  Because I know that the short sellers loss at  lot of money on that as the stock went up and that's basically what I  assumed Elon Musk wanted to do because he's been sticking it to shorts and  he's, you know, uncomfortable with some of the criticism that the company  has received.</p><p>You saw a very upsetting conference call recently where he pushed back on  some of the criticism and the short sellers questioning about his burn  rate, how much cash is he burning?  So, are you expecting shareholder  lawsuits?  </p><p>PITT:  I think they are inevitable.  It's just a matter of time before  lawsuits are filed because of the enormous fluctuation in the price of the  stock.  I would think the shorts will bring a lawsuit against Mr. Musk and  Tesla.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there any precedence here, Harvey?  Have you ever seen  something like this before?  </p><p>PITT:  I've never seen anything like this kind of announcement.  I have  seen short sellers, sue certainly companies and I have certainly seen  companies sue short sellers.  It's a fact of life that if you're public,  you're going to get criticism and the shorts are people you just have to  live with. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And, obviously, that's what they are doing.  They're  critical of the company.  They're shorting the stock.  I mean, that's why  they exist.  So you're expecting the SEC to be asking questions about the  funding.  Any other questions coming from the SEC in your view?</p><p>PITT:  Well, I think they will look into why the board didn't make an  announcement sooner, why they waited for Mr. Musk to go for -- forward, and  I think they will also try to determine what kinds of behind-the-scenes  activities were taken by the company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So in other words, background because the board is saying yes,  Harvey Pitt, the board is saying yes, that Elon Musk has discussed the  potential of going private with us before.  But there is no mention of any  $420 price.  </p><p>PITT:  No.  And where that price comes from is very hard to understand.  It  may be a very good price, but in terms of an economic analysis it may turn  out that it's not as good a price as should be paid for this company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  I mean, when you're talking about $420 a share,  that's like $70 billion, right?  $75 billion? </p><p>PITT:  Yes.  And unprecedented amount of money, it truly is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Harvey, it's great to see  you again.  Hope you'll come back soon.  Thanks so much for your insights  this morning.  </p><p>PITT:  Sure.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Harvey Pitt joining us there.  And we'll take a short break.   When we come back.  The Tribune Media-Sinclair deal is dead.  Tribune says  that the $3.9 deal can no longer move forward after comments from SEC  Chairman Ajit Pai.  The latest coming up there.  Then half dress, half  bikini?  The new dress causing confusion online.  That's coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tribute Media called off its buyout by Sinclair  Broadcast Group.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Two deals that are dead  today, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We got two deals, that is  right, Maria.  First to Tribune, they've terminated their $3.9-billion deal  and they're suing Sinclair for breach of contract for not doing enough to  win approval from regulators.  You may remember last month, SEC Chairman  Ajit Pai said he had serious concerns about the merger.  Take a look at the  stocks, shares of Sinclair right now, they are lower in the premarket  trading.</p><p>Down more than three percent.  Tribune Media, not really trading it but  shares down more than 20 percent so far this year.  So two stocks to watch  now.  We're also watching shares of Rite-Aid right now.  The stock plunging  more than 10 percent in the premarket.  The sell-off coming after Rite-Aid  and Albertsons called off their $24 billion merger.  Some big Rite-Aid  shareholders plan to vote against the deal today.</p><p>Rite-Aid and Albertsons wanted to team up in order to compete better  against CBS, Walgreens and potentially as you know Amazon has been trying  to get into the pharmaceutical business as well. </p><p>All right.  Check this out.  A volcanic eruption in Chile gets a rider on a  ski list, the front row seat to the action all on tape.  The eruption shot  up a 5,000 foot column of dust and ash as he was filming all of this with  his cell phone.  This comes from a volcano complex that's in the Andes  Mountain but pretty incredible pictures and pretty close.  </p><p>And finally there is this.  We've seen some pretty weird fashion trends in  the last year, upside down shorts, plastic jeans.  Well, here is a new one.   This is a bikini and it's a dress, all in one.  This comes from the fashion  brand, PrettyLittleThing.  And after having one of their models wear it on  Instagram picture, people started to freak out.</p><p>There it is.  We'll let you decide.  Looks like she couldn't decide on what  to wear so she cut both in half and sewed them together.  Maybe.  Here's  another comment.  She's going to dinner, clubbing and swimming all at once.   Yes.  The whole thing goes for $35.00 maybe.  Maria, you could wear it with  some crack heels?  You know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  That would be an interesting pairing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure would.  So is it a -- is it a dress or is it a bikini?</p><p>CASONE:  It's both.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's both.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Because --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Why not have both?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're getting your money for it.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Remember the black or blue dress or is it blue or white  dress? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Same thing.  But I know about you.  I think, Governor, it  would look better own you with man-bun, crack heels.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Pretty sure it wouldn't.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Going to be strong with the man-bun.  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You got to really loving this man-bun.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- I would feel naked.  Oh.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  If I wear that without the man-bun I would just feel just naked.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You thought of either of us wearing that is something that there  are television sets across America that are going to be off mode.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't want that.  We don't want that.  Coming up.  Viacom is  reporting quarterly earnings this morning.  We're breaking down those  numbers coming up next.  Big week for media.  Then overhauling the Oscars.   Details on new changes coming to the academy awards quarterly including the  addition of a popular film category, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Both parent company of the Fox Business Network, 21st Century  Fox quarterly profit nearly doubled due to cable and film strength.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching the stock  and the overall market this morning.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  we talked about 21st Century Fox, our parent and it beat on top and bottom  line.  The analyst have to optimism there as you noted in those particular  areas and that's exactly what came.  In fact it did better than expected.   Deadpool 2, the strength of Fox News just among the reasons why we did see  it beat the 18 percent year over year.</p><p>Revenue increase, strong double-digit growth across all the segments and  the new and obviously what happened, the transaction, Disney and the new  Fox transactions, that -- they say unlocked enormous shareholder value.  In  fact when you take a look at the stock over the fiscal year it's about 75  percent gain, that clearly outpaces the S&amp;P 500.  And the media group which  actually has declined over that period.</p><p>Of course, there's still locked in the -- in the bidding war with CMSCA and  that would be Comcast, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You check that?</p><p>PETALLIDES:  We'll watch that.  So that is the big difference.  Also, last  but not least, we're taking a look at Viacom this morning and that came in  profit top revenue fell and there was the slump in ad sales which fell  short.  And that number which I did talk about the increased shareholder  value I did get from the 21st Century Fox headlines themselves.  Back to  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic.  Thank you so much.  Nicole, we'll be watching  all of that.  Switching gears to the censorship of conservatives on social  media.  It has the attention of lawmakers now including House Majority  Leader Kevin McCarthy who talked to us about this as well as House  Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes who want - both want answers on action.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  I want to see bias  stop, especially going after conservatives.  I mean, just look at three  points that showed up in Google right before the primary election in  California.  The party of Lincoln, the party of Reagan, that's not what it  said, it said Nazism.  </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I don't  know what Twitter is up to.  It sure looks to me like they're censoring  people and they ought -- they ought to stop it and we're looking at any  legal remedies that we can go through.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So that was Devin Nunes and Kevin McCarthy.  Kevin  McCarthy was talking about remember right before the primary elections in  California.  You Googled GOP California and in the search results got  Naziism.  Your thoughts, Governor.  I know this is an important topic to  you. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it really is an important topic.  We talk about Russian  interference.  I'm worried about social media interference.  How are they  manipulating elections, how are they manipulating the information and the  question comes as somebody who doesn't really like government regulation  and intervention, we're headed there.</p><p>We're going to get it because social media platforms are no longer just  social media where people chit-chat about their yoga classes and their  daughter's wedding, they're now the place where people get news, they are  public utilities just like electricity, water, cable television and  telephone.  And so government is going to step in at some point.  I think  sooner than later and they're going to regulate them.</p><p>The social media companies will rue the day when they started favoring one  point of view over another.  But here's why that matters.  Would Americans  tolerate it if you paid differently for your electricity, your water or  your telephone based on your political view of where you went to church?   You would be outraged.  Liberal conservative or independent, you'd be  outraged.  That's what we're seeing today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's also so-called, shadowed banning, James, I mean --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I mean, I had put out a tweet about James Clapper  basically admitting on CNN that President Obama directed the Intelligence  Agencies to launch investigation for the special counsel on the Trump- Russia and I -- and I -- and basically Jim Clapper -- James Clapper  admitted it on CNN.  So I tweeted that out, it got no life, no -- and I  thought, you know, this is something that I know my followers care about.</p><p>And I felt to myself, hmm, is that shadow banning?  I don't know.  I wonder  if my followers saw that tweet or if it just went on deaf ears.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, we've had a bunch of these teases where certainly  conservative viewpoints seem to be suppressed.  The answers from Silicon  Valley generally are often not denials but sort of saying, well, it wasn't  intentional, it's the algorithm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But somebody programs the algorithm change.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, I agree.  I think there's enough ear to say there is a  problem of bias.  It's -- I think it -- I'm hoping first there's a consumer  remedy, we've seen user growth surprisingly kind of flattened --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  In these recent earnings reports but I'm hoping it can be  disciplined either through customer behavior or maybe it has to be private  litigation as opposed to creating a new Federal internet regulator and I  think that's the big danger here is that the big tech giants are trying to  cut a deal with both parties in Washington that gives them liability  protection but it also sets up the Federal Trade Commission to have huge  powers over the internet.</p><p>And this could -- this is actually a deal that could happen, very quickly,  I think, and that is the anger I see for innovation because the utility  model you don't get a lot of innovation out of the phone company, the water  company, et cetera.  So I'm hoping there is a market remedy for this and  maybe consumers, you know, are starting to say I want -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I mean, I wish there was a market remedy, I would much rather  see it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But these companies are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some competition.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- hearing the bells.  I mean, they're bringing it upon  themselves because they are actively suppressing the points of view of  certain people and when they do that, the market is going to rise up and I  think -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  What about Alex Jones and certain hate groups, they're  censoring certain things that are clearly fake, if you want to say it, fake  news and he is discounting Sandy Hook and the children and families there.   So when he's -- when somebody is putting out inaccurate facts that have  been proven to be wrong then why not get rid of him?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, that's a fun --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, this is why we're talking about it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- user organization.  But of course, these social media  companies have enjoyed a lot of legal protection on the basis that they are  not news organizations, that it's an open platform anyone in public.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Now that they're making those kind of judgments, they better be  ready for different treatment --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And the first amendment protects stupidity, it protects outrages  speech.  I don't like it but it does protect it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  We got the PPI on the  other side of this break.  Stay with us.  Producer Price Index, we'll take  a look at inflation.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday,  August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  We  are just getting the Producer Price Index out.  It is unchanged.  A gain of  three-tenths of a percent was expected, and that's what it looks like this  morning, unchanged on the Producer Price Index.  Not a major reaction from  markets this morning.  We've been looking at a fractional move all morning.   Dow Industrials right now up 20 points, S&amp;P 500 up three, and the NASDAQ up  4-1/2.  Initial jobless claims also out right now, down 6,000.  </p><p>Global markets action in Europe this morning, take a look at European  indices, obviously down across the board.  FT-100 down 50 points, that's  two-thirds of one percent.  The CAC Quarante is down a quarter of a  percent, 16 points lower, and the DAX Index in Germany is flat, down six  points.  In Asia Overnight, the standout was China.  Chinese markets  bouncing back on hopes to the stimulus against U.S. tariffs.  Shanghai  Composite up almost two percent.  And PPI is out, unchanged on the session  versus a two-tenths of a percent estimate, James Freeman.  Your thoughts on  where we are on inflation.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Pretty benign environment right now, the economy is  humming, fast growth but inflation not yet raging even though the Feds  still has this huge balance sheet they acquired in the wake of the  financial crisis.  So, I think the hope here is that as we transition back  to the real economy, we can do it without an inflation surge.  And so far  so good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And year-over-year, Kristina, on inflation on the PPI is 3.3  percent, very much in step with what we've been -- what we've been  expecting.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.  And if anything, maybe this can add to the argument  that wage growth hasn't been climbing higher.  So, now that inflation is  staying relatively flat, that's OK because of wage growth not climbing high  enough or lasted a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wages have just been creeping up, the 2.8 percent higher  year-over-year on wages, we'll keep following that and any impact on  markets this morning.  We have breaking news right now out of North Korea.   North Korea says that if the Trump administration, \"adheres to all  scenarios,\" then there's no chance of progress on denuclearization.  Blake  Burman is live at the White House this morning with more on that.  Blake,  good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria, good morning to you as well.  This obviously raises more questions  about just how intent North Korea is on resolving the issue of  denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  The headline that is coming out this  morning is that the North Koreans say that if the Trump administration  adheres to old scenarios, it cannot expect any progress on  denuclearization, something that the White House certainly will watch  throughout the day.  And of course, the upcoming weeks and months as the  President right now is in Bedminster, New Jersey for a week off on what the  White House is characterizing as a working vacation.</p><p>Meantime, here in Washington later today, the Vice President Mike Pence  will lay out what the administration hopes to deploy in the upcoming years  that being a sixth branch of the military, the Space Force.  The President  said earlier this summer that he wanted the military to build out this new  branch of government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now, our destiny beyond the  Earth is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national  security.  When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely  have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in  space.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  The Air Force already though has a robust presence patrolling  outer space especially as it relates to the use and deployment of  satellites.  That responsibility would go to the Space Force which would be  responsible for conducting war plans for space, but there are many  questions here, including how the military would be reshaped.  The defense  secretary James Mattis admitting earlier this week that they are still  trying to work out on how the actual organization would take place within  the military.  By the way, Maria, there is also the congressional issue on  this one as well because a sixth branch of the military would need  Congressional approval and, of course, Congressional funding.  We will hear  from the Vice President later today, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman with the  latest there.  Joining us right now is Fox News Legal Analyst and author of  the new book, \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton  and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett is with us.  Gregg, great to see  you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  And as I read the title and as I report  on what has teken place in the 2016 election.  It seems exactly accurate in  terms of what happened.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.  Well, you would know because you have done so much to  further the story yourself.  I wrote this book because actually I became  incensed in outraged, the top officials at the FBI and the Department of  Justice were abusing their positions of power to subvert the rule of law,  and undermine the democratic process, and I think I lay out a fairly  persuasive case here of the facts, the evidence, and the law, that this was  a cesspool of corruption.  And by the way, it still is, because they  continue to cover it up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the latest has a real focus on Bruce Ohr, the number three  guy at the DOJ, whose wife worked for Fusion GPS.</p><p>JARRETT:  I mean, talk about an incestuous collection of corrupt acts.  You  know, the FBI knew that Christopher Steele, who phonied up the anti-Trump  dossier, was already on the payroll of Hillary Clinton, he was on the  payroll of the FBI.  And when the FBI finally fired Christopher Steele,  their regulations say you can't have any more contact with him, so they  were very devious.  They used Bruce Ohr at the Department of Justice as the  conduit, the intermediary.  The FBI continued to receive Christopher Steele  information, spying on Trump after he was inaugurated for several months  thereafter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know, what gets me, Governor, is, you know, it feels  like the left in their hatred of President Trump, so much they've thrown  out all ideals, they've thrown out values of, you know, the law of the  land, and it was OK to spy on Carter Page, oh, because it's Trump.  You  know, it's OK to abuse your power at the top of the FBI, oh, it's Trump.   It's incredible.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it is incredible.  And Gregg, congratulations on the book.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It reads like a novel.  The frightening thing is that it's not  fiction, it's fact, and you lay out an incredibly compelling case in a  chronological order, which I think is a great value to the reader.  So,  it's a -- it's a powerful book.  We've seen the weaponization of the  agencies of our federal government going after a presidential candidate in  a fashion we've never seen before, the highest levels.  But when they are  using their own power in this way, to create a false dossier, on which the  warrant is obtained, legally, does that not put them with the fruit of the  poisonous tree, and so that whatever they end up would be able to be pushed  back because they got it illegally?</p><p>JARRETT:  Yes, absolutely, under the exclusionary rule, it would be  excluded as evidence.  The law enforcers became the lawbreakers.  And  what's outrageous is --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's powerful statement.</p><p>JARRETT:  Yes, they're not being investigated and prosecuted.  I lay out  myriad of potential crimes here, by people like Andrew McCabe, James Comey,  and you know, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and the list goes on and on, things  like abusive power which is a felony.  Obstruction of justice, they  obstructed their own investigation to clear Hillary Clinton.  And on the  same day they cleared her, Comey is standing in front of cameras, his FBI  is meeting secretly in London with Christopher Steele to begin the frame  job on President Trump, then-candidate Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  And you say that this all started when then-FBI director  Jim Comey cleared Hillary Clinton in the e-mail server probe back in 2016.   Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  Although, we did not find clear  evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws  governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that  they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly- classified information.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, while they were putting together a narrative about Donald  Trump, they were very easy on Hillary Clinton.  And they basically did not  investigate.</p><p>JARRETT:  Absolutely.  And it was one deception, and I believe, lie after  another from James Comey as you saw there on that very day.  He had  originally written it, Hillary Clinton committed crimes.  He wrote it down  twice, gross negligence, but his staff said, well, you can't clear her if  you put that in your statement, so they sit down at Peter Strzok's computer  and they expunge from Comey's statements, those incriminating words and  other allegations of criminality by Hillary Clinton.  The swamp didn't want  to be drained.  And a potential President Trump jeopardized their ambitions  and positions of power, so they sought to damage his candidacy, and when  they didn't do that and he was elected, they sought to undo the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  And the -- when you talk about the swamp going after now- President Trump, but then-candidate Trump, do we have a sense yet of  exactly when this began?  There seems to have been I think a real challenge  for Congressional investigators figuring out when was the real beginning of  whether it was intelligence or law enforcement assets descending on the  Trump campaign?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is what Devin Nunes is investigating right now, what  happened before actual launch of the investigation, which, of course, was  July 2016?</p><p>JARRETT:  Some of the documents that Devin Nunes is trying to get his hands  on that Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray will not hand over the origins  of the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, it looks to me like, the FBI  began spying on the Trump campaign seven months before they formally signed  the papers launching the investigation.  And by the way, when they signed  those papers, they violated their own FBI guidelines, there was no probable  cause, no evidence of crimes, no plausible intelligence for  counterintelligence probe, they broke the law and the rules.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think there'll be any accountability here?  </p><p>JARRETT:  Not with Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein at the helm of the  Department of Justice.  And that's a sad commentary on our system of  justice right now.  But Sessions is utterly feckless and Rosenstein, I  think, is trying to continue to cover up his own wrongdoing.  This is a guy  who should have recused himself the moment he appointed Mueller.  You can't  be a prosecutor and a key witness all rolled into one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because he OK'd the fourth FISA warrant.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's right.  And you can only do that when you have new  evidence.  The best we can tell so far, they have no new evidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there wasn't any evidence from the get-go, it was just the  dossier.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's right.  And the FBI knew that the dossier was totally  fabricated.  You can read it online, I've read it a hundred times.  I never  failed to laugh.  You know, it is the work of an amateur dime novelist in  junior high school.  And even Christopher Steele who wrote it, said, in  court papers under oath in Great Britain, which I dug up, and it's in the  book, that it's unverifiable because it was a guy who told a guy, who told  the guy, who told me.  Triple, quadruple hearsay based on anonymous  sources.  You can't use that sort of thing in a court of law.  Get the FBI  and DOJ, use it to gain a warrant to wiretap -- that's abuse of power to  fraud on the court.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this is one political party spying on the -- on their  opponent, there on the left.</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.  And where's the outrage over Hillary Clinton paying for  all of this?  Now, that is a violation of the law.  The Trump Tower  meeting, perfect legal.  All the media has to do is read the federal  campaign election act.  Foreign nationals may participate in American  political campaigns and providing any information is not a thing of value.   But stonewalling to Congress is something I do not understand why it  continues.  They have a constitutional obligation to give Congress what it  wants.  And Congress should use the power of the purse and cut off the  money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Into the oversight agency.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's the only way to have.  Yes.  Absolutely.  But I blame  Congress because for decades, whenever the Department of Justice and FBI  didn't want to hand over documents, they just said we're not going to do  it, and Congress never took action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>JARRETT:  So, it's been habitual.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, the President could order all of this declassified.</p><p>JARRETT:  And he should.  I think he is considering it, but you know, there  are -- there are those advising him not to.  He should absolutely order  declassification of a FISA application documents, the Gang of Eight  documents and the origin documents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The American people have a right to know and they want to know.   \"The Russia Hoax,\" is the book, \"The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary  Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  Great to see you.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have breaking news right now we want to get to, Russian  Foreign Ministry is saying this, Moscow will work on retaliatory measures  in response to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia, it's according to  Reuters this morning.  The U.S. imposed new sanctions tied to the nerve  agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter, that of course,  breaking this week.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Uber and Lyft hitting a roadblock in New York  City.  The city council voted to limit the number of vehicles on the  streets.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to  weigh in.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  You  know, I think there's a backlash coming to this thing.  As you say, the  Mayor of New york is imposing a cap on the number of Uber and Lyft cars  allowed in the city.  In my opinion, that leaves a lot of wait times and to  higher prices.  But there's something else going on here, yellow cabs have  often been accused (INAUDIBLE) regular taxicabs in New York City often  accused of not picking up people of color because of their color.  Uber has  a way out.  </p><p>Uber doesn't care what color you are, Uber doesn't care what your ethnicity  is, they pick you up, it's all electronic.  Well, that is going to be  capped at the -- basically at the doings of the willing of the taxi  industry.  I think there's a backlash coming here from the minorities.   Worse yet, I think there's going to be -- I think New York City will be  used as a template as a test case for other cities in America and around  the world, which want to fence in Uber, because they are devastating the  local taxi industry.  I think this is the wrong decision on so many levels,  and I hope it's withdrawn, I don't think it will be but it should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meaning there's a lot of backlash because, you know, look what  happened to the taxis.  The prices of the medallion plummeted.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, the medallion was 2 -- was 1.3 million in 2013, and now it's  between 160 and 250,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's a huge loss of capital for the taxi owners and this is  their way of pushing back.  But I think the pushback is very detrimental to  many, many people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that.  Stu, I know you'll have more on  that in about 10 minutes.  We'll see you then top of the hour \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.   Join Stuart in the next few minutes.  But first, overhauling the Oscars,  details on the new changes coming to the Academy Awards including the  addition of a popular film category, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  -- arts and sciences cutting  the link to the show and introducing a category for outstanding achievement  in popular film.  Critics have complained that the broadcast is too long,  too boring, too political, too condescending -- oh, maybe that's just my  view.</p><p>Audiences would appear to agree, giving me telecast, its lowest ratings on  record last February when a mere 26.5 million people tuned in.  Remember,  the Super Bowl got 107 million.  Academy CEO Dawn Hudson said the board is,  quote, committed to producing an entertaining show in three hours.  Wow.   Three -- it takes you three hours?  The move was met with a frenzy of  criticism, particularly from in the street journalists.  Atlantic reporter  David Sims called the (INAUDIBLE) award, the Black Panther memorial award  for movie that were afraid won't get a big picture -- best picture  nominations.  Other called it lazy, ham-handed.  In recent years, hit films  like \"Wonder Woman\" have been snubbed by Oscar, although blockbusters from  the past like \"Gone With the Wind\" were heavily recognized.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, good changes?</p><p>WILLIS:  Not the right changes necessary (INAUDIBLE) always a good idea.   Can we do this in like 30 minutes or something?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three hours.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You can get a kidney replacement in less time and it's not as  painful as watching the Oscars.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on the changes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  People like -- I remember when I was a kid, I used to love  watching it because you'd never know who would win and you'd sit around  together, and then the outfits, so I don't think that they're really going  to shorten it that much, but they have lost viewership, for sure, because  there's --</p><p>WILLIS:  It's brutal.  I always (INAUDIBLE) 4 million people every single  night, OK?  I mean, think about it.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  But also the performance.  The performances and the actors  and the comedians in between sets, those are -- that's pretty decent stuff,  and sometimes there's controversy that comes out of it, so that's what I  would watch for.  I don't watch it, but --</p><p>WILLIS:  I thought you'd see the fashion and would be happy.  That's all I  really need.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think beyond the suffocating politics, they just -- you have  too many movies that almost no one in the television audience has seen so I  understand what they're trying to do here.  Maybe they ought to just  recognize some of these films that a lot of Americans think were the best  pictures: \"American Sniper\" -- I mean, most people would say that's a great  movie, right?</p><p>WILLIS:  Right.  Well, this popcorn award, that's what they're trying to  do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The popular film.</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes, popular film.  But you know, that's sort of like a ghetto for  popular -- you know, like, though, it should really win the major  categories.  You know what I mean?  It should be elevated to the level of  \"Gone With the Wind,\" lots of very popular movies in previous years won  those awards, not anymore.</p><p>FREEMAN:  People don't watch the Oscars, though, because they want a  political lecture that insults half of America.  They want to -- they want  to escape from all of that and have entertainment.

Governor Huckabee?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I want to say thanks to James Freeman for writing a book called  \"Borrowed Time,\" and giving really powerful insight into the financial  crisis, I think it's a very, very important book, people need to read it,  and I hope they will.  James, I want it to be a bestseller.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks, Governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \" Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and Bailouts at  Citi.\"  Check out the book.

Saudi  Arabia and Canada, the relations going on between both those countries,  Canada foreign affairs minister tweeting about the human rights -- two  human rights activists in Saudi.

With the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor  James Freeman is here.  And former Arkansas Governor, Republican  Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee.  Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be with you Maria, thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  I'm so happy you're here for three hours.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Great to be back.  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Governor, great to see you.  And you.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congratulations on the book.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Oh, thank you.</p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:   Woo-hoo.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"Borrowed Times\" -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- \"Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and Bailouts at Citi.\"</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Oh, right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Just published a couple of days ago.  Why did you choose Citi  to write a book, James?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well it's the classic too big to fail bank.  It was -- my co- author Vern McKinley who brought the idea to me and the lesson here is  really amazing.  You had a really strong healthy vibrant institution.  It  was so strong it even bailed out the government at times when it was a  completely free institution with no taxpayer backing.  Then --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- about a hundred years ago we get the Federal Reserve, we get  the safety net, taxpayer standing behind it and it's a series of crisis  ever since.  So it's a -- it's a real lesson about the corrosive nature of  the safety net.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's -- and it's an important book because it's important  to tell us exactly what happened in history.  \"Borrowed Time\" is the -- is  the name.  Congrats to you, we're going to talk a lot about your new book - -</p><p> FREEMAN:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- this morning James Freeman.  First though our top story  right now and that is Wall Street and Washington telling Tesla, \"Show me  the money.\"  The Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating  where the CEO Elon Musk's tweet yesterday was truthful.</p><p> He tweeted Tuesday this, \"I'm considering taking Tesla private at $420 a  share.  Funding secured.\"  Joining us right now is Mainstay Capital  Management CEO, Chief Investment Strategist David Kudla.  David, good to  see you this morning.</p><p> DAVID KUDLA, CEO, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I'm glad you're here because you shorted Tesla over the  past two days and you've been watching this company and covering it for a  long time, your reaction to what has taken place David.</p><p> KUDLA:  Well, you know, if we look at what's happened over the past couple  of days the stock never approached $420, the apparent deal price.  It  reached the high of $387 after that tweet came out two days ago, in  premarket today it's more than $20.00 off that price.</p><p> So the market is losing faith in this deal.  And if we look at the merits  of it, I own a very small company by comparison, if I were going to sell it  and arrive at a price, it would take more than a week of discussion to do  that.  If I were doing the largest LBO in history they said they talked  about, the board talked about this last week to arrive at a price in secure  funding, I think it would take a lot longer than one week.  It's just hard  to believe this is real.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean he said funding secured which really was a head- scratcher because you're talking about something like $75 billion, right,  to get to a $420 price.</p><p> KUDLA:  Right.  Right. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So how do you -- so you're questioning whether or not the  funding is secured.</p><p> KUDLA:  Yes.  I think everybody is questioning that.  And now as we know,  the SEC is questioning it and why all the mystery?  If he knows the price  or Tesla knows the price and why all the mystery on who is the buyer or who  are the buyers?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It was pretty clear yesterday that the Securities and  Exchange Commission was going to be knocking on the company's door after  that tweet James.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think this may be a question for a Securities lower but  it may come down to -- a lot is going to hinge on this word secure.  Does  this mean he made a few calls and he was confident he could get the money  or does he probably need a letter from a bank saying, \"You have the X  billion?\"</p><p> KUDLA:  Well James, if you look at the details that came out later on the  blog and on the memo and rather than adding more detail or more certainty,  it was a little bit more -- a little bit more vague. </p><p> You know, he talked about -- it almost look like more of a letter of intent  or a plan to have a plan rather than adding more certainty to the original  tweet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Kristina, we know that he's wanting to stick it to  the shorts for some time.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.  And right now the latest numbers of the shorts  consist of 20 percent of the float.  But I wanted to focus on Saudi Arabia  given that the Financial Times yesterday came out or two days ago came out  with the fact that they increased their share of Tesla or the portfolio of  Tesla.</p><p> And so isn't that a sign of confidence and that possibly other sovereign  wealth funds like Norway for example given they have $1 trillion, couldn't  they be one of the backers of Tesla?  </p><p> KUDLA:  There is -- there's a lot of money out there sloshing around  whether it's sovereign wealth funds, whether it's private equity, looking  for deals.  But the question is, who's going to invest in this company?</p><p> You know, a lot of times they're looking for companies that are cash-rich  or have at least they have positive cash flows.  This is a company that has  a negative cash flow, herding for money.  Even if this deal were to be done  needs more financing.  So who's going to do this deal?  They've had talk --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think this is just a mistake?  I mean, was this just a  mistake on Elon Musk's part?  What the heck happened.</p><p> KUDLA:  We don't know.  He -- you know, he's done things on Twitter before,  he had a prank on April Fool's Day, he's made jokes on Twitter.  We really  don't know yet.  But we know -- but we don't know anything more about the  deal and that's odd.  It was odd how it came about --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p> KUDLA:  -- and it's odd that we don't know anything further.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Governor, your thoughts?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well David, I sometimes wonder, are we taking Twitter too  seriously?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I mean, my thoughts now it's --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That would be right.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  -- the president tweets something, Elon Musk tweets something  and it becomes the focus of a major federal investigation.  Maybe people  ought to step back, lighten up and say, \"Twitter is for amusement.  It is  not necessarily a declaration of some legal document.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Then he shouldn't have put the company up for sale on Twitter.</p><p> KUDLA:  It's a -- but he said --</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:   And then what about the president who constantly --</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well I think a lot of these tweets are for amusement as well.  </p><p> KUDLA:  But Mike --</p><p> FREEMAN:  I think we really should not the company has said that invest --  they've officially said investors can look to his Twitter feed for  additional information about the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> HUCKABEE:  That's right.  They said this --</p><p> FREEMAN:  It's official channel.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, an official channel.</p><p> KUDLA:  They said it's an official channel and investors, Mike, investors  traded on this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KUDLA:  People put money on stake based on what the company has said is an  official news outlet for additional information on the company.</p><p> People went long on those two days, shorts went in and covered positions,  there was people that traded on this information.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> KUDLA:  So they took it seriously.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which is why the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking  into it right now.</p><p> KUDLA:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are the legal implications?  I mean, we're going to speak  with Harvey Pitt coming up in the program, he's my special guest, former  Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  But from your  standpoint as an investor, what do you want to see happen now?  </p><p> KUDLA:  We'll --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been shorting it the last two days, right?  But you were  not short going into it.</p><p> KUDLA:  We had -- we've had short positions on.  We've traded the  volatility in Tesla because as the stock has been hiked up and gone up,  it's been a good short.  The air comes out of the stock, you can cover a  profit.  We play the volatility in the stock.</p><p> And we think it was an opportunity to short the last couple of days because  we don't think this would be able to go through.  Even if there is secured  funding there's a lot of ways that a deal like this can fall apart. </p><p> Then you go back to the company fundamentals which we just don't think are  that good.  There's a liquidity problem, there's a sustained profitability  problem, and you got a lot of competition online -- or coming online in the  next one, two, three, four years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's China.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  Competitive market and we've been raising a lot of  questions.  But shouldn't it be noted that they do seem to have lately been  hitting their production targets, David?  I mean on an operating basis,  isn't there a better story on this company than there has been?</p><p> KUDLA:  I guess it depends how you look at the numbers.  They built 5,000  cars for one week at the end of June by pulling out all the stops and using  parts that were desperately needed for service parts.</p><p> We have people waiting for service parts for weeks and months.  All the  measures that are taking using a tent for their third general assembly  line, manufacturing process --</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well what's wrong with tent?  I mean, if that's how you build the  cars who cares what the -- what the roof is?</p><p> KUDLA:  If you -- for people that know automotive manufacturing that walk  through those plans or look at how these cars are being built, the mistakes  that are being made, you know, this is not as Elon Musk said  revolutionizing manufacturing.</p><p> They're having a lot of problems with building cars, having a lot of  problems in execution and now, you know, Elon Musk talked about production  hell, now they're facing warranty service hell and customers are having  problems with the service centers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> KUDLA:  There are a lot of issues and once they work through that, they've  got all this competition coming online.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And somebody said yesterday when we were talking about  this that China wants to own this market, the E.V. market, electric --</p><p> KUDLA:  They've made a national priority.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  Let me ask you about the price of the stock,  it's at $370 right now, you've been shorting it.  What do you think is the  right price for this company?</p><p> KUDLA:  A lot lower.  In premarket we're down to about $365, $362 --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's $365 right now.  So what's the -- what's the right price?  </p><p> KUDLA:  Well look, Elon Musk himself has said its real car company.  People  want to say it's an energy company that builds cars or it's a technology  (INAUDIBLE) cars.  Ninety percent of the revenues come from building and  selling cars.</p><p> Car companies trade -- around the world trade at multiple of six to twelve.   P.E. multiple six to twelve and right now Tesla trades at a multiple of  infinity.  OK.  Some day if they do get the profitability they won't trade  at a multiple of $300 or $400.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow. </p><p> KUDLA:  They trade a multiple a lot lower.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> KUDLA:  So the stock price should be well below $400, well below $300.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well below $300 as well.  OK.  So we'll watch that.  Broader  market, recent technology route on Facebook earnings, the sector has  bounced back but we're looking at real volatility.  Would you buy any of  these names in tech?</p><p> KUDLA:  We are still strong supporters of technology.  We had a great first  quarter earnings, second quarter with more than 80 percent of companies  reporting, technology earnings are coming in very strong, again, about 31  percent earnings growth.</p><p> With everything going on with tax reform, business new regulation, CAPEX is  strong, tech -- we want second growth stories in this economy, technology  we think is the best place to be for secular growth.  We think that story  keeps getting better.</p><p> We want to own tech, it's our favorite sector this year, continues to do  well, we -- and we -- it's continued to do well for us and we think it's a  leadership sector as we go forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll leave it there.  David, we'll be watching that  as well as Tesla.  Good to see you this morning, thanks so much.  </p><p> KUDLA:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  David Kudla.  Be sure to tune in at 8:00a.m. Eastern for my  interview with the former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  Harvey Pitt, my special guest this morning.  So we will talk about what the  implications are as a result of that tweet on Tesla with Harvey Pitt.</p><p> First though coming up, fear and panic, powerful aftershocks rocking  Indonesia this morning just days after a deadly earthquake killed hundreds  of people.  We have the very latest there. </p><p> And then the deal is off, Rite Aid and Albertsons abandoning their merger,  why things broke down?  Next right here, back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Aftershocks are slamming Indonesia this morning  following a series of deadly earthquake.  Cheryl Casone on headlines now,  Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Well Maria, good morning.  Since Sunday, more than 350 aftershocks  have kept survivors on edge.  The death toll on Indonesia's tourist island  of Lombok has surpassed 300 after the latest earthquake.  </p><p> A 5.9 magnitude tremor shook Lombok less than a week after the area was  devastated by Sunday's 7.0 quake.  As rescue efforts continue that death  toll we should say is expected to rise.</p><p> Well back here at home, another police officer is in the hospital after  being shot  This time Jacksonville, Florida.  Official say the suspect was  walking by a Waffle House where he fired at a passing patrol car.  No one  in the car was hurt, police chased the suspect, a gun fight ensued.  </p><p> One officer and the suspect had been hospitalized both with gunshot wounds  but neither suffered luckily like threatening injuries.</p><p> Well, Albertsons and Rite Aid are calling off their $24 billion merger,  this comes after shareholders complain that the takeover undervalued Rite  Aid.  Albertsons says it's unwilling to change the terms of the merger and  Rite Aid said its committed to moving forward as a standalone company.  The  deal would have created a new company with around $83 billion in annual  sales.</p><p> And then there's this, a major discrepancy in how much oil the Saudis are  producing.  The Wall Street Journal reports the Saudis have told OPEC it  cut output in July but estimates from the U.S. government and independent  agencies say that they boosted production amounted to a huge difference of  as much as half a million barrels a day.</p><p> And the Journal says that this news causing a lot of confusion in the  markets about, Maria, how much oil is actually reaching the consumer.   Another change in what Saudi is today, that is for sure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sure is and that's why we're seeing oil prices.  I mean,  what a move yesterday.  I was reading actually in the Journal, oil prices  dropping significantly yesterday.  Your thoughts on what's going on this  morning in terms of oil James?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  It seems like there's kind of unexpected inventory glut --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- it's happening while U.S. production after surging seems to be  kind of falling off a little.  But I guess looking long-term I just get  very optimistic seeing as how number of reports out this week showing the  U.S. is going to be a net exporter of petroleum within five years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Pretty incredible.  Yes.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Complete energy independence basically somewhere in the 2020,  2021 timeframe.  And it's the -- this fracking revolution we've been  talking about it for years but it has profound very positive effects for  the economy.</p><p> PARTSINEVOLOS:  Did you see -- I think it was a few days ago, maybe in the  last week that Texas would be the third -- very soon the third largest  country to be -- to export oil just given how much is coming out of there.</p><p> And, yes, I think it's definitely going to climb -- I think the United  States will fill the glut.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  One of the priorities of the Trump Administration.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well -- and you're going to be in a lot of trouble with people  in Texas, they think they're the number one economy in the world.  So just  so you know.</p><p> PARTSINEVOLOS:  I think the number one in the United States for sure and  it's just talking about oil, I'm not talking about the economy.  There's so  much oil they're getting out there, they're doing quite well.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes they are.  But I do think that what James is saying is  incredibly important that we're independent.  Many people laugh when we  talked about America being energy independent within 10 years but we're  already there.</p><p> And it's a significant ability not only to provide energy, it's a national  security issue.  The fact that we don't have to go hand-in-hand to the  Saudis and beg for them to be nice to us when they've been financing  terrorism around the world for decades.  This is huge.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it is huge.  All right.  We'll keep talking about that.   We'll take a short break.  When we come back, a man is arrested in  connection with one of wildfires that's scorching Southern California.   We'll tell you why police believe he did it.  We'll bring you that next.</p><p> And then too big to fail over and over again, a new book by our contributor  today, James Freeman.  Taking a deep dive into Citi Groups crisis field  history.  We're going to talk about that when we come right back.  There's  the stock at $72.89, back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big bank, even bigger story.  James Freeman is  out with a new book chronically the history of one of America's largest  financial institutions.</p><p> The book is titled, \"Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and  Bailouts at Citi.\"  James, congratulations on the book, we're so happy  you're here to talk about it.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Great.  Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell us the takeaway that you have in borrowed time.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think the big takeaway is the regulation and government  support through history doesn't work.  We look at a bank that it's been  there two centuries.</p><p> The first century it's an independent organization, there's no federal  backstop, there's no taxpayer exposure.  Knowing that they are going to  accept the consequences of failure you had very careful bankers running a  very strong bank.</p><p> People -- most Americans have never heard of.  Moses Taylor, James  Stillman, they built the largest bank in the country and wasn't necessarily  fun to work there.  Stillman, you know, he roomed by absolute fear.</p><p> He was a maniac about examining their credit risks and demanding  information from people they were going to lend to.  It was such a strong  bank, so highly capitalized that they actually rescued the government a  couple times in the 1890s.  </p><p> Then once the taxpayer safety net comes in, political operators start  running the bank.  And within years of the Federal Reserve being created,  Citi is there borrowing heavily from the New York Fed.  Now, we'd love to  know all the details about that but Fed won't share the documents, they've  probably been destroyed.</p><p> This is kind of an ongoing problem where the Federal Reserve hides and then  destroys documents related to their supervision of banks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And in recent years you really saw how strong or weak the bank  is especially when it was tested during the financial crisis.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  The weakest of the bank.  It needed the biggest bank  bailout.  $45 billion direct government investment, hundreds of billions of  more in debt guarantees various other assistance.</p><p> And it was a complete failure.  And I think it's the -- it's the government  backstop which is the root of it because a lot of people during the crisis  they like to say that this or that particular instrument or Wall Street  gambling was the cause.</p><p> But you look at Citi and we were able to pull one document out of the FDIC  it showed problems across the bank from the most complex financial  instrument and the -- in moral street trading to the most simple loan.  </p><p> So it was -- the underlying problem is the government safety net which  encourages risk taking and government policies driving people into housing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  James, congratulations on the book.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Oh, thanks.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Frankly, I was delighted to find out what the topic was.  When I  saw the title \"Borrow Time\" I thought it was my medical report, so I'm  delighted to hear that it wasn't.</p><p> But I think your book is more a message than just a book and the message is  that when banks operate with prudence and they operate the old fashion way  where they stand up for themselves and they're responsible.</p><p> The stock holders and to their employees and to their customers, that's a  solid bank.  But when they start depending upon the government and know the  government's going to bail them out, they operate at a level of greed that  you expose in this book.</p><p> I think it's an incredibly valuable message that I hope people in  government will read because the politicians need to not make this mistake  again by providing all of this safety net for these banks who operate like  these guys operated.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great point.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well thanks.  And I'm hoping this is maybe a moment where it's a  good time.  Banks are healthy again, they're strong, they're making money,  they're returning capital to shareholders which maybe should make taxpayers  a little nervous.</p><p> But I think it is a good time to say let's start peeling back that safety  net.  I understand if the government said tomorrow everything's change and  we're going to let everyone fail, it would be a little chaotic.</p><p> So you start a phase withdrawal.  Policies, laws, regulations, you start  making it clear that we're going to let people fail again and, you know,  there's a -- obviously bankruptcy was not an option anyone wanted in '08.</p><p> But the beauty of that is it does allow new competitors, more innovative  competitors to arise and it allows people to suffer investors, to suffer  the consequences of their decisions.</p><p> You know, this is not about -- obviously you can your deposit insurance,  it's about making investors who make bad decisions live with it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PARTSINEVOLOS:  Just quickly, you just said there were problems across the  board, they were quite obvious.  So then why do you think the government  bailed them out?</p><p> FREEMAN:  It's funny, it's kind of a mid -- even some of the people doing  the bailouts, Sheila Bair who's running the FDIC was kind of saying, you  know, where's the analysis and where's the real argument that we really  should rescue these guys.</p><p> And it was just kind of presumed and this is -- one of the reason we wrote  the book is to show that this kind of too big to fail mentality was built  over decades.  It wasn't just, oh wait, someone decided a bank like Citi  has to be saved.  It was just presumed.</p><p> Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said that if it's not too big to fail, I  don't know what is.  But there's no analysis to say we couldn't live  without Citi.  And I think you look at this economy where a lot of these  institutions we probably could live without.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, someone who was against TARP, one of the few republicans  who openly was against it and I still am, I want to say thanks for exposing  and peeling the onion back a little bit and letting people realize that  this wasn't the absolute -- if we don't do this, you know, it's Armageddon. </p><p> And I think that's what we were told in a way, I never believed it then.  I  think your book helps to point out, would it have been disastrous?  Yes.   But would it have been the end of the world?  Probably not, just the end of  some very bad banking procedures.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Thanks.  You know, it really went well beyond Citi.  As you point  out, you go back March of '08, the government decided to rescue the  creditors of Bear Stearns, not even a bank.  Maybe the 17th largest  institution in the financial industry.  I mean --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is it because we were in a moment of time -- in time that  they were worried that the lights were going to go out on G.E. and that,  you know, things were coming to a halt given that the buck broke?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  There was definitely a lot of fear and it was based on gut  instinct more than -- more than math I would say.  </p><p> But -- and I understand it was difficult because I think the government can  create a problem that big where one reason it was so challenging, as you  look roughly 20 years before the, Drexel Burnham big investment bank  failed, life went on.  </p><p> But in '08 you had the government pushing everybody in the housing  investment, rewarding banks for holding AAA-rated mortgage bank security.   So you had the same problem across the industry.  </p><p> So I understand the fear of letting all of these institutions take a hit  and have to recognize their losses.  But, I think, certainly, the bailout  culture was building over time whereas the governor said the -- knowing the  safety net was there, made these banks run at very high levels of leverage.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  And it was an election year.  Let's not forget that.  That's a  big motive there.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  James Freeman, the book is Borrowed Time, Two Centuries of  Booms, Busts, and Bailouts of Citi, go check it out, James Freeman,  congratulations again.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Thanks a lot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A very important book.  Coming up, from blue wave to flameout,  why Bernie Sanders and the left are losing in the run-up to the midterms,  this comes as Nancy Pelosi says the votes for Democrats this fall, gives  leverage to people coming to this country, illegally.  Her controversial  comments and the backlash, coming up, right after this short break, stay  with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thank you so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, Happy Thursday, it is Thursday,  August 9th, your top stories right now, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> Wall Street's mixed this morning, as investors are waiting for earnings  from Coca-Cola, Viacom and Gannett.  Futures indicating a flat opening this  morning, Dow Industrials up about 16 points, as you can see, S&amp;P 500 is up  three and the NASDAQ right now, up nine points, eye on earnings.</p><p> Mixed close yesterday, on Wall Street, for the major averages, check it  out.  Dow Industrials losing 45 points, the S&amp;P also negative and the  NASDAQ yesterday, at the close, up 4-1/2 points.</p><p> In Europe this morning, we are seeing some activity on the downside.  FT- 100 down 47 points, in London, down two-thirds of one percent, the CAC  Quarante in Paris, is down seven points, but the DAX Index in Germany, up,  as you can see, 52, that's almost one-half of one percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher, Hang Seng and the Shanghai  Composite, higher, the Chinese index, the Shanghai, up almost two percent,  bouncing back on hopes of stimulus against U.S. tariffs.  </p><p> Fires are raging in California this morning, authorities arresting a man in  connection with the fire that burned over 4,000 acres, the alleged  threatening e-mails he sent coming up this morning.</p><p> And looking for leverage, House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says that a  vote for Democrats in the midterm elections can change the tide on the  immigration debate, watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES:  We are not going to be able to get it done under the  Republican leadership in Congress.  We believe that we will have leverage  when we win in November.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The immigration debate, coming up this morning.  Plus, there's  this, rides over New York City Council, passing regulations limiting Uber  and Lyft.  The number of cars on the road, capped.  We break it down, what  regulators are telling Uber this morning.  </p><p> Fox on top, 21st Century Fox, nearly doubling its quarterly profit, this  ahead of a deal with Walt Disney, to sell most of its entertainment assets.   We are crunching the numbers on 21st Century Fox this morning, put the  stock at 45, 46.</p><p> And he shoots, he scores, a Harlem Globetrotter, flying high with an  incredible trick shot from an airplane, getting a ride in there, too.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Thursday morning, but first, our top story  this half an hour, and that is socialism's popularity is in a slump, many  of the primary candidates backed up by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez, not even coming close to winning the nominations.</p><p> Joining me right now to discuss that is Former Trump Campaign  Communications Director, Bryan Lanza and Democratic Strategist, Robin Biro.   Good to see you both, thank you so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p> BRYAN LANZA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MERCURY:  Good morning, thank you.</p><p> ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think, Robin, let me kick it off with you.   What do you think happened in the primaries?  Why are these socialists arm  of the Democrats not doing well in your view?</p><p> BIRO:  In my view, they're just not resonating with, as you know, your  everyday Americans.  I still think that Ocasio-Cortez was a geographic  anomaly.  You know, you know, a heavily-left-leaning district, a very left- leaning candidate.  </p><p> I did not believe that the party itself lock, stock, and barrel, was going  that far left.  And I'm glad to see that six out of seven of these, Bernie  and Ocasio-Cortez candidates did not win.  </p><p> So, you know, I hope that, sort of, changes the narrative that we're all  losing our minds and drifting toward socialism.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, in other words, you're saying that this is a negative for  the party, because it feels like anybody in the party who is, sort of,  moderate or not extreme left, is not resonating.  I mean, you have to come  up with these things like abolish ICE, in terms of getting the blessing of  the leadership.</p><p> BIRO:  Oh, well -- let's -- we are about to run into a topic talking about  Nancy Pelosi.  And I think the leadership is out of touch with, you know,  your average American.  What I'm saying is that, moderate candidates are  the ones that are winning and moderate candidates, like -- I'm not a  candidate, but moderates like me, are winning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BIRO:  They are the ones with the stronger message.  These far-left  candidates are out of touch with everyday Americans, that's why they didn't  win and I'm glad that they didn't.  It's just it's a bad formula for my  party to have candidates this far to the left.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, speaking about a touch, Bryan, Nancy Pelosi claims that a  vote for a Democrat in November will give leverage to illegal immigrants.  </p><p> LANZA:  Unbelievable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It proves once again, where her priorities lie, with illegals.   Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PELOSI:  We are not going to be able to get it done under the Republican  leadership in Congress.  We believe that we will have leverage when we win  in November, because it gives us hope to -- because of the leverage it  gives to families who may have followed -- dad may have gone home for a  family funeral and now can't come back into the country.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts, Bryan?</p><p> LANZA:  I mean, I think it's just shameful that the leader of the  Democratic Party's prioritizing illegal immigrants over everything else.   You know why she wants leverage for?  She wants leverage to abolish ICE.   She wants leverage for open borders, and she wants leverage for amnesty.</p><p> The American people do not want leverage for illegal aliens coming into  this country.  They want to focus on the American workers who are working  very hard to get themselves out of, you know, whatever socio-economic  condition they're in and work up the economic ladder.  Nancy Pelosi doesn't  believe in the American people, she believes in the foreign dream.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts going into the midterms, Bryan?</p><p> LANZA:  I think this is good.  I mean, it exposes, you know, whether it's  Bernie Sanders or Nancy Pelosi, it really exposes the energy of Democratic  Party and just how far-left it is.  You know, sort of the radical  progressives are taking a food hold in the party.  </p><p> They may not have all the seats today, but that's where the energy is, and  that's where the leaders of the Democratic Party are talking about.  They  are talk about abolishing ICE.  They're talking about raising taxes.  </p><p> They're talking about open borders.  I think those principles and values  are out of context with the American people.  And I think we're going to  have an election in November to prove that they are.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think, Robin, if a blue wave does in fact  happen in November, it may not have impact or support the people think,  take a look at Democratic congressional nominee, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,  she's waffling on whether she even sees a leader of the Democrat Party.   This is an interview with CNN.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRIS CUOMO, HOST CNN:  Whom do you believe to be the head of the  Democratic Party?</p><p> ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK:  Well, I  don't think that there's any one head.  You know, we are a collective, this  is a movement.  And I don't think parties are ever about one person, but  they're about how the contributions that each one person gives to the  party.  So, I think that there are really exciting folks in the party.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Robin, there is a leader, Tom Perez, was the head of the  Democratic National Committee, right?</p><p> BIRO:  Yes, I really, honestly, just can't with her.  You know, I was  affirmed -- I was firmly opposed to Bernie Sanders, I've been opposed to  Ocasio-Cortez, anybody that far to the left, I think, is on the fringe and  does not represent what middle America, most Americans believe.  </p><p> And I agree with Bryan, that, you know, people like Nancy Pelosi are pretty  much out of touch.  I think she makes a strong case for recall, go ahead,  Calexit.  So, you know, I think we need some better leadership.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what do you think is going on then, Robin?  I mean, is it  because they -- the Democrats are not sure what to do with Donald Trump as  President?  </p><p> BIRO:  Oh, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Have they just given up on moderation, I mean, it does seem  that --</p><p> BIRO:  Yes, let me tell you --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  the party has been hijacked, right?</p><p> BIRO:  It has, and let me tell you exactly what's going on.  The party did  swing somewhat to the left, in response to Donald Trump.  But I think what  we're seeing now, Maria, is that it's levelling out, we're getting back to  our roots, we're getting back to winning strategies, we are in red states,  we're running moderates, that's what just happened in Ohio, he came  incredibly close.</p><p> So, you know, we are getting back to a good strategy here.  And like I  said, geographically, Ocasio-Cortez won in a very left-leaning district, so  that, I understand.  I still insist that's a geographic anomaly.  I do not  think the party itself lock, stock, and barrel, is all swinging toward  Democratic socialism.  That was just proven wrong on Tuesday.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will -- we will leave it there and watch this.   Great to see you both, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p> LANZA:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Bryan, thank you.</p><p> BIRO:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Robin, thank you very much.  We have some breaking news right  now that we want to talk about, and apparently, the Sinclair deal with  Tribune is off.  The Tribune media deal -- Sinclair deal is dead.  Tribune  saying that the $3.9 billion deal can no longer move forward after comments  from FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, your thoughts?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, I think -- you know, all these mergers have frightened a  lot of people into feeling there was going to be almost a monopolistic  approach to media.  And the FCC, obviously, has been nervous about it, and  I think we are seeing the results of that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But in an environment where AT&amp;T and Time Warner are getting  together, and obviously, Fox selling the entertainment assets.  But bigger,  sort of, identity of this is the AT&amp;T deal, your thoughts, James?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, I think that deal ought to go through.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p> FREEMAN:  It's kind of nutty the government is appealing on this one.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But why is it being --</p><p> FREEMAN:  You know, I don't think Ajit Pai is some hyper regulator who's  eager to break up business deals.  I think this was more about a sincere  belief that based on the correct reading of the law.  It shouldn't be  allowed to go through.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p> FREEMAN:  I think -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Too much concentration?</p><p> FREEMAN:  It gets into -- I think a fairly technical compliance issue, not  sort of a big picture that too much -- too much concentration in media, but  I think he is correctly applying the law even though it's obviously not the  result that many of the shareholders would have wanted.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Did you guys hear about this, just previously, that critics  have said that Ajit has actually changed the FCC rules to benefit Sinclair?   It's in an article.  Did you talk about that at all?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  OK.  And the FCC inspector general is actually  investigating that particular matter, whether rules have been changed, but  now, I guess that's nullified, given that this deal hasn't gone through.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Maria, I think we need to be more concerned about what's  happening with the social media companies becoming monopolistic rather than  the traditional legacy companies, because the audiences for broadcast and  traditional cable are beginning to dwindle and things are moving more to  the social media platforms.  That ought to strike --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to talk more about that because there's really the  spotlight now on social media, so we'll talk more about that.  We'll take a  break.  When we come back, pumping the brakes, New York becomes the first  major city to cap the number of drivers working for companies like Lyft and  Uber.</p><p> And taking the skyhook to a whole new level, a Harlem Globetrotter makes a  basket from a plane, back in a minute.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A suspect is in custody this morning for  allegedly starting the so-called \"holy fire,\" which has burned more than  six square miles in Southern California.  Cheryl Casone with the details  now, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  One of several fires still burning, Maria, in California.  Maria,  51-year-old, Forrest Gordon Clark is behind bars today on suspicion of  arson.  He's also charged with a threat to terrorize and resisting arrest.   Investigators believe the fire was an intentional act but they're still  figuring out how exactly he started it.  According to Orange County  register, Clark owns a cabin in the area of the fires and sent the e-mail  to fire officials warning this place will burn.  The fire started Monday  but is only five percent contained right now.  </p><p> Well, 21st Century Fox reporting better than expected earnings after the  closing bell last night.  The company's results easily beating the street's  estimates driven by growth and its cable, and film business.  Higher fees  from cable and satellite distributors also helping to boosting profits.   21st Century Fox is preparing to close major deal to sell most of its  entertainment assets Walt Disney for $71 billion shares of 21st Century  Fox, the parent of the Fox Business Network, of 31 percent so far this  year.  </p><p> And then finally, check this out, A Harlem Globe Trotter makes ultimate sky  hook when he scores a basket from an airplane.  This incredible footage  shows Bull Bullard pulling up a shoot from a two-person plane.  The plane  going 70 miles an hour, as a past over hoop in the middle of the runway, he  drops the ball, nothing but net, anybody ask yourself, why do this?  Why  not?  It's the Globe Trotters, man, they love this stuff.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, why not?  I love it.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, screeching of a new rule capping the number of ride- hailing drivers in New York City, what this really means next?  Back in a  minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  -- one year while they  conduct research and try to figure things out.  New York City mayor,  Democrat Bill de Blasio, says this, he says our city is directfully  confronting a crisis that is driving working New Yorkers into poverty, and  our streets into gridlock.  The traffic angle is certainly true, I think,  everybody would agree with that.  But how about fixing the subways?   There's no incentive to take a subway particularly on a hot day in August,  right?    So, what about mass transit and what about the communities and further  parts of the city that don't have access to mass transportation?  They rely  on the for-hire vehicles many times.  You also look at business angles of  all of this, because Uber and Lyft, they're looking to IPO Uber the second- half of the year.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  The latest valuations for these companies, and we can show them  to you, estimated at $62 billion for Uber, about $15 billion for Lyft.   This is big money and this, especially being such a big city like New York  City, if it ripples effects in other places, can certainly hurt them.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what was it that triggered this?  I mean, was there a  catalyst that made the leadership in New York feel that there's just too  much congestion?  I feel like congestion has been the situation for a long  time?  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  True, it's been a little bit worse.  If you look at the exact  numbers of how many cars are on the road, the ride-hailing vehicles and the  taxis, the numbers have gone up.  But we've also seen traditional yellow  cab drivers commit suicide because they're unable to make a living when  they are competing with these for-hire vehicle.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  There's been eight suicides so far.  And also, part of this  deal that these ride-share drivers will earn $17.22 an hour.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Thank you for bringing that up.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes, so at least there's a threshold there.  I do agree  that -- it's not only Lyft.  Via is taking off in New York too.  Are you  familiar with these --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, and also for Via.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  It's a carpooling service, that is carpooling versus Uber,  you can do Uber versus Uber Pool -- Uber Black.  So, there's a lot of  different elements whereas Via is just carpooling, and they're everywhere.   But I agree, why -- you don't want us to take that kind of transportation?   I get around with the city bikes but public transit needs to be improved.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  You do have congestion pricing tolls into the city.  I know no  one likes to pay tolls but that was one idea that de Blasio didn't want  that.  Obviously, we don't want anyone committing suicide but taxi cabs  don't like the competition.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, they don't and the value of their medallion has plummeted.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  It went from one million to 200,000.</p><p> FREEMAN:  A lot of happy Uber and Lyft customers in the city.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  But Uber will work with the city and other cities around the  world, and hopefully figure this out.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yesterday we had a story where, you know, Governor Cuomo wants  to give three months off of bereavement, you know, there's that.  And now,  today we're getting pushed back on Uber, your thoughts on New York and  business?  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  It's just not a place where people can do business.  I mean, it  really isn't, why are so many people move out of New York?  That's why.  I  mean, I was just saying to Lauren a moment ago, the reason I come here, as  seldom as I have to is because -- </p><p> SIMONETTI:  You have to come here.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  No, it's because it's not a place where it's easy to get around,  it's incredibly expensive and it's not getting better.  It's getting worse.   That's unfortunate.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, there's no law of the universe that says financial companies  even have to stay here.  (INAUDIBLE) Bernstein recently announcing it's  moving its headquarters, always been in New York to Nashville.  So, might  want to think about trading customers a little better.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you know what, we've talked about this going into the tax  cut plan and there's been no change there.  So, it almost feels like that's  OK with de Blasio and he doesn't care.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  We're running the same experiment in New Jersey, you would have  thought changes in federal tax law would make a lot of these blue states  politicians want to get more competitive.  And so far, they are resisting;  I guess to use their favorite word, but people are going to leave.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Big story.  Thank you, Lauren.  We'll take a short  break.  When we come back, disturbing trend: Teenagers are getting cosmetic  surgery to look like their favorite Snapchat filters.  More on that, next  hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA right here.

The fallout coming up  this morning.</p><p> Escalating trade tensions weighing on global investors this morning.   Markets are flat as you can see, Dow Industrials exactly where it closed  yesterday.

And joining me to break  it all down -- Fox Business Network's Kristina Partsinevelos is with us,  the Wall Street Journal for assistant editorial page editor James Freeman,  and former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike  Huckabee.  Great to see everybody this morning.  </p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Thank you.  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's on your mind?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  You know what's really cool is we talk about all these people  coming back into the job force.  The quit rate has also gone up.  So people  who already have a job are having an easier time finding new jobs.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That shows confidence.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When you quit and you want another job it shows confidence.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Isn't there a trend of ghosting now at job interviews?   Ghosting, meaning you either don't show up, or you get hired and you don't  show up to your first day of work either and they don't even tell the  employer?  There was an article written about it that it's happening more  and more often.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Well that is -- that is confident.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FREEMAN:  There are jobs -- but they can't find the workers.  They have to  use ghost workers instead.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Ghost like dating -- you go to a restaurant and she doesn't  show up.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Is that what that is.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  That's what it is.  That's what ghosting is.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FREEMAN:  I've been out of the dating scene for a couple of decades now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p> First we have this breaking news.  The Tribune Media-Sinclair deal is dead.   Tribune saying said that the $3.9 billion deal can no longer move forward  after comments from the Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit  Pai.  Pai said last month that he had, quote, \"serious concerns about the  transaction\".</p><p> Joining us right now, by telephone, is Mediatech Capital Partners managing  partner Porter Bibb.  Porter -- great to see you this morning.  Thanks so  much for calling in.  Your thoughts on this deal being dead this morning.  </p><p> PORTER BIBB, MANAGING PARTNER, MEDIATECH CAPITAL PARTNERS (via telephone):   Well, this deal was killed by Ajit Pai about three weeks ago, Maria, when  he indicated the FCC would probably not approve it.  And we haven't heard  from Justice -- the Justice Department would have blocked the deal as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there another competitor in the wings, waiting to come in  for Tribune or for Sinclair?  </p><p> BIBB:  There has to be.  There has to be because there is no question that  Tribune is a seller.  This was nearly $4 billion transaction.  And Sinclair  had an articulated plan to build a competitor basically to the Fox News  Network, a conservative-centric television network that would have had more  stations than any other single entity owned in the United States as part of  their network.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Porter -- James Freeman here at the \"Wall Street Journal\".  I'm  wondering if you could give us a sense of how this happened because I think  Ajit Pai has generally shown he's not eager to intervene in the  marketplace.  He just went through a very tough time basically making sure  that the FCC, his commission, would not be the uber-regulator of the  Internet.</p><p> Was this a sloppy filing by Sinclair?   Or is this Pai in this case at  least overstepping?  </p><p> BIBB:  It's hard to read and I agree with your perception.  The FCC under  Pai has tried to stay out of business matters but I think Justice  Department's challenge against the Time Warner, AT&amp;T merger has influenced  Pai a little bit and also influenced other members, other commissioners on  the FCC.</p><p> It's really a difficult call to try to read what was in their minds.  And I  agree with you, this seemed like a contradictory posture for the FCC to be  adopting.</p><p> However, the idea of a single entity, Sinclair, owning basically the  majority of television stations in this country is not a hard situation to  try to challenge.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.  Ok.</p><p> Sinclair down 1.25 percent this morning.  Porter we just got Viacom  earnings out.  Obviously this is a week of media earnings.  Give us your  sort of 30,000 feet look at what's happening in media today and what you've  learned based on these earnings.  Viacom revenue missed their expectations  at $3.24 billion in revenue.  The estimate was $3.26 billion.</p><p> But that's just one part of the story.  Your thoughts on how this business  has changed.  </p><p> BIBB:  Well, the business has changed radically and scale I guess is the  byword of the day.  Viacom and CBS are going to have to come back together  to get scale and then they will be acquired by maybe Verizon which has made  an offer six, seven months ago -- a tentative offer for the combined  companies.</p><p> There are other buyers out there.  But you have to have scale to compete in  this new landscape that the media business has become.  It takes content  and distribution capability as well as scale on every other level.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Porter, I know you cover Tesla.  You called it yesterday.   You told us when you were here on set that you thought the Securities and  Exchange Commission would in fact be inquiring as to the Tesla tweet, the  Elon Musk tweet saying that he's considering taking the company private,  funding secured at $420 a share.</p><p> Your thoughts on where this goes.  </p><p> BIBB:  I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop at the SEC.  They have not  been particularly aggressive on challenging situations like Elon Musk's --  what I consider outrageous disclosure without any substance or fact behind  it.</p><p> The issue with his announcement really hinges on funding.  And he has not  made any disclosures regarding whether he's got funding or not.  Mr. Musk  basically stuck it to the shorts and where it all goes is going to be a  very interesting scenario because he really cannot take this company  private if he wants to avoid shareholder litigation.  That is going to last  a lifetime.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So do you think ultimately it goes private?  I mean, there  obviously are going to be shareholder lawsuits coming.  Do you see any  opportunity for funding being secured?  I mean what are we talking about  here?  $75 billion?  </p><p> BIBB:  That was the starting point.  One wants to know if he wants to go  private and if he's looking for investors, whether it's Saudis or anybody  else.  Why would he want to pay 20 or 30 percent more than he has to?   Because the stock is going to go back down to earth at some point in the  near future and that's when he should be looking at taking it private if he  wants to.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the stock never reached that $420 a share -- James Freeman.  </p><p> BIBB:  Never.  That's right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You would think that when he says $420 a share that the stock  would rally to $420.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, that's why I'm wondering.  Porter -- it seems like the  tough thing is finding the money.  If he actually has secured the funding,  what would be the shareholder litigation?  Wouldn't they be thrilled that  he was buying -- picking a property?  </p><p> BIBB:  If he can find the money.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Ok.  You think they might sue if they find out he doesn't have  the money and this was just a tease on Twitter.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's sticking it to the shorts.  </p><p> BIBB:  That's right.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Do you not think that if he doesn't sell, if he's trying to  increase the share price, if he holds onto his shares, proves that he has  funding, then he's ok.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  If he proves that he has funding.  We're talking about  $80 billion.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  I know.  </p><p> BIBB:  But look where the price was three or four months ago, was back down  in the $270 range.  If he's going to find financing and make an offer to  take the company private, why wouldn't he go at a more realistically-based   price level than $420.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Do you think that 420 is a joke then?  Some people have  said that.  This isn't the first time he talked about being private; he did  it in 2017, November.  </p><p> You have to take your hat off to Elon Musk.  He's a fantastic promoter.   He's a visionary.  And what he says is not to be taken seriously unless he  can deliver.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Porter -- are you telling clients right now to sell the  stock?  </p><p> BIBB:  You bet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You bet.  All right.  Porter -- great to talk with you, thank  you so much.</p><p> BIBB:  Ok.  Pleasure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Porter Bibb -- Mediatech joining us there.</p><p> Switching gears to renewed Russia tensions -- Reuters is reporting that the  Kremlin is rejecting accusations of involvement in the nerve agent attack  on a former Russian spy and his daughter in the U.K.  That's in response  to, of course, fresh sanctions yesterday from the United States following  the poisoning.</p><p> The Kremlin calling the new sanctions, quote, \"categorically unacceptable  and illegal under international law\" slamming Washington as an  unpredictable actor on the international stage.</p><p> Joining us now, Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle.  Lea -- good morning  to you.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE:  Fox News correspondent:  Good morning to you -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, that's exactly what I would expect from Russia.  Russia  tends to lie, deny and counter-accuse, when the U.S. State Department comes  out with an announcement like Heather Nauert came out with basically saying  that Russia did use a nerve agent.  This is in violation of international  law that triggers sanctions under the Chemical and Biological Weapons  Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991.  We come out and say that  because we have some pretty solid proof and some pretty solid evidence.   That was already there.</p><p> But for, you know, for Russia to say no, we didn't do it; no, it wasn't us;  or no, we didn't use this nerve agent -- completely to be expected.  Of  course that's what they're going to do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about this -- Governor?  I mean that was  pretty aggressive of the U.S. to slap the sanctions on Russia.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, I guess I'm trying to figure out if the President is so  the puppet of Vladimir Putin, he has really cut the strings.  I mean I've  never seen the United States push so hard back against Russia.  I can't  remember a time in my lifetime when we have been this tough on them.  And I  don't know why the President is not getting credit for just saying we're  not going to take it anymore.  Why isn't he?  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.  I think the President's not getting credit for that  because of the big riff we have in our domestic politics in the United  States.  It's because this is what the other side has been using to attack  the President.</p><p> But I'll go over what Secretary Pompeo said back on July 25th, you know,  213 sanctions we've imposed on Russians and individuals, 60 Russian spies,  expelled, Russia's Consulate in Seattle, closed.  Also San Francisco, the  150 military exercises that we've conducted in Europe this year.  More than  $11 billion put towards European deterrence initiatives.  Defensive weapons  that we've made available to Ukraine and Georgia.</p><p> There's been a big change in this administration, you're your point.  And  it comes down to our politics in the United States.  That's why the  President is getting hit so hard on Russia.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  This is not symbolic.  These are things that are really hurting  Russia, hurting them economically at a time were they were already hurting  economically.  It's hurting them politically, it's hurting them on the  world stage.  I mean these are not just, again, symbolic gestures.  These  are substantive measures that are sticking it to Russia in a very, very  harsh way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul implies on Twitter that he  delivered a letter from President Trump to Vladimir Putin.  The Senator  tweeted this.  I was honored to deliver a letter from President Trump to  President Vladimir Putin's administration.  The letter emphasized the  importance of further engagement in various areas including countering  terrorism, enhancing legislative dialogue and resuming culture exchanges.  </p><p> Just as it was going on the dynamics, this is strengthening the  relationship with the U.K. because the U.K. has asked for these sanctions.   This is improving relations with NATO and other allies.  And I think that  that's what United States needs right now.</p><p> When you brought up President Trump and why they're not saying great for  him, maybe this is actually showing a divide or difference between the  President and the administration over Russia because this has been a topic  before that there may not be agreeing on what needs to be done and how  Russia needs to be treated.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I don't think the sanction would be put in place if  President Trump didn't want to.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I would disagree with that and I would say that the president  has had to defend his legitimacy because of the politics involved from the  very start.  But it seems to me from the actions that are taken that  they're very much working together.  But it seems to me from the actions  that are being taken, they're very much State Department, the establishment  of the global engagement center, You look at the State Department and the  establishment of the global Engagement center which is going to be  countering propaganda from state actors like Russia and working on things  like that, there's a lot the administration is doing and that's led by the  President.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Lea great to see you -- thanks you so much.</p><p> We're taking a break.   When we come back, battling the blaze, more  harrowing of the firenado swirling in the sky, that's coming up next.</p><p> Then hack attack, the details after the cyber criminals reportedly seized  control of the PGA of America's computer service.  That's next stay with  us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Hurricane Hector brushing past Hawaii's Big  Island.  Cheryl Casone with details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Maria -- residents of Hawaii's Big Island are breathing a  sigh of relieve today as Hurricane Hector passes well, south of the island.   The hurricane, now a cat 3 is weakening.  That tropical storm warning has  actually been dropped.  But dangerous surf and rip currents are still a  threat on the Island's beaches.</p><p> Meanwhile check out what firefighters saw as a fire tore through a British  plastics factory.  The firefighters captured this amazing video.  They  named it a firenado.  It's really incredible.</p><p> It's a whirl wind of flames that's created when hot air meets cold and the  fire is whipped upwards into the sky.  This was 50 feet high.  Nobody was  hurt.  But people living 26 miles away said they could actually see the  thick, black smoke in the sky.  I don't think we've seen anything like this  before.</p><p> Well, Amazon is hiring and some of the jobs have a nice like perk.  It's  looking to fill more than 200 virtual jobs.  That means you can work from  home.  Most of these are full-time positions and available across the  United States and in other places like the U.K., Germany, and then get this  -- Costa Rica.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Live on the beach.</p><p> There's lots of different positions including Sun and Crowd computing,  software development and employee relations.</p><p> Then there is this story.  First there was clip on toupees.  But now yes,  meet the clip-on man bun.  Men who want to be hip or don't want the hassle  of growing out long hair or they just can't grow out their hair, can now  simply buy this extension by going to bluecrate.com.  It comes in blond,  black and brown and yes, Maria -- it can be yours for just $8.</p><p> That's all I've got.  The man bun.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Man buns -- </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  That's not going to take off.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You don't like it?  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  No, because they did that with women.  Did you not remember  like 10 years ago, 15 years ago, you could get a clip-on extension.  And  you just put on -- if you have your hair in a ponytail and then you have  this luscious long hair -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I sort of liked that for women.  But man bun -- </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  It's so obviously fake because it's a synthetic crap  material.  I'm sorry -- I'm really against this.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  What about you?  Would you -- would you -- </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I just ordered one.  I just ordered one.  Next time I'm on the  show I'm going to be wearing it because I'm getting a little thinner up  here.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Did they find your color?  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  What's that?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Man bun?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, I'm going to try the blonde one.  I think it's ideal when  you want a party on the weekend but be all business on Monday morning.  I  mean in the old days you had to wear the mullet all the time.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Bring on the man buns.  All right.  We've got some  takers here.</p><p> Coming up -- loving the Lakers, the Internet's reaction to Lebron James  shows off his new team uniform.  Check it out, James, 23.</p><p> Plus serious speed -- details on a new motorcycle powered by vintage Rolls  Royce aircraft engine.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The PGA Championship teeing off this morning in  the wake of a major hacking scandal.</p><p> Jared Max with the details now -- Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS SPORTS:  Maria -- good morning.  Computer servers  that belonged to the PGA of America were hacked this week.  Officials  locked out of critical files that relate to the PGA championship and  upcoming Ryder Cup.</p><p> Now this isn't about financial information getting stoned but rather  creative materials, promotional banners, logos for various platforms  including digital signage around the Bell Reef Country Club where the PGA  championship is this week.  Stolen files include development of logos; also  for future PGA championships.</p><p> Now while the hackers didn't demand a specific dollar amount, a bitcoin  wallet number was included within computer messages, ransom note in part  reads \"your network has been penetrated.  All files on each host encrypted  with a strong algorithm, may lead to the impossibility of recovery of  certain files.  As of yesterday afternoon, PGA officials have not taken  back control of the files.</p><p> All right, now for a couple of big reveals.  Lebron James, you all ready to  see your fixer-upper?  What do you think of this, It's Lebron James in his  new L.A. Lakers uniform.  He shared some images yesterday on Instagram.  He  was also wearing the new Nike Kobe Bryant sneakers.</p><p> Our next reveal a baby-gender reveal.  It's a popular thing today --  teammates of Falcons' offensive line Andy Livitra used Gatorade to let Andy  and his wife Kate know what the gender of their baby was.  And blue -- it's  a boy, expected the day after the Super Bowl.</p><p>Time for one more reveal.  Let's find out what's in the ear of MLB umpire  Bruce Drekman.  White Sox Yankees last night.  They go into the Yankee  dugout and they pull out a live moth inside the ear of the Major League  Baseball umpire.</p><p> They're bugging out this week in the big leagues.  A couple of days ago, a  praying mantis took in the national anthem.  Remember on the home of the  Nationals Pitcher Erick Fedde's shoulder.</p><p> Remember when John Kennedy that 96-ounce steak in the movie \"The Great  Outdoors\" so his family could eat for free?  Arizona cardinals bringing a  similar concept to Home games.</p><p> The gridiron burger, if any fan can finish this 7-pound pile of food in  under one hour, the fan gets a free Cardinals Hersey.  Now here's what  inside the gridiron burger.  Five third pound burgers, five beef hot dogs,  agent slicing bacon, eight chicken tenders, 20 slices of American cheese,  also fries, bratwurst, loaded onto a huge bun.</p><p> They say -- it could be about 8,300 calories for this one.  I mean if you  put that down in an hour, that could kill somebody -- No.  </p><p> You get a team jersey and a free ride to the emergency room.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  $8,000 -- that should be not allowed.  </p><p> MAX:  $8,000 </p><p> That jersey is not worth that, even the cost of the calories.  I'm  surprised they're doing this.  They're encouraging people to eat something  that's so bad for you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  8,000 calories in one sitting.  </p><p> Go smoke a carton of cigarettes in 60 minutes and come back to us.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> FREEMAN:  You're going to burn some calories walking to your seat and back,  right.  so that's a start.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Come on -- that's maybe white -- That's five French Fries off  of that thing.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  A nibble.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a meal.  </p><p> MAX:  That's a meal.  It's a mouth full.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a mouth full.  I think he'd be better -- </p><p> HUCKABEE:  You're better off just eating the moth out of the umpire's ear.   Maybe that would be -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  You know what -- in Seattle, they sell the -- what is it -- the  bugs that they sell in Seattle -- I think the grasshoppers is a really  popular. .  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, they're good.  You don't even know because -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've eaten grasshopper them?  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  The grasshoppers, the crickets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've eaten them?  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Of course.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Of course, yes.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Now, it's protein.  You can even get insect protein powder.   You don't even know.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Forget the crickets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm rethinking the burger.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  We call those bait in Arkansas.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jared -- thank you.  Well said.  Catch Jared's sports reports  on Fox News headlines 24-7 or Sirius Radio XM 115.</p><p> We'll take a break.  When we come back, Snapchat dysmorphia -- details on  the concerning new plastic surgery trend fueled by social media.  That's  coming up.</p><p> And then a cloudy future for Crocs, the latest setback for the footwear  company as manufacturing facilities are closing its doors, later this hour.   Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, August 9th.   Your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> The deal is off, Tribune is calling off the $3.9 billion merger agreement  with Sinclair broadcasting and they are suing.

Sinclair stock in the premarket  looks like this, down 1.25 percent this morning.  We have the very latest  coming up.  </p><p> Futures in fact are flat this morning.  We're expecting a flat opening for  the broader averages, DOW Industrials down just three points, S&amp;P is up two  and the NASDAQ up seven.  </p><p> It was a mixed close yesterday on Wall Street for the major averages.  The  DOW Industrials down 45 points and the S&amp;P was down almost one point.  The  NASDAQ was the winner, up just four points, so very much -- so close to  where they started the day.  </p><p> In Europe this morning money is leaving stocks.  FT-100 down about 60  points, 57 points lower, three quarters of one percent.  The CAC Quarante  in Paris is down a third of a percent for the 20 point decline and the DAX  Index in Germany down a fraction, 17 points lower.  </p><p> In Asia Overnight, the standout was the Shanghai Composite in China, up  almost two percent.

It is a motorcycle with a jet  engine.  We will see if this idea can get off the ground.  Gigantic wheels.   We will show you that coming up.  </p><p> First, our top story this half an hour, and that is an immigration  showdown.  A Texas judge hearing arguments from 10 states who claim that  the Obama era DACA program is unconstitutional.  Joining me right now is  Texas Congressman Roger Williams.  Congressman, it's good to see you this  morning.  You oversee a border state.  How vital is this slack down to  DACA?  </p><p> REP. ROGER WILLIAMS (R), TEXAS:  Well, I think we've got to come up with --  that DACA.  Of course, a lot of us think that it was done -- it was done  illegally.  But the biggest problem here in Texas is we have to secure the  border.  The president's trying to do that.  I think we need more border  patrol and we need more technology.  But we also need to let those who are  coming up to understand that we have a law, we need to adhere to the law  and it's better to come through the ports of entry rather than between and  let us handle your issues.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what do you think, can you give us a view of in fact what's  happening at the border right now?  You're in Texas.  You actually see it  up close and personal.  Can you characterize the immigration story for us  today and why there isn't an agreement on both sides of the aisle?  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, the issue at the border, I was Secretary of State of Texas  under Governor Perry and dealt with this issue a lot.  So, it's not new.   The issue is you always have folks coming up frankly for a better life and  some coming over here to hurt Americans, to harm Americans, but the issue  down there is the fact that we have folks that are in many -- in many cases  unaccompanied, they're younger, we've seen it.  We've done a pretty good  job in rebuilding the families back that were separated.  But you have a  lot of folks that just they're here illegally like I say and you've got --  you've got to address that.</p><p> And I think to that we've got to remind ourselves too, there's a lot of  folks not coming over here for -- to get a job or the quality of life,  they're coming over here as I said earlier to harm Americans, terrorists  and that's why it's so important to secure this border.  I believe we  secure it with more boots on the ground.  </p><p> Now, why haven't we done this?  I mean, we debated this in congress.   You've got two sides.  You've got Democratic side that frankly I believe  wants to promote illegal behavior and keep our borders not secure.  On our  side, the Republican side, we've had a hard time coming up with a plan.  I  supported the Goodlatte amendment which you're very familiar with.  We've  talked about that in the past.  I think it would have begun to address the  issues.  So, we've got to get back up in September.  We've got to get  serious about it.  And we've got to come up with a solution that keeps our  borders secure and keeps our sovereignty.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But it's just a head scratcher as to why the Democrats wouldn't  want the same thing.  I mean, Nancy Pelosi claims that a vote for a  Democrat in November will give leverage to illegal immigrants, this is what  she says.  She's proving once again where her priorities lie, with  illegals.  Listen to this, sir.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your  reaction.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  We are not going to be  able to get it done under the Republican leadership in congress.  We  believe that we will have leverage when we win in November.  Because it  gives hope to -- because of the leverage it gives to families who may have  followed dad going home for a family funeral and now can't come back into  the country. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is this about, congressman?  I mean, is this about votes  that she's trying to get?  Why wouldn't she want to keep the borders  secure?  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  I think it's totally about votes.  I think that they would  rather have this president, this administration fail than America succeed.   I think it's totally about votes.  I lived down here all my life.  I know  what's -- I know -- I know what's going on, like all -- like most Texans.  </p><p> And the fact of the matter is that I would like for Nancy Pelosi to go with  me to where we address homeless veterans.  We have so many homeless  veterans that need assistance, much more before those that frankly come to  break our laws.  So, I think it's all politically driven.  I think they  think they can get more votes and we need to address what we're supposed to  address as public officials and secure our borders and address the law of  the land which they're not doing.  It's all driven by political  grandstanding.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a lot of grandstanding.  And this whole resist movement  continues.  Do you think this gone -- this is going to impact midterm  elections coming November?  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, I think it will.  I think, I know people in Texas where I  travel around and certainly my district, they want secure borders for  crying out loud.  We all -- regardless of your party preference, you swore  to uphold the letter of the law, the constitution, and that's what we've  got to do.  I mean, it's there.  Whether you agree with it or not, the law  is the law.  So, I think it's going to be an issue that's frankly will be a  winning issue for Republicans and we've got to talk about it, not be  fearful of it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So then why are we still talking about a blue wave?  What are  your expectations for the midterm elections?  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, I don't think there's going to be a blue wave.  I don't  really know what a blue wave is unless it means all Republicans lose.  But  I think that frankly, I think we keep seats in the House.  I think we -- it  might be minimal.  But at the same time, I think we could gain seats in the  -- in the Senate.  </p><p> But the issues are this.  The issues are Americans are better off than  they've been in many, many years.  Americans regardless of Republican or  Democrat, they have more money in their pockets, they're spending more  money.  They're realizing a lot of great things the country has to offer  with the tax cuts we passed, reducing the regulations, banks now can  breathe, banks can do business and compete and compete for customers.   We've got a lot of great things happening in this country.  And I think  people recognize that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  People recognize that but the left is not recognizing it and  even the mainstream media is driving the bus on the -- on the not  recognizing it.  They're talking about Michael Cohen and Russia and all  this other things that are really not important to the American people.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, it's to divert.  I mean, we've got a lot of people that  don't think frankly like I do but it's interesting because when you talk  about tax cuts alone, Democrats are spending the tax cuts.  Democrats have  more money in their pocket.  </p><p> And so, I think at the end of the day, people will realize that famous  saying, you're better off today than you were yesterday.  I think they will  come along that way.  </p><p> But I will say this to my colleagues in the Republican Party, we've got to  do a better job of promoting the things we've got to -- we've done.  We've  got to be more retail.  We've got to be more offensive.  We can't be  defensive.  We've got a lot to talk about.  </p><p> This country has done a lot of things under President Trump.  I represent  fort hood.  The military is beginning to get much more -- it becoming  stronger, we're training more.  We've got great kids, just got back from  Iraq.  So, there's a lot going for us on this side as we move in to  November.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, I'm surprised you're not hearing more conversation  about 4.1 percent economic growth.  You know, you've got some successes  that you're not really hearing discussed.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, that's right and I go back, I've been in business 47  years, still own a business.  The economy is good.  We look at -- look at  more jobs, and (INAUDIBLE) four percent GDP, you look at unemployment down  around maybe possibly less than four percent.  There's opportunity  everywhere.  </p><p> And those people always talked about minimum wage.  People who are on  minimum wage under Barack Obama, they're making more money now because  we're competing for a workforce and it's driving wages up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  So, it is a good -- it's -- we can talk about a lot of things.   But the press is the press.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  And they drive a separate issue.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, the wage is up 2.8 percent year over year.  That's  obviously very positive.  But congressman, I've got to get your reaction to  this insider trading charges against New York representative Chris Collins,  your colleague.  He's defending himself.  He did so yesterday.  Here's what  he said.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK:  The charges that have been levied  against me are meritless and I will mount a vigorous defense in court to  clear my name.  I look forward to being fully vindicated and exonerated,  ending any and all questions relating to my affiliation with Innate.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction as Collins is not going to be serving on the  House Energy and other committees per Paul Ryan until this is resolved,  sir.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, I mean, I'm sorry about this.  I'm sorry that this has  happened.  I do know Chris.  He came in with me in 2012 into congress.  And  he's got a road ahead of him.  He's a fighter.  He's a battler.  I don't  know the facts.  I just learned them yesterday on the news.  So, I pray for  him and his family and hope everything gets resolved.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask about the looming trade dispute with China.  They're  answering back to President Trump's tariff threat with new tariffs of their  own on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.  Where do you think this is headed  in terms of the spat with China?  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, I mean, I think you've got two heavyweights battling each  other right now.  I am as you know, a small business owner.  I'm not that  excited about tariffs.  I think there's different ways to go.  I think no  tariffs would be great.  President Trump is talking about that.  But  tariffs are -- we've had the biggest tax cut we've had in many, many years.   Tariffs do raise the price of cost of goods sold.  </p><p> So, I hope that at the end of the day, I understand the China issue is  major, we need to -- we need to fix that, but I hope that we focus on  opportunity and the fact that of letting the cost of goods sold go through  competition, let people decide who they want to do business with and I just  don't think tariffs are the way to do that.  I talked to the White House  the other day about if we can't do tariffs, you know, can we do quotas.   We've got a history of quotas which frankly does not raise the cost of  goods sold.  </p><p> So, there's still a lot of opportunity out there.  And the White House is  willing to talk to people like me and others about other ideas.  And I'm  grateful for that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And do you have any sense of when we might see the next deal  logged in terms of a trade deal, perhaps Mexico is on the horizon, we keep  hearing that perhaps that's close.  Any thoughts on the next deal that we  might see?  </p><p> Because markets are giving this president, I guess, some breathing room in  terms of his negotiation on these tariffs but at some point they're going  to want to see a real deal.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, you're right.  And you know, in business you have the --  you get -- you get ready for the sale but some point -- some point in time  you have to close the sale.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  And I think that Mexico could be the very next one.  Mexico is  our partner, is our neighbor.  There's a lot of -- a lot of things we can  coordinate with Mexico.  So, I'd like to see a deal there.  But I'm with  you.  I think a deal's around the corner, I haven't been told that.  But  when you negotiate, you negotiate for a reason and you negotiate for an end  and the president does it better than anybody.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Congressman, it's good to  see you this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> WILLIAMS:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Congressman Roger Williams joining us.</p><p> Coming up, Mickey Mouse to the rescue, details on the new way Disney is  helping parents get their kids to sleep.  That's coming up next.  </p><p> And then flying high, the new motorcycle powered by an aircraft engine,  check this out.  It's taking the internet by storm this morning.  And we're  going to tell you about it, coming up.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The footwear maker Crocs is closing the last of  its manufacturing plants.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  This is  interesting, the company says it's already closed its plant in Mexico and  one in Italy is going to close soon.  But it's unclear how they're going to  continue to produce their products.  </p><p> In addition, the company's executive vice president and CFO Carrie Teffner  is leaving.  The news was announced on the Earnings Call.  </p><p> Now, the company grew second quarter earnings and revenue by 4.7 percent  year over year.  Crocs became popular among hospital, restaurant workers,  boating fans and others, people that are on their feet all day, after they  launched in 2002.  Shares of Crocs are actually up 44 percent for the year.   The question is, where are they going to be making their shoes?  </p><p> All right, well, Disney is launching a sleep hotline to help parents put  their restless kids to bed.  The company even listed a sleep coach to help  with the hotline.  The Parents pick up the phone, they dial 8777-MICKEY.   They're going to be greeted by Mickey Mouse to tell the child it's time to  hit the hay.  There's other familiar voices you may know, Minnie Mouse,  Donald and Daisy Duck even Goofy.  You only get one character per call, so  choose wisely.  </p><p>Disney reported 77 percent of parents have a tough time getting the kids  down at night.  They're hoping this will maybe help them out.  Shares of  Disney are six percent higher so far for the year.  </p><p> And then there's this, how would you like to drive around in what I'm about  to show you?  This is the work of formula -- former Formula One driver  Tarso Marques, it's called the TMC Dumont.  It's got a 300-horsepower Rolls  Royce aircraft engine.  But the biggest thing, 36-inch hubless wheels,  these are the largest wheels ever made for a motorcycle.  It was recently  awarded the Best in Show at the Daytona Beach Bike Week Show.  So, there's  something for you if you want to ride around in that little puppy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's really not exercise, you're sitting there, it's like a  motorcycle, right?  </p><p> CASONE:  It's like a motorcycle.  Yes, with the Rolls Royce engine, so,  that's fun.  </p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  300 horsepower.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  (INAUDIBLE) That is -- that thing could go probably 300 miles an  hour.  Not that you would, but 300-horsepower is absurd for a motorcycle.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It is.</p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I think we  still need to talk about Crocs.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you upset about Crocs?  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, this -- could this be the death of Crocs?  Maybe a  lot of people are rejoicing outside because they're -- they haven't  announced.  It's unclear where their production facilities are going to be.   And they just launched the croc heel.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Not too long ago.  The women that are watching today, will  you wear the croc heel?  I wonder.  I wonder if it's going to -- I don't  know.  Could this be the end?  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, contract manufacturing, yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you say maybe they're outsourcing.  You're not sure?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I mean, yes.  Well, we have to assume it's contract  manufacturing somewhere since they didn't announce the end of the company  as far as I know.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, I want Disney to come up with a sleep line for adults.   Forget the kids.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  You want somebody to call?  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I want to be able to call Mickey and say I'm having a hard time.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Minnie?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  I guess, it all state a Mickey fan.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You can -- you can do it.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes, that's what we'll do.  We'll create a new hot line for  adults.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt will join me.  We're  talking Tesla, he's weighing in on the Securities and Exchange Commission  reportedly examining Elon Musk's tweet on Tesla private.  That according to  the Wall Street Journal this morning.</p><p> Then, suffering for a selfie, a new rise in plastic surgery patients asking  to look like their Snapchat filters.  Wait until you hear this.  Back in a  minute.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A disturbing new trend to tell you about,  teenagers are seeking plastic surgery to look like their filtered selfies.   People suffering from Snapchat Dysmorphia look for enhanced facial features  like those produced by photo filters.  </p><p> Joining us now is assistant professor of Dermatology at Boston University,  Dr. Neelam Vashi.  Dr. Vashi, good to see you this morning.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  </p><p> What can you tell us about this disturbing trend?  </p><p> DR. NEELAM VASHI, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF DERMATOLOGY, BOSTON UNIVERSITY:   Sure.  So, Snapchat Dysmorphia is a new phenomenon that we are seeing in  clinic.  It's a phenomenon of increased scrutiny over selfies and this new  trend we're seeing that has patients seeking out cosmetic procedures to not  only improve their look in selfies but also to look like filtered and  altered versions of themselves with perfect hair and unblemished skin,  smaller noses, fuller lips, bigger eyes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this is from teenagers?  </p><p> VASHI:  So, my patient population, I treat adults.  And so, what I am  seeing in clinic these days is a younger patient population.  And so, the  patients who are in their 20's to early 30's are often bringing in selfies.   They want to -- you know, firstly improve their look in a traditionally  taken selfie or look like an altered version of themself.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Dr. Vashi, this is Mike Huckabee.  First of all, not everybody  can look as beautiful as I do.  So, I realize plastic surgery is necessary  for some people.  But in all honesty, this done on a teenager, would this  not even constitute some level of malpractice if teenagers are having their  faces completely reshaped for reasons that have nothing to do with any  medical reason other than they want a line taken out?  I mean, for a  teenager to make this decision, I just find that frightening.  </p><p> VASHI:  So, I don't treat teenagers for this reason.  And I think that most  cosmetic dermatologists like myself and plastic surgeons also do not treat  teenagers in this type of fashion.  Yes, for medical reasons, such as a  nasal defect or cleft lip or palette younger kids and teenagers will get  plastic surgery but nor for cosmetic reasons.  </p><p> The -- we're calling Snapchat Dysmorphia a trigger to something more  serious called body dysmorphic disorder.  And body dysmorphic disorder does  actually present in the young teens years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> VASHI:  But Patients don't present to clinics until their early 30s and  that's because they don't have the means to obtain a plastic surgery or  some kind of cosmetic procedure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> VASHI:  And also, younger than 18 they need a patient consent.  Not only do  they have to have the means to have this type of treatment, they also have  to have a patient consent to obtain any -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Body dysmorphic disorder.  Kristina, they're blaming it on this  study, the study published in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery viewpoint, found  that apps like Snapchat and photo editing Facetune are to blame for this.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Facetune, so, we were talking about this before.  This is a  trend I've seen for quite some time which is why I almost don't trust  almost any photo online.  Because with some of these apps that you can but  in the app store, you can shrink your waist, you can shrink your arms, you  can change -- you can make your skin flawless, make your eye lashes longer,  make your teeth whiter, you can completely alter your online self.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Which I think is what is contributing to a lot of these  younger women and older woman wanting to change their facial features.  I  think it's horrible.  And it needs to stop.  But I guess, you got to delete  the apps or make them really, really expensive.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I don't know about the apps.  I mean, the apps certainly  you can change the picture.  But to actually take the picture and go to a  dermatologist and say make me look like this, I want to have plastic  surgery, that's where the horrible part of the story comes in.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, doctor, I'm wondering in terms of the scale here, how much  of your practice is now people coming in with specifically this issue?   They want to look like they do in an app?  </p><p> VASHI:  So, I get both.  I get patients who will bring in a selfie and say  they want to improve the look of the selfie.  They say they'll have a  facial asymmetry or a groove in the face.  </p><p> And then, I also have patients who do come in with a filtered photograph.   I had one patient come in with the crown of flowers from Snapchat, saying  she wanted to look like that filtered photograph.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, that's incredible.  Dr. Vashi, thanks so much.  We  appreciate your time this morning.  We'll be watching that.</p><p> VASHI:  You're very welcome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, trouble for Tesla, we've got Harvey Pitt former  chairman of the SEC weighing in, coming up next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly launching a probe into  Elon Musk's tweet about going private.</p><p> My interview with former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt is coming up this morning  to talk about that.

All stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network Kristina Partsinevelos is with us, the Wall  Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman is here and  former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee. </p><p> Great to see you everybody this morning.</p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Good to be with you, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Thanks.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Looking forward to your Harvey Pitt  interview, makes sense of this Elon Musk tweets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  What are the most important questions here?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, it's funny.  You think about these public statements being  so careful and then he fires off what looked like very casual comments but  I -- but I think it is a question.  What does he need to show secure  funding?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  And does this mean he's now obligated to bid for $120 now that  he's teased it on Twitter.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And where is he going to get that money?  I mean, who has  that money to acquire and take the company private? </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Should be -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's $75 billion.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  What about -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  And Harvey is the guy to answer these questions. </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Institutional investors.  So (INAUDIBLE) fact that their  share stake is five percent, one of the largest after Elon Musk when you  talk about insiding -- insiders and then you have five massive  institutional accounts like T. Rowe, these guys have big part.  So it's  either going to be existing shareholders, institutional investors or some  really rich guys from Silicon Valley.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Won't be me, let me just -- </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Or sovereign wealth fund. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see.  We know that the shorts certainly took a hit  on that which is what he was intending.  Our top story, Musk is under the  microscope this morning.  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that  Securities and Exchange Commission is in fact probing Elon Musk's tweet to  find out if it was truthful.  This after the Tesla CEO tweeted two o days  ago this and considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share.</p><p> Funding secured and with that, the stock rallied.  Joining me right now is  former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt.  Great to see you, Harvey.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p> HARVEY PITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION:  Good to be with  you, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think as a former chairman of the Securities and  Exchange Commission.  What is the SEC looking at?  Tell us where you see  potential wrongdoing here.</p><p> PITT:  Well, the entire announcement was highly problematic, and  unprecedented and it's important to realize it's not the medium but it's  the message.  Going private transactions are usually announced in advance  of the market opening or after the market closing.  They're not announced  in the middle day.  Mr. Musk tweeted in the middle of the day.  In addition  it's not the CEO who announces this, but it is the board.</p><p> It's the company that makes this announcement.  But here it was the CEO.   What's more important is he stressed that he already had funding to pay  $420 a share.  But no efforts have yet been done to find out whether it's  in the shareholders best interest to take the company private, and, if so,  at what price, so all of this raises two fundamental questions.  First, was  he trying to artificially influence the price of the stock?</p><p> If he was that would be manipulation.  Second, does he really have the  money in hand? And is it binding commitment that would give him almost $70  billion in what would be at the largest going private transaction in U.S.  history?  That would be fraud if those things were not true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  the SEC then needs to better understand what he was  referring to when he said $420 and funding secured.  Where would that money  come from? </p><p> PITT:  Well, it could come from either a consortium of banks, it could come  from foreign sovereign investor.  I mean -- the company did receive the big  cash infusion from Saudi Arabia the day that earnings were announced this  past week.  So it's possible that that kind of money might exist.  It's a  large amount and it would take a great deal of effort to put it together.   But it's not impossible.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Having said that, it's un-- it's unwise to be tweeting about  this in middle of the day creating activity in the stock.  Do you think the  SEC is also looking at that given the fact that on the Saudi Arabia  investment news, the stock gets rallied right before this announcement.  It   was up seven percent going into tweet and then up 11 percent after the  tweet.  </p><p> PITT:  It's definitely the wrong way to do this kind of thing.  It may not  be per se illegal, but it is definitely highly problematic and it could be  illegal depending on what his intentions were when he made the  announcement.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So is there a deadline here, Harvey, in terms of when he would  have to reveal his source of funding?  I mean, if he says funding secured  does the SEC want an answer now in terms of whether or not it's secured and  how long does he have to come up with whatever deal he was referring to? </p><p> PITT:  No.  I think he is required to demonstrate that at the time of his  tweet he already had a legally binding commitment for $420 a share.  That  would be the requirement, so the SEC can request or subpoena documents  asking for proof as to what his financing was and what the legal basis was  for his suggestion that it was secured which is a very strong term.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very strong term.  What's the penalty, Harvey, if Musk was just  -- I don't want to say lying but coming up with an idea that perhaps wasn't  necessarily intact funding secured, what's the penalty?  </p><p> PITT:  Well, we don't of course know if the facts are yet but the penalties  are quite serious.  If he committed fraud or manipulated the market, he  would be liable both civilly for an extreme amount of damages but also he  could have potential criminal liability as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why criminal? </p><p> PITT:  Because almost every violation of the Federal securities laws is  both a civil problem that the SEC pursues and also a potential criminal  issue that the Department of Justice pursues.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.  And so when do you expect we'll hear more about this?   I mean, for example, when are we going to better -- have a clearer idea  whether or not there was in fact funding in place?</p><p> PITT:  I would believe that the next set of announcements will come at some  point from Tesla itself.  The company will probably organize a special  committee of independent directors who will then indicate exactly where  matters stand and whether they are going to pursue Musk's suggest that the  company go private.  I don't think we will hear from the SEC until it has  completed its investigation.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about shareholder lawsuits, Harvey, are you expecting that  to also be an issue here?  Because I know that the short sellers loss at  lot of money on that as the stock went up and that's basically what I  assumed Elon Musk wanted to do because he's been sticking it to shorts and  he's, you know, uncomfortable with some of the criticism that the company  has received.</p><p> You saw a very upsetting conference call recently where he pushed back on  some of the criticism and the short sellers questioning about his burn  rate, how much cash is he burning?  So, are you expecting shareholder  lawsuits?  </p><p> PITT:  I think they are inevitable.  It's just a matter of time before  lawsuits are filed because of the enormous fluctuation in the price of the  stock.  I would think the shorts will bring a lawsuit against Mr. Musk and  Tesla.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there any precedence here, Harvey?  Have you ever seen  something like this before?  </p><p> PITT:  I've never seen anything like this kind of announcement.  I have  seen short sellers, sue certainly companies and I have certainly seen  companies sue short sellers.  It's a fact of life that if you're public,  you're going to get criticism and the shorts are people you just have to  live with. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And, obviously, that's what they are doing.  They're  critical of the company.  They're shorting the stock.  I mean, that's why  they exist.  So you're expecting the SEC to be asking questions about the  funding.  Any other questions coming from the SEC in your view?</p><p> PITT:  Well, I think they will look into why the board didn't make an  announcement sooner, why they waited for Mr. Musk to go for -- forward, and  I think they will also try to determine what kinds of behind-the-scenes  activities were taken by the company.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So in other words, background because the board is saying yes,  Harvey Pitt, the board is saying yes, that Elon Musk has discussed the  potential of going private with us before.  But there is no mention of any  $420 price.  </p><p> PITT:  No.  And where that price comes from is very hard to understand.  It  may be a very good price, but in terms of an economic analysis it may turn  out that it's not as good a price as should be paid for this company.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  I mean, when you're talking about $420 a share,  that's like $70 billion, right?  $75 billion? </p><p> PITT:  Yes.  And unprecedented amount of money, it truly is.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Harvey, it's great to see  you again.  Hope you'll come back soon.  Thanks so much for your insights  this morning.  </p><p> PITT:  Sure.  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Harvey Pitt joining us there.  And we'll take a short break.   When we come back.  The Tribune Media-Sinclair deal is dead.  Tribune says  that the $3.9 deal can no longer move forward after comments from SEC  Chairman Ajit Pai.  The latest coming up there.  Then half dress, half  bikini?  The new dress causing confusion online.  That's coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tribute Media called off its buyout by Sinclair  Broadcast Group.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Two deals that are dead  today, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We got two deals, that is  right, Maria.  First to Tribune, they've terminated their $3.9-billion deal  and they're suing Sinclair for breach of contract for not doing enough to  win approval from regulators.  You may remember last month, SEC Chairman  Ajit Pai said he had serious concerns about the merger.  Take a look at the  stocks, shares of Sinclair right now, they are lower in the premarket  trading.</p><p> Down more than three percent.  Tribune Media, not really trading it but  shares down more than 20 percent so far this year.  So two stocks to watch  now.  We're also watching shares of Rite-Aid right now.  The stock plunging  more than 10 percent in the premarket.  The sell-off coming after Rite-Aid  and Albertsons called off their $24 billion merger.  Some big Rite-Aid  shareholders plan to vote against the deal today.</p><p> Rite-Aid and Albertsons wanted to team up in order to compete better  against CBS, Walgreens and potentially as you know Amazon has been trying  to get into the pharmaceutical business as well. </p><p> All right.  Check this out.  A volcanic eruption in Chile gets a rider on a  ski list, the front row seat to the action all on tape.  The eruption shot  up a 5,000 foot column of dust and ash as he was filming all of this with  his cell phone.  This comes from a volcano complex that's in the Andes  Mountain but pretty incredible pictures and pretty close.  </p><p> And finally there is this.  We've seen some pretty weird fashion trends in  the last year, upside down shorts, plastic jeans.  Well, here is a new one.   This is a bikini and it's a dress, all in one.  This comes from the fashion  brand, PrettyLittleThing.  And after having one of their models wear it on  Instagram picture, people started to freak out.</p><p> There it is.  We'll let you decide.  Looks like she couldn't decide on what  to wear so she cut both in half and sewed them together.  Maybe.  Here's  another comment.  She's going to dinner, clubbing and swimming all at once.   Yes.  The whole thing goes for $35.00 maybe.  Maria, you could wear it with  some crack heels?  You know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CASONE:  That would be an interesting pairing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sure would.  So is it a -- is it a dress or is it a bikini?</p><p> CASONE:  It's both.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's both.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  Because --</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Why not have both?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're getting your money for it.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Remember the black or blue dress or is it blue or white  dress? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Same thing.  But I know about you.  I think, Governor, it  would look better own you with man-bun, crack heels.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Pretty sure it wouldn't.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Going to be strong with the man-bun.  Yes.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You got to really loving this man-bun.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  -- I would feel naked.  Oh.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  If I wear that without the man-bun I would just feel just naked.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  You thought of either of us wearing that is something that there  are television sets across America that are going to be off mode.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We don't want that.  We don't want that.  Coming up.  Viacom is  reporting quarterly earnings this morning.  We're breaking down those  numbers coming up next.  Big week for media.  Then overhauling the Oscars.   Details on new changes coming to the academy awards quarterly including the  addition of a popular film category, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Both parent company of the Fox Business Network, 21st Century  Fox quarterly profit nearly doubled due to cable and film strength.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching the stock  and the overall market this morning.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  we talked about 21st Century Fox, our parent and it beat on top and bottom  line.  The analyst have to optimism there as you noted in those particular  areas and that's exactly what came.  In fact it did better than expected.   Deadpool 2, the strength of Fox News just among the reasons why we did see  it beat the 18 percent year over year.</p><p> Revenue increase, strong double-digit growth across all the segments and  the new and obviously what happened, the transaction, Disney and the new  Fox transactions, that -- they say unlocked enormous shareholder value.  In  fact when you take a look at the stock over the fiscal year it's about 75  percent gain, that clearly outpaces the S&amp;P 500.  And the media group which  actually has declined over that period.</p><p> Of course, there's still locked in the -- in the bidding war with CMSCA and  that would be Comcast, but -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You check that?</p><p> PETALLIDES:  We'll watch that.  So that is the big difference.  Also, last  but not least, we're taking a look at Viacom this morning and that came in  profit top revenue fell and there was the slump in ad sales which fell  short.  And that number which I did talk about the increased shareholder  value I did get from the 21st Century Fox headlines themselves.  Back to  you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic.  Thank you so much.  Nicole, we'll be watching  all of that.  Switching gears to the censorship of conservatives on social  media.  It has the attention of lawmakers now including House Majority  Leader Kevin McCarthy who talked to us about this as well as House  Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes who want - both want answers on action.   Listen to this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  I want to see bias  stop, especially going after conservatives.  I mean, just look at three  points that showed up in Google right before the primary election in  California.  The party of Lincoln, the party of Reagan, that's not what it  said, it said Nazism.  </p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I don't  know what Twitter is up to.  It sure looks to me like they're censoring  people and they ought -- they ought to stop it and we're looking at any  legal remedies that we can go through.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  So that was Devin Nunes and Kevin McCarthy.  Kevin  McCarthy was talking about remember right before the primary elections in  California.  You Googled GOP California and in the search results got  Naziism.  Your thoughts, Governor.  I know this is an important topic to  you. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, it really is an important topic.  We talk about Russian  interference.  I'm worried about social media interference.  How are they  manipulating elections, how are they manipulating the information and the  question comes as somebody who doesn't really like government regulation  and intervention, we're headed there.</p><p> We're going to get it because social media platforms are no longer just  social media where people chit-chat about their yoga classes and their  daughter's wedding, they're now the place where people get news, they are  public utilities just like electricity, water, cable television and  telephone.  And so government is going to step in at some point.  I think  sooner than later and they're going to regulate them.</p><p> The social media companies will rue the day when they started favoring one  point of view over another.  But here's why that matters.  Would Americans  tolerate it if you paid differently for your electricity, your water or  your telephone based on your political view of where you went to church?   You would be outraged.  Liberal conservative or independent, you'd be  outraged.  That's what we're seeing today.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And there's also so-called, shadowed banning, James, I mean --</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, I mean, I had put out a tweet about James Clapper  basically admitting on CNN that President Obama directed the Intelligence  Agencies to launch investigation for the special counsel on the Trump- Russia and I -- and I -- and basically Jim Clapper -- James Clapper  admitted it on CNN.  So I tweeted that out, it got no life, no -- and I  thought, you know, this is something that I know my followers care about.</p><p> And I felt to myself, hmm, is that shadow banning?  I don't know.  I wonder  if my followers saw that tweet or if it just went on deaf ears.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, we've had a bunch of these teases where certainly  conservative viewpoints seem to be suppressed.  The answers from Silicon  Valley generally are often not denials but sort of saying, well, it wasn't  intentional, it's the algorithm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But somebody programs the algorithm change.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, I agree.  I think there's enough ear to say there is a  problem of bias.  It's -- I think it -- I'm hoping first there's a consumer  remedy, we've seen user growth surprisingly kind of flattened --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  In these recent earnings reports but I'm hoping it can be  disciplined either through customer behavior or maybe it has to be private  litigation as opposed to creating a new Federal internet regulator and I  think that's the big danger here is that the big tech giants are trying to  cut a deal with both parties in Washington that gives them liability  protection but it also sets up the Federal Trade Commission to have huge  powers over the internet.</p><p> And this could -- this is actually a deal that could happen, very quickly,  I think, and that is the anger I see for innovation because the utility  model you don't get a lot of innovation out of the phone company, the water  company, et cetera.  So I'm hoping there is a market remedy for this and  maybe consumers, you know, are starting to say I want -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I mean, I wish there was a market remedy, I would much rather  see it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  But these companies are --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Some competition.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  -- hearing the bells.  I mean, they're bringing it upon  themselves because they are actively suppressing the points of view of  certain people and when they do that, the market is going to rise up and I  think -- </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  What about Alex Jones and certain hate groups, they're  censoring certain things that are clearly fake, if you want to say it, fake  news and he is discounting Sandy Hook and the children and families there.   So when he's -- when somebody is putting out inaccurate facts that have  been proven to be wrong then why not get rid of him?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, that's a fun --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, this is why we're talking about it.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- user organization.  But of course, these social media  companies have enjoyed a lot of legal protection on the basis that they are  not news organizations, that it's an open platform anyone in public.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Now that they're making those kind of judgments, they better be  ready for different treatment --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE:  And the first amendment protects stupidity, it protects outrages  speech.  I don't like it but it does protect it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  We got the PPI on the  other side of this break.  Stay with us.  Producer Price Index, we'll take  a look at inflation.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday,  August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  We  are just getting the Producer Price Index out.  It is unchanged.  A gain of  three-tenths of a percent was expected, and that's what it looks like this  morning, unchanged on the Producer Price Index.  Not a major reaction from  markets this morning.  We've been looking at a fractional move all morning.   Dow Industrials right now up 20 points, S&amp;P 500 up three, and the NASDAQ up  4-1/2.  Initial jobless claims also out right now, down 6,000.  </p><p> Global markets action in Europe this morning, take a look at European  indices, obviously down across the board.  FT-100 down 50 points, that's  two-thirds of one percent.  The CAC Quarante is down a quarter of a  percent, 16 points lower, and the DAX Index in Germany is flat, down six  points.  In Asia Overnight, the standout was China.  Chinese markets  bouncing back on hopes to the stimulus against U.S. tariffs.  Shanghai  Composite up almost two percent.  And PPI is out, unchanged on the session  versus a two-tenths of a percent estimate, James Freeman.  Your thoughts on  where we are on inflation.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Pretty benign environment right now, the economy is  humming, fast growth but inflation not yet raging even though the Feds  still has this huge balance sheet they acquired in the wake of the  financial crisis.  So, I think the hope here is that as we transition back  to the real economy, we can do it without an inflation surge.  And so far  so good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And year-over-year, Kristina, on inflation on the PPI is 3.3  percent, very much in step with what we've been -- what we've been  expecting.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.  And if anything, maybe this can add to the argument  that wage growth hasn't been climbing higher.  So, now that inflation is  staying relatively flat, that's OK because of wage growth not climbing high  enough or lasted a while.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wages have just been creeping up, the 2.8 percent higher  year-over-year on wages, we'll keep following that and any impact on  markets this morning.  We have breaking news right now out of North Korea.   North Korea says that if the Trump administration, \"adheres to all  scenarios,\" then there's no chance of progress on denuclearization.  Blake  Burman is live at the White House this morning with more on that.  Blake,  good morning to you.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria, good morning to you as well.  This obviously raises more questions  about just how intent North Korea is on resolving the issue of  denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  The headline that is coming out this  morning is that the North Koreans say that if the Trump administration  adheres to old scenarios, it cannot expect any progress on  denuclearization, something that the White House certainly will watch  throughout the day.  And of course, the upcoming weeks and months as the  President right now is in Bedminster, New Jersey for a week off on what the  White House is characterizing as a working vacation.</p><p> Meantime, here in Washington later today, the Vice President Mike Pence  will lay out what the administration hopes to deploy in the upcoming years  that being a sixth branch of the military, the Space Force.  The President  said earlier this summer that he wanted the military to build out this new  branch of government.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now, our destiny beyond the  Earth is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national  security.  When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely  have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in  space.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  The Air Force already though has a robust presence patrolling  outer space especially as it relates to the use and deployment of  satellites.  That responsibility would go to the Space Force which would be  responsible for conducting war plans for space, but there are many  questions here, including how the military would be reshaped.  The defense  secretary James Mattis admitting earlier this week that they are still  trying to work out on how the actual organization would take place within  the military.  By the way, Maria, there is also the congressional issue on  this one as well because a sixth branch of the military would need  Congressional approval and, of course, Congressional funding.  We will hear  from the Vice President later today, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman with the  latest there.  Joining us right now is Fox News Legal Analyst and author of  the new book, \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton  and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett is with us.  Gregg, great to see  you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  And as I read the title and as I report  on what has teken place in the 2016 election.  It seems exactly accurate in  terms of what happened.</p><p> JARRETT:  Thank you.  Well, you would know because you have done so much to  further the story yourself.  I wrote this book because actually I became  incensed in outraged, the top officials at the FBI and the Department of  Justice were abusing their positions of power to subvert the rule of law,  and undermine the democratic process, and I think I lay out a fairly  persuasive case here of the facts, the evidence, and the law, that this was  a cesspool of corruption.  And by the way, it still is, because they  continue to cover it up.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the latest has a real focus on Bruce Ohr, the number three  guy at the DOJ, whose wife worked for Fusion GPS.</p><p> JARRETT:  I mean, talk about an incestuous collection of corrupt acts.  You  know, the FBI knew that Christopher Steele, who phonied up the anti-Trump  dossier, was already on the payroll of Hillary Clinton, he was on the  payroll of the FBI.  And when the FBI finally fired Christopher Steele,  their regulations say you can't have any more contact with him, so they  were very devious.  They used Bruce Ohr at the Department of Justice as the  conduit, the intermediary.  The FBI continued to receive Christopher Steele  information, spying on Trump after he was inaugurated for several months  thereafter.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know, what gets me, Governor, is, you know, it feels  like the left in their hatred of President Trump, so much they've thrown  out all ideals, they've thrown out values of, you know, the law of the  land, and it was OK to spy on Carter Page, oh, because it's Trump.  You  know, it's OK to abuse your power at the top of the FBI, oh, it's Trump.   It's incredible.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, it is incredible.  And Gregg, congratulations on the book.</p><p> JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  It reads like a novel.  The frightening thing is that it's not  fiction, it's fact, and you lay out an incredibly compelling case in a  chronological order, which I think is a great value to the reader.  So,  it's a -- it's a powerful book.  We've seen the weaponization of the  agencies of our federal government going after a presidential candidate in  a fashion we've never seen before, the highest levels.  But when they are  using their own power in this way, to create a false dossier, on which the  warrant is obtained, legally, does that not put them with the fruit of the  poisonous tree, and so that whatever they end up would be able to be pushed  back because they got it illegally?</p><p> JARRETT:  Yes, absolutely, under the exclusionary rule, it would be  excluded as evidence.  The law enforcers became the lawbreakers.  And  what's outrageous is --</p><p> HUCKABEE:  That's powerful statement.</p><p> JARRETT:  Yes, they're not being investigated and prosecuted.  I lay out  myriad of potential crimes here, by people like Andrew McCabe, James Comey,  and you know, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and the list goes on and on, things  like abusive power which is a felony.  Obstruction of justice, they  obstructed their own investigation to clear Hillary Clinton.  And on the  same day they cleared her, Comey is standing in front of cameras, his FBI  is meeting secretly in London with Christopher Steele to begin the frame  job on President Trump, then-candidate Trump.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  And you say that this all started when then-FBI director  Jim Comey cleared Hillary Clinton in the e-mail server probe back in 2016.   Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  Although, we did not find clear  evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws  governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that  they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly- classified information.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, while they were putting together a narrative about Donald  Trump, they were very easy on Hillary Clinton.  And they basically did not  investigate.</p><p> JARRETT:  Absolutely.  And it was one deception, and I believe, lie after  another from James Comey as you saw there on that very day.  He had  originally written it, Hillary Clinton committed crimes.  He wrote it down  twice, gross negligence, but his staff said, well, you can't clear her if  you put that in your statement, so they sit down at Peter Strzok's computer  and they expunge from Comey's statements, those incriminating words and  other allegations of criminality by Hillary Clinton.  The swamp didn't want  to be drained.  And a potential President Trump jeopardized their ambitions  and positions of power, so they sought to damage his candidacy, and when  they didn't do that and he was elected, they sought to undo the election.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  James?</p><p> FREEMAN:  And the -- when you talk about the swamp going after now- President Trump, but then-candidate Trump, do we have a sense yet of  exactly when this began?  There seems to have been I think a real challenge  for Congressional investigators figuring out when was the real beginning of  whether it was intelligence or law enforcement assets descending on the  Trump campaign?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this is what Devin Nunes is investigating right now, what  happened before actual launch of the investigation, which, of course, was  July 2016?</p><p> JARRETT:  Some of the documents that Devin Nunes is trying to get his hands  on that Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray will not hand over the origins  of the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, it looks to me like, the FBI  began spying on the Trump campaign seven months before they formally signed  the papers launching the investigation.  And by the way, when they signed  those papers, they violated their own FBI guidelines, there was no probable  cause, no evidence of crimes, no plausible intelligence for  counterintelligence probe, they broke the law and the rules.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think there'll be any accountability here?  </p><p> JARRETT:  Not with Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein at the helm of the  Department of Justice.  And that's a sad commentary on our system of  justice right now.  But Sessions is utterly feckless and Rosenstein, I  think, is trying to continue to cover up his own wrongdoing.  This is a guy  who should have recused himself the moment he appointed Mueller.  You can't  be a prosecutor and a key witness all rolled into one.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because he OK'd the fourth FISA warrant.</p><p> JARRETT:  That's right.  And you can only do that when you have new  evidence.  The best we can tell so far, they have no new evidence.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And there wasn't any evidence from the get-go, it was just the  dossier.</p><p> JARRETT:  That's right.  And the FBI knew that the dossier was totally  fabricated.  You can read it online, I've read it a hundred times.  I never  failed to laugh.  You know, it is the work of an amateur dime novelist in  junior high school.  And even Christopher Steele who wrote it, said, in  court papers under oath in Great Britain, which I dug up, and it's in the  book, that it's unverifiable because it was a guy who told a guy, who told  the guy, who told me.  Triple, quadruple hearsay based on anonymous  sources.  You can't use that sort of thing in a court of law.  Get the FBI  and DOJ, use it to gain a warrant to wiretap -- that's abuse of power to  fraud on the court.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, this is one political party spying on the -- on their  opponent, there on the left.</p><p> JARRETT:  Right.  And where's the outrage over Hillary Clinton paying for  all of this?  Now, that is a violation of the law.  The Trump Tower  meeting, perfect legal.  All the media has to do is read the federal  campaign election act.  Foreign nationals may participate in American  political campaigns and providing any information is not a thing of value.   But stonewalling to Congress is something I do not understand why it  continues.  They have a constitutional obligation to give Congress what it  wants.  And Congress should use the power of the purse and cut off the  money.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Into the oversight agency.</p><p> JARRETT:  That's the only way to have.  Yes.  Absolutely.  But I blame  Congress because for decades, whenever the Department of Justice and FBI  didn't want to hand over documents, they just said we're not going to do  it, and Congress never took action.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> JARRETT:  So, it's been habitual.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, the President could order all of this declassified.</p><p> JARRETT:  And he should.  I think he is considering it, but you know, there  are -- there are those advising him not to.  He should absolutely order  declassification of a FISA application documents, the Gang of Eight  documents and the origin documents.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The American people have a right to know and they want to know.   \"The Russia Hoax,\" is the book, \"The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary  Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much.</p><p> JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  Great to see you.</p><p> JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have breaking news right now we want to get to, Russian  Foreign Ministry is saying this, Moscow will work on retaliatory measures  in response to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia, it's according to  Reuters this morning.  The U.S. imposed new sanctions tied to the nerve  agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter, that of course,  breaking this week.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Uber and Lyft hitting a roadblock in New York  City.  The city council voted to limit the number of vehicles on the  streets.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to  weigh in.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  You  know, I think there's a backlash coming to this thing.  As you say, the  Mayor of New york is imposing a cap on the number of Uber and Lyft cars  allowed in the city.  In my opinion, that leaves a lot of wait times and to  higher prices.  But there's something else going on here, yellow cabs have  often been accused (INAUDIBLE) regular taxicabs in New York City often  accused of not picking up people of color because of their color.  Uber has  a way out.  </p><p> Uber doesn't care what color you are, Uber doesn't care what your ethnicity  is, they pick you up, it's all electronic.  Well, that is going to be  capped at the -- basically at the doings of the willing of the taxi  industry.  I think there's a backlash coming here from the minorities.   Worse yet, I think there's going to be -- I think New York City will be  used as a template as a test case for other cities in America and around  the world, which want to fence in Uber, because they are devastating the  local taxi industry.  I think this is the wrong decision on so many levels,  and I hope it's withdrawn, I don't think it will be but it should be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meaning there's a lot of backlash because, you know, look what  happened to the taxis.  The prices of the medallion plummeted.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, the medallion was 2 -- was 1.3 million in 2013, and now it's  between 160 and 250,000.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p> VARNEY:  That's a huge loss of capital for the taxi owners and this is  their way of pushing back.  But I think the pushback is very detrimental to  many, many people.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that.  Stu, I know you'll have more on  that in about 10 minutes.  We'll see you then top of the hour \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.   Join Stuart in the next few minutes.  But first, overhauling the Oscars,  details on the new changes coming to the Academy Awards including the  addition of a popular film category, that's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  -- arts and sciences cutting  the link to the show and introducing a category for outstanding achievement  in popular film.  Critics have complained that the broadcast is too long,  too boring, too political, too condescending -- oh, maybe that's just my  view.</p><p> Audiences would appear to agree, giving me telecast, its lowest ratings on  record last February when a mere 26.5 million people tuned in.  Remember,  the Super Bowl got 107 million.  Academy CEO Dawn Hudson said the board is,  quote, committed to producing an entertaining show in three hours.  Wow.   Three -- it takes you three hours?  The move was met with a frenzy of  criticism, particularly from in the street journalists.  Atlantic reporter  David Sims called the (INAUDIBLE) award, the Black Panther memorial award  for movie that were afraid won't get a big picture -- best picture  nominations.  Other called it lazy, ham-handed.  In recent years, hit films  like \"Wonder Woman\" have been snubbed by Oscar, although blockbusters from  the past like \"Gone With the Wind\" were heavily recognized.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, good changes?</p><p> WILLIS:  Not the right changes necessary (INAUDIBLE) always a good idea.   Can we do this in like 30 minutes or something?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Three hours.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  You can get a kidney replacement in less time and it's not as  painful as watching the Oscars.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on the changes.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  People like -- I remember when I was a kid, I used to love  watching it because you'd never know who would win and you'd sit around  together, and then the outfits, so I don't think that they're really going  to shorten it that much, but they have lost viewership, for sure, because  there's --</p><p> WILLIS:  It's brutal.  I always (INAUDIBLE) 4 million people every single  night, OK?  I mean, think about it.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  But also the performance.  The performances and the actors  and the comedians in between sets, those are -- that's pretty decent stuff,  and sometimes there's controversy that comes out of it, so that's what I  would watch for.  I don't watch it, but --</p><p> WILLIS:  I thought you'd see the fashion and would be happy.  That's all I  really need.</p><p> FREEMAN:  I think beyond the suffocating politics, they just -- you have  too many movies that almost no one in the television audience has seen so I  understand what they're trying to do here.  Maybe they ought to just  recognize some of these films that a lot of Americans think were the best  pictures: \"American Sniper\" -- I mean, most people would say that's a great  movie, right?</p><p> WILLIS:  Right.  Well, this popcorn award, that's what they're trying to  do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The popular film.</p><p> WILLIS:  Yes, popular film.  But you know, that's sort of like a ghetto for  popular -- you know, like, though, it should really win the major  categories.  You know what I mean?  It should be elevated to the level of  \"Gone With the Wind,\" lots of very popular movies in previous years won  those awards, not anymore.</p><p> FREEMAN:  People don't watch the Oscars, though, because they want a  political lecture that insults half of America.  They want to -- they want  to escape from all of that and have entertainment.  When the celebrities go  up there and lecture us and preach to us and point their fingers --</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  They don't do that all the time during Oscars.  I'm going  to fight back against that.  If you watch the full show --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's become much more political.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  -- not all politics.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But it has become much more political.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  It doesn't have to be all politics, but when all the politics  they have is negative toward half the population, what happens?  People say  I'll watch paint dry before I'll sit here and watch this.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  There's always going to be something that's going to offend  somebody out there, and usually, politics makes for good comedy.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  But their ratings are tanking.  It's not working.  Maybe they  should listen to us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Gerri, good stuff.</p><p> WILLIS:  I'm staying 30 minutes.  I think I'm going to --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Stay with  us.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel right  now.  Governor Huckabee?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  I want to say thanks to James Freeman for writing a book called  \"Borrowed Time,\" and giving really powerful insight into the financial  crisis, I think it's a very, very important book, people need to read it,  and I hope they will.  James, I want it to be a bestseller.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Thanks, Governor.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  \" Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and Bailouts at  Citi.\"  Check out the book.  Congratulations.</p><p> FREEMAN:  I just want to say that the Governor is very handsome and very  charming man.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> FREEMAN:  And a model American citizen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kristina?</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, I'm not going to -- I'm going to take a serious route  just because we haven't been able to --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, this is serious.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is serious stuff right here.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  You bring a wonderful book and you're a gorgeous man.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Now, the timing just seems so awkward.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell us.  This is an important story, too.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  This is an important story, but you guys are great.  Saudi  Arabia and Canada, the relations going on between both those countries,  Canada foreign affairs minister tweeting about the human rights -- two  human rights activists in Saudi.  Saudi is saying, you can't tell us  anything and what to do.  So, I think that's just a big story, a big story.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll follow that.  Kristina Partsinevelos, James  Freeman, Mike Huckabee, great to see, everybody.  Thank you so much.  Great  show, everybody.  We'll see you again tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is now.   Stuart, take it away.</p><p> VARNEY:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  And good morning, everyone.  August  9th, yes, mid-summer, dog days of summer, summer doldrums, not if --</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

He and his cofounders sold their artificial intelligence company DeepMind to Google for 400 million (now $486 million) in 2014. Suleyman dropped out of university and worked as an activist before getting involved in artificial intelligence. In August 2019 news emerged that he was taking \"time out\" from DeepMind, although it isn't clear why.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] Mustafa Suleyman is one of the three cofounders of DeepMind, an artificial intelligence[2] (AI) lab in London that was acquired by Google[3] in 2014 for a reported 400 million \u2014 the search giant's largest acquisition in Europe to date. Listen to a few of Suleyman's talks on YouTube and you'll quickly realise that he's a left-leaning activist who wants to make the world a better place for everyone as opposed to an elite few.He differs from many of today's tech founders in that he genuinely seems to care about the welfare of everyone on the planet. </p><p>The 35-year-old \u2014 affectionately known as \"Moose\" internally at DeepMind and among his friends \u2014 lives in Peckham, South London, with his artist fiance. He can often be seen on Twitter[4] making his thoughts known on issues like homelessness, diversity, and inequality, and also once retweeted Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. DeepMind may be owned by one of the largest companies in the world but Suleyman strongly believes capitalism is failing society in a number of areas. He explained this during a talk at a Google event in 2017. \"We believe today that in some sense, capitalism in many ways has delivered so much for us over the last couple of centuries,\" Suleyman said at a Google ZeitgeistMinds event[5] in London. \"We've delivered so much progress. No other construct or idea has been able to distribute benefits so broadly and so rapidly. And yet in many areas, capitalism is currently failing us. We actually need a new kind of set of incentives to tackle some of the most pressing and urgent social problems and we need a new kind of tool, a new kind of intelligence, that is distributed, that is scaled, that is accessible, to try and make sense of some of the complexity that is overwhelming us.\" DeepMind's not-so-simple mission is to solve intelligence and then to use that to solve everything else. The company is building complex algorithms that can learn for themselves using techniques similar to those seen in the human brain. Ultimately, it hopes to end up with something that works like an artificial hippocampus \u2014 the part of the brainthat is mainly associated with memory, and long-term memory in particular. Since its incorporation in 2011, DeepMind has been aggressively hiring some of the smartest computer scientists, neuroscientists, mathematicians, and physicists around the world. As of 2018 it employed around 700 people across offices in the UK (London), Canada (Edmonton and Montreal), and the US (Mountain View). The vast majority of DeepMind's staff (over 500 people) are currently located across two floors in Google's main office in London's King's Cross. Unlike his cofounders, Suleyman does not have a background in science. As a result, he is more focused on the business side of the company and today he is trying to find applications for DeepMind's technology both inside and outside of Google while also ensuring that the company's work in AI remains safe and ethical. Suleyman grew up in North London and developed a passion for philosophy Suleyman grew up just off Caledonian Road in North London where he lived with his parents and his two younger brothers. His father was a Syrian-born taxi driver and his mother was an English nurse in the NHS. Suleyman went to Thornhill Primary School (a state school in Islington) followed by the free, but selective, Queen Elizabeth boys school in Barnet. Suleyman read widely as a child, according to a Wired feature on DeepMind from June 2015[6], developing an early love for philosophy. He also had a passion for business and entrepreneurship from an early age and he wasn't afraid to try to hustle his fellow students on the school playground. When I started secondary school at 11, me and my best friend started selling sweets in the playground. \"Ever since I was a kid I was always starting small businesses and dreaming they would one day grow like crazy,\" Suleyman told Business Insider. \"When I started secondary school at 11, me and my best friend started selling sweets in the playground. We would go to the wholesaler and buy in bulk and rent people's lockers to store them in. We started hiring other kids out at break-times to sell for us. It got pretty big before the teachers shut it down.\" Suleyman moved from selling sweets in the playground to exploring how he could help the disabled in his spare time. \"A few years later, a team of us got together and spent a summer visiting restaurants and attractions across London in a wheelchair we borrowed to review their accessibility for disabled people,\" he said. \"Based on that, we published an 80-page guide to London for young disabled people. \"It's part of the reason why I believe so strongly[7] that if we rewrite the incentives for businesses today to include social responsibility in addition to fiduciary duties, plenty of leaders will jump at the chance to redirect their energies toward building a better, fairer world.\" As a straight A student, Suleyman could afford to be fairly selective about where he went to university. He chose to go to Oxford \u2014 one of the top (and most elite) universities in the world \u2014 to read philosophy and theology. Interestingly, Suleyman joined Oxford's Mansfield College, known for leading the charge[8] on anti-elitism at the university; nine in 10 of the students it admitted in 2017 came from state schools. \"Philosophy and theology is an interesting course and I thought it was a nice combination,\" Suleyman said. \"Mansfield is an amazing place to study theology, and my tutor was one of the leaders in the field.\"But Suleyman realised that he didn't want to focus on education in his late teenage years. Young and eager to get out into the world and use his intelligence to have an impact, he dropped out of the centuries-old institution at 19 because he didn't feel like his degree was practical enough. \"Throughout my life, I've always been focused on maximizing social impact with everything I do,\"said Suleyman. \"At the time, I was enjoying studying philosophy and theology but it felt so abstract and impractical to me. \"Like many teenage activists I guess I was restless and angry at what I saw as such widespread injustice and inequality. And I felt compelled to do something to help people directly in the wider world.\"Suleyman dropped out of Oxford to set up a counselling service for young MuslimsAfter dropping out, Suleyman and his university friend Mohammed Mamdaniset up a telephone counselling service called the Muslim Youth Helpline which went on tobecome one of the largest mental health support services of its kind in the UK. \"I wanted to broaden my scope to tackle social challenges affecting all of society, not just a specific subgroup,\" Suleyman said. \"At the Helpline I realised that the problems many of our service users were facing were actually rooted in the wider systemic inequalities and prejudices present in broader society.\" At 22, Suleyman left Muslim Youth Helpline after realising non-profit organisations are held back by multiple factors. \"After three or four years, I realised in some sense the fundamental limitations of charities,\" Suleyman told The Financial Times[9]. \"It was really difficult to scale the organisation and to raise funds in a sustainable way.\"He went on to work for former London mayor Ken Livingstone. \"When I got an offer to work for Mayor Ken Livingstone on human rights policy, it seemed like a brilliant opportunity to to fight the systemic injustices that create so much of the suffering I saw first hand at the Helpline.\" He left City Hall when he realised that government wasn't the vehicle to promote radical systemic change either. \"It was pretty challenging and despite all of the high-minded principles it was actually really difficult to get practical things done on a day-to-day basis,\" Suleyman told the FT.Suleyman worked with the UN, the US government, and ShellFollowing his stint in politics, Suleyman helped to cofound a consultancy called Reos Partners, which aims to help drive change on global issues like food production, waste, and diversity. \"[Through Reos Partners] I ended up working for a whole bunch of different organisations including the UN, the US government, the Dutch government, WWF, Shell,\" he told the FT. His work for Shell was on sustainability-related projects. \"We worked all over the world, ended up growing [Reos Partners], which is still going today, to about five or six offices around the world \u2014 specialising in large scale conflict resolution and negotiation.\" Suleyman left Reos Partners in 2010 aftera year-long piece of facilitation work at the Copenhagen climate negotiations left him feeling frustrated.\"There was a very natural alignment back in late 2009, early 2010 when I had just sort of finished the climate negotiations, which of course were at the time a massive disaster and everybody was really broken hearted\" he told the FT. He added: \"Traditional vehicles for addressing climate change \u2014 the various meetings and minds, grassroots campaigning, high level political negotiations, waiting for spontaneous market driven outcomes \u2014 were, to put it bluntly, just not working fast enough.Time and again we found ourselves failing to come to grips with a dizzyingly complex world, with groups of the smartest experts struggling to make sense of the relationship between cause and effect. \"Of course climate change is just one of many strands of a complex, interdependent, and dynamic set of problems that we currently face as a species. If we don't tackle these problems, the future of humanity and the planet is at best uncertain.At worst, it's an extremely grim prognosis.\"DeepMind was born in London in 2009Realising the potential that technology and AI have to benefit the world, Suleyman set up DeepMind around the end of 2009 with his childhood friend Demis Hassabis and a New Zealander called Shane Legg. Before incorporating DeepMind, Suleyman and Hassabis (who were friends through Hassabis's younger brother) had many deep discussions and debates about how to improve the world. They typically approached the matter from different angles but they both say they're fundamentally motivated by the opportunity to alleviate human suffering at scale, and they've talked about how best to do that endlessly. \"Demis and I grew up in the same neighborhood and his younger brother and I were \u2014 and still are \u2014 best friends,\" said Suleyman. \"We often had conversations about how to improve and impact the world \u2014 from solving inequality to malnutrition. He felt the solutions would come through simulations that could model the complex dynamics in the world causing these problems, while I would always emphasize more near-term practical change efforts. \"Building and applying general purpose learning systems combined our two different approaches. And after working in many different arenas \u2014 from government to think tanks and the charity sector \u2014 trying to tackle our most intractable social challenges, it was clear to me that we needed new institutions, creativity and knowledge in order to navigate the growing complexity of our social systems. Reapplying existing human knowledge was not going to be enough. Starting a new kind of organisation with the single purpose of building AI and using it to solve the world's toughest problems was our best shot at having a transformative, large scale impact on society's most pressing challenges.\" Suleyman is well-liked across DeepMind and the UK tech sector. Peers have said they liked the fact that he's humble and down to Earth, and they respect the fact that he's willing to talk about difficult issues like equal pay and capitalism in a way that many other tech leaders aren't. He's seen by some as a revolutionary and whether he realises it or not, may people are more than willing to sign up to his mission and his way of thinking. In the company's early days, Suleyman made several trips to Silicon Valley and successfully convinced billionaires like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk to invest in DeepMind, telling them that he and his cofounders planned to hoover up as much brain power in Europe as they could and get these smart young people working on the most advanced AI systems on the planet. Frank Meehan, an early investor in DeepMind and a former board member on virtual assistant startup Siri, which was acquired by Apple in 2010, said he first met Suleyman when DeepMind employed about six or seven people and was based out of a tiny office in London's Russell Square. \"Mustafa is a key part of the whole thing,\" Meehan told Business Insider. \"He's confident, he's energetic, and he stays on top of things,\" said Meehan. \"He's focused and he gets things done.\" Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA), former head of the No 10 Policy Unit, and an independent reviewer of DeepMind Health, described Suleyman as an \"open\" and \"rounded\" leader, adding that he respects his willingness to talk about the big issues facing the world's tech giants. \"Everyone thinks if Mustafa is running the world it would be a pretty amazing place, to be honest,\" Taylor told Business Insider. Taylor said that if he were to take a cynical view of DeepMind, \"the question is whether or not he is someone inside the system genuinely transforming the culture of Google, or, if you were cynical, is he the kind of acceptable face for an industry that knows it has its issues but is actually going to plough on regardless?\" But he later clarified on Twitter[10] that he has a \"very positive\" view of Suleyman and the company. Commenting on his relationship with Suleyman, Hassabis said: \"Mustafa is a fantastic cofounder \u2014 we were family friends growing up together in North London and we share a deep belief in the potential of scientific and technical advances for positive social change. He brilliantly leads our applied and commercial efforts including spearheading our work in healthcare and energy, as well as being a respected thought leader on the ethical and societal impact of AI.\"Suleyman has been leading DeepMind's health projectsDeepMind's algorithms have been used by Google to reduce the amount of energy[11] used in its vast fleet of enormous data centres by 15%. \"Anything that we can do to reduce the amount of energy required to deliver the same service is fantastic for the planet and has a very significant dollar impact at the bottom line, which is also good,\" Suleyman said in July 2016. Google has also used DeepMind's[12] WaveNet neural network[13] to generate the Google Assistant voices for US English and Japanese.Looking outside Google, Suleyman, who oversaw and grew DeepMind Health's team[14], convinced several NHS trusts to work with DeepMind on projects including a patient monitoring app for clinicians and an AI system that can learn to spot early signs of cancer. DeepMind's work with the NHS didn't get off to the best start and Suleyman found himself in the spotlight when a freedom of information request from New Scientist revealed the extent of a data-sharing agreement with the Royal Free Trust in North London, which was DeepMind's first NHS deal. The deal \u2014 which was laterdeemed illegal by the Information Commissioner's Office[15], the UK's top data regulator \u2014 gave DeepMind access to 1.6 million NHS patient records to help it build a kidney monitoring app called Streams. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement at the time: \"There's no doubt the huge potential that creative use of data could have on patient care and clinical improvements, but the price of innovation does not need to be the erosion of fundamental privacy rights. Our investigation found a number of shortcomings in the way patient records were shared for this trial. Patients would not have reasonably expected their information to have been used in this way, and the Trust could and should have been far more transparent with patients as to what was happening.\" A little over a year later, the firm published research on detecting around 50 different eye diseases[16]. Under Google's management, Suleyman's role began to change. In November 2018 DeepMind's health team, including Streams, was absorbed into a new Google subsdiary called Google Health[17], headed up by former Geisinger CEO David Feinberg. However that didn't mean DeepMind and Suleyman were taken off health research. This month DeepMind published a paper on predicting acute kidney injury up to 48 hours before it happens[18]. For a time DeepMind was also keen to work with the National Grid[19] to see how it can cut energy consumption across the UK in the same way that it's helped Google in its data centres, but talks between the two entities fizzled without producing a deal, Forbes reported in March[20]. Suleyman is also one of the founding members of the Partnership on AI \u2014 an organisation set up in September 2016[21] to ensure that AI is developed safely, ethically, and transparently \u2014 along with Facebook's AI head Yann LeCun, Microsoft Research director Eric Horvitz, and several others.Suleyman was reported to be going on leave in August 2019Bloomberg first got the story, reporting that Suleyman had been placed on leave[22], \"after controversy over some of the projects he led.\" A spokeswoman for DeepMind told Business Insider: \"Mustafa's taking some time out right now after ten hectic years,\" although declined to elaborate why, saying the company doesn't comment on employees' personal reasons to taking time off. She added that Suleyman was expected to return towards the end of the year. The report sparked some speculation [23]on a possible rift between DeepMind and Google over how to commercialise DeepMind's work. The Financial Times reported[24] earlier this month that DeepMind's losses had risen 55% to 470 million ($571 million) in its bids to secure the brightest AI talent.Suleyman accepts there are very real concerns about the future of AIWhile AI clearly has great potential, academics, philosophers, and technologists have warned that AI may be humanity's biggest downfall if it is programmed incorrectly or harnessed for wrong doing. Renowned scientist Stephen Hawking said[25] at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon last November: \"Success in creating effective AI could be the biggest event in the history of our civilization. Or the worst. We just don't know. So we cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI, or ignored by it and side-lined, or conceivably destroyed by it.\" When it comes to DeepMind's research, Suleyman and his cofounders realise that there are two sides to the coin. The DeepMind leaders allowed their startup to be acquired by Google on the condition that Google set up an internal AI ethics board to oversee AI developments across the entire organisation. Little is known about the mysterious ethics board but Suleyman said at a Bloomberg conference in 2015 that he wanted Google to disclose the board members. He's been asked about the board several times since then but remained tight lipped. \"Getting these things right is not purely a matter of having good intentions,\" Suleyman wrote in Wired[26] this month. \"We need to do the hard, practical and messy work of finding out what ethical AI really means. If we manage to get AI to work for people and the planet, then the effects could be transformational. Right now, there's everything to play for.\" SULEYMAN'S 3 FAVOURITE BOOKS Ivan Illich's \"Deschooling Society,\" a penetrating commentary on the shortcomings of institutionalized education. Illich accomplishes that most difficult of feats, complementing his critique with a set of practical and creative proposals for alternative approaches. \"Inventing the Future\" by Nick Srnicek and Alex Williamstackles the likely ramifications of intensified automation for the future of work, and the prospects for policies like UBI. The book distinguishes itself by taking absolutely seriously the difficult and contentious political dimensions to this debate. \"Transparency and the Open Society\" by Roger Taylor and Tim Kelsey is a timely and detailed inquiry into the complexities that surround greater openness, together with a framework for thinking through transparency as effective policy.

The question naturally arises whether new Internet laws could change things. The trick would be to reconcile Internet technology (which allows anyone to publish anything worldwide), gatekeeping and editing on the basis of credibility and reliability, and First Amendment freedom. But that perfect formula certainly isn't before Congress.Several bills have been introduced in Congress to change Internet laws, but no changes directly addressing misinformation are likely to be passed soon, and there is no consensus on changes affecting basic Internet laws.Initially, it would take drastic legislative changes to significantly affect the Internet, because under current circumstances, the Internet 'has largely operated under a system of self-governance,' as a Congressional Research Service report[3]notes. </p><p>After Section 230 (which essentially creates the self-governance system), the next two most important Internet laws are several special provisions of the Copyright Act, and the general rule of the Federal Trade Commission act barring 'unfair or deceptive acts or practices.' None of these laws has proven an effective barrier to Internet misinformation.Nor would the next-most-often proposed Internet law, on net neutrality, significantly control misinformation. Net neutrality would bar broadband Internet access services from blocking or throttling lawful Internet traffic, or from engaging in paid prioritization of Internet traffic. None of these provisions would control content.Against this background, several bills have been introduced to further regulate the Internet, and proposals have been made for applying existing laws against Internet giants. Cutbacks of Section 230 Section 230 has already been amended once, to prevent it from protecting intermediaries from certain sex-trafficking crimes and claims. And President Trump issued an executive order that attempts to cut back on Section 230's protection. But the President's order attempts to weaken Section 230 by an interpretation contrary to the well-settled caselaw, and through intervention of an agency that may have no authority to do so. It seems unlikely to succeed[4], though it may have accelerated the debate on Section 230's future.As to new legislation, it would be a challenge to amend Section 230 in a way that covered misinformation without crippling Internet discourse generally. Any law that grants or withholds immunity based on the speaker or subjects discussed, particularly in the political arena, would raise serious First Amendment concerns.One proposed bill[5]would remove the immunity if intermediaries displayed user-generated content 'in an order other than chronological order,' but that approach, an unusual government-imposed content control, would not prevent misinformation and perhaps even give an advantage to sophisticated misinformation actors.Senator Josh Hawley's proposed 'Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act'[6]would allow private litigation to challenge content moderation decisions made by large online companies, with the issue being whether each decision had been made in 'good faith' or 'without an honest belief or purpose.' Reminiscent of the 'heckler's veto,' before Section 230 by which a mere complaint could force service providers to take down content, this bill would arm the complaining parties with a $5,000 per item civil penalty threat. As a practical matter, it would give those with litigation resources a powerful tool to chill all internet content about themselves on major services. It would also open up litigation over any provider's compliance with its service terms.A Department of Justice report issued in June 2020 suggests similar changes in Section 230, including narrowing Section 230's coverage and opening up content moderation decisions to litigation, but doesn't confront the reality that these changes would permit the return of the heckler's veto and self-censorship problems[7]that Section 230 was designed to prevent.Similarly, replacing Section 230 with a notice-and-takedown procedure, like that of Section 512[8]of the Copyright Act, would permit an effective heckler's veto by those wealthy and aggressive enough to regularly make takedown demands.Another reformer has suggested[9]that the protections of Section 230 be withheld from platforms, of a certain minimal size, 'that use algorithmic amplification for attention.' The idea here is that bots are the biggest problem, and that social media services that employ them, and reap the benefits of the revenue they bring in, should be responsible for vetting the content brought in by the bots.A 'Fairness Doctrine' based change, mandating equal treatment of different political positions, seems unlikely for multiple reasons. The original Fairness Doctrine, which applied to fairly narrow circumstances, grew out of the perceived scarcity of broadcasting stations, and was upheld by the Supreme Court on that basis. It has been off the books for several decades, and there is a broad consensus that it would be unconstitutional if reinstated, even in the limited broadcasting arena.Accordingly, while repeal or change of Section 230 is likely to be on the legislative agenda in the near future, it is premature to predict whether or how it will be restricted. Among other things it is likely to be vigorously defended by the powerful tech industry lobby. Antitrust law changes or prosecutions Some experts, notably including Columbia University law professor Tim Wu[10], have suggested using antitrust enforcement to split up or more forcefully regulate giant tech companies to thereby mitigate their power and the power of content posted on their forums.The 'network effect' attendant to leading social media forums clearly exacerbates the effect of misinformation posted there. Put simply, once a particular social media company becomes popular, new members will gravitate to it in order to connect with other people they know or want to connect with. Soon that company becomes dominant, meaning that posts on its service \u2014 including misinformation \u2014 will circulate broadly. If a more diverse set of differently managed social media services existed, misinformation providers would likely find it more difficult to widely distribute their messages. But government acceptance of many past social media mergers has only helped these network effects develop.Any antitrust actions against tech or social media companies would have to be based on anti-competitive conduct, would raise many legal and factual issues, and would likely take years to litigate. Changes to antitrust law to adapt it to Internet business structures will be highly controversial and divisive. Neither route is likely to solve the misinformation problem. Data privacy protection Federal data privacy legislation, if enacted, could govern and restrict how social media companies and other Internet intermediaries collect, use, and distribute user data. Since user data, including Internet searches, purchases, and associations, can reveal a person's political and economic preferences and create psychological profiles (as Cambridge Analytica demonstrated in 2016[11]), personal data collection has significant ties to political misinformation. But federal data privacy bills have been proposed in Congress since 2010[12], and while interest in such bills has significantly picked up recently, such legislation still seems a long way off.In short, no legislation currently proposed or likely to pass in the near future appears to offer any reasonable legislative solution to political misinformation. And legislation alone can probably never effectively address it. As one report[13]notes, it would take at least 'reshaping of platforms and policies, laws and infrastructures, technologies and standards,' since all those things are implicated in the circulation of misinformation.So with no current or likely legal or business solutions, the onus on finding and dealing with Internet misinformation falls on . . . you, the user. We'll discuss what you can and should do in our next post.

They include Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google.</p><p>Personally, I'm not sure if regulating and/or cutting the FANGs down to size is something that can actually be accomplished. I think it's a good thing on moral, political, and social levels, but I have my doubts on legal and business levels. Plus, I'd replace Netflix with Yahoo! and call them \"FAYGs,\" since Netflix is not in the user-generated content business.</p><p>U.S. government agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), want to break up each individual FAYG company because they are harming competition. The Department of Justice is looking at antitrust charges against big tech. Private organizations such as the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) want the FAYGs to be regulated--just as broadcasting is. And social groups, such as The Center for Humane Technology, as well as Common Sense Media, want to limit the use of tech and social media, especially by children.</p><p>On a political level, far-right politicians like the idea of being able to spread their ideologies any way they can. Meanwhile, far left politicians decry the fact that fake news, foreign interferences, and fabrications are disseminated online without any control.</p><p>All of them, however, have thus far failed in presenting a valid, ironclad argument that would allow the U.S. government to regulate and/or split up the FAYGs. And Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act (which shields websites from liability for content created by their users) gives FAYGs further protection.</p><p>I have been following NAB president Gordon Smith's campaign to get the FAYGs covered under the same rules that regulate radio and TV stations. Smith contends that: \"We are up against unregulated behemoth companies. Facebook [is] even talking about coming out with their own currencies. While broadcasters are kept small by regulators, [they] are competing with what are developing as corporate nation-states.</p><p>\"There comes a point when a private interest gets so large that it has a public impact that begins to counter the public interest. Congress should look to the tech industry, but focus on the public interest. Those companies don't do local [coverage like broadcasters do], but they [want to perform other services that we do without] the regulators' burdens.\"</p><p>Finally, according to FTC chairman Joe Simons, breaking up FAYG companies could be the right remedy to rein in dominant companies and restore competition.</p><p>Now, I agree that the FAYGs are facilitating the spread of fake news, creating social and political havoc, and are operating virtually without rules. But I'm not sure about the competition part, since the FAYG acronym implies multiple, competing companies. The problem is that the FAYGs are not affecting one another, but those in the print, broadcast, and content media fields.</p><p>In addition, the FAYGs do not use public resources like airwaves, as broadcasters do. They do not use limited resources (like wood), as print media does. And they are not content gatekeepers, as the studios are. Plus, the same rules that regulate broadcasting also give broadcasters protections against hostile takeovers, illegal speculation, stock manipulation, etc.</p><p>On the other hand, the FAYGs, like Apple, tend to damage consumers directly. If, for example, a wire breaks in the power supply of an Apple laptop, the whole expensive unit must be replaced--not just the inexpensive wire.</p><p>In my view, in order to equate the FAYGs with broadcasting (after all, the FAYGs compete with broadcasters for advertising, content, and viewers) we should consider their media revenues. Since broadcasters are regulated, and FAYGs are not, and since FAYGs don't use public resources, a compromise could be that FAYGs cannot be larger than the largest broadcast company. This way, broadcasters and FAYGs will be engaging in fair competition under fair rules. As for the spreading of fake news, the FAYGs have to be held accountable by a monitoring government organization, similar to what broadcasting has (the FCC).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-606080236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 606080236</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ4-F4S1-JCBJ-K4D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 TV Trade Media, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Video Age International</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0278-5013</issn><volume>Vol. 39</volume><issueNumber>No. 5\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BROADCASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Last weekend, its leaders scrambled to manage Facebook's message in the wake of an indictment by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III that laid out how Russian operators used Facebook and other social media platforms to manipulate American voters.</p><p>And just days before the indictment, another Facebook executive disclosed that the company wasn't yet sure how to put in place <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>latest major directive: Shifting the company's metrics so that so-called meaningful interactions are valued over cheap likes and clicks, a response to the misinformation and reports about the harms of social media that drew attention last year.</p><p>Even if [<person><nameText>Zuckerberg] </nameText></person>says, 'Resolve this right away,' the problems are baked into the fundamentals of the platform, said Jonathon Morgan, chief executive of New Knowledge, a company that tracks disinformation. It's not like <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>just comes to the floor, makes a command, and everything turns around. The changes are a real threat to the way that these people think about success at their jobs.</p><p>Almost immediately after the indictment landed, Facebook's vice president of global policy, Joel Kaplan, took advantage of an opportunity to appear cooperative with the regulators and critics that company has clashed with in recent months over how forthcoming Facebook was. He boasted that today's news confirms our announcement last year that foreign actors conducted a coordinated and sustained effort to attack our democracy, and that the company had readily handed over information on Russian interference to authorities. He said he was grateful that the US government was now taking this aggressive action against those who abused our service.</p><p>Advertising VP defends Facebook</p><p>But hours later, another Facebook vice president, Rob Goldman, who runs the company's massively lucrative ad business, seemed more defensive about Facebook's role. I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal, he tweeted, adding that the majority of Russian ads ran after the election. We shared that fact, he wrote, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn't align with the main media narrative of Tump [sic] and the election.</p><p>Researchers and experts pounced on Goldman, pointing out that the bigger challenge for Facebook did not relate to ads but to the free content posted by Russians that the company has said reached nearly half the US population - 10 times the number of people who saw the ads. (Facebook has not said whether the majority of the free posts appeared after the election.) Others suggested that his conclusions contradicted the special counsel's indictment, which found that election meddling on Facebook was indeed a priority of the Russian operatives.</p><p>The comments from Goldman, who had 1600 followers at the time, could have been a standard Twitter debate between professionals - until President Donald Trump broadcast the comments to 48 million users the following day. Goldman now has over 11,000 followers.</p><p>The controversy sent Facebook executives scrambling over the weekend. They tried to recast the statements, emphasising that Goldman was speaking for himself, without prior approval. Kaplan, trying to put an end to the matter, put out an additional company statement saying that nothing we found contradicts the Special Counsel's indictments. Any suggestion otherwise is wrong. They vented internally that Goldman had damaged hard-won credibility with the public. By Monday, Goldman, posting on Facebook this time, had issued an apology to his colleagues.</p><p>Goldman is part of a social media-oriented culture that is permissive of employees having a voice and become so-called thought leaders in their field. Several Facebook executives are regular Twitter users, including Andrew Bosworth, who initially shared Goldman's tweet.</p><p>Need to defend credibility</p><p>But that culture is increasingly pushing up against the need of big tech companies like Facebook to defend their credibility. Marc Andreessen, a Facebook board member, shut his popular Twitter account after making offensive comments about Facebook's goals in India. After Google fired a conservative engineer for making derogatory statements about women, employees took to social media to protest both sides of the issue. Engineers across Silicon Valley pushed their chief executives to speak out against President Trump's immigration ban.</p><p>Recently, a Facebook executive spoke publicly about the challenges of implementing <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>latest directive to make the product less harmful by measuring time well spent and meaningful interactions.</p><p>We're trying to figure out how to best measure and understand that, Adam Mosseri, Facebook vice president who manages the company's news feed, said at an industry conference. The metric is definitely evolving.</p><p>Later, Mosseri took to Twitter to explain himself further. In response to a question from a Washington Post reporter, Mosseri said the company was considering placing more emphasis on comments and messages, particularly long ones, after surveys found that users reported those features to be meaningful to them. He said that company was trying to define how to give people news that is genuinely informative. Currently, the company shows people highly personalised content that its algorithm predicts they will find informative.</p><p>But there is a real difference between feeling informed and being informed, he wrote. We have yet to work out a way to do the latter.</p><p>- The Washington Post</p><p>Elizabeth Dwoskin is The Washington Post's Silicon Valley correspondent.</p><p>(The Myanmar Times)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RRK-4H21-JB5P-J1YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 27, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The subtitle was more insightful, and revealed the authors' intentions: market developments and potential financial stability implications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report's premise is straightforward. The arrival of established technology giants, or Big Tech, on the financial scene could affect the degree of concentration and contestability in financial services, with both potential benefits and risks for financial stability.</p><p>The focus is on companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Ant Financial, rather than the myriad fintech startups in Silicon Valley, Israel, or clustered round the Old Street roundabout in London. Central banks and finance ministries are beginning to ask whether the activities of the tech behemoths, whose market capitalizations now dwarf those of even the biggest banks, will be wholly benign.</p><p>In a way, it might be thought surprising that the questions are being raised only now. Phrases like bolting stable doors come to mind. In Europe, regulatory changes like the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) have been crucial in opening up the banking system, and regulators like the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority have for some time been running regulatory sandboxes to smooth the way for new entrants by helping them to structure themselves to comply with standards. PSD2, often described as open banking, requires banks to offer their customer data to non-bank providers of payment and account information services. Aggregators can then present the customer with an integrated view of their finances, and offer add-on services.</p><p>Maybe the time to assess the financial-stability risks of open banking was in the consultation period before the directive was passed. Even now, the list of contributors to the FSB work shows that the European Commission, and the key regulators in Europe and North America, were not involved.</p><p>So what did the FSB conclude?</p><p>The authors begin, tactfully, with a series of bows to Big Tech. They say, correctly, that the greater efficiency of new players may enhance the efficiency of financial services in the longer term. Certainly, the absence of the cost drag of legacy IT systems and underused branch networks (which have been seen as a kind of public service and are therefore hard to rationalize) allow for cheaper digital delivery mechanisms which banks can only envy.</p><p>It is also entirely fair to argue, as the authors do, that increased competition in the supply of financial services may benefit consumers by expanding choice, stimulating innovation, and driving down transaction costs. The pressure on traditional providers is generating strong incentives to reduce costs and improve service. Incumbents can no longer afford to sit back and allow inertia to be their friend, as they did in the past when account switching was rare. But the FSB also warns that cross-subsidization may allow Big Tech firms to gain market share rapidly and knock out existing providers. As a result, their participation may not result in a more competitive market over the longer term.</p><p>That is a warning policymakers should heed. But the FSB is supposed to be primarily interested in stability. And here the report points in both directions at once. On one hand, the authors argue that greater competition can create a more resilient financial system, with a wider range of companies managing the essential plumbing. On the other hand, the ability of new entrants to undercut banks significantly could make the latter potentially more vulnerable to losses. The accompanying reduction in retained earnings as a source of internal capital, the report argues, could have an impact on financial sector resilience and risk-taking.</p><p>The reader is largely left to decide which of these two scenarios is most likely to play out. But while the report is unambiguously positive about the impact of fintech startups, whether they remain standalone entities, or join exiting banks to create complementary offerings, the authors' conclusions about Big Tech are far more nuanced. Whereas previous analyses have suggested that the financial-stability implications of fintech are either benign or small, the FSB believes that this could change quickly with deeper involvement of the large technology providers.</p><p>One possible route to financial instability identified in the report is that banks may loosen lending standards unwisely. I would assess that risk as low. Banks have been there before, in recent living memory, and are not keen to go back. But the threat to profitability is real, particularly if loss-leader pricing strategies are adopted, as the FSB believes is possible. They refer explicitly to the risk of cross-subsidization. Banks in Europe are not much in favor with investors today, trading well below book value in most cases, and a significant loss of market share in payment services would threaten their viability further.</p><p>In response, the FSB, unsurprisingly, argues for vigilance on the part of banking supervisors. (When, one wonders, have supervisors been told that now is the time to turn a blind eye?). But I wonder if the answer lies with banking supervisors at all. Had a broader range of authorities contributed to the work, they might have more pertinently recommended vigilance by conduct and competition regulators, too. Following the FSB's own logic, it is in these authorities' territories where the biggest risks are most likely to emerge.</p><p>- Project Syndicate</p><p>Howard Davies, the first chairman of the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority (1997-2003), is Chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

The subtitle was more insightful, and revealed the authors' intentions: market developments and potential financial stability implications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report's premise is straightforward. The arrival of established technology giants, or Big Tech, on the financial scene could affect the degree of concentration and contestability in financial services, with both potential benefits and risks for financial stability.</p><p>The focus is on companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Ant Financial, rather than the myriad fintech startups in Silicon Valley, Israel, or clustered round the Old Street roundabout in London. Central banks and finance ministries are beginning to ask whether the activities of the tech behemoths, whose market capitalizations now dwarf those of even the biggest banks, will be wholly benign.</p><p>In a way, it might be thought surprising that the questions are being raised only now. Phrases like bolting stable doors come to mind. In Europe, regulatory changes like the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) have been crucial in opening up the banking system, and regulators like the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority have for some time been running regulatory sandboxes to smooth the way for new entrants by helping them to structure themselves to comply with standards. PSD2, often described as open banking, requires banks to offer their customer data to non-bank providers of payment and account information services. Aggregators can then present the customer with an integrated view of their finances, and offer add-on services.</p><p>Maybe the time to assess the financial-stability risks of open banking was in the consultation period before the directive was passed. Even now, the list of contributors to the FSB work shows that the European Commission, and the key regulators in Europe and North America, were not involved.</p><p>So what did the FSB conclude?</p><p>The authors begin, tactfully, with a series of bows to Big Tech. They say, correctly, that the greater efficiency of new players may enhance the efficiency of financial services in the longer term. Certainly, the absence of the cost drag of legacy IT systems and underused branch networks (which have been seen as a kind of public service and are therefore hard to rationalize) allow for cheaper digital delivery mechanisms which banks can only envy.</p><p>It is also entirely fair to argue, as the authors do, that increased competition in the supply of financial services may benefit consumers by expanding choice, stimulating innovation, and driving down transaction costs. The pressure on traditional providers is generating strong incentives to reduce costs and improve service. Incumbents can no longer afford to sit back and allow inertia to be their friend, as they did in the past when account switching was rare. But the FSB also warns that cross-subsidization may allow Big Tech firms to gain market share rapidly and knock out existing providers. As a result, their participation may not result in a more competitive market over the longer term.</p><p>That is a warning policymakers should heed. But the FSB is supposed to be primarily interested in stability. And here the report points in both directions at once. On one hand, the authors argue that greater competition can create a more resilient financial system, with a wider range of companies managing the essential plumbing. On the other hand, the ability of new entrants to undercut banks significantly could make the latter potentially more vulnerable to losses. The accompanying reduction in retained earnings as a source of internal capital, the report argues, could have an impact on financial sector resilience and risk-taking.</p><p>The reader is largely left to decide which of these two scenarios is most likely to play out. But while the report is unambiguously positive about the impact of fintech startups, whether they remain standalone entities, or join exiting banks to create complementary offerings, the authors' conclusions about Big Tech are far more nuanced. Whereas previous analyses have suggested that the financial-stability implications of fintech are either benign or small, the FSB believes that this could change quickly with deeper involvement of the large technology providers.</p><p>One possible route to financial instability identified in the report is that banks may loosen lending standards unwisely. I would assess that risk as low. Banks have been there before, in recent living memory, and are not keen to go back. But the threat to profitability is real, particularly if loss-leader pricing strategies are adopted, as the FSB believes is possible. They refer explicitly to the risk of cross-subsidization. Banks in Europe are not much in favor with investors today, trading well below book value in most cases, and a significant loss of market share in payment services would threaten their viability further.</p><p>In response, the FSB, unsurprisingly, argues for vigilance on the part of banking supervisors. (When, one wonders, have supervisors been told that now is the time to turn a blind eye?). But I wonder if the answer lies with banking supervisors at all. Had a broader range of authorities contributed to the work, they might have more pertinently recommended vigilance by conduct and competition regulators, too. Following the FSB's own logic, it is in these authorities' territories where the biggest risks are most likely to emerge.</p><p>- Project Syndicate</p><p>Howard Davies, the first chairman of the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority (1997-2003), is Chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

In a word: technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On August 3, Starbucks made an announcement which, though little noticed at the time, amounts to a potentially massive shift in the organisation of finance. How did an international chain of coffee shops position itself to play a major role in upending not just how payments are made but also the business model of established banks?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a word: technology. The financial system is full of legacy costs and inefficiencies, and the incumbent major banks are generally happy to maintain existing arrangements. But technological advances now make it possible for big tech companies to compete for the profits of the financial sector - if they can find the right partners.</p><p>Starbucks matters because it has a strong consumer brand and, in particular, because around 15 million people use the Starbucks Rewards system - which stores value that is typically accessed through an app on people's phones. Behind that system currently is a credit card, charging significant fees to people who transfer value to Rewards in the Starbucks app. Starbucks, like all merchants, pays those fees, which are not fully transparent to consumers - but which of course add to the cost of a cup of coffee. (Full disclosure: I have the Starbucks app and use it regularly.)</p><p>One key partner for Starbucks in this new venture is Intercontinental Exchange (commonly known as ICE; not to be confused with the controversial US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency). Retail consumers do not usually think about an entity such as ICE. It runs marketplace infrastructure, including the New York Stock Exchange as well as a much broader set of derivative and over-the-counter markets. In the post-financial-crisis world, ICE has done well by running well-organised and properly regulated markets. Seen from this perspective, ICE is a tech company, albeit one with a focused area of expertise.</p><p>The Internet has no central authority, and no one needs anyone's permission to connect a computer to the network, build a website, or offer a completely new kind of business model. The financial system, on the other hand, does have a central official authority. In the United States, it's the Federal Reserve, and there a large number of rules - made by the Fed as well as other federal, state, and self-regulatory bodies - regarding how one may send money or extend credit.</p><p>Many of these rules, such as those to protect consumers, make sense; but the overall result is to protect incumbents - banks and credit card companies - against competitive pressure.</p><p>'The future of finance is not likely to be fully decentralised. There will be intermediaries of some kind.'</p><p>There is, of course, another long-established way to organise finance outside of banks - through markets. In the US, the relevant regulators are the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), whose primary role is to ensure fair market operation and the protection of investors against scams in commodity derivative markets, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which oversees how securities are issued to the investing public across all financial markets. The CFTC and SEC are happy to encourage innovation that is consistent with their mandates.</p><p>Traditionally, the operation of commodity markets - corn, pork bellies, silver, and the like - has been quite distant from retail payments in stores like Starbucks. However, new technology is closing - or perhaps has already closed - this gap.</p><p>At the heart of this latest technological development is the much-maligned development of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies have become associated in recent years with price volatility, rampant speculation, and - to be frank - a great deal of theft. The original idea behind these new forms of payment was that a decentralised peer-to-peer monetary system should be preferable to one run by governments, which could and would cheat individuals.</p><p>The flaw in this logic, of course, is that people rip off people just as much (and sometimes more) than governments do. This dawning realisation has cast a pall over the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>But the idea that people may behave badly in market transactions is nothing new to commodity markets, to the CFTC, or to ICE. In fact, companies like ICE prosper when they provide adequate security, good customer service, and market integrity. For example, problems with the operations of some markets - reflected in the price-fixing scandal regarding Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate), a benchmark interest rate - became apparent in 2007 and 2008. Smart infrastructure operators have embraced the changes that were legislated under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation and implemented by the CFTC.</p><p>The Starbucks-ICE backed company is known as Bakkt.

In a word: technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On August 3, Starbucks made an announcement which, though little noticed at the time, amounts to a potentially massive shift in the organisation of finance. How did an international chain of coffee shops position itself to play a major role in upending not just how payments are made but also the business model of established banks?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a word: technology. The financial system is full of legacy costs and inefficiencies, and the incumbent major banks are generally happy to maintain existing arrangements. But technological advances now make it possible for big tech companies to compete for the profits of the financial sector - if they can find the right partners.</p><p>Starbucks matters because it has a strong consumer brand and, in particular, because around 15 million people use the Starbucks Rewards system - which stores value that is typically accessed through an app on people's phones. Behind that system currently is a credit card, charging significant fees to people who transfer value to Rewards in the Starbucks app. Starbucks, like all merchants, pays those fees, which are not fully transparent to consumers - but which of course add to the cost of a cup of coffee. (Full disclosure: I have the Starbucks app and use it regularly.)</p><p>One key partner for Starbucks in this new venture is Intercontinental Exchange (commonly known as ICE; not to be confused with the controversial US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency). Retail consumers do not usually think about an entity such as ICE. It runs marketplace infrastructure, including the New York Stock Exchange as well as a much broader set of derivative and over-the-counter markets. In the post-financial-crisis world, ICE has done well by running well-organised and properly regulated markets. Seen from this perspective, ICE is a tech company, albeit one with a focused area of expertise.</p><p>The Internet has no central authority, and no one needs anyone's permission to connect a computer to the network, build a website, or offer a completely new kind of business model. The financial system, on the other hand, does have a central official authority. In the United States, it's the Federal Reserve, and there a large number of rules - made by the Fed as well as other federal, state, and self-regulatory bodies - regarding how one may send money or extend credit.</p><p>Many of these rules, such as those to protect consumers, make sense; but the overall result is to protect incumbents - banks and credit card companies - against competitive pressure.</p><p>'The future of finance is not likely to be fully decentralised. There will be intermediaries of some kind.'</p><p>There is, of course, another long-established way to organise finance outside of banks - through markets. In the US, the relevant regulators are the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), whose primary role is to ensure fair market operation and the protection of investors against scams in commodity derivative markets, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which oversees how securities are issued to the investing public across all financial markets. The CFTC and SEC are happy to encourage innovation that is consistent with their mandates.</p><p>Traditionally, the operation of commodity markets - corn, pork bellies, silver, and the like - has been quite distant from retail payments in stores like Starbucks. However, new technology is closing - or perhaps has already closed - this gap.</p><p>At the heart of this latest technological development is the much-maligned development of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies have become associated in recent years with price volatility, rampant speculation, and - to be frank - a great deal of theft. The original idea behind these new forms of payment was that a decentralised peer-to-peer monetary system should be preferable to one run by governments, which could and would cheat individuals.</p><p>The flaw in this logic, of course, is that people rip off people just as much (and sometimes more) than governments do. This dawning realisation has cast a pall over the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>But the idea that people may behave badly in market transactions is nothing new to commodity markets, to the CFTC, or to ICE. In fact, companies like ICE prosper when they provide adequate security, good customer service, and market integrity. For example, problems with the operations of some markets - reflected in the price-fixing scandal regarding Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate), a benchmark interest rate - became apparent in 2007 and 2008. Smart infrastructure operators have embraced the changes that were legislated under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation and implemented by the CFTC.</p><p>The Starbucks-ICE backed company is known as Bakkt. Microsoft will provide the cloud services, and a Who's Who of tech investing is lined up to provide funding and advice. While more details of how Bakkt will operate are expected in November, the August announcement made it clear that Bitcoin one-day futures contracts will play a significant role.</p><p>The future of finance is not likely to be fully decentralised. There will be intermediaries of some kind. Banks and credit card companies can be expected to devise a competitive response, and it remains to be seen who will prevail. It is also unclear to what extent profits will simply be transferred from incumbents to new powerful entrants.</p><p>Still, the chances are high that consumers will gain from this latest innovation - and that there will be positive spillover effects in other areas of finance, as it becomes easier to bypass establishment payment mechanisms.

Sometimes it seems that way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This famous experiment in virtual cash, with its aura of near anonymity and lack of pesky regulation, gets tech heads really excited. Yet it may be the most famous thing in the world that nobody really understands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People who hear about it have questions like ''What is it?'' and ''Wait, I still don't understand. What is it?'' and ''Why has the price fluctuated so wildly?'' And, finally, ''Are any of them, maybe, lodged between my sofa cushions?''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I can answer only the last question: No, unless you also have a virtual sofa.</p><p>I was born too late for the tulip bulbs and too early for Beanie Babies, but I don't want to miss out on Bitcoin mania. Of course, I can't become a Bitcoin mogul without knowing anything about it, so I did some research.</p><p>The first thing I found out? This is the closest thing in finance to riding an angry bull at the rodeo. The value of a single Bitcoin has gone as high as $1,200 and plummeted on bad news for the currency, like theft through hacking, to less than half of that. So caveat investor, says the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra. Those spoilsports put out an alert warning investors that it could be ''more than a bit risky'' to buy and sell Bitcoin because of all that volatility, and that there was a potential for fraud in dealing with some of the companies that say they are involved in the Bitcoin world. Bracing!</p><p>Wouldn't you know it? The bureaucrats are circling.</p><p>The Internal Revenue Service has been looking at Bitcoin too, and with something of a gimlet eye. It recently tried to get a fix on just what Bitcoin is, because commerce is the sort of thing that the I.R.S. likes to get a piece of.</p><p>On March 25, the friendly fellas at the tax office took a stab at telling us what Bitcoin, and other virtual currency, is. The answer, roughly, is that it's more like property than currency -- and, by the way, you do need to pay taxes on your Bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Does that sound like paperwork and trouble? Well, you might say that, and news of the potentially burdensome ruling drove the cost of a Bitcoin to below $500. But many people took the news as a move forward for the legitimacy of the currency, or investment, or whatever the heck it is.</p><p>To be fair, something whose value bobs and weaves this way does sound more like an investment than a currency. In fact, it sounds like many investments I've made in my proven track record of buying high and selling low. It's a gift.</p><p>Folks like Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, applauded the I.R.S. move, saying it ''provides clarity for taxpayers who want to ensure that they're doing the right thing and playing by the rules when utilizing Bitcoin and other digital currencies.''</p><p>I'M still no expert, but isn't playing by the rules the opposite of what many people who are interested in Bitcoin want -- and, more important, what I want? Don't I get to fly my pirate flag? If I wanted to play by the rules, wouldn't I just invest in a money-market fund, with perfect safety and ... sorry, I just fell asleep for a moment.</p><p>But that dream state reminds me: As a science-fiction fan, I used to tear through books that predicted a digital-currency future, an anonymous underground economy where value flowed without government buttinskis. It made money seem exciting, not just depressing. And the novels predicted that government, threatened by the crypto-cash revolt, would do anything it could to block that future. Of course, who needs government sabotage when the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange, already seems to be doing a fine job of undermining faith in digital currency? It has out-Finra'd Finra!</p><p>I called a smart person to help me figure all this out. Ajay Vinze, associate dean at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, has done research on Bitcoin, and he says that if you are going to disrupt the existing way of doing things, ''you come across as a pirate.''</p><p>He told me that Bitcoin wasn't yet functioning quite like money because of all the volatility, but that it's well on its way to the kind of respectability that requires a less swashbuckling demeanor. ''Once you're successful,'' he said, ''you're stuck with this nuance of having to put on the cloak of legitimacy.''</p><p>As my brain started to melt, I realized that some of the smartest people in the business world completely disagree about Bitcoin. It's caused something of a billionaire slap fight between Warren Buffett and Marc Andreessen.</p><p>Mr. Buffett recently expressed skepticism about the new currency. ''It's a mirage, basically,'' he told CNBC on March 14. He added, ''The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke, in my view.''</p><p>Mr. Andreessen, who invented the first popular web browser and became a big tech investor, made it sound as if the Oracle of Omaha had told the whole Internet to get off his lawn. As a champion of new technologies, Mr. Andreessen has ranked Bitcoin's importance up with that of personal computers and the Internet. His venture capital firm has invested more than $50 million in Bitcoin-related companies. In a Twitter post, he called Mr. Buffett one of the ''old white men'' who disparage technologies they don't understand.</p><p>Mr. Andreessen, as it turns out, is also white and also not so young anymore, at least not by wunderkind standards. He backpedaled a bit with a succession of tweets praising Mr. Buffett highly, and offered to spend ''as much time with Warren as he wants teaching him all about Bitcoin. :-)''</p><p>Mr. Buffett didn't respond publicly to Mr. Andreessen, or to my request for comment, because he's Warren Buffett, for crying out loud, and he doesn't need to mess with this kind of stuff.</p><p>O.K., two observations here: First, does Mr. Buffett really want to spend a lot of time getting a tutorial from Mr. Andreessen? You can just read the frequently asked questions list at Bitcoin.org, though it's full of language like ''the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms.''</p><p>Sorry, I dropped off again ...</p><p>But what bothers me is this: When billionaires fight, shouldn't it be with weaponry more impressive than tweets? Twitter is the battleground for weenies. Billionaires have the money to buy private armies! Of robot warriors! With lasers! On a giant chessboard! That's the true spirit of virtual currency, isn't it?</p><p>Real life is such a disappointment.</p><p>I'M hoping for the Bitcoin world to be more fun. So far, though, finding someone who accepts virtual currency isn't that easy. The site useBitcoins.info lists more than 2,000 businesses that take the currency, or investment, or whatever, all over the world. If I need an electrician in Coventry, England, I'm covered, and I can use Bitcoin to satisfy all of my beef jerky needs at beefjerky.com.</p><p>Yet trying to handle transactions in my New Jersey neighborhood is a little tougher. I've been asking around. There's apparently a fitness ''boot camp'' in the town next door that accepts Bitcoin, but I don't like paying people to sweat when I can sweat just fine for nothing. At my local car-rental counter, the guys look at me as if I were trying to pull a fast one. The checkout machine at Home Depot doesn't have a button for paying with Bitcoin. And my cats act as if they don't know what I'm talking about.</p><p>I guess they aren't living in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DRAWING (DRAWING BY GLYNIS SWEENEY)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-078689140406</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BXB-6TD1-JBG3-64J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1237\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/business/mutfund/my-bitcoin-befuddlement.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/business/mutfund/my-bitcoin-befuddlement.html</url><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>April 6, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY (FINRA)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Purposes</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRkU5M0NCNTRGNDQ5M0E5MzBENUFBNTQ3RTgyRTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUQ0NUZCREI1NkY2NDA3NDk4NzdFQ0I5MDIxQTc3NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001681</classCode><className>TAX LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Tax</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

There's the Dan Cooper writing these words right now, standing at his desk in an attic in Norwich, England. There is also the Dan Cooper who has the same name and address but who only exists inside a computer sitting on a shelf. I had never heard of this man until a couple of months ago, but now I am intimately familiar with who he is, his contradictions and the terrible truth he may reflect upon me.In the wake of Europe's new privacy laws, I polled numerous companies[1] to learn what they knew about me. </p><p>One of them was Acxiom, a principally American marketing-data agency that collects data on individuals across the globe. Data that it has bought, or gathered, is algorithmically mashed together with public records and drained through a series of statistical models. The eventual aim of this effort is to create a series of conclusions about user behavior that can be used to create increasingly targeted advertising.Acxiom sent me a 24-page file that covered everything it had about me. That information has been sold to a number of \"respected brands,\" including major names like Ford Motor Company, British Telecom and (British retailer) Tesco. The file was also passed on to companies that already know me pretty damn well: Facebook, eBay, Twitter and PayPal.I'm sure that at some point in the past, I've unwittingly ticked \"agree\" on some box and given my consent for my data to be collected. And these companies are likely to have tried to build a complete profile of my health, economic status and purchasing profile. It's quite possible that the data has been used to send me specific offers, suggest products I should buy and even dangle discounts in front of my face.That's a real problem, because the data they store on me is total bollocks.Data retrieval How big tech manages your personal information Tuesday: Who controls your data?[2]Wednesday: My digital shadow looks nothing like me[3]Thursday: How a data request turned into a data breachFriday: Don't ask me for my passwordSaturday: A date with my Tinder data Here's the real me: I'm a 33-year-old technology journalist who is married and owns his own home -- at least if you think having a 35-year mortgage qualifies as \"ownership.\" I have one daughter who is now a few years old and a newborn son. I drive a third- or fourth-hand, petrol-powered Lexus from the year 2000, making my car old enough to vote.Maybe it's egomania, but because I'm on the internet as much as I am and also because I have a semi-prominent job, I assumed these companies would know a lot about me. Like, I'm on Facebook and Twitter pretty much nonstop, and I spend 10 or 12 hours per day on the internet. How can I not be the most open book to these people?And yet...The Acxiom version of Dan Cooper has the same address as me, but he's 25, not 33, and he's cohabiting rather than married. Well, according to the documents, there's a 37.2 percent chance he's cohabiting and a 37.1 percent chance he's hitched. The data also shows that he's an \"empty nester,\" meaning that his kids have grown up and moved out, which is just about plausible if he fathered his first child at seven.Acxiom's data contradicts itself on a number of occasions, thanks to the weird, algorithmic way it was gathered. He's childless, but at the same time his kids were born in 1983 and 1986 -- clearly this alterna-Cooper blossomed early. He also somehow managed to buy a home in 1993, aged 11, which he mortgaged as a second-time buyer. I mean, I have to admit, this guy clearly has his life and priorities sorted out.All of that time spent having kids while still in school and buying a house has, unfortunately, had a domino effect on his career. Acxiom's statistical models think that he's an employed individual (85.4 percent) working inside the socio-economic grade C2/D. That means he's either a skilled or unskilled manual laborer. The data also isn't clear about his politics: He either reads the reactionary, right-wing rag Daily Express or the center-left Guardian. What the hell is a C2/D social grade? Talk about the ossified nature of British society for long enough and the chat will always come back to the Class System. The country's immovable social strata means that upward mobility, based on some sense that hard work is rewarded, is limited. When Prince William married Catherine Middleton, the joke was that she was a \"commoner\" made good, despite being from a historically wealthy and powerful British dynasty[4].Britain's obsession with class runs so deep as to inform the basis of the National Readership Survey (NRS) social grades. The survey was launched in 1956 as a way for the burgeoning ad industry to research the attitudes and wealth of its readers. The six NRS grades run from A through E, with C split in two to better define the top and bottom halves of the population. The categories are broken down by how you earn your money, with professionals marked as A, middle managers as B and so on.If you work in politics or advertising or have any sort of interest in the nature of British society, then it's quite likely that you'll have heard the phrase \"ABC1.\" That's a general shorthand for the upper and middle classes, while \"C2DE\" denotes the middle and lower orders. Ironically, despite being used in Acxiom's files, the company's former data chief, Dawn Orr, said that the NRS \"simply isn't up to the job anymore[5].\"Part of me is naturally delighted that this huge data brokerage has no clue who Dan Cooper really is. Through some combination of genius, trickery or luck, I have avoided becoming a cog in the Man's Machine. I've hidden in plain sight, and these companies don't know me, my lifestyle or my purchasing habits. Then again, the fact that Acxiom failed to get facts right that are a matter of public record is pretty concerning. Perhaps that's the reason why the company declined to participate in this story.But then, I also wonder how far this information will travel and to what ends it will be used, especially in light of what's going on in other parts of the world. You may have heard of China's plans for a Social Credit System that combines big data and mass surveillance. It is, of course, a way to both monitor and tightly control the population, ensuring compliance with whatever policy is currently en vogue.Already, China has blacklists that can prevent people from traveling[6], blocking job offers and making people's children ineligible to attend top schools. And there was even an attempt at letting the private sector run parts of the scheme: In 2015, Alibaba and Tencent were asked to test their own systems. Two years later, regulators realized that companies[7] that have a profit motive might charge folks to bolster their score.The point is that even now companies and governments are working out ways of using this sort of aggregated data for their ends. I'm reminded of the movie Brazil, in which a vast bureaucracy would rather assassinate its own citizens than rectify errors in its records. Scoff all you want, but it's entirely plausible that a government would simply poll ad-agency data, credit scores and social media information to begin profiling its citizens.That leaves me at something of a crossroads: Do I kick up a fuss and demand greater accuracy in the surveillance? Or is it better to try, as best possible, to obfuscate the system in the hopes of making it unusable by any future government?Credits:Writer: Daniel CooperFeatures editor: Aaron SouppourisLead reporter: Chris IpCopy editor: Megan GillerIllustration: Koren Shadmi This article originally appeared on Engadget at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/05/my-digital-shadow-acxiom-corporation/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603\">https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/05/my-digital-shadow-acxiom-corporation/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/04/who-controls-your-data/\">https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/04/who-controls-your-data/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/04/who-controls-your-data/\">https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/04/who-controls-your-data/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/05/my-digital-shadow-acxiom-corporation/\">https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/05/my-digital-shadow-acxiom-corporation/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupton_family\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupton_family</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/love-hate-abc1-just-doesnt/512203\">https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/love-hate-abc1-just-doesnt/512203</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/china-social-credit-system-punishments-rewards-explained-a8297486.html\">https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/china-social-credit-system-punishments-rewards-explained-a8297486.html</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f772a9ce-60c4-11e7-91a7-502f7ee26895\">https://www.ft.com/content/f772a9ce-60c4-11e7-91a7-502f7ee26895</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AOLB1032841536157267576251762500033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AOLB-5150</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6B-KMC1-JCMN-Y2C9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1402\"/><timeReceived>2:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Engadget HD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 5, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002J45</classCode><className>FORD MOTOR CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

Each day in one of the main halls a crowd gathered, huddling in front of a stage upon which stood a structure that appeared at first glance like a gallows. Above a platform rose a tall structure of wooden boards with ropes hanging off to both sides. As workmen took the strain, pulling the ropes taut, the platform rose bearing the inventor Elisha Otis as well as barrels and heavy boxes, until it reached 30 feet above the heads of the throng.</p><p>After a dramatic pause an assistant cut the hoists with an axe and the crowds gasped as they expected to see the engineer crash to the ground. But the platform only dropped a few inches and remained there, suspended in the air, held by Otis's patented safety device, the \"safety hoister.\" Above the murmur of astonishment, Otis assured his stunned audience, \"all safe, gentlemen, all safe.\" It was a spectacle that changed the history of the world. Otis had not invented the elevator, but had made it safe. Before Otis's innovation, few places in the world-apart from Sana'a, in Yemen-had buildings over five storeys high; within 50 years there were skyscrapers overlooking Manhattan.</p><p>Cities and technology have long influenced each other. Otis's elevator was invented at the same time as innovations in railways, sewers and steel manufacture; combined they would determine the shape and scale of the modern city. Today, we are experiencing a new technological leap: the intelligent city, which is being heralded with the same fevered, messianic optimism and hard sell as Stephenson's Rocket or Bazalgette's sewers. To be smart is to be modern, we are told; a failure to embrace the liberating power of information is to be morally suspect. But this poses the question of what precisely the role of technology might be in the modern city. Can it turn a leaden metropolis into a sustainable, robust utopia?</p><p>For some urban thinkers, the solution to all our current problems is to start again, from scratch. Songdo, in South Korea, is an example of the next generation of metropolis: a smart city, built according to the new rules of the Information Age. Built from reclaimed land 40 miles southwest of Seoul, it is a connected city, in which information is gathered and used to regulate the urban fabric. Buildings, objects, traffic lights are both sensors and activators. This type of city is no longer a static collection of places but \"a computer in open air.\" It is a sentient place-a living and connected matrix in which buildings, signs, users and vehicles communicate with each other in real time.</p><p>Songdo's promotional brochure notes that the city appropriates the canals of Venice, Hong Kong's skyline, the park areas from Savanna Georgia and Napoleon's sense of street planning, and mixes it all up together. Beneath this architectural melee the city is wired with Cisco's proprietory U.City infrastructural software, meaning that Songdo can be run from a hub that functions as the city's \"brain stem,\" gathering data from the sensors scattered throughout the city.</p><p>Street cameras watch the human flow to brighten the energy-saving street lamps that shut down when no one is around. Sensors surveil street traffic, collecting registration plate data to monitor congestion. Buildings, bridges and infrastructure are connected to avoid unexpected works or delays. On top of buildings, mini stations predict the weather, sending warnings when temperatures drop to a level that might cause a surge in energy use for heating. All waste, rubbish, energy use and water is metered and measured, offering potential ways to reduce inefficiencies.</p><p>Is this an efficiency dream? Or a control nightmare? It's hard to decide. The modernist era saw planned cities such as Bras\u00edlia, Canberra and Chandrigarh, built from the dirt, as well as the more local post-war new town plans of Peterlee, Welwyn Garden City and Washington. Each was created as an expression of hope for the future-so what do smart cities tell us about ourselves?</p><p>In addition to Songdo, new cities are appearing everywhere. Masdar City has been created outside Abu Dhabi by Norman Foster as the first carbon-free city. In China there are numerous plans for eco-cities that harness information technology to make more sustainable environments. Often the techno-utopian claims made for such cities need to taken with a pinch of salt. Most of us will never live in cities created out of the desert. The prospective populations of these cities are minute compared to the majority of the global population that already lives within the dense, complex, and often straining-at-the-limits cities built from bricks, stones, steel and lives of the pre-Information Age. These cities face the challenge of adapting as best as possible to advances in technology even though they are poorly positioned to do so.</p><p>In November 2010, David Cameron announced the launch of Tech City, an initiative that hoped to turn a stretch of east London-from Shoreditch to Stratford-into the technology capital of Europe. The dilapidated post-industrial East End was to be transformed into a new gleaming smart hub: Silicon Roundabout, named after the Old Street roundabout. So did it work?</p><p>Within a year of Cameron's announcement, Tech City had attracted huge attention from international companies. The high profile push has raised the international standing of the project. For big tech companies looking for a place to site their European office, the publicity drive has worked. However, local start-ups have lost out, and with them has gone an important source of innovation. According to Elizabeth Varley, founder of TechHub, a hugely successful community workspace close by Old Street roundabout, the top-down initiative needs to be questioned. Around the roundabout itself there has been little investment: the tube station, one of the least attractive in the city, has not been improved. There has not even been an upgrade to the neighbourhood's broadband capacity. There are fears that the main effect of government cheerleading will be to raise rents.</p><p>According to Varley, the most urgent matter was the lack of government investment-but in the people rather than the place, with small grants \"so that a young entrepreneur can eat for six months.\" A 2012 report by the Centre for London put the case for development from the ground-up rather than a policy to attract outside investment. The report concluded: \"It has been evolving for years under the policy radar, and only now-as it reaches critical mass, and becomes the figurehead of London's digital economy-is it receiving much public attention... Tech City should be about taking what inner East London already has and helping it get even better.\"</p><p>Other British cities are adapting to new technology. In November 2012 Birmingham announced its Smart City Vision, which confronted precisely this challenge. Despite having the youngest population in the UK, 18.5 per cent of Birmingham's adult population still has no access to the internet. Overcoming this is the first step. Second, local government should become more efficient and find new ways to deliver services and share more between departments. There will also be a commitment to smart energy use, intelligent architecture and infrastructure planning-out with the old Victorian systems, in with the new.</p><p>The promise made by Birmingham's Smart City Vision was that: \"Technology will be seamlessly interwoven into the fabric of our city life to provide better information, more choice, more convenience and less waste for our citizens, businesses, communities and public services.\"</p><p>The optimism and sense of ambition is laudable, as was the Victorian mission to provide clean water, sewers, and fresh air. But these plans are expensive. The installation of meters to measure energy and water usage has a price; there is no guarantee that \"ultra fast digital connectivity\" will attract \"inward investment, create jobs and drive innovation.\" This \"joined up, integrated and citizen-centric approach across city systems and processes, using and sharing real time data and intelligence\" might lead to better decision making. But this is dependent on the quality of the people making the decisions, not just the size of the data set.</p><p>Amsterdam Smart City, launched in 2009. Like Birmingham, it is looking to upgrade its infrastructure. One lesson concerned the willingness of residents to take in the technological developments that were occurring around them. The lesson of Amsterdam is that citizens' tolerance for high-tech lectures from city officials is low.</p><p>Big schemes like this have to come from city hall, but they must be promoted with caution; both Birmingham and Amsterdam propose widespread top-down schemes that risk promising too much.</p><p>In addition, the intelligent city must not become a cage. The amount of security technology installed in London in advance of the 2012 Olympic was astounding. In Rio de Janeiro, in preparation for the 2014 World Cup, the city has worked with IBM to create an all-seeing information hub that collects data and could be the nerve centre during an emergency. It can also be used to watch and monitor the city from every angle.</p><p>Most of the major software companies have developed the proprietary code to make and market the future metropolis. Big players such as IBM, Cisco, Siemens, Phillips, and GE are entering the debate on the intelligent city. These big companies are talking to city halls, offering end-to-end solutions, the complete package to retrofit the everyday city for the 21st century.</p><p>Some of the most interesting ideas are coming from the MIT SENSEable Lab, run by the architect and designer Carlo Ratti. Ratti's team at MIT has looked at a number of projects that help the gathering together of huge sources of information that allow us to understand the city-not how we think it might work but how it actually, empirically functions. One project used small GPS monitors to find out where our trash ended up. Starting in Seattle, the team discovered that parts of the city's trash travelled thousands of miles, some items even crossing borders before being discarded.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Copenhagen Wheel, an attractively designed add-on to the back wheel of an ordinary bike, works both as a miniature engine that stores energy for those moments when you need a little help, and a multi-sensor that gathers data on your performance, traffic and air pollution. Simple devices like this could have as large an impact as the massive city-wide public infrastructure projects.</p><p>However, in the hope of developing the intelligent city, perhaps the most radical gesture is also the cheapest. City governments have been gathering data for decades; the use of information technology will make this easier, faster and bigger. But who owns this information? In 2009 Mayor Michael Bloomberg opened the New York City Open Data archive that made copious amounts of city data public. In 2010 Mayor Boris Johnson did the same in London; and since then has been followed by numerous cities around the world.</p><p>The datastore is not just a mechanism for transparency. While it is important that the city government proves itself to be open and accountable, establishing a sense of trust between the city and city hall, the variety of information being offered to general scrutiny has a far more valuable potential in engaging the active citizen. Once data is made available, city hall loses control on how that information is used, and by whom: hackers, activists, website designers, coders or app entrepreneurs. It can be utilised to start a political campaign or launch a new business.</p><p>This donation of the control of information by the traditional government powers to whoever has a broadband connection and a special interest is perhaps the start of the real intelligent city.</p><p>Leo Hollis is an urbanist and historian. His latest book is \"Cities Are Good For You: the Genius of the Metropolis\" (Bloomsbury)What does a citygain by becoming intelligent?</p><p>Rick Robinson</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRSPEC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRSPEC2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58R8-JHV1-F0PR-7028-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2029\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Prospect Magazine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Prospect</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"43160\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>June 20, 2013</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0009VJW</classCode><className>OTIS FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0008WPI</classCode><className>OTIS AS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS333921 ELEVATOR &amp; MOVING STAIRWAY MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC3534 ELEVATORS &amp; MOVING STAIRWAYS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>N333921MM</classCode><className>ELEVATOR &amp; MOVING STAIRWAY MFG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002014</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N331111MM</classCode><className>IRON &amp; STEEL MILLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GX601</classCode><className>NEW YORK, NY, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>GX354</classCode><className>SANAA, YEMEN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>GX301</classCode><className>SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC307</classCode><className>KOREA, REPUBLIC OF</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC566</classCode><className>YEMEN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

(When Myspace rebooted in 2013, it boasted a library of 52 million songs thanks to deals with labels and uploads from users, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3006697/can-justin-timberlake-help-the-vanderhooks-remix-myspace\">according to reports at the time</url>.)</p><p>The news was the latest chapter in the long decline of the once-mighty social media giant. Founded in 2003, a year before Facebook, MySpace boasted about 250 million users in the United States in its heyday. In 2005, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/18/business/news-corp-to-acquire-owner-of-myspacecom.html\">paid $580 million</url> to buy the site\u2019s parent company. Around that time, Myspace.comalso       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/02/technology/02myspace.html\">became</url> the most-visited website in the United States, briefly overtaking Google. But it changed hands two more times in the last decade for a fraction of that price, as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter and other platforms lured users away.</p><p>Myspace grew to be a formidable force in music hosting, at one point amassing the biggest library in digital music. But <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/business/media/myspace-is-accused-of-using-music-without-permission.html\">it struggled on that front, too,</url> eventually losing ground to other services like Spotify.</p><p>For those who kept their accounts, the news of the data loss comes as little surprise. They have complained <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/7uiv8b/myspace_player_wont_play_songs_and_i_want_to/\">in Reddit discussions</url> and elsewhere about receiving similar messages from the company for more than a year. Over the weekend, the frustration spilled into sight again       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1107442118643994624\">after a much-cited tweet by Andy Baio</url>, a former chief technology officer of Kickstarter.</p><p>Jordan Tallent is among the MySpace users who has been trying to recover his music. Last summer, Mr. Tallent, a 26-year-old audio-video professional in London, reached out to Myspace to ask for help recovering songs that his former post-hardcore/heavy metal band, Where Got Ghost, <url normalizedValue=\"https://myspace.com/wheregotghostband\">had uploaded to Myspace</url>.</p><p>A representative of the company told him via email that a 2016 server migration, a transfer of data to a new server, had left some older files irreparably corrupted. But while the recent announcement said that files uploaded before 2016 may have been affected, the representative had told Mr. Tallent that only files before 2013 were missing.</p><p>\u201cIf you had a Myspace profile before 2013 certain content that was related to classic Myspace accounts (messages, comments, blogs, videos, etc.) are no longer available for retrieval or download as they were not migrated to our redesigned website that launched in 2013,\u201d the email read.</p><p>The email noted that Mr. Tallent had not used his account since 2014, which the representative said was \u201cbeyond the period we committed to maintain your profile data.\u201d</p><p>The massive data loss underscores a modern danger: As we increasingly give pieces of our lives over to big tech companies, we lose control of some of our most intimate artifacts.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just going to be digital refugees forever, running from site to site losing things as we go, and our family history is going to disappear,\u201d said Jason Scott, a founder of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.archiveteam.org/\">Archive Team</url>, a loose network of archivists and programmers formed to save data from services at risk of disappearing.</p><p>Failures like the one at Myspace are not just personal catastrophes, Mr. Scott said. The information people share on social media can seem mundane, but it contributes to family and community histories.</p><p>\u201cThis is our modern folklore,\u201d he said.</p><p>Myspace is hardly the first service to lose user data, intentionally or by accident. For example, the photo site Flickr <url normalizedValue=\"http://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/12/17/important-service-updates-and-dates-to-remember/\">began deleting some user-uploaded photos</url> last month.</p><p>Flickr took great care to prepare its users for the deletion, Mr. Scott said, but that was a rare exception. He believes there is only one solution.</p><p>\u201cLaws, straight-up laws,\u201d he said. \u201cBig old, bothersome, \u2018Oh no, our start-up can\u2019t have free vodka on Friday because of the extra money we spend on certifications and holding to them\u2019 laws.\u201d</p><p>He and others warn this will be a recurring story, too. \u201cSomeday, this will happen to Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, etc.,\u201d Cory Doctorow, the author and co-editor of the tech site Boing Boing, <url normalizedValue=\"https://boingboing.net/2019/03/17/facebook-is-next.html\">wrote in a post</url>. \u201cDon\u2019t trust the platforms to archive your data.\u201d</p><p>But even those motivated to save their data often face hurdles. Many popular services do not make it easy to extract the photos, videos and messages that they upload.</p><p>The troubles at MySpace began almost as soon as News Corporation scooped up Intermix Media, whose main asset was Myspace, in 2005. Mr. Murdoch <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/business/murdoch-spars-with-investors-at-annual-meeting.html\">has conceded</url> that his company \u201cproceeded to mismanage it in every possible way,\u201d ultimately selling the company in 2011 to a group of investors that included Justin Timberlake for just $35 million. The company that acquired it, Viant, an ad technology firm,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.viantinc.com/about-us/#history\">describes the move on its website</url> as being motiviated by the consumer data Myspace offered.</p><p>But Myspace would never recover, even as it changed hands, strategies and designs.</p><p>In early 2016, the publisher Time Inc., bought Viant for $87 million. The following year, Meredith Corporation, a media conglomerate, announced plans to buy Time. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1591517/000119312517351617/d459013dex21.htm\">a regulatory filing related to that deal</url>, Time laid out its intellectual property, which it said included consumer data, and e-mail addresses, for about 250 million unique Myspace users in the United States.</p><p>According to data provided by Comscore, the media measurement company, the number of unique visitors to Myspace.comhas fallen precipitously over the past four years. In Febuary 2015, the website had nearly 29 million unique visitors. This February, it had about 2 million.</p><p>And Myspace may change hands again. After Meredith Corporation acquired Time Inc., last year, it put Viant up for sale.</p><p>PHOTO: The pop rock band Four O\u2019clock Heroes, and its Myspace profile, in 2011.

(When Myspace rebooted in 2013, it boasted a library of 52 million songs thanks to deals with labels and uploads from users, according to reports at the time.)</p><p>The news was the latest chapter in the long decline of the once-mighty social media giant. Founded in 2003, a year before Facebook, MySpace boasted about 250 million users in the United States in its heyday. In 2005, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation paid $580 million to buy the site's parent company. Around that time, Myspace.com also became the most-visited website in the United States, briefly overtaking Google. But it changed hands two more times in the last decade for a fraction of that price, as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter and other platforms lured users away.</p><p>Myspace grew to be a formidable force in music hosting, at one point amassing the biggest library in digital music. But  it struggled on that front, too, eventually losing ground to other services like Spotify.</p><p>For those who kept their accounts, the news of the data loss comes as little surprise. They have complained in Reddit discussions and elsewhere about receiving similar messages from the company for more than a year. Over the weekend, the frustration spilled into sight again after a much-cited tweet by Andy Baio, a former chief technology officer of Kickstarter.</p><p>Jordan Tallent is among the MySpace users who has been trying to recover his music. Last summer, Mr. Tallent, a 26-year-old audio-video professional in London, reached out to Myspace to ask for help recovering songs that his former post-hardcore/heavy metal band, Where Got Ghost, had uploaded to Myspace.</p><p>A representative of the company told him via email that a 2016 server migration, a transfer of data to a new server, had left some older files irreparably corrupted. But while the recent announcement said that files uploaded before 2016 may have been affected, the representative had told Mr. Tallent that only files before 2013 were missing.</p><p>\"If you had a Myspace profile before 2013 certain content that was related to classic Myspace accounts (messages, comments, blogs, videos, etc.) are no longer available for retrieval or download as they were not migrated to our redesigned website that launched in 2013,\" the email read.</p><p>The email noted that Mr. Tallent had not used his account since 2014, which the representative said was \"beyond the period we committed to maintain your profile data.\"</p><p>The massive data loss underscores a modern danger: As we increasingly give pieces of our lives over to big tech companies, we lose control of some of our most intimate artifacts.</p><p>\"We're just going to be digital refugees forever, running from site to site losing things as we go, and our family history is going to disappear,\" said Jason Scott, a founder of Archive Team, a loose network of archivists and programmers formed to save data from services at risk of disappearing.</p><p>Failures like the one at Myspace are not just personal catastrophes, Mr. Scott said. The information people share on social media can seem mundane, but it contributes to family and community histories.</p><p>\"This is our modern folklore,\" he said.</p><p>Myspace is hardly the first service to lose user data, intentionally or by accident. For example, the photo site Flickr began deleting some user-uploaded photos last month.</p><p>Flickr took great care to prepare its users for the deletion, Mr. Scott said, but that was a rare exception. He believes there is only one solution.</p><p>\"Laws, straight-up laws,\" he said. \"Big old, bothersome, 'Oh no, our start-up can't have free vodka on Friday because of the extra money we spend on certifications and holding to them' laws.\"</p><p>He and others warn this will be a recurring story, too. \"Someday, this will happen to Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, etc.,\" Cory Doctorow, the author and co-editor of the tech site Boing Boing, wrote in a post. \"Don't trust the platforms to archive your data.\"</p><p>But even those motivated to save their data often face hurdles. Many popular services do not make it easy to extract the photos, videos and messages that they upload.</p><p>The troubles at MySpace began almost as soon as News Corporation scooped up Intermix Media, whose main asset was Myspace, in 2005. Mr. Murdoch has conceded that his company \"proceeded to mismanage it in every possible way,\" ultimately selling the company in 2011 to a group of investors that included Justin Timberlake for just $35 million. The company that acquired it, Viant, an ad technology firm, describes the move on its website as being motiviated by the consumer data Myspace offered.</p><p>But Myspace would never recover, even as it changed hands, strategies and designs.</p><p>In early 2016, the publisher Time Inc., bought Viant for $87 million. The following year, Meredith Corporation, a media conglomerate, announced plans to buy Time. In a regulatory filing related to that deal, Time laid out its intellectual property, which it said included consumer data, and e-mail addresses, for about 250 million unique Myspace users in the United States.</p><p>According to data provided by Comscore, the media measurement company, the number of unique visitors to Myspace.com has fallen precipitously over the past four years. In Febuary 2015, the website had nearly 29 million unique visitors. This February, it had about 2 million.</p><p>And Myspace may change hands again. After Meredith Corporation acquired Time Inc., last year, it put Viant up for sale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006415736</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP4-W3J1-DYR7-C04P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1082\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009QZ8</classCode><className>MYSPACE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp; RELATED SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING &amp; DATA PREPARATION &amp; PROCESSING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

For me, the person that influenced tech in the most positive way in 2017 was the EU's Commissioner for Competition[2]: Margrethe Vestager. She has had a massive impact on how big tech operates in Europe \u2014 and quite possibly the rest of the world \u2014 through monumental cases such as\u00a0Amazon's \u20ac250 million tax fine[3]\u00a0and Alphabet's (Google) historic\u00a0\u20ac2.4 billion fine for anti-trust violations[4]. I could write an article just listing her regulatory accomplishments but let's face it, nobody would read that. That's why I'll be focusing on the ideals she's bringing to tech through her role as Commissioner and why they're important.Some might view Vestager as a regulatory downer who smothers innovation, but for me she's the hero we need to make tech development sustainable for the future.New sheriff in townEver since taking office in 2014, it's been clear that Vestager meant to take big tech head on. </p><p>She brought a certain zeal to the office and she's generally perceived to be more determined than her predecessor, especially when it comes to putting influential companies in their place. Up until now, Vestager has been mostly concerned with tax practices of big tech \u2014 like the massive \u20ac13 billion tax bill[5] she made Ireland collect from Apple back in 2016 \u2014 but it's been reported[6] that she's now made her team look into cases concerning how companies collect and use personal data. That doesn't come as a surprise, given Vestager's digital privacy concerns. Her view, and her mission, was crystalized in her speech at the Web Summit[7] in Portugal back in November. She said[8] that tech companies need to ensure that\u00a0'society [is] served by technology and not the other way around.' I can't see how anybody could argue against this sentiment \u2014 which could be the\u00a0key to good technology[9]\u00a0\u2014 but I've yet to see any other influential people in tech work as hard towards that goal as Vestager has. You might think it's fine that she's fighting for the little guy (us), but she's kind of killing tech while doing it, right? Well, no, I can't disagree more. I'd like to argue that Vestager's (and the EU's) fight to keep big tech in check is beneficial to everybody.Why Vestager is good for techNothing kills innovation like unfair competition. If you have no chance competing with already established tech companies, why would you spend time and money working on innovation? The simple answer is, you wouldn't. And the truth is, that would probably happen if companies like Google weren't kept on a regulatory leash, which you can't really blame them for. I mean, what business wouldn't want to cement its market share? But we need to make sure that doesn't happen so we don't end up with\u00a0a dystopian web[10], where we, the people, would lose our freedom. Tech is advancing at frightening speed, at least for the average person. That's completely understandable seeing that we're on the cusp of an AI driven world. Futurist Ben Hammersley\u00a0argued at our conference in 2017[11] that the normal people's fear of technology was probably one of the underlying factors for the rise of Trump and the blunderous Brexit. When people are scared they react in unpredictable and often destructive ways, which is bad because tech is only getting scarier. That's why it's so incredibly important that new technologies are built on trust, and people like Vestager are the ones the ensure that they are. She's trying to make sure that everybody, no matter how big or important they might be, play according to the rules that we as a society have set. It isn't sustainable to allow companies to advance tech completely unhinged because one can imagine that the reaction from the general public might only get more severe in the future. We need to make sure that tech is built to serve people and that companies have our interests, not just their own, in mind \u2014 for our sake and the sake of technological advancement.\u00a0We don't get to vote on what Amazon, Google, Apple, or others will do, but we do get to vote for the people that create the rules those companies must adhere to. Now you might think it's ridiculous to be so dramatic about the future of tech, that it's only a tool or a device that can be used to our benefit or our detriment, it just depends on the person wielding it. That's technically true, but I'd say we aren't quite there yet, especially with frontier tech like AI. I've heard a few tech evangelists use a variation of the same analogy when promoting somewhat controversial technologies. It's that tech is only a tool, like a hammer, and that it can be used constructively \u2014 like building a house \u2014 or destructively \u2014 like breaking someone's fingers. However, that analogy doesn't work for tech unless we have strict regulations in place that make it illegal to misuse the tool. If you attack someone with a hammer, you go to jail, but right now, we haven't similarly prescribed repercussions when companies use digital tools in a way that harms us, the consumers. However, people like Vestager are the ones that are trying to fix that, and working hard to do so.The importance of symbolismOf course Vestager isn't pulling regulatory miracles out of her sleeve through some personal magic. She has the power of organizations and governing bodies governing bodies behind her, and in many ways, she's just the one to implement the rules that have been already set. We all know that, but I can't help but feel that what she brings to the office, through her character, is almost equally important. We humans are simple creatures and we need help with understanding large and complex issues, and one of the easiest ways to do that is through people, by having a real person at the helm that acts as a representation of the issue. We could probably achieve just the same through committees, institutions, and organizations \u2014 but it just wouldn't make its mark on the general consciousness like having a person embody those values. The added symbolism of having a woman at the forefront of reigning in a male-dominated field also doesn't hurt in today's climate. Vestager isn't necessarily a perfect human or a politician with impeccable ideals, but at least she's trying (and succeeding) to keep tech responsible through accountability \u2014 and that's exactly what we need. I can't wait to see what she'll do for tech in 2018 and if you're the same, you can follow her\u00a0on Twitter[12], where she frequently shares updates on her work.

She said that tech companies need to ensure that \"society [is] served by technology and not the other way around.\" I can't see how anybody could argue against this sentiment - which could be the key to good technology - but I've yet to see any other influential people in tech work as hard towards that goal as Vestager has.<br/> You might think it's fine that she's fighting for the little guy (us), but she's kind of killing tech while doing it, right? Well, no, I can't disagree more. I'd like to argue that Vestager's (and the EU's) fight to keep big tech in check is beneficial to everybody. Why Vestager is good for tech<br/> Nothing kills innovation like unfair competition. If you have no chance competing with already established tech companies, why would you spend time and money working on innovation? The simple answer is, you wouldn't.<br/> And the truth is, that would probably happen if companies like Google weren't kept on a regulatory leash, which you can't really blame them for. I mean, what business wouldn't want to cement its market share? But we need to make sure that doesn't happen so we don't end up with a dystopian web, where we, the people, would lose our freedom.<br/> Tech is advancing at frightening speed, at least for the average person. That's completely understandable seeing that we're on the cusp of an AI driven world. Futurist Ben Hammersley argued at our conference in 2017 that the normal people's fear of technology was probably one of the underlying factors for the rise of Trump and the blunderous Brexit.<br/> When people are scared they react in unpredictable and often destructive ways, which is bad because tech is only getting scarier. That's why it's so incredibly important that new technologies are built on trust, and people like Vestager are the ones the ensure that they are. She's trying to make sure that everybody, no matter how big or important they might be, play according to the rules that we as a society have set.<br/> It isn't sustainable to allow companies to advance tech completely unhinged because one can imagine that the reaction from the general public might only get more severe in the future. We need to make sure that tech is built to serve people and that companies have our interests, not just their own, in mind - for our sake and the sake of technological advancement. We don't get to vote on what Amazon, Google, Apple, or others will do, but we do get to vote for the people that create the rules those companies must adhere to.<br/> Now you might think it's ridiculous to be so dramatic about the future of tech, that it's only a tool or a device that can be used to our benefit or our detriment, it just depends on the person wielding it. That's technically true, but I'd say we aren't quite there yet, especially with frontier tech like AI.<br/> I've heard a few tech evangelists use a variation of the same analogy when promoting somewhat controversial technologies. It's that tech is only a tool, like a hammer, and that it can be used constructively - like building a house - or destructively - like breaking someone's fingers.<br/> However, that analogy doesn't work for tech unless we have strict regulations in place that make it illegal to misuse the tool. If you attack someone with a hammer, you go to jail, but right now, we haven't similarly prescribed repercussions when companies use digital tools in a way that harms us, the consumers. However, people like Vestager are the ones that are trying to fix that, and working hard to do so. The importance of symbolism<br/> Of course Vestager isn't pulling regulatory miracles out of her sleeve through some personal magic. She has the power of organizations and governing bodies governing bodies behind her, and in many ways, she's just the one to implement the rules that have been already set. We all know that, but I can't help but feel that what she brings to the office, through her character, is almost equally important.<br/> We humans are simple creatures and we need help with understanding large and complex issues, and one of the easiest ways to do that is through people, by having a real person at the helm that acts as a representation of the issue. We could probably achieve just the same through committees, institutions, and organizations - but it just wouldn't make its mark on the general consciousness like having a person embody those values. The added symbolism of having a woman at the forefront of reigning in a male-dominated field also doesn't hurt in today's climate.<br/> Vestager isn't necessarily a perfect human or a politician with impeccable ideals, but at least she's trying (and succeeding) to keep tech responsible through accountability - and that's exactly what we need. I can't wait to see what she'll do for tech in 2018 and if you're the same, you can follow her on Twitter, where she frequently shares updates on her work.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10309839</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8C-2R61-DYDW-73JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1113\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 26, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They think Brexit isn't going to happen. There are some media observers - in this country and around the world - who think we are going to bottle it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I detect scepticism about whether we have the stamina, the guts, the persistence to pull it off. They think that the Brexit Bill will get lost in a House of Commons crevasse or buried in some interminable Jarndyce and Jarndyce legal proceedings. They think that we will simply despair of finding the way out of the EU and sit down on the floor and cry - like some toddler lost in the maze at Hampton Court.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, in so far as they doubt our resolve, I believe they are wrong; and I am here to tell you that this country will succeed in our new national enterprise, and will succeed mightily.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those 17.4\u00a0million people - they weren't fools, you know. They weren't stupid. They weren't as bad as some would have you believe. They were right; and even if you think they were wrong, I hope you agree that it is our duty, as democrats, to fulfil the mandate they gave us.</p><p>I respect those who voted to remain. More than respect them. They number some of the people I love the most in the world. And we all know that it is far too simple to divide this country into Leavers and Remainers.</p><p>We know the complexity of the decision, and how each person brought different mixtures of reason and emotion, heart and head.</p><p>There were lifelong Eurosceptics who decided at the last moment to remain; and a great many, in my view, whose heart said leave, but whose resolve was finally shaken by the warnings of the Government, the BBC, Barack Obama, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the CBI, every major political party and much of the media.</p><p>And then there were dyed-in-the-wool Europhiles, who thought Brussels was going too far and the only way to get change was to vote Leave.</p><p>It is not fair or right for one side to stereotype the motives of the other, because there is no stereotype. But the choice was binary. The result was decisive. There is simply no way - or no good way - of being 52 per cent out and 48 per cent in.</p><p>Before the referendum, we all agreed on what leaving the EU logically must entail: leaving the customs union and the single market, leaving the penumbra of the European Court of Justice; taking back control of our borders, cash, laws.</p><p>That is the programme that Theresa May set out with such clarity in her speech on January 17 at Lancaster House, and that is what she and her Government will deliver.</p><p>                   The answer is always the same: more Europe!                   </p><p>Overwhelmingly, I find that Leavers and Remainers are coming together - sometimes with a slight impatience - and urging us to get on and do it, and do a deal that is in the interests of both sides of the channel.</p><p>In 10 years', 20 years' time, when we consider the arc of history comprised by our 45 years of EU membership, we will have a better and fairer comprehension of these events - why the British people wanted to join and why, eventually and sometimes regretfully, they wanted to leave.</p><p>To understand why we wanted to join, you have to remember the shock of Suez, the loss of confidence in Westminster and Whitehall, the way in which this post-imperial future was sold to the people - a common market, a way of maximising trade.</p><p>Then came the gradual realisation that this was a very different agenda, an attempt not just at economic but political integration of a kind that the British people had never bargained for; and you may remember how we were repeatedly assured that even if we were unhappy with the direction of the project, even if we disagreed with the concept of ever closer union, it was none the less worth putting up with it all for the sake of the influence we would have.</p><p>Of course we should pay tribute to the patriotic British men and women who went out to Brussels and got stuck into those institutions. The EU today is better for their contribution, but in the end we have to accept that they were only partly successful.</p><p>And it is notable that today their numbers have diminished to the point where the UK represents 16 per cent of EU GDP and 13 per cent of the population but only 3.6 per cent of EU officials.</p><p>If we had been asked to design the EU ourselves, on a blank sheet of paper, we would have nothing like the body that exists today. We tried so often to frustrate it.</p><p>.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component .quote.component .component-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source, .quote__author {white-space: normal;}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embed.component .quote.component .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12px;padding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}To every question, to every crisis - whether it is the euro or immigration - the answer is always the same: more Europe!</p><p>I was there at the Antibes EcoFin meeting, made up of the economics and finance ministers from all member states, when British officials made a gallant attempt to strangle the euro at birth with a project called the \"hard Ecu\", or fixed-rate European Currency Unit.</p><p>I was there when they ambushed Margaret Thatcher at the Rome summit with conclusions that the British thought had been explicitly rejected.</p><p>I remember how we kept trying to stop this or that - we rejected the very notion of political union; we tried to stop the expansion of majority voting.</p><p>And I remember the mantra of EU officials - Britain objects, Britain protests, but in the end she always signs up.</p><p>Although we kept trying to deny it - with an embarrassing lack of realism - we all knew that the logic was not economic but political.

I wish that were true. Yes, we do have allies - countries that look to us for a lead on deregulation, and free markets, and trying to resist the centralising role of the Commission. But I am afraid that all too often, when push comes to shove, that apparent willingness to support the UK position is less powerful than the great centripetal force of integration.</p><p>To every question, to every crisis - whether it is the euro or immigration - the answer is always the same: more Europe!</p><p>I look ahead over the next 15 years at what may be coming down the track: the push to create an economic government of Europe, the activism of the ECJ in all the new competences of the Lisbon Treaty; and I ask myself, do I really believe that if we had stayed in, we would have produced a more devolved, a more decentralised, a more free-trading European Union?</p><p>I am afraid not.</p><p>And therefore it is wrong for us to be there - always trying to make things different, always getting in the way, always moaning.</p><p>Our destiny will be in our own hands</p><p>Our friends have embarked on a visionary but difficult project. Though the eurozone is growing more strongly now - and that is immensely positive - the logic of their ambition means trying to construct what is effectively a single polity out of 27 countries.</p><p>That plan is simply not for Britain, and we should have been more honest about it years ago. We have spent too much time trying, and often failing, to exert influence in the meeting rooms of Brussels. That exercise has diverted massive quantities of the intellectual energy of the British government, and it has not helped us to address the real challenges this country faces.</p><p>It is important to have a sense of perspective about these challenges, because the sky has not fallen in since June 23. We have not seen the prophesied 500,000 increase in unemployment and the Treasury has not so far sought to punish the British people with an emergency budget.</p><p>On the contrary: unemployment is at record lows, and manufacturing is booming \"in spite of Brexit\", as the BBC would put it. (Have you noticed that any good news is always \"in spite of Brexit\"?)</p><p>But, of course, this country still has chronic problems, and at least some of them have been exacerbated by the rigidities of EU membership - and certainly by the way we have chosen legally to apply those obligations.</p><p>Our infrastructure is too expensive - and takes far longer than France or other countries.</p><p>Successive governments have failed to build enough homes - though this is now being tackled by Sajid Javid .</p><p>Our vocational training is often superb - but still not inspirational, and we have yet to find a way of persuading middle-class kids that they might be just as well off getting a skill as a degree.</p><p>We do not conduct enough basic research in science, and I am afraid we still have too many schools that are content with second-best.</p><p>The result of all these failings - over decades - is that we have low productivity: lower than France or Germany.</p><p>.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component .quote.component .component-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source, .quote__author {white-space: normal;}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embed.component .quote.component .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12px;padding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}I believe we have an immense can-do spirit. I have seen it in action.</p><p>I believe we have an immense can-do spirit. I have seen it in action. But we also have a truly phenomenal ability to delay and to rack up cost. We have been able to blame bureaucracy and to blame Brussels, and my point is that after Brexit we will no longer be able to blame anyone but ourselves.</p><p>Our destiny will be in our own hands, and that will be immensely healthy.</p><p>We are not going to dismantle the corpus of EU law on exit. On the contrary, the objective of the repeal Bill is to incorporate it. Our systems of standards will remain absolutely flush with the rest of the EU.</p><p>We would not expect to pay for access to their markets any more than they would expect to pay for access to ours.</p><p>And yes - once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly \u00a3350 million per week. It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS, provided we use that cash injection to modernise and make the most of new technology.</p><p>The NHS is one of the great unifying institutions of our country. It is the top political priority of the British people and, under the leadership of Jeremy Hunt, it is indeed the top priority of the Conservative Party. Coming out of the EU will give us an opportunity to drive that message home.</p><p>And as we take back control of our cash, and our borders, and our laws, we will certainly not jettison what is good. We will keep environmental and social protections that are fair and wise.</p><p>Outside the EU, there are obvious opportunities</p><p>But over time we will be able to diverge from the great accumulated conglomerate, to act with regulatory freedom. I mean no disrespect to the authors and champions of the single market - but whether you believe such notable authorities as Peter Mandelson, who once claimed that EU regulation cost us 4 per cent of GDP, or Gordon Brown, who said the cost was nearer 7 per cent, it is fair to say that it has not produced the growth or the synergies that were originally forecast.</p><p>Outside the EU, there are obvious opportunities - in agriculture, fisheries, in the setting of indirect taxation. At the stroke of a pen, for instance,  the Chancellor will be able to cut VAT on tampons . This is often demanded by Parliament but - absurdly - it is legally impossible to deliver.</p><p>We will have an immigration policy that suits the UK, not slamming the door but welcoming the talent we need, from the EU and around the world. Of course we will make sure that business gets the skills it needs, but business will no longer be able to use immigration as an excuse not to invest in the young people of this country.</p><p>And I can think of obvious ways in which Brexit can help us tackle the housing crisis - perhaps the single biggest challenge facing the younger generation.</p><p>There may be ways of simplifying planning procedures, post-Brexit, and abbreviating impact assessments, without in any way compromising the environment.</p><p>It is often pointed out that the price of housing in certain parts of London may be pushed up by buyers from overseas. But there is no point in putting any kind of tax on foreign buyers, because the inhabitants of 27 other countries cannot legally be treated as foreign.</p><p>No one would want a tax that discouraged international investment and stopped good developments from happening. No one would want to send a signal that the London market was closed. But it would at least be possible to have the argument. That is what we mean by taking back control.</p><p>Outside the EU, we will be on our mettle - obliged to set policy to prioritise areas where the UK is strong. One of the advantages of investing in the NHS - if we combine that investment with reform - is that we can turbo-charge the role of our health service in driving bioscience.</p><p>The NHS is a national asset whose data banks record the dizzying range of diseases that our flesh is heir to. Freed from EU regimes - often cumbersome and hard to change - we will be able to accelerate our work on gene therapy - an infant science, now taking its first faltering steps, whose potential is gigantic. Britain is already at the forefront of this, and we can lengthen our lead.</p><p>Britain can become a tech powerhouse</p><p>We should seize the opportunity of Brexit to reform our tax system. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, argued in 2015 that our system is currently skewed so as to discourage investment. He believes that reform could raise output by around 20 per cent.</p><p>We should use the opportunities afforded by historically low interest rates to give this country the infrastructure it deserves - especially in London, the most dynamic and productive urban economy in Europe, where things seem frankly to have gone a bit quiet since the departure of the last Mayor.</p><p>There is an agenda that will help to drive the UK economy for decades - new road tunnels, new bridges, Crossrail 2, Tube extensions, and the housing developments made possible by this infrastructure.</p><p>This is our chance to catch the wave of new technology, and to put Britain in the lead. In the next 20 years I believe traditional car companies will vanish as we switch to automated vehicles. Millions of jobs will go, and millions of new jobs will be created. Traditional supply chains will be disrupted, and new supply chains will be created.</p><p>And, of course, the instinct of the European Commission will always be to protect against that revolution, to regulate, to muffle that change - listening, as they always do, to the vested interests of the big EU manufacturers.</p><p>People often ask themselves why the EU has failed to produced a single major tech giant on the scale of those found in America. Well, part of the answer may be found in the statist and top-down approach that characterises the thinking of the Commission.</p><p>Have you ever wondered what happened to Minitel, the state-owned and managed French equivalent of Google? Or what good was done by all those directives - dating from the early Nineties - on les r\u00e9seaux t\u00e9l\u00e9matiques? Did they produce a European champion? Pas encore.</p><p>There are in fact four zones of the world where big tech investments are made: Boston, Silicon Valley, Shanghai and the triangle formed by London, Oxford and Cambridge.</p><p>Let us have the confidence to experiment, to be at the cutting edge. My brother, Jo Johnson, is finalising the candidates for the location of a new UK space centre, and this Government is investing in the truly revolutionary Sabre project in Hampshire - a system that promises radically to reduce our journey times around this Earth.</p><p>We are investing in the new battery technology that will be part of the driverless revolution. And this country already boasts companies such as Deep Mind, one of the most promising artificial intelligence companies in the world.</p><p>These are just some of the most obvious areas for the future development of UK technology. What we cannot now know - as the great French economist Bastiat observed in the 19th century - is the unseen opportunity cost of the way the UK economic structure has evolved to fit the EU over the last four and a half decades, and the productive ways in which it might now evolve.</p><p>But we do know one thing: that we will be able to get on and do free-trade deals, to campaign for free trade that has lifted billions out of poverty, which so badly needs a new champion.</p><p>We will be able to intensify old friendships around the world, not least with fast-growing Commonwealth economies, and to build a truly Global Britain.</p><p>Brexit will work for everyone</p><p>Britain's success will not be a bad thing for our friends across the Channel. On the contrary, it will mean a bigger market in the UK for everything from Italian cars to German wine. And we will be there for our friends and partners.</p><p>We will be the largest military power in Europe, and with our growing defence budget we are now making an ever-more vivid commitment to the defence of Europe - like the new deployments in Estonia - and to our common European ideals and values.</p><p>That is the goal the Prime Minister has set out - a strong EU, buttressed and supported by a strong UK, and linked by a deep and special partnership founded on the mutual benefits of free trade.</p><p>We have a glorious future - but hardly any of this would be possible under the bizarre and incoherent plans of the Labour Party. It seems that Jeremy Corbyn has chickened out. He has already betrayed the students who voted for him, dropping his absurd pledge to cancel all their debts.</p><p>Now he is betraying the millions of Labour supporters who voted Leave and who thought that he also wanted to leave, to get on and deliver the will of the people. (For a man of such unbending Lefty principle, he seems to have a remarkable beardy ability to speak out both sides of his mouth.)</p><p>Now it appears he wants to remain in the single market and the customs union. In other words, he would make a complete mockery of Brexit, and turn an opportunity into a national humiliation. It would be the worst of both worlds, with the UK turned into a vassal state - taking direction from the EU, but with no power to influence the EU's decisions.</p><p>It is a totally invertebrate position, and betrays a dismal lack of confidence in this country.</p><p>We are not turning our backs on the world</p><p>I end on the point with which I began - that groundless and peculiar lack of confidence in Britain.</p><p>I remember when the project for European citizenship was launched by Jacques Delors in the early Nineties. At the time, I thought it was a bit of a gimmick. I used to doubt that you could build such a thing as a European identity out of the mosaic of states.</p><p>I was indignant when they came out with the European passport, and when they said that all car number plates had to carry the 12-star flag, but I never thought that Brussels would succeed in its aim.</p><p>I used to look at the Brussels bumper stickers saying \"Mon patrie, c'est Europe\" and think it was a bit of a laugh, and that they would never engender a genuine Euro-patriotism, or compete with people's natural feelings for their own country.</p><p>I have to say that I am now not so sure. I think I was complacent. I look at so many young people with the 12 stars lipsticked on their faces and I am troubled with the thought that people are beginning to have genuinely split allegiances.</p><p>And when people say that they feel they have more in common with others in Europe than with people who voted Leave, I want to say: \"But that is part of the reason why people voted Leave.\"</p><p>You don't have to be some tub-thumping nationalist to worry that a transnational sense of allegiance can weaken the ties between us; and you don't have to be an out-and-out nationalist to feel an immense pride in this country and what it can do.</p><p>We have the biggest financial centre in this hemisphere - and, by common consent, we will still have one by the time the Brexit controversy is a distant memory. I have seen the prophets of doom proved wrong so many times.</p><p>They said it would be a disaster if we left the ERM in 1992, and again if we failed to join the euro in 1999; and again in the 2008 crash, when they prophesied that the bankers would flee to Zug and Zurich. Yet London has sailed serenely through, riding the waves of adversity, as we have for centuries.</p><p>Look at Canary Wharf - a banking district now bigger than Frankfurt itself.</p><p>Look at our universities - the best in the world, with just one Cambridge college responsible not just for more Nobel prizes than France but indeed for more than Russia and China combined.</p><p>It is an astonishing fact that of all the kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers in the world, one in seven was educated in this country. While I have been Foreign Secretary, I am proud to have expanded the amazing Chevening and Commonwealth scholarship schemes that bring so many talented people into this country's system, which will ensure that the leaders of the world will be educated in Britain - and have a natural understanding of and affinity for Britain - for generations to come.</p><p>.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component .quote.component .component-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source, .quote__author {white-space: normal;}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embed.component .quote.component .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12px;padding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}Britain at the beginning of the 21st century was the second-greatest power on Earth after America.</p><p>Just stand on the streets of central London and listen to the excitement of the tourists.

A great, bright, warm six-million-strong constellation of British minds and British hearts, a pulse in the eternal mind, no less, giving somewhere back the thoughts by Britain given (as Rupert Brooke almost puts it). Aid workers, journalists, businesspeople, artists, all helping in myriad ways to make the world a better place.</p><p>We have the youngest and fastest-growing population of any major EU economy, and on current estimates we will be the most populous country in western Europe by the middle of this century.</p><p>.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component .quote.component .component-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source, .quote__author {white-space: normal;}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embed.component .quote.component .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12px;padding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny.</p><p>If we organise, if we plan, if we build the homes and the infrastructure we need, if we give our young people the skills and the confidence that they could so easily acquire, then we can also ensure that this country is not just the place where everyone wants to come and live, but the place with the highest standard of living, with the per-capita GDP, the productivity and the quality of life that we deserve.</p><p>That means insisting on a culture that is pro-business and pro-enterprise, but one that is so dynamic that fat cats can no longer sit unpunished in their jobs when they let everyone down.</p><p>It means simplifying regulation, and cutting taxes, wherever we can - but also ensuring that everyone in a company is decently paid, because that is the way to boost productivity.</p><p>I am not saying that all this will be some kind of cinch.

They think Brexit isn't going to happen. There are some media observers - in this country and around the world - who think we are going to bottle it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I detect scepticism about whether we have the stamina, the guts, the persistence to pull it off. They think that the Brexit Bill will get lost in a House of Commons crevasse or buried in some interminable Jarndyce and Jarndyce legal proceedings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They think that we will simply despair of finding the way out of the EU and sit down on the floor and cry - like some toddler lost in the maze at Hampton Court.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, in so far as they doubt our resolve, I believe they are wrong; and I am here to tell you that this country will succeed in our new national enterprise, and will succeed mightily.</p><p>Those 17.4 million people - they weren't fools, you know. They weren't stupid. They weren't as bad as some would have you believe.</p><p>They were right; and even if you think they were wrong, I hope you agree that it is our duty, as democrats, to fulfil the mandate they gave us.</p><p>I respect those who voted to remain. More than respect them. They number some of the people I love the most in the world. And we all know that it is far too simple to divide this country into Leavers and Remainers.</p><p>We know the complexity of the decision, and how each person brought different mixtures of reason and emotion, heart and head.</p><p>There were lifelong Eurosceptics who decided at the last moment to remain; and a great many, in my view, whose heart said leave, but whose resolve was finally shaken by the warnings of the Government, the BBC, Barack Obama, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the CBI, every major political party and much of the media. And then there were dyed-inthe-wool Europhiles, who thought Brussels was going too far and the only way to get change was to vote Leave.</p><p>It is not fair or right for one side to stereotype the motives of the other, because there is no stereotype. But the choice was binary. The result was decisive. There is simply no way - or no good way - of being 52 per cent out and 48 per cent in.</p><p>Before the referendum, we all agreed on what leaving the EU logically must entail: leaving the customs union and the single market, leaving the penumbra of the European Court of Justice; taking back control of our borders, cash, laws.</p><p>That is the programme that <person><nameText>Theresa May </nameText></person>set out with such clarity in her speech on January 17 at Lancaster House, and that is what she and her Government will deliver.</p><p>Overwhelmingly, I find that Leavers and Remainers are coming together - sometimes with a slight impatience - and urging us to get on and do it, and do a deal that is in the interests of both sides of the Channel.</p><p>In 10 years', 20 years' time, when we consider the arc of history comprised by our 45 years of EU membership, we will have a better and fairer comprehension of these events - why the British people wanted to join and why, eventually and sometimes regretfully, they wanted to leave.</p><p>To understand why we wanted to join, you have to remember the shock of Suez, the loss of confidence in Westminster and Whitehall, the way in which this postimperial future was sold to the people - a Common Market, a way of maximising trade.</p><p>Then came the gradual realisation that this was a very different agenda, an attempt not just at economic but political integration of a kind that the British people had never bargained for; and you may remember how we were repeatedly assured that even if we were unhappy with the direction of the project, even if we disagreed with the concept of ever closer union, it was none the less worth putting up with it all for the sake of the influence we would have.</p><p>Of course we should pay tribute to the patriotic British men and women who went out to Brussels and got stuck into those institutions. The EU today is better for their contribution, but in the end we have to accept that they were only partly successful. And it is notable that today their numbers have diminished to the point where the UK represents 16 per cent of EU GDP and 13 per cent of the population but only 3.6 per cent of EU officials.</p><p>If we had been asked to design the EU ourselves, on a blank sheet of paper, we would have nothing like the body that exists today. We tried so often to frustrate it.</p><p>I was there at the Antibes ecofin meeting, made up of the economics and finance ministers from all member states, when British officials made a gallant attempt to strangle the euro at birth with a project called the \"hard Ecu\", or fixedrate European Currency Unit.</p><p>I was there when they ambushed Margaret Thatcher at the Rome summit with conclusions that the British thought had been explicitly rejected.</p><p>I remember how we kept trying to stop this or that - we rejected the very notion of political union; we tried to stop the expansion of majority voting.</p><p>And I remember the mantra of EU officials - Britain objects, Britain protests, but in the end she always signs up.</p><p>Although we kept trying to deny it - with an embarrassing lack of realism - we all knew that the logic was not economic but political. It wasn't about creating a single market; it was about trussing the nations together in a gigantic and evertightening cat's cradle of red tape.</p><p>And today the argument is still the same - that if only we were there we could somehow reform it all, make it more congenial to our instincts. I wish that were true.</p><p>Yes, we do have allies - countries that look to us for a lead on deregulation, and free markets, and try to resist the centralising role of the Commission. But I am afraid that all too often, when push comes to shove, that apparent willingness to support the UK position is less powerful than the great centripetal force of integration.</p><p>To every question, to every crisis - whether it is the euro or immigration - the answer is always the same: more Europe!</p><p>I look ahead over the next 15 years at what may be coming down the track: the push to create an economic government of Europe, the activism of the ECJ in all the new competences of the Lisbon Treaty; and I ask myself, do I really believe that if we had stayed in, we would have produced a more devolved, a more decentralised, a more free-trading European Union? I am afraid not. And therefore it is wrong for us to be there - always trying to make things different, always getting in the way, always moaning.</p><p>ur friends have embarked on a visionary but difficult project. Though the eurozone is growing more strongly now - and that is immensely positive - the logic of their ambition means trying to construct what is effectively a single polity out of 27 countries.</p><p>OPA That plan is simply not for Britain, and we should have been more honest about it years ago. We have spent too much time trying, and often failing, to exert influence in the meeting rooms of Brussels. That exercise has diverted massive quantities of the intellectual energy of the British government, and it has not helped us to address the real challenges this country faces.</p><p>I-IMAGES; It is important to have a sense of perspective about these challenges, because the sky has not fallen in since June 23. We have not seen the prophesied 500,000 increase in unemployment and the Treasury has not so far sought to punish the British people with an emergency budget.</p><p>On the contrary: unemployment is at record lows, and manufacturing is booming \"in spite of Brexit\", as the BBC would put it. (Have you noticed that any good news is always \"in spite of Brexit\"?) But, of course, this country still has chronic problems, and at least some of them have been exacerbated by the rigidities of EU membership - and certainly by the way we have chosen legally to apply those obligations.</p><p>Our infrastructure is too expensive - and takes far longer than France or other countries.</p><p>Successive governments have failed to build enough homes - though this is now being tackled by Sajid Javid.</p><p>Our vocational training is often superb - but still not inspirational, and we have yet to find a way of persuading middle-class kids that they might be just as well off getting a skill as a degree.</p><p>We do not conduct enough basic research in science, and I am afraid we still have too many schools that are content with second-best.</p><p>The result of all these failings - over decades - is that we have low productivity: lower than France or Germany.</p><p>I believe we have an immense can-do spirit. I have seen it in action. But we also have a truly phenomenal ability to delay and to rack up cost. We have been able to blame bureaucracy and to blame Brussels, and my point is that after Brexit we will no longer be able to blame anyone but ourselves.</p><p>Our destiny will be in our own hands, and that will be immensely healthy.</p><p>We are not going to dismantle the corpus of EU law on exit. On the contrary, the objective of the Repeal Bill is to incorporate it. Our systems of standards will remain absolutely flush with the rest of the EU.</p><p>We would not expect to pay for access to their markets any more than they would expect to pay for access to ours.</p><p>And yes - once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly \u00a3350 million per week. It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS, provided we use that cash injection to modernise and make the most of new technology. The NHS is one of the great unifying institutions of our country. It is the top political priority of the British people and, under the leadership of Jeremy Hunt, it is indeed the top priority of the Conservative Party. Coming out of the EU will give us an opportunity to drive that message home.</p><p>s we take back control of our cash, and our borders, and our laws, we will certainly not jettison what is good. We will keep environmental and social protections that are fair and wise.</p><p>ABut over time we will be able to diverge from the great accumulated conglomerate, to act with regulatory freedom. I mean no disrespect to the authors and champions of the single market - but whether you believe such notable authorities as Peter Mandelson, who once claimed that EU regulation cost us 4 per cent of GDP, or Gordon Brown, who said the cost was nearer 7 per cent, it is fair to say that it has not produced the growth or the synergies that were originally forecast.</p><p>Outside the EU, there are obvious opportunities - in agriculture, fisheries, in the setting of indirect taxation. At the stroke of a pen, for instance, the Chancellor will be able to cut VAT on tampons. This is often demanded by Parliament but - absurdly - it is legally impossible to deliver.</p><p>We will have an immigration policy that suits the UK, not slamming the door but welcoming the talent we need, from the EU and around the world. Of course we will make sure that business gets the skills it needs, but business will no longer be able to use immigration as an excuse not to invest in the young people of this country.</p><p>And I can think of obvious ways in which Brexit can help us tackle the housing crisis - perhaps the single biggest challenge facing the younger generation.</p><p>There may be ways of simplifying planning procedures, post-Brexit, and abbreviating impact assessments, without in any way compromising the environment.</p><p>It is often pointed out that the price of housing in certain parts of London may be pushed up by buyers from overseas. But there is no point in putting any kind of tax on foreign buyers, because the inhabitants of 27 other countries cannot legally be treated as <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.foreign.No\">www.foreign.No</url> one would want a tax that discouraged international investment and stopped good developments from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.happening.No\">www.happening.No</url> one would want to send a signal that the London market was closed. But it would at least be possible to have the argument. That is what we mean by taking back control.</p><p>utside the EU, we will be on our mettle - obliged to set policy to prioritise areas where the UK is strong. One of the advantages of investing in the NHS - if we combine that investment with reform - is that we can turbocharge the role of our health service in driving bioscience.</p><p>OThe NHS is a national asset whose data banks record the dizzying range of diseases that our flesh is heir to. Freed from EU regimes - often cumbersome and hard to change - we will be able to accelerate our work on gene therapy - an infant science, now taking its first faltering steps, whose potential is gigantic. Britain is already at the forefront of this, and we can lengthen our lead.</p><p>We should seize the opportunity of Brexit to reform our tax system. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, argued in 2015 that our system is currently skewed so as to discourage investment. He believes that reform could raise output by around 20 per cent.</p><p>We should use the opportunities afforded by historically low interest rates to give this country the infrastructure it deserves - especially in London, the most dynamic and productive urban economy in Europe, where things seem frankly to have gone a bit quiet since the departure of the last Mayor.</p><p>There is an agenda that will help to drive the UK economy for decades - new road tunnels, new bridges, Crossrail 2, Tube extensions, and the housing developments made possible by this infrastructure.</p><p>This is our chance to catch the wave of new technology, and to put Britain in the lead. In the next 20 years I believe traditional car companies will vanish as we switch to automated vehicles. Millions of jobs will go, and millions of new jobs will be created. Traditional supply chains will be disrupted, and new supply chains will be created. And, of course, the instinct of the European Commission will always be to protect against that revolution, to regulate, to muffle that change - listening, as they always do, to the vested interests of the big EU manufacturers.</p><p>People often ask themselves why the EU has failed to produced a single major tech giant on the scale of those found in America. Well, part of the answer may be found in the statist and top-down approach that characterises the thinking of the Commission.</p><p>Have you ever wondered what happened to Minitel, the state-owned and managed French equivalent of Google? Or what good was done by all those directives - dating from the early Nineties - on les r\u00e9seaux t\u00e9l\u00e9matiques? Did they produce a European champion? Pas encore.</p><p>There are in fact four zones of the world where big tech investments are made: Boston, Silicon Valley, Shanghai and the triangle formed by London, Oxford and Cambridge.</p><p>Let us have the confidence to experiment, to be at the cutting edge. My brother, Jo Johnson, is finalising the candidates for the location of a new UK space centre, and this Government is investing in the truly revolutionary Sabre project in Hampshire - a system that promises radically to reduce our journey times around this Earth.</p><p>We are investing in the new battery technology that will be part of the driverless revolution. And this country already boasts companies such as Deep Mind, one of the most promising artificial intelligence companies in the world.</p><p>These are just some of the most obvious areas for the future development of UK technology. What we cannot now know - as the great French economist Bastiat observed in the 19th century - is the unseen opportunity cost of the way the UK economic structure has evolved to fit the EU over the last four and a half decades, and the productive ways in which it might now evolve.</p><p>But we do know one thing: that we will be able to get on and do free trade deals, to campaign for free trade that has lifted billions out of poverty, which so badly needs a new champion.</p><p>We will be able to intensify old friendships around the world, not least with fast-growing Commonwealth economies, and to build a truly Global Britain.</p><p>Britain's success will not be a bad thing for our friends across the Channel. On the contrary, it will mean a bigger market in the UK for everything from Italian cars to German wine. And we will be there for our friends and partners.</p><p>We will be the largest military power in Europe, and with our growing defence budget we are now making an ever-more vivid commitment to the defence of Europe - like the new deployments in Estonia - and to our common European ideals and values.</p><p>That is the goal the Prime Minister has set out - a strong EU, buttressed and supported by a strong UK, and linked by a deep and special partnership founded on the mutual benefits of free trade.</p><p>We have a glorious future - but hardly any of this would be possible under the bizarre and incoherent plans of the Labour Party. It seems that Jeremy Corbyn has chickened out. He has already betrayed the students who voted for him, dropping his absurd pledge to cancel all their debts.</p><p>Now he is betraying the millions of Labour supporters who voted Leave and who thought that he also wanted to leave, to get on and deliver the will of the people. (For a man of such unbending Lefty principle, he seems to have a remarkable beardy ability to speak out both sides of his mouth.) Now it appears he wants to remain in the single market and the customs union. In other words, he would make a complete mockery of Brexit, and turn an opportunity into a national humiliation. It would be the worst of both worlds, with the UK turned into a vassal state - taking direction from the EU, but with no power to influence the EU's decisions.</p><p>It is a totally invertebrate position, and betrays a dismal lack of confidence in this country.</p><p>end on the point with which I began - that groundless and peculiar lack of confidence in Britain.</p><p>I remember when the project for European citizenship was launched by Jacques Delors in the early Nineties. At the time, I thought it was a bit of a gimmick. I used to doubt that you could build such a thing as a European identity out of the mosaic of states. I was indignant when they came out with the European passport, and when they said that all car numberplates had to carry the 12-star flag, but I never thought that Brussels would succeed in its aim. I used to look at the Brussels bumper stickers saying \"Mon patrie, c'est Europe\" and think it was a bit of a laugh, and that they would never engender a genuine Euro-patriotism, or compete with people's natural feelings for their own country.</p><p>I have to say that I am now not so sure. I think I was complacent. I look at so many young people with the 12 stars lipsticked on their faces and I am troubled with the thought that people are beginning to have genuinely split allegiances.</p><p>And when people say that they feel they have more in common with others in Europe than with people who voted Leave, I want to say: \"But that is part of the reason why people voted Leave.\"</p><p>You don't have to be some tub-thumping nationalist to worry that a transnational sense of allegiance can weaken the ties between us; and you don't have to be an out-and-out nationalist to feel an immense pride in this country and what it can do.</p><p>We have the biggest financial centre in this hemisphere - and, by common consent, we will still have one by the time the Brexit controversy is a distant memory. I have seen the prophets of doom proved wrong so many times.</p><p>They said it would be a disaster if we left the ERM in 1992, and again if we failed to join the euro in 1999; and again in the 2008 crash, when they prophesied that the bankers would flee to Zug and Zurich. Yet London has sailed serenely through, riding the waves of adversity, as we have for centuries.</p><p>Look at Canary Wharf - a banking district now bigger than Frankfurt itself.</p><p>Look at our universities - the best in the world, with just one Cambridge college responsible not just for more Nobel prizes than France but indeed for more than Russia and China combined.</p><p>It is an astonishing fact that of all the kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers in the world, one in seven was educated in this country. While I have been Foreign Secretary, I am proud to have expanded the amazing Chevening and Commonwealth scholarship schemes that bring so many talented people into this country's system, which will ensure that the leaders of the world will be educated in Britain - and have a natural understanding of and affinity for Britain - for generations to come.</p><p>Just stand on the streets of central London and listen to the excitement of the tourists. We have more international visitors to our city than any other capital, including Paris and New York.</p><p>When you go to the British Museum, you visit the world's greatest thesaurus of global culture, and a place that attracts more visitors than the entire tourist industry of 10 other EU countries that I will not mention. So don't you tell me that we are turning our backs on the world. It is not physically or emotionally possible.</p><p>I was proud to be mayor of the greatest city on Earth, and I believe we can be the greatest country on Earth. Indeed, a recent estimate by the Henry Jackson Society just this month made a tally of the various nations' political, economic and cultural throw-weight, and concluded that, with the second biggest contribution to Nato; with our forces deployed around the world; with our bankers, our chefs, our scientists, our poets and, yes, our diplomats, Britain at the beginning of the 21st century was the secondgreatest power on Earth after America.</p><p>And since I regard the United States as one of the finest ideological and cultural creations of this country - even if involuntarily - I am prepared to live with that assessment.</p><p>We have more British people living overseas - a bigger diaspora - than any other OECD country. A great, bright, warm six-million-strong constellation of British minds and British hearts, a pulse in the eternal mind, no less, giving somewhere back the thoughts by Britain given (as Rupert Brooke almost puts it). Aid workers, journalists, businesspeople, artists, all helping in myriad ways to make the world a better place.</p><p>We have the youngest and fastest-growing population of any major EU economy, and on current estimates we will be the most populous country in western Europe by the middle of this century.</p><p>If we organise, if we plan, if we build the homes and the infrastructure we need, if we give our young people the skills and the confidence that they could so easily acquire, then we can also ensure that this country is not just the place where everyone wants to come and live, but the place with the highest standard of living, with the per-capita GDP, the productivity and the quality of life that we deserve.</p><p>That means insisting on a culture that is pro-business and pro-enterprise, but one that is so dynamic that fat cats can no longer sit unpunished in their jobs when they let everyone down.</p><p>It means simplifying regulation, and cutting taxes, wherever we can - but also ensuring that everyone in a company is decently paid, because that is the way to boost productivity.</p><p>I am not saying that all this will be some kind of cinch. I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny.</p><p>All I say is that they are in grievous error - all those who write off this country, who think we don't have it in us, who think that we lack the nerve and the confidence to tackle the task ahead.</p><p>They have been proved wrong before and, believe me, they will be proved wrong again.</p><p>'I am here to tell you that this country will succeed in our new national enterprise, and will succeed mightily'</p><p>'I find that Leavers and Remainers are coming together and urging us to get on and do a deal that is in the interests of both sides of the Channel'</p><p>'This is our chance to catch the wave of new technology, and to put Britain in the lead'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>'It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of our contribution to the EU went on the NHS,' says Mr Johson'I-IMAGES;

NAB was held April 6-11, 2019, in Las Vegas, NV. More Than M*A*S*H The opening session was chaired by NAB President and CEO Gordon Smith. Smith is celebrating his tenth year at the head of the organization. </p><p>Alan Alda at NAB Show In introducing stage, TV and film actor[3] Alan Alda, who received the NAB Distinguished Service Award, Smith, a former U.S. Senator, recalled how Alda won an Emmy for his portrayal of a conservative senator from California on The West Wing. He quipped, 'Conservative? California? Sounds like a non sequitur. I was a conservative senator from Oregon and all I got was not re-elected.'When Alda, best known for his portrayal of 'Hawkeye' Pierce on M*A*S*H, came on stage he shared stories about how he was inspired and got started on his career with Variety Business Editor Cynthia Littleton.Alda recalled how his father made one of the first television broadcasts. 'It was only between two buildings in New York,' he said, 'but, it still counts.'Alda became fascinated with radio and TV and made his own debut on TV when he only ten-years old and interested in magic. 'KTLA was always asking for people from LA to come on the air and perform,' Alda recalled. 'I called up and they let me do a magic trick where I pulled a cake out of a hat. I don't remember how I did it.'Alda got a laugh from the crowd when he shared a memory of the last episode of M*A*S*H, which was watched by 105.9 million viewers. 'At the first commercial break,' he said, 'so many New Yorkers went to the bathroom at the same time it nearly broke the water works.' Alan Alda pretending he can't lift the award from NAB More recently, for ten years, Alda hosted Scientific American Frontiers. On this show he interviewed scientists to get them to tell their stories from a human standpoint. 'I realized that if I related to them like another actor, I could get them to open up,' he recalled. 'When they began to lecture, I'd interrupt and connect in a real way. A lecture is like a commercial, but if you engage the person with what interests them, that's communication.' He smiled. 'Everything else is excommunication.'That show led to the foundation of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science[4] at Stony Brook University. 'All this,' Alda observed, 'because a ten-year old boy was listening to the radio and was inspired by it.'You can hear more from Alda on his podcast, Clear+Vivid with Alan Alda. Tom Taylor Tales Smith also presented the NAB Spirit of Broadcasting Award to industry veteran Tom Taylor. For thirty years Taylor was a 'must read/must listen to' voice for people in radio. Tom Taylor receiving award from NAB President Gordon Smith In accepting the award, Taylor observed, 'Successful stations are those who serve their local markets.'In all the years I provided news, no one ever said to me, 'Don't do that story, it will upset someone.''He emphasized the importance of trusted sources. Taylor said, 'Always seek our sources we can trust and in our local markets, work to be that source.'He urged attendees to remember, 'The public is the only critic whose opinion has any worth,' Challenges and the Future One of NAB's missions is to represent broadcasters in the halls of Congress and state legislators. To dramatize one of the challenges facing the industry, Smith held up a cell phone with a small white attachment on its base.'The Next Gen TV attachment with this phone lets me watch my favorite stations anywhere I am,' Smith explained. From the consumer's stand point, having the attachment would be beneficial because it uses none of their data. Gordon Smith displaying device which would save users data and dollars Smith continued, 'And while this attachment is great, what we would really love to see is a chip built into mobile devices to give consumers this broadcast reception technology. But to date, manufacturers, Apple being one, refuse to enable broadcast chips in their devices. And it begs the question: why?'Smith pointed out that he does not often agree with Senator Elizabeth Warren, but made an exception for recent comments about big tech.He quoted her as saying, 'They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.'Smith then mused, 'Iwonder if this growing tech power is one of the reasons why this consumer benefit is being held back by the manufacturers.'But he had a solution. 'Given the threat to local journalism that is posed by these tech companies, lawmakers can enable broadcasters to better compete and to support journalism in two ways. 'First, modernize outdated broadcast regulations to allow us to compete on a level playing field with these behemoth tech and pay-TV companies to ensure that broadcast journalism can flourish. 'And second, increase regulation on the tech industry to ensure that these companies cannot use their market power to stifle competition and the financial viability of local news.'

NAB was held April 6-11, 2019, in Las Vegas, NV. More Than M*A*S*H The opening session was chaired by NAB President and CEO Gordon Smith. Smith is celebrating his tenth year at the head of the organization. </p><p>Alan Alda at NAB Show In introducing stage, TV and film actor[3] Alan Alda, who received the NAB Distinguished Service Award, Smith, a former U.S. Senator, recalled how Alda won an Emmy for his portrayal of a conservative senator from California on The West Wing. He quipped, 'Conservative? California? Sounds like a non sequitur. I was a conservative senator from Oregon and all I got was not re-elected.'When Alda, best known for his portrayal of 'Hawkeye' Pierce on M*A*S*H, came on stage he shared stories about how he was inspired and got started on his career with Variety Business Editor Cynthia Littleton.Alda recalled how his father made one of the first television broadcasts. 'It was only between two buildings in New York,' he said, 'but, it still counts.'Alda became fascinated with radio and TV and made his own debut on TV when he only ten-years old and interested in magic. 'KTLA was always asking for people from LA to come on the air and perform,' Alda recalled. 'I called up and they let me do a magic trick where I pulled a cake out of a hat. I don't remember how I did it.'Alda got a laugh from the crowd when he shared a memory of the last episode of M*A*S*H, which was watched by 105.9 million viewers. 'At the first commercial break,' he said, 'so many New Yorkers went to the bathroom at the same time it nearly broke the water works.' Alan Alda pretending he can't lift the award from NAB More recently, for ten years, Alda hosted Scientific American Frontiers. On this show he interviewed scientists to get them to tell their stories from a human standpoint. 'I realized that if I related to them like another actor, I could get them to open up,' he recalled. 'When they began to lecture, I'd interrupt and connect in a real way. A lecture is like a commercial, but if you engage the person with what interests them, that's communication.' He smiled. 'Everything else is excommunication.'That show led to the foundation of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science[4] at Stony Brook University. 'All this,' Alda observed, 'because a ten-year old boy was listening to the radio and was inspired by it.'You can hear more from Alda on his podcast, Clear+Vivid with Alan Alda. Tom Taylor Tales Smith also presented the NAB Spirit of Broadcasting Award to industry veteran Tom Taylor. For thirty years Taylor was a 'must read/must listen to' voice for people in radio. Tom Taylor receiving award from NAB President Gordon Smith In accepting the award, Taylor observed, 'Successful stations are those who serve their local markets.'In all the years I provided news, no one ever said to me, 'Don't do that story, it will upset someone.''He emphasized the importance of trusted sources. Taylor said, 'Always seek our sources we can trust and in our local markets, work to be that source.'He urged attendees to remember, 'The public is the only critic whose opinion has any worth,' Challenges and the Future One of NAB's missions is to represent broadcasters in the halls of Congress and state legislators. To dramatize one of the challenges facing the industry, Smith held up a cell phone with a small white attachment on its base.'The Next Gen TV attachment with this phone lets me watch my favorite stations anywhere I am,' Smith explained. From the consumer's stand point, having the attachment would be beneficial because it uses none of their data. Gordon Smith displaying device which would save users data and dollars Smith continued, 'And while this attachment is great, what we would really love to see is a chip built into mobile devices to give consumers this broadcast reception technology.

NAB was held April 6-11, 2019, in Las Vegas, NV. More Than M*A*S*H The opening session was chaired by NAB President and CEO Gordon Smith. Smith is celebrating his tenth year at the head of the organization. </p><p>Alan Alda at NAB Show In introducing stage, TV and film actor[3] Alan Alda, who received the NAB Distinguished Service Award, Smith, a former U.S. Senator, recalled how Alda won an Emmy for his portrayal of a conservative senator from California on The West Wing. He quipped, 'Conservative? California? Sounds like a non sequitur. I was a conservative senator from Oregon and all I got was not re-elected.'When Alda, best known for his portrayal of 'Hawkeye' Pierce on M*A*S*H, came on stage he shared stories about how he was inspired and got started on his career with Variety Business Editor Cynthia Littleton.Alda recalled how his father made one of the first television broadcasts. 'It was only between two buildings in New York,' he said, 'but, it still counts.'Alda became fascinated with radio and TV and made his own debut on TV when he only ten-years old and interested in magic. 'KTLA was always asking for people from LA to come on the air and perform,' Alda recalled. 'I called up and they let me do a magic trick where I pulled a cake out of a hat. I don't remember how I did it.'Alda got a laugh from the crowd when he shared a memory of the last episode of M*A*S*H, which was watched by 105.9 million viewers. 'At the first commercial break,' he said, 'so many New Yorkers went to the bathroom at the same time it nearly broke the water works.' Alan Alda pretending he can't lift the award from NAB More recently, for ten years, Alda hosted Scientific American Frontiers. On this show he interviewed scientists to get them to tell their stories from a human standpoint. 'I realized that if I related to them like another actor, I could get them to open up,' he recalled. 'When they began to lecture, I'd interrupt and connect in a real way. A lecture is like a commercial, but if you engage the person with what interests them, that's communication.' He smiled. 'Everything else is excommunication.'That show led to the foundation of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science[4] at Stony Brook University. 'All this,' Alda observed, 'because a ten-year old boy was listening to the radio and was inspired by it.'You can hear more from Alda on his podcast, Clear+Vivid with Alan Alda. Tom Taylor Tales Smith also presented the NAB Spirit of Broadcasting Award to industry veteran Tom Taylor. For thirty years Taylor was a 'must read/must listen to' voice for people in radio. Tom Taylor receiving award from NAB President Gordon Smith In accepting the award, Taylor observed, 'Successful stations are those who serve their local markets.'In all the years I provided news, no one ever said to me, 'Don't do that story, it will upset someone.''He emphasized the importance of trusted sources. Taylor said, 'Always seek our sources we can trust and in our local markets, work to be that source.'He urged attendees to remember, 'The public is the only critic whose opinion has any worth,' Challenges and the Future One of NAB's missions is to represent broadcasters in the halls of Congress and state legislators. To dramatize one of the challenges facing the industry, Smith held up a cell phone with a small white attachment on its base.'The Next Gen TV attachment with this phone lets me watch my favorite stations anywhere I am,' Smith explained. From the consumer's stand point, having the attachment would be beneficial because it uses none of their data. Gordon Smith displaying device which would save users data and dollars Smith continued, 'And while this attachment is great, what we would really love to see is a chip built into mobile devices to give consumers this broadcast reception technology. But to date, manufacturers, Apple being one, refuse to enable broadcast chips in their devices. And it begs the question: why?'Smith pointed out that he does not often agree with Senator Elizabeth Warren, but made an exception for recent comments about big tech.He quoted her as saying, 'They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.'Smith then mused, 'Iwonder if this growing tech power is one of the reasons why this consumer benefit is being held back by the manufacturers.'But he had a solution. 'Given the threat to local journalism that is posed by these tech companies, lawmakers can enable broadcasters to better compete and to support journalism in two ways. 'First, modernize outdated broadcast regulations to allow us to compete on a level playing field with these behemoth tech and pay-TV companies to ensure that broadcast journalism can flourish. 'And second, increase regulation on the tech industry to ensure that these companies cannot use their market power to stifle competition and the financial viability of local news.' Find Out More NAB aims at enabling broadcasters to serve their communities, strengthen their businesses and flourish in the digital age.The conference brought together 92,000 media, entertainment and technology professionals from 160 countries and over 1,700 exhibitors. Attendees learned and explored traditional broadcasting, filmmaking, and new digital storytelling options, from creation to delivery, across multiple platforms to bring their stories to life.Learn more at their website[5].

Smith kicked off this year\u2019s NAB Show 2019 today in Las Vegas by speaking about the importance of local broadcast journalism as the ultimate way to \u201cinform and help our communities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour role has become more critical while people search for a trusted source of news,\u201d said Smith, a former two-term U.S. senator from Oregon who joined the organization in 2009. \u201cAmericans turn on their televisions to watch their favorite local news anchor and to get an unbiased report of what is happening in their communities. And they turn to their local broadcasters for a lifeline during emergencies.\u201d</p><p>However, not all local news is unbiased. There\u2019s the issue of Sinclair Broadcasting that has captured the attention of many in the media industry over the past few years. In addition to its failed acquisition of Tribune Media, the Maryland-based local broadcast company directs its stations to incorporate conservative and pro-Trump commentary into newscasts.</p><p>One of the most recent examples is former Fox News personality Sebastian Gorka\u2019s 30-minute special last year about the failures of socialist regimes around the world, titled Inside Socialism. During the special, he remarked: \u201cCan the teachings of Islam and Western values ever be reconciled? Is it possible for the waves of refugees arriving in the West to assimilate and coexist peacefully?'\u201d That\u2019s not exactly unbiased.</p><p>Sinclair also recently hired another unabashedly conservative former Fox News employee, Eric Bolling.</p><p>Nevertheless, Smith extolled the importance of local broadcast journalism in 2019\u2014and in the future. \u201cTo me, the story of broadcasters is a story of everyday heroes,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you do day in and day out can be taken for granted as your daily acts of service are sewn into the fabric of American life.\u201d</p><p>Smith, the former Republican senator, noted that he rarely agrees with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but he did admit that he was intrigued by her recent comments about the big tech companies.</p><p>\u201cShe said, \u2018They\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,'\u201d said Smith. \u201cI wonder if this growing tech power is one of the reasons why this consumer benefit is being held back by the manufacturers.\u201d</p><p>Smith also spoke about wanting to modernize outdated broadcast regulations so that broadcast can compete on a level playing field with the massive tech and pay-TV companies to better ensure that broadcast journalism can flourish.</p><p>Additionally, the NAB wants to increase regulation on the tech industry to ensure that these companies cannot use their market power to stifle competition and the financial viability of local news.</p><p>The NAB also honored legendary actor Alan Alda with the organization\u2019s Distinguished Service Award.

Insbesondere in Zeiten des technologisch induzierten Wandels k\u00f6nnen Wertsch\u00f6pfungsketten extrem schnell ver\u00e4ndert werden - und wer sich nicht rechtzeitig positioniert hat, droht den Anschluss zu verlieren.</p><p>Diese Sorge treibt den Bankensektor um, seitdem sich die Big-Tech-Konzerne dem Geldgesch\u00e4ft \u00fcber den Zahlungsverkehr n\u00e4hern. Alipay wurde in Rekordzeit zum Giganten im Depositengesch\u00e4ft und legt \u00dcberschussliquidit\u00e4t vorwiegend in Geldmarktfonds an. Facebooks Initiative zur Verwendung der digitalen W\u00e4hrung Libra im globalen Zahlungsverkehr ist nun der gro\u00dfe Wachmacher f\u00fcr Gesch\u00e4fts- und Notenbanken, um sich f\u00fcr die Anforderungen von Open Finance zu r\u00fcsten.</p><p>Dabei werden die Spielregeln jetzt neu definiert - und keiner betreibt das so proaktiv wie Mark Carney, Chef der Bank of England. Sein Plan: Den am Zahlungsverkehr teilnehmenden Nichtbanken wird erlaubt, Depositen bei der Notenbank \u00fcber Nacht zu lagern. Damit w\u00fcrde das n\u00e4chste Bankenprivileg fallen, besteht doch bereits punktuell Zugang zum Settlement-System der Zentralbank.</p><p>Was das alles soll? Carneys Ma\u00dfnahme ist zum einen ein Beitrag zur Finanzstabilit\u00e4t. Denn wer Konten im Zahlungsverkehr f\u00fchrt, der sollte Zugang zum sichersten Ort haben, wo Geldfl\u00fcsse unter Kontrolle sind. Zudem werden diese \u00dcbernacht-Einlagen bei der Bank of England verzinst - ein Satz von 0,75 % tr\u00e4gt zur Refinanzierung privater Payment-Infrastruktur bei. Ein Element, das auch den EU-Banken gut zu Gesicht st\u00fcnde.</p><p>Zum anderen r\u00fcstet Carney die gesamte Infrastruktur der Notenbank auf eine API-Umgebung f\u00fcr schnellen und sicheren Datentransfer auf. Das erm\u00f6glicht bessere Dienstleistungen zu geringeren Kosten, was dem Verbraucher zugutekommt. Selbst die regulatorisch geplagten Banken d\u00fcrfen auf sinkenden Compliance-Aufwand hoffen, wenn die Aufseher Daten zielgerichtet aus den Banksystemen ziehen k\u00f6nnen. Datenqualit\u00e4t und Verf\u00fcgbarkeit sind das Herz von Open Finance.</p><p>Die Gesch\u00e4ftsbanken werden in der Welt des Open Finance mit dem Verlust von privilegierten Zugangswegen im Status heruntergestuft. Und solange es mit der Finanzstabilit\u00e4t vereinbar ist und dem Konsumenten nutzt, werden die Notenbanken Big Tech Zugang gew\u00e4hren. Die wiederum m\u00fcssen einen Compliance-Upgrade leisten, um nach dem Leitprinzip \"Gleiches Gesch\u00e4ft, gleiche Regeln\" reguliert zu werden.</p><p>(B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung, 25.6.2019)</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link zum PDF-Dokument</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2019118008\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14219\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BORZTG-2019118008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BORZTG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF6-2911-DY1C-70GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253914</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"411\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Herausgebergemeinschaft Wertpapier-Mitteilungen Keppler, Lehmann GmbH &amp; Co.

On Wednesday, Fortune made the Microsoft CEO global business person of the year. But more likely it was the $US10bn ($14.7bn) JEDI contract with the US Department of Defence he had under his belt that gave him the real traction for new business down under.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In three days, Satya Nadella's trip took in meetings with Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the largest government agencies including Defence, the NSW Premier and some of his most important corporate partners: three of the four bank leaders, Wesfarmers' Rob Scott and Woolworths' Brad Banducci.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Microsoft's business is growing rapidly in Australia. ASIC filings for the year to June 2019 show almost $3bn in revenue from contracts with customers.</p><p>Much has been said of Nadella this week, but what stands out is his timing - both on cloud and on culture. His pivot to the cloud, now a trillion-dollar business, was endorsed earlier this month by the Pentagon, which handed Microsoft the JEDI (Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure) contract for US Defence Department's cloud requirements. A shocked Amazon had its lunch cut.</p><p>The news comes just as the US and Australia have \"hit refresh\" on the alliance with renewed investment in the South Pacific and defence security ties and just as former Telstra CEO David Thodey has delivered his report on how to make the Australian Public Service fit for purpose.</p><p>Spotted at Microsoft's understated Canberra offices on National Circuit on Thursday morning - Secretary of Defence Greg Moriarty and Defence Department CIO Stephen Pearson. Customer meetings? This was also the morning of my interview with Nadella.</p><p>For the US-Australia alliance and, indeed, for the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, what then, does Satya Nadella think could be achieved in terms of security and how does he see the responsibility for underpinning Five Eyes?</p><p>\"When you think about any of the agencies you mentioned, they are all big users of a lot of our technology already,\" he says. \"This is about really ensuring that they are not being left behind as the technology frontier changes. Cloud is essentially a more efficient, more cost-effective, more scalable way for them to use compute resources and so therefore I think of this as nothing more than simply moving to the new frontier of technology.\" Nadella sees the same gains in being a cloud-first top retailer or top bank, but where there are mission critical systems within defence rather than the cloud, being able to operate at \"the edge\", close to where computing is needed, is key to defence requirements.</p><p>\"The cloud is just not a migration to some sort of few data centres run by one or two companies. It's really about having distributed computing fabric in the world. So essentially, what is the tactical edge, the form of deployment needs? Those are all very important. By the way, they are similar for autonomous driving or retail or factories running mission-critical workloads or even the Department of Defence.</p><p>Tech for good On his time with Scott Morrison, Nadella says, \"It was a very positive meeting. The Prime Minister is well informed, and I appreciated his deep insights into how governments, large businesses and tech and software companies can, through their own actions, accelerate digital take-up in our economies, lifting wages and creating jobs. \"We also discussed how traditional economic analysis was failing to capture the benefits of digital investments on economies and how we could not let this misdirect policy settings. Digital advancement is the one area that will bring more benefits to the strength of our economies, meaning more jobs and better wages than any other single reform.\" The PM did not directly comment on any defence or security discussions, but the increasing presence of Microsoft supporting state and federal governments is clear. Australia is the only country outside the US with four Microsoft data centres, one each in NSW and Victoria and two federally for mission critical systems.</p><p>NSW now ranks in Microsoft's top 500 global customers.</p><p>\"It signals how important Australia and NSW are to that global company for him to take the time to come here,\" says Premier Gladys Berejiklian. \"I found him to be someone who obviously cares deeply about his organisation; but someone who leads an organisation like that really has to think about the future, is almost a futurist in some ways, and as all organisations like that have to be, concerned about trust in the digital age, and how citizens can feel comfortable with information they are sharing and receiving.\" In her search for better services and security around those services, the Premier considers Microsoft an important partner.</p><p>\"We value integrity of information, we value processes, cyber- security. These are things important to the government. That's what we look for in partners because in a community where there are growing concerns about what is happening with personal information or what is happening to children accessing certain information, for example, before they are ready to receive it, these are concerns that we know the community shares and these are concerns that we know organisations like Microsoft share as well.\" Nadella's other uncanny sense of timing has been to emerge at the top of Microsoft with his philosophy of empathy just as the world smarts at a capitalism that has left some behind. \"What is most important is for the world to have more technology capability to solve its pressing challenges, starting with equitable economic growth all over the world,\" he says Microsoft's cloud and data management expertise is being applied to break the pernicious cycle of disadvantage around homelessness in NSW.</p><p>For Nadella, this is tech for good. \"Just a couple of volunteers working with a lot of service organisations came together with a real passion to say 'look, let's go after this homelessness challenge' and really create the digital record for anyone who needs services, so that there is proper sharing of identity and their requirements, and find homes for homelessness.\" \"When it comes to rough sleepers,\" says Berejiklian, \"we will use digital technology and data to try to have a compassionate approach to how we can reduce the rate to half by 2025.\" Strategically, what positions Microsoft and its 1600 employees so well in Australia is the customer partnership: 11,000 partners employing more than 232,000 people, from start-ups to multinationals and state bodies.</p><p>\"Our core mission, as a company,\" says Nadella, \"is to empower people and organisations all over the world. So that's why I'm Australia, to see first hand how some of our platforms and tools are useful in more Australians creating their own digital IP.\" Nadella talks of \"tech intensity\": customers using the cloud as a commodity and building their own IP on top. \"In Australia, 71 per cent of the software engineering jobs that are open today are outside of what is considered the tech industry. That speaks to tech intensity in action. That is banks, energy sector, healthcare all hiring software developers to drive their own tech intensity and digital capability.\" As much of this tech intensity and innovation moves to the edge, just where the interface between Microsoft and a customer will end up is contestable ground, a point not lost on a big telco or bank as they strive to build their IT.</p><p>\"If anything, we are more interested in enabling that,\" responds Nadella. \"What excites me is to be able to provide the developer velocity and productivity and even making domain experts.\" He sees trust as central to tech intensity formula: \"It is really the cloud adoption rate times your capability, to the power of trust, is what we describe as tech intensity\". Demonstrably, his big customers take the big tech on trust. Nadella's Yoda-like wisdom certainly resonated with business leaders in Australia this week, in particular his line: \"I look back at our history, we made our biggest mistakes when we did things out of envy.\" NAB incoming chair Phil Chronican also noted Nadella's work-life balance, harmonising life so that work has meaning.</p><p>\"Envy, that's not a good thing,\" agrees billionaire fund manager Ray Dalio, in town on Friday for the Sohn Hearts &amp; Minds conference. \"Or ego, those things that are the emotional barriers to making the best decision, that's what he's referring to. I've been lucky to meet the most successful people in the world. The smartest ones are the ones that are most curious and ask the most questions. They are the least arrogant people.\" On meeting, Nadella himself is personable and modest. Telstra chief financial officer Vicki Brady describes him as \"such a grounded empowering leader, with no big ego and yet runs one of the biggest companies in the world\".</p><p>An inquiring half-smile, even in repose, he likes his bottled water at room temperature and did not have time for lunch at any of his lunchtime events. It is in no small part the actions and deeds of this mega corporate citizen that has governments, state and federal, open for Microsoft's business.</p><p>\"I have known Satya since he became CEO of Microsoft\" says David Thodey. \"and I've always been inspired by his values, intellect and commitment to the role of Microsoft in the community around the world.\" The fireside chat between Thodey, former Telstra CEO and now CSIRO chair, and Nadella in front of a Great Hall packed with public servants in Canberra on Thursday was always going to be warm. \"It has always stunned me as to why nation states do not have control over their citizens' data, whereas companies have,\" quipped Nadella. \"Maybe one of these days I'll come to Australia and you'll have more of a policy\".</p><p>\"Working on it at the moment,\" Thodey jumped in. Afterwards, Thodey lists a ream of insights for me that Nadella had for those listening, including this one: \"Leaders bring clarity, the need for the APS to work together to solve complex societal challenges and the importance of data for the nation.\" And, as the world recoils from breaches of trust by Facebook and Google, there is no 'M' in FANG. Microsoft's proactive approach to regulators has even earned it praise from ACCC boss Rod Sims. Part of this, as Nadella readily points out, is that Microsoft's core business model is a platform for others to build upon. Much of FANG is about aggregating data.</p><p>Trust, he insists, is earned daily, whether around cyber-security, or privacy as a human right, or ethics on AI. \"And then, we also welcome any regulation. After all, in our systems of government, we elect the legislatures, as well as appoint regulators, and the legislatures appoint regulators in order to enforce, right?\" Former shadow minister for the digital economy Ed Husic was impressed: \"It is good to hear a big business leader balancing regulation and self-regulation and recognising AI ethics as important, because this is where the debate is at a government level.\" Yet if Microsoft's reputation sets it apart from Facebook, Google and Amazon and its CEO ticks almost every environmental, social and governance box, market power is different. Now vying with Apple as the world's largest company, and growing, could not Microsoft once again become too powerful? \"Our success just doesn't come in isolation of success all around us,\" responds Nadella. \"Even in Australia, any success that we have fundamentally is based on us adding value to small businesses becoming more productive, large multinationals becoming more competitive, and the public sector becoming more efficient. Those outcomes are the real governor of our success.\"</p><p>Cloud, culture, cricket After the three-day blitz of Satya Nadella, one almost feels the need to step back and grasp for some objectivity. This is the constant altruist who is running a multinational that has made billions for its shareholders - can that work? Even in the fierce battle for quantum supremacy, which might make or break tech giants, Nadella sees things differently.</p><p>\"Even if there is a quantum computer, the real thing is, how is that quantum computer becoming democratised so that all the climate scientists in the world can come together and go solve the climate transition challenge, or the food safety challenge? It's not about any one company getting ahead on any one piece of technology. It's about how quickly these technologies are being commoditised, so that every company can be a digital tech company. That's our vision. It's not about a few companies on the west coast of the US, or a few companies on the east coast of China. It's about every company in every part of the world, in their own right being successful using digital tech.\" \"In a country where I think people are rightly wary about tall poppies, we're not trying to grow the tallest poppy in the field,\" Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said in March. \"I think we are in a realm where, let's face it, there's plenty of money to be made in technology, so let's now figure out how we're going to do the right thing. I'm glad that this is a moment in history when people care about companies that do the right thing. I think that should motivate us all to do that.\" Satya Nadella: cloud, culture and, of course, cricket. With a new grass oval going in on Microsoft's Redmond campus, I ask the tragic off-spinner how he would deal with Steve Smith. \"Ah! That's the hardest question I've ever been asked. I would just pack up and go home.\"Ticky Fullerton is the Sky News business editor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-ea84f8460cdb11eab33488b1c19204f0321ece47afef92d10ffca03d31a1861a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJT-3FW1-F0JP-W06S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2253\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 23, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

That's according to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler who spoke with Barr tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also breaking news, President Trump pushing forward in support of legal challenge against Obamacare, vowing his administration will have a plan that is far better. A White House official said they have no alternative plan as of right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a moment, I'll talk about this and 2020 race with former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. It's a CNN exclusive.</p><p>We begin with the Congressman Nadler's talk with Attorney General Barr about the Mueller report.</p><p>CNN's Manu Raju joins us now from Capitol Hill.</p><p>So, what is Nadler saying?</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I talked to Nadler after this 10-minute phone call with Bill Barr and he said that Barr would not commit to releasing the full report to Congress and the public. He also said Barr would not commit to providing the underlying evidence to Congress as something that Democrats have demanded and he said that he doesn't believe that the Justice Department will meet the Democrats' April 2nd deadline to provide the full report to Congress.</p><p>According to Nadler, Barr told him this report is, quote, very substantial and Nadler questioned how it could be summarized in just four pages. And Democrats are going to have to weigh or -- what they'll do next if they don't get what they want.</p><p>But Nadler made very clear, he's not happy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAJU: So the attorney general would not commit to releasing the full report? REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY), CHAIRMAN, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: No, he would not. I just had a conversation with the attorney general. I asked about the length and breadth of the report. He said it was a very substantial report, so substantial that I don't see how you could summarize it in four pages fairly. He said it was a very substantial report.</p><p>I asked when we would see the report and he said it will be a matter of weeks, not months as we've heard before. Obviously he's not going to -- they're not going to meet the April 2nd deadline the committee set. I'm very upset and concerned by that and most concerned that when I asked whether the -- he could commit that the American people and the Congress would see the entire unredacted report and the underlying evidence, he would not make a commitment on that. And that is not acceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAJU: Now I asked if any of the report that will be ultimately submitted would be summarized by Bill Barr. He said that Barr reserved the right to summarize portions of the report that would ultimately be heavily redacted but it is unclear to Nadler how much that would be and how much of the report will be released. He did say though, Anderson, that Barr did commit to testifying in public before the House Judiciary Committee, so expect that to happen in the coming weeks.</p><p>COOPER: Right. Well, the thing that Congress Nadler is not saying is what Barr's explain is, in fairness to the attorney general, there are some issues which may be from a grand jury -- which would need to be redacted or some issues which are -- come from classified information or reveal sources or methods that, would need to be redacted.</p><p>So I know Chairman Nadler is putting the worst possible light on the attorney general saying I won't release the full report, we don't know exactly what that means. It does seem the idea that the Department of Justice would give all of the underlying documents, that has always seemed like a -- that would be a major step if they were willing to do that. I know it was done in the investigation of Hillary Clinton but that's a rare thing. That is essentially Congress reinvestigating the Mueller investigation.</p><p>RAJU: Yes, no question. That is difficult for Democrats. They want to see -- they realize they couldn't get all of the underlying evidence, but they want a good portion of the underlying evidence. They do point to what happened in the last Congress where Republicans got hundreds of thousands of pages of e-mails related to the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation and that is a precedent that they point to. But Nadler is saying the full report is what they are ultimately demanding which is what he -- Barr is not committing to.</p><p>But one thing, too, Anderson, I asked him whether or not the White House would have a chance to review this first and I told me that Barr told him there are no plans to let the White House review it before the public ultimately sees the report.</p><p>COOPER: Right. Manu, thanks very much.</p><p>And now the White House where the focus is shifted from praise to the Muller report to an effort against Obamacare.</p><p>CNN's Abby Phillip joins us now.</p><p>So does the White House have something to replace Obamacare?</p><p>ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: They don't, Anderson. The White House is pretty much acknowledging that they don't have a plan at the moment. Marc Short, the vice president's chief of staff, acknowledged earlier on air that they would come up with one by this year. But one of the problems, the crux of the debate within the administration, has been that if there is no plan, which there isn't at the moment, it would essentially throw the entire health insurance market into chaos, leaving millions uninsured if Obamacare is completely struck down and the White House has nothing to replace it with.</p><p>[20:05:17] An official told CNN Jim Acosta this afternoon that there is nothing fresh at the moment. They pointed to some -- a plan that had previously been debated in Congress that ultimately failed to pass. But at the same time, that is a clear acknowledgment that the White House is starting from scratch here and meanwhile over on Capitol Hill, Republicans lawmakers are actually pointing to the White House and saying, we'll be happy to see what they come up with, but so far they have nothing.</p><p>COOPER: I mean, it was yesterday the president said that the, quote, Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care.</p><p>PHILLIP: Just yesterday, the president seemed to suggest this would be the new battle plan for Republicans. But it is not clear how many actual Republicans are with him on this. The Republican Party did not fare well when battling with Democrats over the issue of health care in 2018.</p><p>And most that we've spoken to, sources that I've spoken to today suggested that they know that this is not going to be a great political strategy for them moving forward. And given that the president seems to suggest that this is going to be their standard bearing for the next two years, it would suggest that they would need to have a plan and they would need to come up with one pretty soon.</p><p>COOPER: All right. Abby Phillips, appreciate it.</p><p>My next guest was one of two people who was CEO of the Trump campaign at one point he also served as White House Chief Strategist.</p><p>He had a front-row seat to the battle over Obamacare. He was interviewed by the Mueller team three times. Steve Bannon joins me now from Rome. Mr. Bannon it's a pleasure to have you on.</p><p>I want to get to Obamacare a little bit later on but let's start with what the attorney general Barr, according to Chairman Nadler not committing to releasing the full Mueller Report. Do you think he should, except of course of classified material or Grand Jury proceedings?</p><p>STEVEN BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Look, I think it's obviously up to the attorney general as somebody that was part of the process I think they ought to release it.</p><p>But it's the attorney general's decision. You know one of the things, Anderson; I think is lost in all of this is -- is President Trump, you know, waived executive privilege. He waived attorney client privilege. He had not just Reince Priebus and myself but Don McGahn, the White House Counsel and others.</p><p>I think it was like 500 witnesses, what 2,800 subpoenas. So the president went out of his way to get all this information out and get it out quickly. So I would assume that everybody would want to get the full report out to people except for what's classified or what needs to be redacted.</p><p>COOPER: Yes, and Lindsey Graham just said today that the president told him directly said, quote, just release it. I know you thought it was legal but not wise for the president to fire Comey.</p><p>Given the fact that Mueller has now exonerated the president and those around him when it comes to any kind of collusion or criminal conspiracy with Russia, was smart in retrospect for the president to have been attacking the investigation in the way that he did really for the last two years?</p><p>BANNON: Well, you know, actually -- I actually used you as example when we talked -- when I talked with the president back in the Oval Office. I said hey, on the Comey investigation, I said even Anderson Cooper, you know, has got this in the C Block.</p><p>This was in the spring of 17'. But you know the president had his own ideas about the job that Comey was doing. And so he -- he terminated him. I always said that Mueller, I think's an honorable guy.</p><p>He's a combat veteran, he's combat marine. And -- but the president, you know whatever he said on Twitter or whatever he said you know in -- in -- in public declarations or on T.V., the important thing was he told everybody to cooperate and to get it out there like no other president's ever done.</p><p>That's what was stunning. And in fact I was kind of a critic about how quickly they were releasing information. I thought it ought to be a little bit more processed. You know there's 1.2 million documents that were released.</p><p>So I think the president's actions where he was full supportive of the Mueller investigation and that's -- that's why I think it's -- and coming back like it is to kind of exonerate him.</p><p>I actually think it's time to release the documents and let's move on and get on with the work of the country.</p><p>COOPER: You've been very clear about no collusion all along. You've been probably less definitive; I think is fair to say when it comes to obstruction of justice. Were you surprised that Mueller himself did not reach a conclusion or recommendation on that and essentially hand it over to the attorney general to make a -- a conclusion?</p><p>BANNON: Look -- look, I'm not a lawyer but the way I look at prosecutors either charge or they don't charge. You know the no exoneration line, to me, I thought was a little bit of a cheap shot and -- and I've been very supportive of the Mueller process.</p><p>Look he -- here's the thing, they took two years, they looked at everything. It wasn't that I was concerned about an obstruction of justice. I didn't think there was any. But you know you go through all these documents and that's why the 18 election, you know, by the democrats getting out there and working so hard, the grassroots democrats winning the House, I said look, what they're going to try to do is weaponize the Mueller report.</p><p>And to -- and to use that as the beginning under Nadler's -- Jerry Nadler's Judiciary Committee to start kind of impeachment hearings and impeachment process.</p><p>[20:10:07] I actually think that this -- what happened is with this report; it looks like that's all going to be put to bed. So we'll just have to see when it gets released but I think it's really time to -- to kind of release it, people review it and then move on and let's get on with the -- the great work in front of us.</p><p>COOPER: So the -- I mean essentially you -- you believe even if the report is released, even if it has negative -- you know some things which are of questionable behavior by the president or attempt to cover up what the Trump Tower meeting was with this sort alternative explanation about it was -- about adoption.</p><p>As long as it's not criminal, at this point, you think it's done no matter what's released, it's really not going to matter and no matter what democrats try in terms of, in your words weaponizing but in terms of investigating, it's not going to matter?</p><p>BANNON: Yes, I just -- I think it's -- I think -- look, if there's anything substantive -- you know Mueller had what, you know what 20, you know, serious professional prosecutors, they had 42 field agents in the FBI.</p><p>I know as somebody who went through the process, Anderson, it was like a proctology exam. And -- and I was witness of fact as was Don McGhan and was Reince Priebus. And -- and so this was a very thorough investigation.</p><p>I think if -- if Mueller had something being the kind of senior level prosecutor he was, he -- he would have done something. And I think by not doing anything and -- and saying there was no collusion, which this whole thing started about, I -- I think -- I just don't think there's going to be much there. Look, it's -- it's -- it's what over 1,000 pages long, we'll have to see. I said, you know, early on that if the democrats won the House and the Mueller report, you know, had these type of charges in there, had this type of stuff that the -- the democrats would try to, what I call weaponize it and really use it to move forward.</p><p>But I think you're seeing already in the House, people like Nancy Pelosi saying hey, we got to get focused on healthcare, we got to get focused on other things. So I think that this is a time to move on. I do think that the media ought to kind of assess both their coverage -- and I've said this for a long time, both their coverage of the 2016 campaign and now their coverage of this whole investigative process.</p><p>I think the media ought to be self regulating and kind of internally look at itself and then I think we just got to move on. There's so much in front of us with China and what's going on in the world. It's time to get focused on the big problems facing the country.</p><p>COOPER: Yes, and there's a lot -- there's stuff going on with China, which I do want to talk to you about. In -- in an interview though, I think you gave earlier this week, you said that the president's going to quote -- or going to go full animal, which is an expression I hadn't really heard before but it's really stuck in my mind.</p><p>Now that he sees himself as no longer being under the cloud of the Mueller investigation, what does going full animal look like? What does that mean for -- because I also know you said that 2019 would be the most vitriolic year in American politics since before the Civil War and you include Vietnam in that. Both of those things are pretty startling statements. What is -- what's the vision for this year then?</p><p>BANNON: Well you know I was talking a Spanish journalist and I think I said honey badger, which as you know is one of my favorite phrases.</p><p>COOPER: I love honey badger. Honey badger don't care.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON: Yes. Exactly. Exactly. I think the -- I think the president is going to be very aggressive. You saw some of the tweets. In fact I was talking here to the foreign press assoCIAtion in Rome and the president tweeted out the time (inaudible) the opposition party media.</p><p>So I think the president's going to be very aggressive. I think he feels like the work of the country, particularly the work he had was kind of slowed down, particularly looking internationally because of some the hysteria around this investigation.</p><p>Not the investigation. I think this is the thing that people should focus on. He, you know, overly supplied people with documents. He was very aggressive in getting this information out there because he said from day one there's no collusion.</p><p>But I think about the hysteria is that what he's -- he's you know I think reasonably upset about. And I think you will definitely see some push back. You know President Trump's a fighter. I don't need to tell you Anderson, you know him very well.</p><p>He's a fighter. And I think he looks at this as a fight and I think he's going to be very aggressive. I think he's going to start giving interviews and I think he's going to really try to push this.</p><p>And look, we're just in a time and I think democracy has never been stronger in American. We just had 113 million vote in the midterm elections. I think -- we are divided but I think division is good and healthy because people have to argue out and have to -- have to kind of fight at the ballot box for what they believe in.</p><p>And I think the country is very engaged in this political process. I do think this year is going to be very vitriolic and I think we're just going to have to work through this but I think the president of the United States and I think rightfully so that Donald Trump's going to be very aggressive.</p><p>And kind of pushing back on this -- what I think he believes is media hysteria around the investigation at the time entire time that he was actually putting everybody in the White House, everybody on the campaign front and center with all these documents and his lawyers to kind of work through this.</p><p>COOPER: But -- but you know -- I mean listen, I understand the criticism of the media. I think every reporter I know is constantly trying to look inward and look at their coverage and if something is wrong apologize for it and correct it as quickly as possible.</p><p>[20:15:09] But at the same time, the president himself, while he may have been behind the scenes the people of the White House may have been behind the scenes providing all of the documents that they needed, publicly he certainly gave a lot of people a lot of reasons to scratch their heads and think, wait a minute.</p><p>From interviews he gave, to tweets he sent, to things he said to the Russians in the Oval Office. He did provide a lot of the questions -- he certainly stoked it whether he meant to or not.</p><p>BANNON: Well, Anderson, but Mueller had all of this to go through. So I think he saw it. There is no collusion and if the atmosphere -- I think the president -- justifiably looked at -- and I said this from day one, after the '16 defeat, the Democratic Party was in such disarray, the mainstream media was on the position and during the campaign. And I'm the one that came up with that term, and it was the opposition party media.</p><p>I think instead of doing mea culpas or big inflections internally, one of the things that the media could do -- and I think this is a big issue for both conservative and liberal media, and this is the FBI's counterintelligence operation, and some of the CIA, what was done at the beginning of the investigation of the Trump campaign? I think it has really got to be looked into.</p><p>I've said now, Anderson, over a year and a half I believe the like church commission is going to have to be established to look at the FBI's behavior in this and the CIA -- and I would hope -- in the old days in the '70s, \"New York Times\" and \"Washington Post\" would lead the investigations, that is not happening. Maybe CNN will do it, but I think there is a lot there, and this is not to get partisan. I think this is for the good of the country.</p><p>We have to look at -- I'm a huge supporter. I've never been a conspiracy guy, I'm a former naval officer, and my daughter is at West Point. I'm not a deep state guy.</p><p>But we have some big problems. I think we have to, in a bipartisan way, look at what these investigations were, particularly look at the start of the Trump -- investigation into the Trump thing, and I think really seriously question some of the FBI counterintelligence, and some of the CIA, and maybe even foreign intelligence services.</p><p>And I think this is for the good of the country and for the good of the FBI and the CIA too. But I would hope that that would be the next phase of investigations here.</p><p>COOPER: As to the question the vitriolic tone, which you mentioned, the president said recently something which I think a lot of people who don't like the president or distrust the president or are very concerned about, he said before an audience: I could tell you have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump, I have the tough people, but they don't play it tough until they get to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.</p><p>How do you interpret that?</p><p>BANNON: I just think that's -- I think it's President Trump talking about the deplorables, talking about what about his base is, which is, as you know, a lot of veterans, a lot of people that served the country, a lot of people in law enforcement. I don't think it's anything pejorative. I don't think there's anything that people get worried about.</p><p>I think people read more into some of the president's statements sometimes in trying to read the tea leaves. I think this is all -- although I do think the president is going to be pretty aggressive in his tweets, I think in some of his interviews, I think the way maybe he talks to some people at Congress. I know he's not particularly happy with -- I think some investigations that may go into his -- the finances of the Trump Organization.</p><p>I think his point is, hey, the American people had a chance to judge that in 2016. We voted on it and then had this huge investigation into Russian collusion which turned out to be I think, honestly, kind of a hoax and we've gone through two years of that. It costs million dollars, but more importantly, it's the opportunity cost. And now, it's time to really get focused on the kind of move on.</p><p>So I think very legitimate -- and I could tell you, Donald Trump is a fighter and he's going to fight on this one. And so, I just think it's time -- and all of these other investigations about his finances and all of this stuff, I think the American people are eventually going to say, hey, look, you're grasping at straws here. You know, if you don't like the guy and I think Nancy Pelosi said this the other day, go beat him at the ballot box in 2020. If you think orange man bad, right, and then get organized and get out there and do the kind of effort like you did in 2018 and defeat him in the way that you should -- you know, which we have in the United States.</p><p>COOPER: Yes.</p><p>BANNON: If you want to win, win at the ballot box, not in some sort of investigative apparatus to do that.</p><p>COOPER: I want to get your thoughts on the field of Democratic candidates and what's going to happen in 2020. We've got to have a quick break. If you would, just stick around. I know it's late in Rome, but appreciate it.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>Also, there's breaking news in the uproar of the dismissal of the charges against actor Jussie Smollett. What the state's attorney is saying now about a so-called error.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>[20:23:39] COOPER: Back with Steve Bannon, former chief strategist of the Trump White House, former CEO of his 2016 campaign.</p><p>So, in terms of the 2020 election, how much of it in your opinion is about convincing people to switch sides or find new voters, and how much is about candidates just getting out their side, mobilization?</p><p>BANNON: It's mobilization. I don't think we're in an age of persuasion. I mean, you want to persuade people in the margin, but I think it's mobilization. I think you saw that in '16 where we were able to mobilize the deplorables, particularly in states that the Clinton campaign wasn't focused on. They didn't think we'd win places like Michigan and Wisconsin and, you know, Pennsylvania.</p><p>I think '18 election is the same thing. I think the progressive left did a terrific job like the Tea Party did in the old days of kind of grassroots, door-to-door. They mobilized their base and they had a big victory. I think this is all about mobilization.</p><p>And I think this next, you know, four or five months of what I call the gauntlet that the House of Representatives is going to try to think to put up around President Trump and these investigations, I think they look at that as one aspect of how to mobilize their base and how to excite them. So, I think this is all going to be part of the lead up to 2020.</p><p>COOPER: Do you include reaching out and finding people who haven't voted before? Because that's one of the arguments that some, you know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Congresswoman, makes, which was in her district, reaching out to people who finding new voters and bringing them in.</p><p>[20:25:06] BANNON: I think it's very important. Low propensity voters, we did that in '16. One of the things we did in '16 that wasn't quite done in '18 in these House races was low propensity voters. I think one of the good news for all the Trump supporters is Brad Parscale and the campaign looks like they're very focused on already kind of doing the pick and shovel work that you have to do to build up this kind of -- this field operation and this digital operation to actually get out there and do it.</p><p>I know the Democrats are going to do it. Mike Bloomberg is talking about putting $500 million of his own money in to kind of anti-Trump.</p><p>So I think this is going to be -- look, I think our democracy, Anderson, is in great shape because 113 million people voted. You know, the political, you know, discussion is permeated even popular culture. Everybody is talking about it.</p><p>I think 2020 is going to be just huge. I think people will be very engaged and I think it's about mobilizing the people that support you. And I think this is going to very important and I think the winner at the end of the day is going to be who mobilizes his base.</p><p>COOPER: I think there are a lot of people who hear you say democracy has never been stronger in America and would take huge issue with that. That, you know, I mean, look, this is a president who has undermined a number of institutions. You could argue they deserved to be undermined. But he certainly, you know -- the -- he's questioned the FBI. He's questioned, you know, U.S. intelligence which obviously many people have over the years --</p><p>BANNON: But I -- but, Anderson, I don't think that's undermining. I actually think -- I think these institutions -- look, I believe in these institutions, I believe in the FBI, the CIA, some of the institutions in Washington, D.C. But they have to be rejuvenated. You always got to question -- remember back in the --</p><p>COOPER: Right, but saying the polls are fixed and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON: And with Vietnam and all of those issues -- all of the issues, people are going after those all of the time and what happened I think we made these institutions stronger. And I think that is -- I one of the things, remember, Trump was elected because, you know, working-class Americans believed America was in decline and the elites were comfortable with managed decline and they weren't.</p><p>Trump is a disruptor. I mean, he got hired by people who said we want to shake up things and he had this cute phrase of \"drain the swamp\".</p><p>COOPER: Right.</p><p>BANNON: But it's really quite serious. We want you go to go in and we want you to start focusing on these institutions and making sure they're working for the American people. So, I don't think -- I think undermine is way too tough of a word. I think Trump is trying to -- he's a disruptor and he's trying to rejuvenate.</p><p>COOPER: I understand the idea of disruption but, you know, he is siding with Vladimir Putin over Dan Coats and, others in the U.S. intelligence service about whether Russia was involved in the election. He stands next to Putin and says, you know, he says very strongly that he didn't do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON: Well, listen, by the way -- but Anderson -- but, Anderson, here is the other thing. When you see this evidence, I think reasonable people can say -- can question about this whole thing of interference. I think it is another thing that kind of question --</p><p>COOPER: You don't believe the Russians interfered in the election?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON: Look, no, I think -- I think it was complete marginalia. It's complete, total marginalia, right? I think there is another overhyped part of what I call the hoax.</p><p>COOPER: So, you don't believe they hacked the e-mails?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANNON: So, it is not a serious thing -- I think like I said on the margin, you might have had some e-mails , you might have had, you know, these guys down in Florida that even Clapper said was what, $115,000 of Facebook ads. It's all marginalia, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER: So, you don't think stealing the e-mails was a major thing?--</p><p>BANNON: The stealing of the Podesta e-mails?</p><p>COOPER: Yes. The Podesta e-mails.</p><p>BANNON: Look, should you have done it? No. It's wrong to do it, but it's marginalia. It's inner office gossip, right? So, I think it was complete marginalia.</p><p>I'm not saying it's right to do, and we want to make sure we stop the Chinese, we stop the Russians, we stop other people from trying to hack in this, but I think at the end of the day, it's total marginalia.</p><p>And I don't think President Trump is trying to undermine any American institutions. I really -- I've got to challenge you on that. I think what he's trying to do as a disruptor who was hired by working class people in the country to say, hey, you know, we don't want America to be in decline and we particularly don't want this permanent political class that's comfortable with managed decline in the United States.</p><p>Remember his task is to rejuvenate and I think that's what you're seeing.</p><p>COOPER: Yes, I mean, I would say that is a charitable interpretation. But just one more thing on that, I mean, meeting with Vladimir Putin without anybody else present, meeting with Kim Jong-un without just -- just with interpreters. I understand disruption, doesn't it concern you have no idea as an American citizen that was discussed?</p><p>BANNON: Anderson, Anderson, Anderson, he is commander-in-chief of the United States military, right? He's the chief law enforcement officer. He's president of the United States.</p><p>If he makes a decision that he wants to meet with the world leader with just interpreters or without interpreters, I wouldn't have problems with President Obama, I wouldn't have problems with Clinton or Reagan or anybody. If the president of the United States in his judgment is going to make that decision, you know, I would abide by it.</p><p>And I think people, if it's President Obama, I think Democrats will say it's fine. I don't think there is any nefarious activity. If he wants to make a decision that he wants to talk with an interpreter, I think that is -- look, he was elected commander-in- chief. You know, one of the big issues we had in the campaign when I stepped in just to give people permission to vote for him as commander-in-chief particularly given the resume of Hillary Clinton. People did.</p><p>They weighed and measured Donald Trump in that campaign and, you know, a hard-fought campaign as you remember. They selected him and I think he got -- I think you've got to trust his judgment.</p><p>And if you don't trust his judgment, you've got 2020. You can get out, you can knock on doors. You can say, \"Hey, he's done all this bad stuff,\" get your friends out there. If you're opposing, then beat him at the ballot box.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Is there one candidate on the Democratic side announced or expected to announce who you think would provide a real challenge to President Trump?</p><p>BANNON: I don't really see a real challenge right now and quite frankly I'm a little surprised, I thought there might be some real challenges. I think that -- I think the launches of these things have been particularly kind of weak.</p><p>The one thing I think is very different in this primary season, Anderson, than any other we've had in American history is that the -- you know, the sitting president, Donald Trump, is going to have a vote in the Democratic primary, that's a reality. And this is because of the -- of President Trump's house style, right? He's going to be engaged and I think a perfect example is Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER: He's defined her --</p><p>BANNON: -- more well-thought through -- well, yes. She's got probably, if you look at and particularly given some of other candidates, she's got some pretty well defined policy initiatives on big tech, on, you know, getting people more -- participation and ownership in society.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER: Which are things that you have been talking about for a long time.</p><p>BANNON: Yes. So, listen --</p><p>COOPER: I mean, just in the populous --</p><p>BANNON: -- I think on the populous side, you have kind of right-wing populous and then left-wing. I don't believe on solutions. I think some of the stuff she's been saying is very smart. In fact, I've kind of say, \"Hey, she's lifting from our playbook.\"</p><p>But, what's most amazing to me is she's now 8 percent. And even President Trump said, you know, \"Hey, maybe I moved too quickly. She would have been a weak candidate.\" I think it's very interesting and I think that his direct involvement has really brought Elizabeth Warren under 10 percent and she's having a tough time getting that muzzle velocity, that traction you need to get going.</p><p>So, I think all of the candidates -- one of the things that surprised me the most is how much the AOCs kind of, you know, New Green Deal and kind of this movement to the far left economically has pulled the candidates I think farther left and I think they've had some pretty slow starts. Right now, I don't see anybody.</p><p>And I think when Joe Biden announces, that's going to peak Biden. I don't see anybody in this field right now taking on Donald Trump. You know, Donald Trump is going to be very tough in this campaign. He's going to go right at you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER: And you see Hillary Clinton coming in?</p><p>BANNON: You've got to go right at him. Here's what I think. First, you know, Secretary Clinton said she's not running but, you know, she's in the bull pen waiting for the call.</p><p>I believe that if you go through this gauntlet this summer, you start the Democratic primary, by the fall of next year if there is not a candidate that is kind of breaking out of the pack and looks like they could take on Trump, because the number one thing for the Democrats is not policy right now, the number one thing for Democrats is beating Donald Trump. And they're going to fall in line with whoever they think can beat Donald Trump and shows they can beat him.</p><p>If you get to the fall of 2019, pre-Iowa, and you don't have a candidate that's breaking out, looks like it matches up with Trump, you know, I think somebody is going to call the bull pen and get her start warming up because she's there, she's going to say, \"Hey, I get 63 million votes,\" you know.</p><p>Look, I realize people heads will blow up, particularly Democrats that don't want anything to do with her. But remember, at the end of the day the Democrats I think are going to focus on somebody who can beat Donald Trump and they're going to search for that. It's not going to be a policy discussion, it's going to be electability.</p><p>And if you're going to beat Donald Trump as an incumbent, you're going to have to bring it, right? You're going to really have to bring it and the field I've seen so far, I don't know anybody that can hit a fastball like Donald Trump can throw.</p><p>COOPER: Just lastly, you're in Rome tonight. Your focus there -- you're there to focus on China. I've heard you talk about the China 2025 initiative. It's certainly I've been looking at. I find it fascinating. It's not gotten a lot of attention in the United States.</p><p>But Chinese espionage, the stealing of trade secret, recruiting Americans to steal information, it's become a huge issue for intelligence agencies more than -- I mean, I've talked to some intelligence officers who say it's more, you know, more than Russia, more than anybody else. Is the U.S. on top of this enough?</p><p>BANNON: Well, I think before Trump got there, we really weren't. Remember, Xi came to the Rose Garden a couple of years ago with President Obama and promised President Obama and actually signed some documents saying, \"Hey, we're going to stop all the cyber theft, we're going to stop cyber espionage,\" and didn't, it was really Trump.</p><p>And the reason we did it, that's what we think we won the upper Midwest is because all these manufacturing jobs that the elites let go to China, that's what -- you know, the jobs left as J.D. Vance says, the jobs left and the opioid crisis came in with the workers that were left behind. This is a central issue to the United States.</p><p>And made in China in 2025 -- Anderson, let me give you the bad news. It's not about the stealing of intellectual property, it's about forced technology transfers. This is what this very tough negotiation that Ambassador Lighthizer is having right now under President Trump's guidance on the trade deal.</p><p>[20:35:06] It's not about soy beans, it's about making major structural changes to the Chinese economy. What made in China 2025 is that every American should understand this because it will change your life, is the convergence of advanced chip design, artificial intelligence and robotics.</p><p>They have a plan which they've been working on for years and announcing that by 2025 the conversions of those three will make them an advanced manufacturing superpower and really we'll become kind of a component parts supplier for their manufacturing, high value added.</p><p>That will crush manufacturing in the United States. It will lead to underemployment like you can't believe. This is going to be a massive issue in 2020, this economic war that China has been running against us. And one of the reasons I'm here in Italy, this One Belt, One Road initiative, the Italians who are allies signed a memorandum of understanding. It's not a full deal, but to anchor the One Belt, One Road actually up near Venice on the Adriatic Sea, it's a major strategic shift and I know that the United States is now engaged in talking to Italy, et cetera.</p><p>But this geopolitical struggle, this economic war of China versus the West -- and this is why the Russia thing I said for years is kind of silly. Russia's economy is the size of New York State. China -- and this is not the Chinese people. The Chinese people are decent and hard working, honorable people.</p><p>This is just kind of radical cadre of the Chinese communist party that runs China is that economy war and it's an existential threat economically to the industrial democracies to the West. And this is -- you're going to see this now play on a global stage and it's going to be a huge part of the 2020 campaign.</p><p>COOPER: Yes. Steve Bannon, appreciate talking to you. Thank you very much.</p><p>BANNON: Thanks, Anderson.</p><p>COOPER: Still ahead, we have breaking news in the Jussie Smollett case. The prosecuting attorney speaking out for the first time since the bombshell announcement that her office was dropping all charges again the actor and Smollett's attorney will join us with her reaction, next.</p><p>COOPER: Breaking news in the Jussie Smollett case. In her first interview since the charges against the actor were dropped, the state's attorney said her office believed they could prove him guilty. She also blamed a clerical error for the fact that the court files were sealed. All this is certainly raising even more questions tonight. Smollett's attorney will join us in a moment. But first, Ryan Young has the latest from Chicago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tonight, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx under fire speaking out for the first time after her office dropped all charges against actor Jussie Smollett.</p><p>KIM FOXX, COOK COUNTY STATE'S ATTORNEY: He chose this alternative prosecution method. The court has not found him guilty. I believe based on the facts and the evidence that was presented in the charging decision made by this office, this office believed that they could prove him guilty.</p><p>[20:40:07] I think this office based on those charging decisions believe that he's culpable of doing that.</p><p>YOUNG: New and important, she said parts of Smollett's file were sealed in error.</p><p>FOXX: Mr. Smollett was allowed to have his criminal record to the police report around the arrest sealed. The court file was not supposed to be sealed. I think what happened was the clerk sealed the whole thing.</p><p>YOUNG: But an attorney for Smollett made the request for the case to be sealed in court and a judge approved it, contradicting the state's attorney statement. The decision to drop charges has been met with criticism from many corners, including from the mayor.</p><p>MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL, CHICAGO: He abused the City of Chicago. He actually committed a crime here. He lied about something.</p><p>YOUNG: Meanwhile, Foxx was heavily criticized for her involvement with two people close to the Smollett camp, so she recused herself from the case back in February. CNN obtained e-mails between Foxx and Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff to First Lady Michelle Obama.</p><p>Tchen e-mails Foxx asking for help in the matter. On February 1st, Foxx e-mailed Tchen saying in part, \"Spoke to Superintendent Johnson. I convinced him to reach out to the FBI to ask that they take over the investigation. He is reaching out now and will get back to me shortly.\"</p><p>Tchen then gave Foxx's number to unidentified Smollett family member, a text message exchange between Foxx and the family member. Foxx eventually sharing the same update and the family member responding, \"Oh, my god, this would be a huge victory.\"</p><p>FOXX: The family reached out I think to me largely because they didn't have a connection with the police department, asking if there was a way to make sure that the leaks in the case were too a minimum.</p><p>YOUNG: Despite it all, Smollett's attorney claiming victory.</p><p>TINA GLANDIAN, SMOLLETT'S ATTORNEY: I think if they believe the charges they would have never dismissed the case.</p><p>YOUNG: Ryan Young, CNN, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COOPER: And Jussie Smollett's attorney, Tina Glandian, joins us now. Ms. Glandian, thanks for being with us. How do you square State's Attorney Kim Foxx saying she's confident her office could have proven Jussie Smollett's guilt with the fact that she dropped the case?</p><p>GLANDIAN: I think, as I said earlier, that if they were able to prove the charges, they never would have dismissed the case. Sorry.</p><p>COOPER: It's OK. Those things pop out all of the time.</p><p>GLANDIAN: I think there's been a lot of political pressure in this case and so as much as we applauded the state's attorney office for what they did yesterday, which was the right thing under the circumstances, they've been backpedaling and we understand all of the heat and pressure they've gotten and they've been reacting to that.</p><p>COOPER: So, Jussie Smollett did what, like, two days of community service and paid a $10,000 fine. Why did he do that? I mean, that seems to be some form of punishment. What was he being punished for?</p><p>GLANDIAN: He was not punished. He was not ordered to do a single thing in this case. He voluntarily agreed to forfeit the bond because if he had chosen -- and this was a decision he struggled with, because he knew what the perception would be and he didn't want that to be the perception.</p><p>But had he wanted to go to trial, he would have to put his career and life on hold for a minimum of a year and he would have incurred much more costs than $10,000 to ultimately bring this to trial. And to have his day in court would have put his career on hold and also been very costly. So, we strongly advised him to agree to forfeit the bond.</p><p>As far as the community service, that's completely been falsely represented at this point. Jussie, as we told the judge at the initial bond hearing, has always volunteered. He's been a contributing member of society for decades at this point and volunteered with dozens if not hundreds of organizations. And so he has done volunteer service.</p><p>I know there were some questions about the push coalition. They put a statement out saying that there was no court ordered community service which is the true facts here. And if you look at the transcripts from the proceedings where the case was dismissed, there is no mention of any required community service, either before or after the fact.</p><p>COOPER: So if you can just stay with us, Ms. Glandian, because I do want to bring in Laura Coates and Jeffrey Toobin, who are both former federal prosecutors and CNN Legal Analyst. Laura, you hear the argument from the legal team. You get the comments from the state's attorney. Does this make sense to you?</p><p>LAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, it sounds as if this is an alternative to prosecution just hearing what they're having to say about it in the sense that perhaps that the dismissal was contingent on the payment and forfeiture of the bond and perhaps some look at his criminal record, et cetera. That to me suggests that it wasn't a full dismissal with no contingencies.</p><p>Having said that, I do have a question for you in the sense of, well, when you think about the notion that your colleague talked about this being prosecutorial overkill, is there something to suggest that the reason they may have decided against this and not to the charges because of the number of counts against him and charging as a felony rather than a misdemeanor?</p><p>[20:45:06] GLANDIAN: No. I think the fact that they charged so many counts is all the more reason just looks so odd to everybody that all 16 counts were dismissed two and a half weeks after he was arraigned on the 16 counts. So, there's obviously very different ways they could have tried to dissolve of this case and their initial offer to us involved a dismissal.</p><p>This wasn't something that was negotiated. We were never going to enter a plea. He's maintained his innocence. Obviously, he continues to maintain his innocence and so a plea was off the table. And so for them -- two and a half weeks later to completely dismiss the case, I think that speaks volumes.</p><p>COOPER: Jeff Toobin, I know you have some questions.</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: Ms. Glandian, does your client plan to apologize to the actual victims of hate crimes who will now be disbelieved because of your client's ridiculous stunt here.</p><p>GLANDIAN: Well, I completely disagree with your categorization that this was a ridiculous stunt. Again, he's not been convicted of any crimes. It's unbelievable to me the amount of conviction in his guilt when prior to him ever stepping foot inside of the courthouse and now the 16 counts were dismissed against him by the state attorney's office in such a high profile matter.</p><p>The fact that people still call it -- call this a ridiculous stunt is actually very offensive to me. And so the only person who should be apologizing is the mayor and the City of Chicago. That's who should apologize to the victims of hate crimes who will now hesitate to come forward because they don't want to be charged with 16 counts themselves.</p><p>TOOBIN: What was his relationship with the two people who allegedly beat him up?</p><p>GLANDIAN: He was friendly with one of them. He had met Abel and Ola Osundairo about a year and a half ago. They were friends and friendly and they trained together. They socialized. He knew the older brother strictly -- you know, he met him only a few times and did not even have his contact information, had never communicated with him, which also should, you know, make you wonder that if he was going to pull such a ridiculous stunt, would he actually entrust pretty much a stranger to do that to ruin his -- to potentially ruin his life and come out with this?</p><p>COOPER: Ms. Glandian, let me just ask you, so he knew this guy for a year and a half. They trained together. They've socialized together. If this guy is punching him in the face and saying things to him, how is it possible he could not recognize this guy?</p><p>GLANDIAN: He was wearing -- the attackers, I should say, were wearing ski masks.</p><p>COOPER: Did they have gloves on?</p><p>GLANDIAN: I'm sorry?</p><p>COOPER: Did they have gloves on?</p><p>GLANDIAN: Yes. But more importantly, I mean, his face was covered with a ski mask. He only saw one of the attackers. COOPER: OK. But they were wearing gloves so he didn't even know he was of Nigerian decent, that he was not white?</p><p>GLANDIAN: He did not.</p><p>COOPER: How -- I just don't understand, if you know somebody --</p><p>COATES: So why did he identify the person on --</p><p>COOPER: -- as white. He identified the person as white. But if you know -- I mean, if you've known somebody for a year and a half --</p><p>GLANDIAN: If you were jumped from --</p><p>COOPER: If my trainer beat me up or punch me in a dark street, I would know it's my trainer.</p><p>GLANDIAN: No. I think if it's 2:00 in the morning and you got jumped from behind and somebody -- the first point of contact is a punch to your face and it's all of a 30 to 45 second tussle and they're wearing a ski mask and there's the commotion that goes on in a fight, I don't think through a ski mask you're going to identify anybody in the excitement of the moment.</p><p>COOPER: All right. We're out of time unfortunately.</p><p>COATES: Well, I have to ask, if I could just ask one question. You know, if you have -- the reason you say this is, of course, you're all lying. Why do you think that the state's attorney office has not charged those two brothers with actually committing perjury if they testified in front of the grand jury? I think there was no actual plea deal, cooperation's agreement, why would they not be charged?</p><p>GLANDIAN: I can't speak to what the police department of the state's attorney office has done because a lot of it has been frankly inexplicable to me. So, you would have to ask them that.</p><p>COOPER: All right. Tina Glandian, appreciate, Laura Coates and Jeff Toobin as well.</p><p>Still more to learn, Senate hearings begin tomorrow on the nomination of acting Secretary David Bernhardt to become the full-time Secretary of the Interior. Coming up, an investigation you'll only see here about what Mr. Bernhardt was doing during the shutdown when hundreds of thousands of federal employees weren't getting paid.</p><p>[20:51:01] COOPER: The Senate committee holds hearings tomorrow for the acting attorney -- Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to be confirmed for the job full-time. Bernhardt is a former oil and gas industry lobbyist who's been questioned by CNN's Drew Griffin about why so many of his former clients have been getting what they've asked for while he's been serving as secretary -- as acting secretary.</p><p>Now on the eve of those hearings, there's some new information about how Bernhardt ordered federal workers back to the job during the government shutdown, specifically to process and approve drilling permits on federal land, this while during that shutdown, as you all remember, thousands of government workers were severely impacted.</p><p>We even met some on this program who told us stories of rationing badly needed medicine and wondering if they were going to wake up the next morning or choosing between eating and putting gas in their car because money was no longer coming in. So keep that in mind as you watch Drew's report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The oil and gas industry in Northeastern Colorado is booming, new wells, new drilling rigs, new roads and an industry awash in gas and oil. And in a controversial move, the Interior Department under acting Secretary David Bernhardt --</p><p>DAVID BERNHARDT, ACTING INTERIOR SECRETARY: My name is David Bernhardt.</p><p>GRIFFIN: -- tried to make sure all this activity didn't even slowdown during the recent government shutdown. How? By calling in furloughed federal workers in the Bureau of Land Management whose job was to process and approve drilling permits for the industry that David Bernhardt used to lobby for, a few of those permits even went to Bernhardt's former clients, which has environmentalists fuming.</p><p>AARON WEISS, CENTER FOR WESTERN PRIORITIES: In every shutdown prior, the Interior Department actually shuts down so there's no reason to bring those employees only back just to do the bidding of the oil and gas industry, but that's what happened here.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Some members of Congress are questioning if it was even legal. Federal law dictates when an agency doesn't have funding to pay workers like during a shutdown, only essential employees, those needed to protect life or property should continue to work. But the BLM under Bernhardt used a novel interpretation, saying permit fees would cover the cost of the permit workers.</p><p>During the shutdown, the BLM approved 267 drilling permits along with 16 oil and gas leases. Permits went to at least two of Bernhardt's former clients, including Noble Energy, which got four permits to drill in Colorado's Pawnee National Grassland.</p><p>BERNHARDT: I'm happy to visit with you at any time. Right now is not the time.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Bernhardt, who refused to answer questions on a previous CNN report concerning his ties to the oil and gas industry, has again denied a request to be interviewed here, and has yet to fully explain why it was so urgent, essential, that workers be brought back to process drilling permits.</p><p>Bernhardt was quoted in a local New Mexico newspaper saying, \"There's also safety and we need to keep things safe,\" though it's not clear how permitting impacts safety. Asked for an explanation, the Interior Department said the acting secretary's words speak for themselves.</p><p>WEISS: That makes no sense to me. Not issuing a permit does not make things unsafe and I can't imagine a way you can parse that sentence in which that does make any sense.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Kathleen Sgamma is president of the Western Energy Alliance which represents the oil and gas industry.</p><p>(on camera) The Western Energy Alliance did not raise a concern on safety.</p><p>KATHLEEN SGAMMA, WESTERN ENERGY ALLIANCE: No. We started to hear concerns from companies that, \"hey, I've got these situations changing in the field. I can't get BLM on the phone. And not problems as in safety problems, but problems as in, hey, this company wants to keep moving forward with development and can't because they can't get an answer out of BLM.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Couldn't this be viewed as just another favor to the energy industry?</p><p>SGAMMA: Well, it's not a favor because we pay for those permits.</p><p>GRIFFIN: It wasn't that long ago these wild Pawnee Grasslands were just that, wild. Now, almost everywhere you look is a gas rig.</p><p>[20:55:05] It doesn't look like a grassland where we standing.</p><p>BRIAN RUTLEDGE, NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY: Kind of falling away from that, hasn't it? It looks like a factory.</p><p>GRIFFIN (voice-over): Brian Rutledge with the Audobon Society has worked for decades trying to prevent encroaching oil and gas drilling from destroying habitat in the grasslands. What he sees now is rampant drilling on federal lands with the Interior Department focused on approving permits as fast as possible, even during government shutdowns.</p><p>RUTLEDGE: Our responsibility is these great western lands. It's not whether or not gas and oil is hitting their profit margins.</p><p>GRIFFIN: The Bureau of Land Management told CNN, \"We had a legal and ethical obligation to continue this work, especially since halting would have increased the hardships borne by our people and the communities that depend on energy production for jobs and economic development.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COOPER: Drew, this is the third story we've done on Bernhardt's close ties to the oil and gas industry. He's up for confirmation hearing tomorrow. Is there any expectation that his confirmation as interior secretary is going to be challenged?</p><p>GRIFFIN: His nomination may get some tough questions from Democrats, but on the issue of granting favors to his old industry clients, Bernhardt through his office maintains, Anderson, that he has done nothing wrong. Anderson?</p><p>COOPER: All right, Drew, thanks. I want to check in with Chris to see what he's working on. Chris?</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: My favorite word from the Bannon interview that I learned tonight, marginalia.</p><p>COOPER: Marginalia.</p><p>CUOMO: All the Russian interference, marginalia.</p><p>COOPER: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: I had to look it up if it means what I thought it meant, which is something opposite than the truth. What an important interview to have on, though. Good for you, Anderson.</p><p>Tonight, we're going to take on people on the other side of the equation. We have Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings here tonight, big members of the Democratic Party, chairs of Oversight Committees, what do they see as the path forward?</p><p>COOPER: All right. Chris, we look forward to that, just about three minutes from now. We'll be right back.</p><p>COOPER: Busy night to say the least. Our interview with Mr. Bannon went longer than expected. We're going to leave it to Chris now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019032701CNV98</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRY-TN21-DXH2-60P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9371\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 27, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>BREAKING NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Bill Barr</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jerry Nadler</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robert Mueller</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DOJ</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Obamacare</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Steve Bannon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Thursday, the association sent a letter to Senate leadership outlining specific provisions the industry supports and opposes, including urging inclusion of bipartisan legislation that would ease the forgiveness process for smaller paycheck protection program (PPP) loans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of note, NAFCU continues to fight against any efforts to extend interchange price caps to credit cards, arguing that it 'would cause irreparable harm to credit unions' and hurt consumers by potentially reducing the availability of credit.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Senate began releasing details of its Phase 4 package \u2013 the HEALS Act (Health; Economic Assistance; Liability Protection; and Schools Act) \u2013 which includes several NAFCU-supported items related to small business lending. Among those provisions are improvements to the PPP, including simplifying the forgiveness application process for smaller loans (similar to what the NAFCU-supported Paycheck Protection Small Business Forgiveness Act would do for loans under $150,000 as well as other changes for loans between $150,000 and $2 million).</p><p>The House previously passed its Phase 4 proposal \u2013 the HEROES Act \u2013 and NAFCU has continued to share its feedback on the bill with lawmakers.</p><p>For the Senate's Phase 4 package, NAFCU Vice President of Legislative Affairs Brad Thaler sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y , outlining the association's priorities.</p><p>Measures from the CARES Act that NAFCU would like extended or modified include:</p><p>making improvements to the PPP and adjusting the PPP loan forgiveness language proposed in the HEALS Act to match what is in the Paycheck Protection Small Business Forgiveness Act as the House has also had companion legislation introduced; making permanent the changes to the NCUA's Central Liquidity Facility; extending through the end of the year flexibility related to troubled debt restructurings (TDRs); providing parity for the NCUA with the FDIC related to establishing an unlimited maximum guarantee to all shares or deposits held in a federally-insured credit union; providing an exemption or extended relief from the current expected credit loss (CECL) standard for credit unions; and providing capital flexibility to credit unions on par with what community banks received, which allowed banking regulators to temporarily lower the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) from 9 percent to 8 percent.</p><p>Additional provisions NAFCU would like added to the Phase 4 package include:</p><p>providing relief from credit unions' member business lending (MBL) cap so they can provide more credit to small businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic; providing emergency funding for the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund and the NCUA's Community Development Revolving Loan Fund (CDRLF), which will allow credit unions to better serve underserved and low-income communities; modernizing the E-SIGN Act; and limiting liability for essential businesses that remained open during the pandemic to protect them from exploitative lawsuits. NAFCU joined more than 400 groups in support of this provision in a letter to Congress Thursday.</p><p>Provisions NAFCU warned against including in Phase 4 legislation as they could hinder credit unions' ability to support members trying to recover from the pandemic include:</p><p>eliminating courtesy pay programs; mandating blanket loan forbearance; placing overly broad restrictions on first-party debt collection; disrupting the integrity of the credit reporting system; making major changes to bankruptcy provisions; and allowing big tech to enter the financial services industry without proper oversight or regulations.</p><p>NAFCU will continue its aggressive advocacy to ensure credit unions' needs are included in any final legislation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMFNNW-IFN5557303</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMFNNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HY-T3V1-F0YC-N3YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact Financial News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56566\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0001V1J</classCode><className>FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS524128 OTHER DIRECT INSURANCE (EXCEPT LIFE, HEALTH &amp;

Ahead of the hearing, NAFCU Vice President of Legislative Affairs Brad Thaler reiterated the association's call for additional credit union relief measures to be included in the next coronavirus-related package.</p><p>Today's hearing is set to begin at 1 p.m Eastern and will be available via livestream.</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, NAFCU has consistently fought for credit unions to have the regulatory flexibility and relief needed to provide members facing financial hardship with the assistance they need. The association's advocacy has secured several beneficial provisions and bipartisan support for additional legislative changes. In addition, NAFCU has strongly opposed efforts to extend interchange price caps to credit cards, arguing that it 'would cause irreparable harm to credit unions' and hurt consumers by potentially reducing the availability of credit.</p><p>In the letter sent Monday, Thaler outlined provisions \u2013 already provided for in previous relief packages or being considered \u2013 that would benefit credit unions and their members, including:</p><p>simplifying the PPP loan forgiveness process for loans under a $150,000 threshold, such as proposed in the \u200b\u200bPaycheck Protection Small Business Forgiveness Act; making permanent the changes to the NCUA's Central Liquidity Facility; extending flexibility related to troubled debt restructurings (TDRs); providing parity for the NCUA with the FDIC related to establishing an unlimited maximum guarantee to all shares or deposits held in a federally-insured credit union; providing an exemption or extended relief from the current expected credit loss (CECL) standard for credit unions; providing capital flexibility to credit unions on par with what community banks received, which allowed banking regulators to temporarily lower the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) from 9 percent to 8 percent; providing relief from credit unions' member business lending (MBL) cap so they can provide more credit to small businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic; providing emergency funding for the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund and the NCUA's Community Development Revolving Loan Fund (CDRLF), which will allow credit unions to better serve underserved and low-income communities; modernizing the E-SIGN Act; and limiting liability for essential businesses that remained open during the pandemic to protect them from exploitative lawsuits.</p><p>Additional provisions Thaler warned against including as they could hinder credit unions' ability to support members trying to recover from the pandemic include:</p><p>eliminating courtesy pay programs; mandating blanket loan forbearance; placing overly broad restrictions on first-party debt collection; disrupting the integrity of the credit reporting system; making major changes to bankruptcy provisions; and allowing big tech to enter the financial services industry without proper oversight or regulations.</p><p>NAFCU will continue its aggressive advocacy to ensure credit unions' needs are included in any final legislation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMFNNW-IFN5827852</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMFNNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RR-7J61-JDG9-Y4CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact Financial News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56566\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001V1J</classCode><className>FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS524128 OTHER DIRECT INSURANCE (EXCEPT LIFE, HEALTH &amp;

The principles set out expectations that AI systems and AI actors be fair and ethical, avoid proxy discrimination against protected classes, be accountable, compliant with the law, transparent, and have secure, safe and robust outputs. The guidelines are intended to assist regulators and NAIC committees when addressing the level of regulatory oversight they should give to insurance-specific AI applications.The NAIC AI Working Group began work on the AI principles in June 2019, using the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) AI principles as a model. </p><p>The OECD's AI principles have been adopted by 42 countries, including the United States. Significant tensions emerged during debate at meetings of the NAIC's AI Working Group and of the Innovation and Technology Task Force on the meaning of the term 'proxy discrimination' and the practicality of avoiding proxy discrimination against protected classes in a risk-based insurance system. Nevertheless, NAIC leadership recognized the importance of addressing proxy discrimination in AI; the concept of avoiding 'proxy discrimination against protected classes' has remained in the AI principles that the full NAIC membership adopted during the August 2020 National Meeting.AI is a powerful, dynamic tool that can be used in insurance to identify hidden correlations and relationships among factors in massive data sets. AI-based applications currently underwrite and price insurance policies, assist in processing claims and fraud avoidance, and identify populations of consumers for targeted advertising, among other uses. AI is a strong growth area in a business whose 'deep learning' capabilities, without accountability and transparency, could lead, and, some allege has already led, to unfair outcomes. If an algorithm used in AI is biased, insurance regulators stress that the algorithm must be avoided; AI actors must anticipate this possibility and not, in the words of one regulator, 'cut the machine loose' and claim they were not aware of the issue.The NAIC AI principles are intended to be an aspirational document that acts as guidance and 'do not carry the weight of law or impose any legal liability.' They nonetheless constitute a statement of regulatory policy and 'should be used to assist regulators and NAIC committees addressing insurance-specific AI applications' and on that basis are intended to serve as guiding principles for new regulations and enforcement of existing ones. They nonetheless reflect regulators' recognition that regulation should not stifle technological innovation, stating the principles should be 'interpreted and applied in a manner that accommodates the nature and pace of change in the use of AI by the insurance industry [to] promote innovation, while protecting the consumer.'In adopting these principles, the NAIC joins the EU, other governments and big tech companies (IBM, Google, Microsoft, among others) in recognizing the potential benefits and harms of AI, such as biased outcomes. To deal with the power and potential of AI, the NAIC principles call on AI actors to implement mechanisms and safeguards to foresee potential adverse consequences and address these risks comprehensively. The NAIC principles recognize the need for improving public confidence in AI by providing stakeholders with a way to inquire about, review and seek recourse for AI-driven insurance decisions. The principles also call on AI actors to ensure a reasonable level of traceability of AI data sets, processes and decisions made during the lifecyle of an AI system. To that end, the principles provide that AI actors should enable transparent analyses of their AI systems, consistent with best practices and legal requirements. Finally, the principles provide that AI actors should apply a systemic and continuous risk management approach to their AI systems and outputs in the areas of privacy, data security and unfair discrimination.Many regulators noted that their duty is to ensure that the industry innovates responsibly with AI systems that are well thought out with no unintended consequences. The New York State insurance regulator remarked on the synergies between the AI principles and NY's Circular Letter No. 1 from 2019 in making insurers responsible for the models, algorithms and data designed or used by third party vendors.Insurance regulators and industry representatives recognize that adopting these AI principles is only the beginning.

Another Briton in Silicon Valley, a partner at the San Francisco fund NFX, he offers unnecessary apologies and talks about the weather.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But he was a pioneer. It was 16 years ago that Flint, from Chigwell in Essex, first arrived to do an MBA at Stanford. Back then he had to seek out the short supply of British friends.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I don't think I knew any British entrepreneurs out here. California to London just seemed such a long way,\" he says. \"You want to maintain relationships with your culture and your history and people that kind of share the same sense of humour.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2004, while still at the university, he founded the property website Trulia, which was bought by its larger rival Zillow in 2015 for $3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn). The resulting company is the largest property marketplace in the US.</p><p>But Flint, now 45, was already a tech veteran despite being not yet 30 when he landed in Silicon Valley. Part of the founding team at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">www.lastminute.com</url>, he had seen the UK ecommerce giant grow from a start-up to a public company worth more than $1bn, back when being a unicorn meant something.</p><p>\"I remember getting my payroll slip, and I was number one employee on the payroll, and Brent [Hoberman] was number two and I think Martha [Lane Fox] was number three. It was a really tiny team, six people. Really fun.\"</p><p>So what is it about Silicon Valley? Why leave success in London behind and take your chances in the US? The fabled region, full of recognisable big tech brands, certainly holds a fascination for any UK entrepreneur - as do its famous residents.</p><p>\"I was like a kid in a candy store.</p><p>You'd see the Google campus, and that was Yahoo, and that was eBay,\" he says. \"I had written this business plan. On the Saturday I was hearing Steve Jobs do his commencement speech. On the Monday morning, I was pitching Mike Moritz at Sequoia. It's just a crazy time.\"</p><p>Now, as an investor, Flint works with the many British start-ups who have followed his path to the Valley. Why do they end up here? \"I often think is quite accidental,\" he says. \"There are not that many people who are intentionally like 'I'm going to start a company in Silicon Valley'. They come here and then become enthralled by it. And then stick around.\"</p><p>The Valley certainly does a great job of marketing itself. Stanford's business school consistently lands at the top of world MBA rankings.</p><p>Accelerator programmes like Y Combinator have launched success stories including Airbnb, Dropbox, Reddit and Twitch. And would-be entrepreneurs are just a few connections away from deeppocketed investors like Moritz (a Cardiff-born former journalist), or the mentorship of successful chief executives and founders.</p><p>Being an outsider can be helpful.</p><p>Flint founded Trulia after experiencing first-hand the frustrating California property market, where most new arrivals found their home on Craigslist, a website that has barely changed since 1995, or via distinctly analogue estate agents. \"I moved to Silicon Valley expecting people to be riding around on Segways and there to be amazing technology.</p><p>And - you've been to [Silicon Valley town] Palo Alto. It's not that modern. I was shocked at how bad something as important as real estate was,\" he says.</p><p>It is a curiously low-tech place for somewhere synonymous with innovation, and especially for someone moving from London. It's normal to pay your rent by cheque, lots of bars are cash-only, you can't use contactless on public transport, phone signal is poor and supermarket self-checkouts are rare and unreliable.</p><p>That culture shock is useful as an entrepreneur, Flint says. \"You look at the stats around the companies that have been started by first and secondgeneration immigrants and it's remarkable. It's a combination of naivety, in a good way, just thinking differently about a problem and not accepting the status quo, plus a sense that there's nothing to lose. You're really coming with nothing.</p><p>\"There's something to prove. I think a lot of immigrants want to make their mark on society and that pushes them to do things that are not pedestrian.\"</p><p>What about the companies that stay at home? Has the gap between Silicon Valley and the Silicon Roundabout narrowed at all? \"It's got so much better,\" he says. \"I used to think there was a sort of latency between Silicon Valley and London, which was maybe 18 months. And now it feels like three to six months.\"</p><p>The main impediment for would-be British tech giants is Little Britain's limited size. \"The market size is just inherently challenging. It's a sizeable country, but it's just not as big as America, which makes it really hard to build really huge businesses.\"</p><p>One thing that is easier in the UK is building a brand, something Flint credits with lastminute.com's success. Few UK consumer tech companies since have made the kind of splash that it managed. \"There was, frankly, a bit of a vacuum at the time, there were just no other big dotcom companies in the UK that became successful. They were almost the last man standing.\"</p><p>The London-centric nature of the UK is key. \"In the US you need to dominate LA and San Francisco and Chicago, and Miami - it's a collection of states, whereas at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">www.lastminute.com</url> the media strategy was specifically designed to saturate central London, because a lot of influencers were there. If you dominated that people would think you were this enormous organisation.\"</p><p>British fintech and AI businesses are pushing ahead of Silicon <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Valley.UK\">www.Valley.UK</url> start-up Monzo, in particular, has also leveraged brand and desirability with its distinctive coral cards. In the US, Twitter has tried a similar saturation tactic in San Francisco, covering streets and train stations with adverts.</p><p>For <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">www.lastminute.com</url>, he says, branding was a \"superpower\". \"Brent and Martha were amazing. They took a lot of hits as well. But they were phenomenal at building the brand.\"</p><p>In his new gig as an investor at NFXwhich stands for network effects, Silicon Valley slang for something that gets better when more people sign up), he has invested in UK entrepreneurs including Let's Do This, a site for endurance athletes, and Zeus, which provides furnished corporate housing.</p><p>But it's getting tougher to find good software companies. \"I sort of think of it like a technology tsunami. All the low lying areas have been covered and now it's moving up to the high ground and the more regulated industries, and the more operationally complex things.</p><p>\"WeWork, for example, is not really a tech company. I think their competitors would call themselves tech-enabled real estate companies. It doesn't make them tech companies.\"</p><p>He knows plenty of Britons now, as chairman of a Silicon Valley networking group for British entrepreneurs, GBx, and his children go to a French lycee and learn in a \"European environment\"\" (his wife, Melanie, grew up in France). But that's enough to satisfy any yearnings to return. \"The world is getting to be so much smaller that it is less relevant where I live, but for right now, this is home.</p><p>'I was shocked at how bad something as important as real estate was in the Valley'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Pete Flint was part of the founding team at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\">www.Lastminute.com</url>.

She is currently writing a book about textile artisans. This is one of my favorite posts to write each year. It's my annual chance to thank the Naked Capitalism community for what you give to me. </p><p>I've said it before[1]. But I can say it differently and maybe, a bit better this year. So here goes. Here at Naked Capitalism, Yves and Lambert have fostered a vibrant critically thinking, supportive community.. Please visit and drop somemoney into the Tip Jar[2], which is to the right, to keep It going. I want to thank that community for what you give to me. You have made me a far better writer since I have been contributing to Naked Capitalism. Let me count the ways! You keep me sharp and at the top of my game by pointing out, at the trivial level, typos and awkward prose, and more seriously, oversights, omissions, and errors, providing a chance to admit and correct my mistakes. I can't promise I get it completely right out of the gate, but with your help, I can immediately improve and if necessary correct my original thoughts. You keep me company, as writing is a solitary gig and I am not a solitary personality. As my friends and family well know, I am anything but! It's important to me that someone, somewhere is paying attention to my thoughts and I am not just whistling in the wind. That I have a constant audience and some of you through your comments have made yourselves known to me means I have someone concrete to write for and to. And that at least for this writer, is very important. You keep me inspired, as via your comments on my posts, you suggest new themes and arguments. And just as crucially, you let me know which ones simply do not fly. Rather than rejecting your criticisms out of hand, I consider them, and when I conclude you're right, I incorporate the corrections into my subsequent work and thinking. The Naked Capitalism commentariat is the best commentariat, and you often think of things that simply haven't occurred to me. Together, we create better subsequent posts. And I thank you for spurring me on to create better work. Future posts can be better than past. There are multiple ways to give to Naked Capitalism. The first is here on the blog, the Tip Jar[3], which takes you to PayPal. You can use a debit card, a credit card or a PayPal account (the charge will be in the name of Aurora Advisors). You can also send a check (or multiple post-dated checks) in the name of 'Aurora Advisors Incorporated' to: Aurora Advisors Incorporated 164 Peachtree Circle Mountain Brook, AL 35213 If you send a check, please also send an e-mail to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:yves@nakedcapitalism.com\">yves@nakedcapitalism.com</email>  with the headline 'Check is in the mail' to let her know it's coming and to have your contribution included in the total number of donations.; Donate now to Naked Capitalism, whether it's $5, $50, or $5000. If you can't afford much, give what you can. If you can afford more, give more. If you can give a lot, give a lot. It will pay for itself, I guarantee you. Help Us to Explore Topics that the Mainstream Media Doesn't That's what you've done for me in the past year. Now I ask you to contribute so that we can keep on raising hell in the future. IIRC, there was a past fundraising post on how if you're not paying for your content, rest assured someone is. paying for the spin that you instead read. Not here. So onto my second theme. I won't purport to speak for either Yves or Lambert. They can do a far better job than I can in expressing these points themselves. Except to say: Yves will continue to cover the CalPERS beat. As well as explore the seamy, self-interested side of finance, economics, and politics. Expect Lambert to continue to write about the election, what the two mainstream patrties are up to, and especially how both sides are trying to manipulate - or outright steal - the results, by means both far and foul. As well as to bring you the latest news on science and COVID-19, and news about of the biosphere. As for me, I will continue to hammer the point that both Big Pharma and Big Tech have agendas as to what anti-COVID-19 policies are pursued. We here at Naked Capitalism don't subscribe to them, but seek to illuminate them, and subvert them as self-interested responses that oftentimes will do more harm than good. In the U.S. in particular, we need to hear what other places are doing that works. Hong Kong, Thailand, and Vietnam - places I know a bit about- are all doing better jobs, much better than the EU average, not to mention the pathetic performance of the United States. Likewise for Taiwan, Korea, China, New Zealand, and other places. There are particular cities as well that have had better responses, and I will seek out what they are doing, and write about it. Because we all know that not only the U.S., but also the UK, needs all the help it can get, and the responses and policies of places showing some success should be more widely and deeply known. The mainstream media is not looking at why this is so, but continues to push agendas and messages of Big Pharma and Big Tech. Rest assured, we'll continue to tell you why contact tracing via app doesn't work - supported by the expertise of Ignacio. As he emailed me recently, when presented with the following Guardian clip about the failure of the UK's contact tracing app[4] (which joins the Indian app, and numerous other similar tech-driven solutions on the dustheap of failed techno fixes). Over toIgnacio: An app to do massive contract tracing is equal to laziness or unwillingness to do the right thing. But you know contracting people to do the good work is not in the neolib agenda. Importantly, it was expected to fail, so it is a failure by design. Big Phama wants you to believe that we'll soon have a vaccine, and that what they've created will work, out of the box, without serious side effects. But we have no assurance that the vaccines they are promoting in the U.S. and UK are more efficacious than those being pushed by India, Russia, China, and other places. A COVID-slayer vaccine can come from anywhere, and will not necessarily be a Big Pharma option. Although rest assured, if that proves to be effective, and the best bet, I won't let its provenance deter me from accepting it. May the best solution win! Yet as someone who has written much over the last decade or so about the evolution of Indian pharmaceuticals and the country's pharma diplomacy, I hope I am open-minded enough to consider a range of possible solutions that may not necessarily be Big Pharma options. The only drug solutions Big Pharma and its acolytes are seriously promoting are expensive new drugs, which are under patent protection. There are numerous other approaches, however, for which Big Pharma is muddying the waters, turning scientific matters into issues of politics. Such as the use of hydroxychloroquince (HCQ) , or the importance of supplementation by vitamins C and D and zinc. These are not easy issues, but Big Pharma has made them more complicated to understand. Should I personally take HCQ? Should you? Well using the critical thinking skills that Naked Capitalism has been so good at honing. I say no, at least with respect to me, as every HCQ pill I take comes out of the mouth of someone who needs it for an ailment where it has been proven to work. I asked my friend, Dr. Sarah Borwein, who as regular readers know practices medicine in Hong Kong. and has experience dating back to the SARS epidemic in Beijing. And she told me their Hong Kong infectious disease specialists are counselling no. So I've decided no. Why should you care? Well, only 105 patients have died in Hong Kong. In a densely populated city of 7 million. No typo that. So I think they know something there about treating and preventing the spread of the COVID-19 infection. And they are not recommending use of HCQ at this time. Isn't that something you want to know? Now you do! Mind you, I am not claiming they are right. Only telling you what I have personally concluded. That, my friends, is what is meant by critical thinking. Beyond trying to debunk the spin of Big Tech and Big Pharma, I intend to continue to ply my regular beats: fast fashion and sustainability; the right to repair, plastics, and the war on waste; significant legal and regulatory developments; and finally, the looming specter of food insecurity, which to date is not getting all the attention I fear it should be receiving. But we have been covering this issue here and will continue to do so. I hope you'll dig deep so that NC's writers can continue to explore and seek out truth, without fear or favour.Allow me another request if you have not done so already, please visit and drop somemoney into the Tip Jar[5], which is to the right, so we can keep the lights on here.

You keep me company, as writing is a solitary gig and I am not a solitary personality. As my friends and family well know, I am anything but! It\u2019s important to me that someone, somewhere is paying attention to my thoughts and I am not just whistling in the wind. That I have a constant audience and some of you through your comments have made yourselves known to me means I have someone concrete to write for and to. And that at least for this writer, is very important.    You keep me inspired, as via your comments on my posts, you suggest new themes and arguments. And just as crucially, you let me know which ones simply do not fly. Rather than rejecting your criticisms out of hand, I consider them, and when I conclude you\u2019re right, I incorporate the corrections into my subsequent work and thinking.    The Naked Capitalism commentariat is the best commentariat, and you often think of things that simply haven\u2019t occurred  to me. Together, we create better subsequent posts. And I thank you for spurring me on to create better work. Future posts can be better than past.    There are multiple ways to give to Naked Capitalism . The first is here on the blog, the Tip Jar , which takes you to PayPal. You can use a debit card, a credit card or a PayPal account (the charge will be in the name of Aurora Advisors).    You can also send a check (or multiple post-dated checks) in the name of \u201cAurora Advisors Incorporated\u201d to:    Aurora Advisors Incorporated  164 Peachtree Circle  Mountain Brook, AL 35213    If you send a check, please also send an e-mail to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:yves@nakedcapitalism.com\">yves@nakedcapitalism.com</email>  with the headline \u201cCheck is in the mail\u201d to let her know it\u2019s coming and to have your contribution included in the total number of donations.    Donate now to Naked Capitalism, whether it\u2019s $5, $50, or $5000. If you can\u2019t afford much, give what you can. If you can afford more, give more. If you can give a lot, give a lot. It will pay for itself, I guarantee you.    Help Us to Explore Topics that the Mainstream Media Doesn\u2019t    That\u2019s what you\u2019ve done for me in the past year. Now I ask you to contribute so that we can keep on raising hell in the future. IIRC, there was a past fundraising post on how if you\u2019re not paying for your content, rest assured someone is. paying for the spin that you instead read.    Not here. So onto my second theme.    I won\u2019t purport to speak for either Yves or Lambert. They can do a far better job than I can in expressing these points themselves. Except to say: Yves will continue to cover the CalPERS beat. As well as explore the seamy, self-interested side of finance, economics, and politics.    Expect Lambert to continue to write about the election, what the two mainstream patrties are up to, and especially how both sides are trying to manipulate \u2013 or outright steal \u2013 the results, by means both far and foul. As well as to bring you the latest news on science and COVID-19, and news about of the biosphere.    As for me, I will continue to hammer the point that both Big Pharma and Big Tech have agendas as to what anti-COVID-19 policies are pursued. We here at Naked Capitalism don\u2019t subscribe to them, but seek to illuminate them, and subvert them as self-interested responses that oftentimes will do more harm than good.    In the U.S. in particular, we need to hear what other places are doing that works. Hong Kong, Thailand, and Vietnam \u2013 places I know a bit about- are all doing better jobs, much better than the EU average, not to mention the pathetic performance of the United States. Likewise for Taiwan, Korea, China, New Zealand, and other places. There are particular cities as well that have had better responses, and I will seek out what they are doing, and write about it.    Because we all know that not only the U.S., but also the UK, needs all the help it can get, and the responses and policies of places showing some success should be more widely and deeply known.    The mainstream media is not looking at why this is so, but continues to push agendas and messages of Big Pharma and Big Tech.    Rest assured, we\u2019ll continue to tell you why contact tracing via app doesn\u2019t work \u2013 supported by the expertise of Ignacio. As he emailed me recently, when presented with the following Guardian clip about the failure of the UK\u2019s contact tracing app (which joins the Indian app, and numerous other similar tech-driven solutions on the dustheap of failed techno fixes). Over to Ignacio:    An app to do massive contract tracing is equal to laziness or unwillingness to do the right thing. But you know contracting people to do the good work is not in the neolib agenda. Importantly, it was expected to fail, so it is a failure by design.    Big Phama wants you to believe that we\u2019ll soon have a vaccine, and that what they\u2019ve created will work, out of the box, without serious side effects. But we have no assurance that the vaccines they are promoting in the U.S. and UK are more efficacious than those being pushed by India, Russia, China, and other places.    A COVID-slayer vaccine can come from anywhere, and will not necessarily be a Big Pharma option. Although rest assured, if that proves to be effective, and the best bet, I won\u2019t let its provenance deter me from accepting it. May the best solution win!    Yet as someone who has written much over the last decade or so about the evolution of Indian pharmaceuticals and the country\u2019s pharma diplomacy, I hope I am open-minded enough to consider a range of possible solutions that may not necessarily be Big Pharma options.    The only drug solutions Big Pharma and its acolytes are seriously promoting are expensive new drugs, which are under patent protection. There are numerous other approaches, however, for which Big Pharma is muddying the waters, turning scientific matters into issues of politics. Such as the use of hydroxychloroquince (HCQ) , or the importance of supplementation by vitamins C and D and zinc.    These are not easy issues, but Big Pharma has made them more complicated to understand. Should I personally take HCQ? Should you?    Well using the critical thinking skills that Naked Capitalism  has been so good at honing. I say no, at least with respect to me, as every HCQ pill I take comes out of the mouth of someone who needs it for an ailment where it has been proven to work. I asked my friend, Dr. Sarah Borwein, who as regular readers know practices medicine in Hong Kong. and has experience dating back to the SARS epidemic in Beijing. And she told me their Hong Kong infectious disease specialists are counselling no. So I\u2019ve decided no.    Why should you care? Well, only 105 patients have died in Hong Kong. In a densely populated city of 7 million. No typo that. So I think they know something there about treating and preventing the spread of the COVID-19 infection. And they are not recommending use of HCQ at this time.    Isn\u2019t that something you want to know? Now you do! Mind you, I am not claiming they are right.  Only telling you what I have personally concluded. That, my friends, is what is meant by critical thinking.    Beyond trying to debunk the spin of Big Tech and Big Pharma, I intend to continue to ply my regular beats: fast fashion and sustainability; the right to repair, plastics, and the war on waste; significant legal and regulatory developments; and finally, the looming specter of food insecurity, which to date is not getting all the attention I fear it should be receiving. But we have been covering this issue here and will continue to do so.    I hope you\u2019ll dig deep so that NC\u2019s writers can continue to explore and seek out truth, without fear or favour.Allow me another request if you have not done so already,  please visit and drop some money into the Tip Jar , which is to the right, so we can keep the lights on here.    Thanks for paying attention and reading to the end!
