But it's on the hotter seat than usual this week, after Carlos Maza, a Vox journalist,<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/gaywonk/status/1134263774591037441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1134264395717103617%7Ctwgr%5E393039363b636f6e74726f6c&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Ftechnology%2F2019%2F06%2F05%2Fright-wing-youtuber-hurled-racist-homophobic-taunts-gay-reporter-company-did-nothing%2F\"> tweeted </url>that Steven Crowder, a right-wing personality, had directed anti-gay slurs at Maza on his YouTube channel, which inspired a hateful harassment campaign against Maza by many of Crowder's fans. Maza accused YouTube of turning a blind eye to anti-LGBTQ hate on its platforms, while talking a good game about equality. YouTube responded at first by claiming that Crowder had      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/youtube-rules-stephen-crowder-can-harass-voxs-carlos-maza.html?utm_source=nym&amp;utm_medium=f1&amp;utm_campaign=feed-full\"> not violated any of the company's policies </url>, even if his speech was offensive. But amid backlash, it announced today that his channel      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1136341801109843968\"> would be demonetized </url>- though<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> re </emphasis>-monetized if he cleans up his behavior. What do you think of this mealymouthed middle ground of a response?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Madison </emphasis>: Can you change the font size in these chats? I want my LOL to be as big as possible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Ben </emphasis>: Haha.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Madison </emphasis>: This whole thing has played out in a pretty predictable way for Big Tech. YouTube took the gamble and opted for the \"do nothing\" approach, probably hoping that while people would be upset, this whole thing would die down after it replied to Maza telling him Crowder could stay in the name of free speech. But it didn't die down, and the blowback appears to have forced YouTube's hand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Ben </emphasis>: Do you think that letting the videos stay up but demonetizing them is a reasonable reaction? Carlos Maza doesn't - his<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/gaywonk/status/1136342694442217472\"> response to this news </url>was: \"So the fuck what. Basically all political content gets 'demonetized.' Crowder's revenue stream isn't from YouTube ads. It's from selling merch and 'Socialism Is For Fags' shirts to millions of loyal customers, that @YouTube continues to drive to his channel. For free.\"</p><p>Should YouTube have banned Steven Crowder altogether?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Max </emphasis>: I don't know that I feel super prepared to judge the \"reasonableness\" of what YouTube is doing here. Like, the context in which this is taking place - a guy has an audience of millions just for calling a not-particularly-well-known journalist a \"lispy queer\" and tacitly encouraging his harassment - already seems so unreasonable to me! I know that's a bit of a dodge. But I think when we talk about what the \"right\" or \"wrong\" or \"reasonable\" responses are to situations like this with Maza and Crowder it's worth taking a step back and thinking about the whole picture here. This is a more or less unprecedented situation that YouTube itself has created; I don't want to take it as given and suggest that we now proceed with determining how best to adjudicate between an awful bigot and his army of trolls, and a guy who makes explainer videos.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Ben </emphasis>: Is it unprecedented? Is it that different from harassment on any other internet platform?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Max </emphasis>: Well, I suppose I mean unprecedented in the long view. Put another way, I'm wary of offering up solutions that accept as given the way that the megaplatforms have been built and currently operate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Madison </emphasis>: YouTube needs to get a better system for dealing with these instances situationally. This conversation would look different if it hadn't fired off those first four tweets clearing Crowder while it was still, admittedly, investigating things. Seems like it'd have been better off skipping the first three explaining why Crowder wasn't in violation (while also making sure to distance itself and claim that keeping his content up isn't a tacit endorsement) and just saying \"We're still looking into this.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Ben </emphasis>: YouTube certainly mishandled this situation. But, as always with these kinds of situations, there are some probably impossible-to-solve quandaries here. Is it feasible for YouTube to police its millions or billions or whatever of hours of content for everything that rises to a Crowder-level threshold? (Separately today, by the way, YouTube<url normalizedValue=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/youtube-bans-videos-promoting-supremacism-hoax-conspiracies.html?utm_source=nym&amp;utm_medium=f1&amp;utm_campaign=feed-full\"> banned certain genres </url>of hate and conspiracy-theory videos.) Or must we fundamentally rethink everything about these platforms, which I think is what Max is suggesting?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Madison </emphasis>: It's not possible at this scale right now, no. But we didn't get here overnight. So it's going to take rethinking on our part, but also on YouTube's.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Max </emphasis>: Yeah, I agree with that. I'd add that this isn't simply (or even necessarily) a problem of insufficient moderation - one thing that the specter of \"demonetization\" raises (even if it doesn't apply in a big way to Crowder) is that YouTube vloggers are being paid by YouTube through ad partnership programs. It's a bit like if you got free cable, with 10 million channels, and there was a ton of awful, vile stuff among those channels, in addition to ESPN and HBO.</p><p>Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think people would spend an enormous amount of time hand-wringing about Cablevision or the free speech problems of removing 1 of those 10 million channels in that instance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Ben </emphasis>: Who decides what's awful and vile?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Max </emphasis>: I mean, traditionally, the FCC, the cable companies, and the various channels that partner with the cable companies. Because we've sort of conditioned ourselves to understand YouTube as an open platform for expressing views (which, sure, it is, in some ways!), I think we have a hard time remembering that it's much more like a cable company even than something like Facebook.</p><p>That's not a perfect system, obviously, and I'm sympathetic to criticisms of centralized and corporatized media apparatuses. But to me YouTube has pulled off a kind of sleight of hand where it's managed to supplant a bunch of these broadcasters and still, by appealing to our understanding of free speech and open platforms, avoided any of the regulation or responsibility or accountability that they were obligated to. I know that doesn't necessarily give us much guidance on the Maza/Crowder stuff, sorry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Ben </emphasis>: Nah, it's relevant. As you said, I think it's mostly about the way in which we view these platforms, and the promise the internet was supposed to represent. This game of Whac-A-Mole, where stuff gets litigated only if the right people raise a fuss about it, and only after tons of hemming and hawing on the platforms' part, does not feel like the correct way of going about things for anyone. But I'm just trying to imagine what a better alternative would be, and it's hard to do that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Madison </emphasis>: Look, I'm sorry, but it's June and gay rights say I don't have to talk about this anymore.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Max </emphasis>: I think I was going to say that in this case one thing YouTube needs to think about is<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> why </emphasis>it's putting together its rules in the first place. It is really reliant on this empty legalism (like claiming that because Crowder has not explicitly called for harassment, he can't be held responsible), which is why it keeps tying itself in knots on stuff like Crowder. To me, it falls into the rabbit hole of endless literalist interpretation of its own rules because it doesn't know why those rules exist in the first place - it has to follow the letter of the law because the law has no spirit, you might say. (Or really, the law has a \"spirit,\" YouTube just can't admit that the \"spirit\" of the law is \"don't piss off advertisers.\")</p><p>To me, this is ultimately a structural problem: For-profit businesses do not mesh well with liberal rights or deliberative judicial processes. But if YouTube was able to invest its regulations with some values - any values, really! - it might be able to regulate with a surer hand, at the very least.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYMAG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8P-M6C1-DYWJ-M4F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">296337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1264\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New York Magazine Holdings LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New York Magazine</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>steven crowder</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>carlos maza</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>youtube</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Labor &amp; Employment Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Actionable Discrimination</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTVFREQ1RjhGQkU3NDg2MkE2MzM1RTUzQkREMTMzNkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mjc5OTVCOEUxNzU4NDdDNDhCMjBGNkE0REQ1MEFGQjA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN9X</classCode><className>HATE SPEECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000777</classCode><className>GAYS &amp; LESBIANS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp; VIDEO SHARING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp; VIDEO SHARING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

For those of us who can work from home meetings, webinars, job interviews and family gatherings as well as home-schooling via Zoom or Teams or another platform have become part of life - as long as we remember to turn our microphones on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But can you imagine the online world being such a big part of our lives in the era of dial-up internet? However, the prime minister's fabled \"pizza wheel of doom\" isn't entirely consigned to history. So, as he and the chancellor contemplate an economic stimulus package the promised \"shovel-ready\" projects must include investing in even faster broadband and mobile connectivity.</p><p>As a former digital secretary, the ability of the UK to power ahead in digital, data and technology is clear to me. In January I launched our digital strategy: to provide a holistic and unified approach for tech companies, consumers and investors. It covered better connectivity, our approach to online harm regulation, protecting freedom of expression, supporting tech companies to start and scale up in the UK, ensuring they have sufficient talent to recruit as well as working on current and future data protection policy and cross-border data flows.</p><p>It is reported that three of the areas the government is likely to want the UK to focus on in the future are computing, robotics and AI. All require a flow of people with a capacity for innovation and a willingness to be open to the possibilities of technology.</p><p>As our labour market is changed by Covid-19, social distancing measures will mean there will be some jobs and sectors which won't be able to keep the staff they had. An activist government strategy is needed which doesn't allow those staff to be lost to the labour market. There are schemes such as TechUK's Returner Programme or #techmums already leading the way. The government can use their experience of giving confidence to people about their future tech skills to ensure more people are ready for employment in the digital age.</p><p>Today, the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill returns to the House of Lords. The UK has a real opportunity, with great 5G coverage, to set the global pace in the era of the internet of things. It is understandable that some of my fellow parliamentarians have concerns about who is helping to build our 5G network. The government has already made clear it wants more diversity of providers and work is starting on that. However, stalling our progress now by restricting suppliers because of their links to China will not only put a real barrier in the way of 5G opportunities but, closer to home, simply make it harder and slower for leaseholders to get improved broadband. A joint government and private sector approach to building a broader 5G supply chain over the next few years will instead ensure we continue to build our 5G capability in a sustainable way.</p><p>The UK is a world leader in other ways. Our Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation and our Office for Artificial Intelligence ensure that in embracing new technologies we also identify the downsides. Algorithms that bake in bias or data capture which ignores privacy concerns risk undermining advances. And we shouldn't just accept the power and reach of big tech companies without question. The recent NHSX test-and-trace app experience must not mean that we only rely on big tech and its way of doing things. We wouldn't accept that in other industries and technology is no different.</p><p>Stimulating our post-coronavirus economy should include building even faster connectivity, building stronger tech skills and sectors and technology that works for all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-64001220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607K-VKF1-F021-627S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"619\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 29, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

For those of us who can work from home meetings, webinars, job interviews and family gatherings as well as homeschooling via Zoom or Teams or another platform have become part of life - as long as we remember to turn our microphones on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But can you imagine the online world being such a big part of our lives in the era of dial-up internet? However, the prime minister's fabled \"pizza wheel of doom\" isn't entirely consigned to history. So, as he and the chancellor contemplate an economic stimulus package the promised \"shovel-ready\" projects must include investing in even faster broadband and mobile connectivity.</p><p>As a former digital secretary, the ability of the UK to power ahead in digital, data and technology is clear to me. In January I launched our digital strategy: to provide a holistic and unified approach for tech companies, consumers and investors. It covered better connectivity, our approach to online harm regulation, protecting freedom of expression, supporting tech companies to start and scale up in the UK, ensuring they have sufficient talent to recruit as well as working on current and future data protection policy and cross-border data flows.</p><p>It is reported that three of the areas the government is likely to want the UK to focus on in the future are computing, robotics and AI. All require a flow of people with a capacity for innovation and a willingness to be open to the possibilities of technology.</p><p>As our labour market is changed by Covid-19, social distancing measures will mean there will be some jobs and sectors which won't be able to keep the staff they had.</p><p>An activist government strategy is needed which doesn't allow those staff to be lost to the labour market. There are schemes such as TechUK's Returner Programme or #techmums already leading the way. The government can use their experience of giving confidence to people about their future tech skills to ensure more people are ready for employment in the digital age.</p><p>Today, the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill returns to the House of Lords. The UK has a real opportunity, with great 5G coverage, to set the global pace in the era of the internet of things. It is understandable that some of my fellow parliamentarians have concerns about who is helping to build our 5G network. The government has already made clear it wants more diversity of providers and work is starting on that.</p><p>However, stalling our progress now by restricting suppliers because of their links to China will not only put a real barrier in the way of 5G opportunities but, closer to home, simply make it harder and slower for leaseholders to get improved broadband. A joint government and private sector approach to building a broader 5G supply chain over the next few years will instead ensure we continue to build our 5G capability in a sustainable way.</p><p>The UK is a world leader in other ways. Our Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation and our Office for Artificial Intelligence ensure that in embracing new technologies we also identify the downsides. Algorithms that bake in bias or data capture which ignores privacy concerns risk undermining advances. And we shouldn't just accept the power and reach of big tech companies without question. The recent NHSX test-andtrace app experience must not mean that we only rely on big tech and its way of doing things.

They point out that the FCC rules are more nuanced than many give them credit for. Under certain \"forbearance\" clauses, the proposals would not, for example, give the FCC the power to set prices or to require universal service provision.</p><p>The big tech giants such as Google, initially highly supportive of net neutrality, have been less vocal on the issue of late.</p><p>CTIA, a trade organisation representing many of America's biggest telecoms providers, described the proposals as \"heavy-handed and unnecessary\", and said that broadband providers needed \"flexibility\" to continuously manage their networks in the way they saw fit. It added that consumers would pay more in fees and taxes under the FCC's proposals to apply Title ll regulation of the 1934 Communications Act to all internet services.</p><p>David Farber, a professor of computer science and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, who is credited with helping to design parts of the internet, accused the FCC of trying to fix a system that wasn't broken.</p><p>He said that many net-neutrality supporters lacked a sound technical grasp of how service providers managed traffic flow. \"There are services that don't work if they are treated like any other service. It's going to be an issue with applications such as virtual reality or voice services that may require some form or prioritisation,\" he said, adding that the rules would deter investment in internet infrastructure.</p><p>However, Tim Karr, of Free Press, an internet advocacy group, insisted that the regulations were vital. \"Net neutrality was built into the DNA of the internet at its inception . . . it protects us from the power of cable companies to control the flow of content and take decisions away from us,\" he said.</p><p>Although Mr Wheeler's proposals are expected to be passed by the FCC's Democrat-controlled board on February 26 this will by no means be the end of the issue.</p><p>Republicans in Congress have already drawn up alternative proposals, which effectively protect net neutrality in name only, although it is open to question whether they would be capable of passing it in time to head off the FCC, even with control of both houses.</p><p>A more likely scenario is that the lobbyists come out in force, one or more of the big providers moves to sue and the next stop will be the courts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-18316567</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5F74-FBJ1-JCJY-G23X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><timeReceived>1:37 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>February 4, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

My answer: Because we let it happen. In the last twenty years, America has allowed big tech firms in Silicon Valley to become monolith giant monopolies of search, media and commerce. </p><p>And now we don't like it, so we want to break them up? That's not really going to be possible as they provide global reach and links, not just things for the American consumer. So, what to do? I guess my thinking is that there is always something new around the corner. Wikileaks launch a social network to try to solve the Facebook issue. Tik-Tok takes over from Snapchat which took over from Vine. Bing edges with Google, but never wins. There's always competition. No company is unassailable. However, if they gain dominance, they work hard to keep it which is why these firms are so hard to change or overcome. The same could be said of most markets however. Look how long Richard Branson and Virgin Airlines have had a go at British Airways, but BA is still there rocking and rolling. Look how long there's been a battle between Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury and company, but they're still there doing well enough. Look at the big banks and their operations. Most countries have just three or four big banks and then a whole load of little ones. The big banks get bigger. Everything becomes acquired, merged, consolidated over time. How many soft drinks can you name? Coca-cola? Pepsi-Cola? Irn-Bru? The list runs out fast. In fact, Red Bull have done a great job of breaking into this space. In general though, outside the technology markets, the big names stay big, get bigger, get more control and get more backing thanks to lobbying, than any others. It's that last part, the lobbying or, rather, their ability to line the pockets of those who watch them that counts the most. Now, I'm not being a rebel or leftie here, but it's pretty obvious who has control. Just look at the NRA in the USA. Who has control? Not the President. If the President could change gun laws in America, then ti would have been changed by now. Look at the fossil fuel firms. Who has control? Not the governments. That's the reason why the biggest fossil fuel firms spend $40 million a year each just on political lobbying[1]. The same is true of the big tech firms. They learned a lesson from Bill Gates twenty years ago[2]: don't ignore the politicians. I have no idea how much they're paying in lobbying fees, but with $100 billion of tax avoided in the last decade[3], they can afford $1 billion a year to line the politician's pockets. Easy. Oh, and don't forget the big banks. Washington Post[4], April 30 2019: Wall Street banks and other parts of the financial sector spent close to $2 billion on lobbying and campaign contributions in the 2018 election cycle, a 36 percent jump from the last non-presidential campaign year. 'Campaign contributions' and 'lobbying' is just another way of saying 'protection'. Protection from regulation, protection from competition, protection from the law. That's why no banker got jailed when the financial crisis hit in 2008. It's why Boeing's executives are immune from prosecution and why people like Jeffrey Epstein hangs around with Prince Andrew. It's all about the money. It's all about the power. Not that I'm being a rebel or a leftie here, but it's always the case that if you want to find out who really is behind the decision making in any part of the world, just follow the money.

''The No. 1 initiative is to go to common systems,'' Mr. Griffin says.</p><p>In Boeing's commercial aircraft division, the company is embracing wireless systems that allow pilots to radio mechanics on the ground when a plane needs parts; the mechanics can have the parts ready when the plane lands.</p><p>In defense systems, Boeing's goal is to consolidate the communication networks it designed for different branches of the armed services.</p><p>''Everything will be a node on the network-centric environment,'' Mr. Griffin says.</p><p>Translation: Marines in armored tanks will be able to talk to Air Force fighter pilots, Navy ships at sea and Army infantry commanders.</p><p>Exelon Corp.</p><p>Chicago's biggest utility company has two big tech initiatives on tap in 2005. First, it's got to integrate its systems with those of its latest acquisition target, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. of Newark, N.J.</p><p>Next, says Chief Information Officer Dan Hill, Exelon hopes to roll out new Internet services for employees and wireless services for mobile field workers. The company also wants to upgrade the technology behind its power trading.</p><p>Nevertheless, Mr. Hill says he plans to cut Exelon's IT spending by 5% this year.</p><p>The most interesting technology Mr. Hill sees on the horizon: broadband over power line, a high-speed communications system that transmits data over electric wires. Power companies could eventually offer high-speed Internet service to compete with phone and cable services.</p><p>CNA Financial Corp.</p><p>Chief Information Officer John Golden wants every CNA claims adjuster to go entirely wireless by the end of the year-cut loose from their desks by laptops, cell phones and electronic organizers connected to corporate through wireless signals.</p><p>''We are rolling that out this year in earnest,'' he says.</p><p>Nevertheless, Mr. Golden expects CNA to spend 6% less on technology than it did last year, when it laid out an estimated $400 million.</p><p>Mr. Golden also plans to upgrade the company's security systems to keep hackers out of its database, which contains customers' health information.</p><p>But so far, Mr. Golden has been having a tough time finding the right software, a system that will help keep hackers from breaking through the company's network firewalls.</p><p>''We need application security,'' he says.</p><p>CNA also plans to cut down its paperwork by making its recordkeeping entirely electronic.</p><p>Allstate Corp.</p><p>At Chicago's largest insurance company, Chief Technology Officer Catherine Brune oversees an estimated budget of $1.2 billion a year.</p><p>She expects Allstate's IT spending to grow about 4% this year-despite her best efforts to avoid an increase.</p><p>''I'd love to keep it flat,'' Ms. Brune says. ''But I don't know if that will happen.''</p><p>Especially considering that the Northbrook-based insurance company plans to continue a project it started three years ago: consolidating its three data centers into two large ones.</p><p>Besides saving money, the move will give Allstate greater control over its data, a common goal of big-company CIOs grappling with heightened federal requirements for controlling financial information.</p><p>Allstate also plans to upgrade its Web site to make it easier for consumers to file claims and review their billing statements.</p><p>Among her vendors, Ms. Brune sees an interesting trend: They seem to have given up pushing new products in favor of leveraging their existing product lines. ''They want to come in now and work with you to find innovative ways to use products you already have in place,'' she says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Boeing's Scott Griffin plans to hold the line on the IT budget this year as well as cut back on vendors. * Emerging broadband over power line technology (BPL) looks promising to Dan Hill, Exelon's chief information officer. * CNA is rolling out a wireless workplace \"in earnest\", says John Golden, head of infomation technology. * Catherine Brune expects Allstate's technology spending will rise 4% this year, despite her best efforts.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIBUS-A0500020340</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIBUS2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4FGH-RVF0-001M-G1W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8099</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Crain's Chicago Business</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Crain Communications Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>February 7, 2005, Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>BOEING CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0EXELON CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>\u00a0CNA FINANCIAL CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0FORRESTER RESEARCH INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>\u00a0PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>BOE (LSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0BAB (BRU)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0BA (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0EXC (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>\u00a0CNA (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0FORR (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>\u00a0PEG (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

(When Myspace rebooted in 2013, it boasted a library of 52 million songs thanks to deals with labels and uploads from users, according to reports at the time.)</p><p>The news was the latest chapter in the long decline of the once-mighty social media giant. Founded in 2003, a year before Facebook, Myspace boasted about 250 million users in the United States in its heyday. In 2005, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. paid $580 million to buy the site's parent company. </p><p>Around that time, Myspace.com also became the most-visited website in the United States, briefly overtaking Google. But it changed hands two more times in the last decade for a small fraction of that price, as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter and other platforms lured users away.</p><p>Myspace grew to be a formidable force in music hosting, at one point amassing the biggest library in digital music. But it struggled on that front, too, eventually losing ground to other services such as Spotify.</p><p>For those who kept their accounts, the news of the data loss comes as little surprise. They have complained in Reddit discussions and elsewhere about receiving similar messages from the company for more than a year. Over the weekend, the frustration spilled into sight again after a much-cited tweet by Andy Baio, a former chief technology officer of Kickstarter.</p><p>Jordan Tallent is among the Myspace users who has been trying to recover his music. Last summer, Tallent, a 26-year-old audio-video professional in London, reached out to Myspace to ask for help recovering songs that his former post-hardcore/heavy metal band, Where Got Ghost, had uploaded to Myspace.</p><p>A representative of the company told him via email that a 2016 server migration, a transfer of data to a new server, had left some older files irreparably corrupted. But while the recent announcement said that files uploaded before 2016 may have been affected, the representative had told Tallent that only files before 2013 were missing.</p><p>\"If you had a Myspace profile before 2013 certain content that was related to classic Myspace accounts (messages, comments, blogs, videos, etc.) are no longer available for retrieval or download as they were not migrated to our redesigned website that launched in 2013,\" the email read.</p><p>The email noted that Tallent had not used his account since 2014, which the representative said was \"beyond the period we committed to maintain your profile data.\"</p><p>The massive data loss underscores a modern danger: As we increasingly give pieces of our lives over to big tech companies, we lose control of some of our most intimate artifacts.</p><p>\"We're just going to be digital refugees forever, running from site to site losing things as we go, and our family history is going to disappear,\" said Jason Scott, a founder of Archive Team, a loose network of archivists and programmers formed to save data from services at risk of disappearing.</p><p>Failures like the one at Myspace are not just personal catastrophes, Scott said. The information people share on social media can seem mundane, but it contributes to family and community histories.</p><p>\"This is our modern folklore,\" he said.</p><p>Myspace is hardly the first service to lose user data, intentionally or by accident. For example, the photo site Flickr began deleting some user-uploaded photos last month.</p><p>Flickr took great care to prepare its users for the deletion, Scott said, but that was a rare exception. He believes there is only one solution.</p><p>\"Laws, straight-up laws,\" he said. \"Big old, bothersome, 'Oh no, our startup can't have free vodka on Friday because of the extra money we spend on certifications and holding to them' laws.\"</p><p>He and others warn this will be a recurring story, too. \"Someday, this will happen to Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, etc.,\" Cory Doctorow, the author and co-editor of the tech site Boing Boing, wrote in a post. \"Don't trust the platforms to archive your data.\"</p><p>But even those motivated to save their data often face hurdles. Many popular services do not make it easy to extract the photos, videos and messages that they upload.</p><p>The troubles at Myspace began almost as soon as News Corp. scooped up Intermix Media, whose main asset was Myspace, in 2005. Murdoch has conceded that his company \"proceeded to mismanage it in every possible way,\" ultimately selling the company in 2011 to a group of investors that included Justin Timberlake for just $35 million. The company that acquired it, Viant, an ad technology firm, describes the move on its website as being motivated by the consumer data Myspace offered.</p><p>But Myspace would never recover, even as it changed hands, strategies and designs.</p><p>In early 2016, the publisher Time Inc., bought Viant for $87 million. The following year, Meredith Corp., a media conglomerate, announced plans to buy Time. </p><p>In a regulatory filing related to that deal, Time laid out its intellectual property, which it said included consumer data, and email addresses, for about 250 million unique Myspace users in the United States.</p><p>According to data provided by comScore, the media measurement company, the number of unique visitors to Myspace.com has fallen precipitously over the past four years. In February 2015, the website had nearly 29 million unique visitors. This February, it had about 2 million.</p><p>And Myspace may change hands again. After Meredith Corp. acquired Time, Inc., last year, it put Viant up for sale.</p><p>Chokshi writes for The New York Times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0092705298</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP3-CTP1-DY37-F237-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1063\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009QZ8</classCode><className>MYSPACE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp; RELATED SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING &amp; DATA PREPARATION &amp; PROCESSING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

This is your CQ Cyber newsletter for Thursday, Jan. 10, 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOPLINES </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. Shutdown Short-Circuits Cybersecurity: Dozens of U.S. departments and agencies, many of them prime targets for hackers, remain shut down for the third week in a row, and that could leave many of the agencies more vulnerable to cyberattacks, lawmakers and experts worry. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. Ixnay on the Export Controls: The Internet Association, which represents big tech, wants the Commerce Department to consider multinational export controls instead of unilateral U.S. ones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3. Extra for Election Security: House Democrats plan to make a push for another round of appropriations to provide federal grants to states that in turn would use the money to beef up voting systems and election security ahead of the 2020 election. </p><p>4. What, Russians Helped NSA? Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab, the anti-virus and cybersecurity firm that has been banned from selling its products and services to U.S. government agencies, may have helped the National Security Agency in arresting a suspected leaker, according to reports. </p><p>5. Cyber Subway Worries: The Washington D.C. area Metro system is adding cybersecurity requirements to its bid proposals for new railcars, heeding warnings from experts that a Chinese company could win the contract and use the railcars to collect intelligence or disrupt operations. </p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Cybersecurity Efforts May be Hurting as Shutdown Persists</p><p>Lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are worried that the prolonged shutdown of dozens of U.S. departments and agencies could be undermining the security of vital computer networks across the country. </p><p>Government departments and agencies rely on lots of contractor employees to do cybersecurity work, and the shutdown \"significantly degrades the ability of the government function to meet all of the cyber mission requirements,\" Greg Touhill, president of Cyxtera Federal, a government contractor told CQ. Touhill previously served as the first U.S. chief information security officer in 2016. </p><p>Routine functions such as patching vulnerable software and conducting penetration testing are likely being postponed across the dozens of U.S. agencies, Touhill said. </p><p>The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency that is responsible for government-wide cybersecurity, is one of the agencies affected by the shutdown. </p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen last year said: \"Cyberattacks now exceed the danger of physical attacks. ... This has forced us to rethink homeland security.\" Nielsen is now one of the main proponents of the Trump administration's assertion that without a border wall Americans face physical danger from migrants coming across the border. </p><p>Read more from my story here. </p><p>2. Unilateral Export Controls Will Hurt American Companies, Tech Group Warns</p><p>A group of top U.S. technology companies has told the Department of Commerce that if the agency were to regulate exports of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing in a unilateral fashion, it would hurt American technological competitiveness.</p><p>\"Longstanding U.S. government policy has acknowledged that unilateral export controls are far less effective than controls developed through multilateral efforts, such as through the Wassenaar Arrangement,\" the Internet Association, a trade group, said in comments submitted Wednesday to the Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce. \"Unilateral controls would also jeopardize U.S. technological leadership. Accordingly, we urge that BIS not impose any controls unilaterally, and only impose controls if there is a clear path towards agreement by all Wassenaar member countries.\"</p><p>The Wassenaar agreement refers to a group of 41 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and others that coordinate export controls they place on sensitive technologies to countries outside the bloc.</p><p>The Internet Association represents more than 40 different U.S. technology and internet companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, PayPal, Salesforce and others.</p><p>In December, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security announced an advance notice of proposed rule-making that would cover as many as 40 different types of technologies. The move followed the passage of the 2019 Defense authorization act (PL 115-232) that called on the Commerce Department to establish export controls on \"emerging and foundational technologies\" that are critical to U.S. national security.</p><p>Several elements in the field of artificial intelligence such as machine learning, neural networks, speech and voice recognition, as well as video manipulation techniques used in \"Deepfakes,\" could potentially face new controls on exports. The list also includes nanotechnology, synthetic biology, genetic engineering, quantum computing, robotic drones, and microelectronic applications such as smart dust.</p><p>The Internet Association in its comments to the Commerce Department said that many of the technologies that are on the list \"are being developed outside of the U.S., and many U.S.-based companies have already acquired or formed different types of collaborative relationships with non-U.S. counterparts in order to benefit from innovation taking place outside\" the United States.</p><p>Therefore, it will be \"futile and counterproductive to impose broad export controls on many of these technologies,\" the trade group said in its comments.</p><p>The Commerce Department should define emerging technologies in a narrow fashion as ones that would provide the United States with a \"specific and identifiable qualitative military advantage\" and are not available or produced outside the country, the group said.</p><p>The trade group said that the broad basket of technologies that fall under artificial intelligence, including natural language processing, object recognition and game playing, are no longer emerging but are in widespread global use in commercial applications.</p><p>Export controls that are too broad and imposed on widely available technologies would hurt U.S. industry, the trade group said, citing the example of U.S. export controls on commercial satellite technologies imposed in the late 1990s that ultimately led to the rise of commercial satellite makers in China and elsewhere.</p><p>\"This is not an area for trial and error,\" the Internet Association said in its comments. \"It is critical to take a tailored approach from the outset, working in close collaboration with U.S. stakeholders and multilateral export control regimes.\"</p><p>3. House Democrats Plan to Seek More Election-Security Funds </p><p>House Democrats plan to make a renewed push to provide states with a federal grant that would pay for election security measures and new voting machines. Last year Democrats sought but failed to appropriate $250 million in addition to a $380 million one-time grant for such efforts. </p><p>Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., the designated chairman of the House Financial Services Appropriations Subcommittee, said he plans to pursue additional funding for election security measures once the current impasse over government funding is resolved. </p><p>The grant would be administered by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and parceled out to states that in turn would supplement the federal funds with their own money to upgrade voting machines, boost cybersecurity measures, and train election personnel. </p><p>Many states have used the earlier grant money to replace digital-only voting systems with machines that generate a paper backup. The Russian interference in the 2016 election showed that in the absence of a paper backup, states and local jurisdictions may not be able to validate voters' intentions through post-election audits. </p><p>Dozens of voting jurisdictions in the country still have no paper backup systems and rely exclusively on digital voting. </p><p>Read more from CQ's Doug Sword here.  </p><p>4. Kaspersky May Have Helped the NSA Nab Potential Leaker</p><p>Kaspersky Lab, the Russia-based cybersecurity company that has been banned by the U.S. government from selling its services to federal agencies, likely assisted the U.S. National Security Agency in arresting one of its employees who is accused of stealing a large trove of classified material.</p><p>Kaspersky's researchers alerted officials at the NSA about its employee, Harold T. Martin III, who is alleged to have taken 50 terabytes of classified data from the agency and other U.S. government agencies over a two-decade period, according to a report in Politico. </p><p>Martin is alleged to have used an alias and sent messages via Twitter to researchers at Kaspersky, seeking a meeting with the company's founder, Eugene Kaspersky. Those messages were sent just as an anonymous group calling itself Shadow Brokers began dumping highly secretive NSA cyber exploits online in the summer of 2016, Politico reported, citing unnamed sources. </p><p>The leaked NSA tools were later used by hackers tied to North Korea to design the WannaCry ransomware that affected hundreds of thousands of computers around the world in May 2017. The exploits were also used to craft the NotPetya attack that the Trump administration has blamed on Russia. </p><p>Martin was arrested in August 2016 and is set to go to trial in June.</p><p>Separately, in September 2017, the Department of Homeland Security issued a notice to all federal agencies to stop using Kaspersky anti-virus products. Congress passed legislation codifying the decision into law. </p><p>The DHS and the National Defense Authorization Act (PL 115-91) banned federal agencies from using the Kaspersky anti-virus software after it emerged that classified information stored on the home computer of another NSA contractor -- not Martin -- may have been exposed to Russian intelligence because the computer ran the Kaspersky software.</p><p>Kaspersky sued to overturn the law and the DHS decision but lost the case in November. </p><p>Read more from Politico's story here. </p><p>5. China Spying Via D.C. Metro Railcars? </p><p>The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority that operates the area's Metro rail system has decided to add cybersecurity requirements to its bid specifications as it considers buying new railcars, after heeding warnings that a Chinese company could win the contract and use the Metro system to gather intelligence, The Washington Post reported. </p><p>The state-owned China Railway Rolling Stock Corp., considered a strong contender for the Metro contract estimated at about $1 billion, already has won four out of five large U.S. transit car bids since 2014, the Post reported. </p><p>Since no U.S. company makes subway cars, operators of transit systems turn to foreign suppliers, and China could use that opportunity to embed sensors and cameras on board the railcars, not only to collect information on users but even to disrupt the transportation system, experts told the Post.</p><p>The Post story is here.  </p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ's up-to-date daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

Good Thursday morning.  Thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, March 22nd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the east coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm really sorry,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally speaks out over  the company's growing privacy scandal calling it a major breach of trust.   The fallout for the technology sector as Zuckerberg says he is willing to  testify before Congress if necessary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the race to avoid a shutdown, lawmakers have reached a tentative  agreement on a $1.3 trillion spending bill to keep the government running  but do they have the votes?  The very latest as Congress scrambles to pass  the bill before midnight tomorrow night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trade crackdown, President Trump will announce strict tariffs and  restrictions on Chinese imports and China investing.  That's happening  today at noontime; the move sparking concerns over a possible trade war.</p><p>I spoke with the director of the White House national trade council, Peter  Navarro about what's to come.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  This talk  like this I think is irresponsible in some sense because if you look at the  chess board, I think it's clear that all we want is to defend ourselves  against economic aggression.  And I see this as bullish for corporate  America.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets under pressure today, take a look.  Futures indicating  a decline of about 200 points at the start of trading this morning.  Stocks  settled lower yesterday and that momentum is continuing in a big way this  morning.  The Nasdaq is down 80 points right now.</p><p>The Federal Reserve, of course, raised interest rates yesterday for first  time this year under new Chairman Jay Powell.  Markets traded down after  that.  The Dow Industrials closed down 45 points, the S&amp;P was down 5 and  the Nasdaq was down 19.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are lower right now.  Investors are watching and wait for  the Bank of England's decision on interest rates.  That's due in about an  hour from now when we will get you the news as soon as it hits the tape.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances.  Japan was up -- rest of the majors  were lower but Nikkei average was up 1 percent.  Hang Seng in Hong Kong was  down 1 percent.</p><p>Plus, not playing around, the details as Toys R Us begins to liquidate.</p><p>All those stories this morning coming up and joining me to talk all about  it: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle,  rather; and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor  James Freeman.  Great to see you.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Good to be here -- thanks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So much on the table to talk about.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  There's a ton and we've got the China  sanctions release later today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we've got restrictions on investment as well as  tariffs.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, it's both ways, right.  It's trade tariffs and perhaps  prohibitions on their investment in the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Fed raised interest rates yesterday -- no big deal, I  mean 1.75 percent.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  And the Fed thinks the economy can grow faster and they finally  realized that there are people in the economy who can come in to the labor  market.  So these are good things.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  At the same time those smart gentlemen  and ladies down in D.C. are spending that much more money, driving up the  deficit that much more in the face of higher interest rates -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and a Fed that's winding down its balance sheet and will not  stand at the ready to buy the debt that the federal government will be  trying to sell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.  </p><p>We'll coming up this morning, we've got all that on the table.  Senate  Finance Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch.  We'll talk about that coming up.   Also, former presidential candidate, Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee is  here.  Former presidential candidate Herman Cain is joining us.  And the  host of \"VARNEY AND COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighing in as well.</p><p>All that coming up this morning.</p><p>But first, House Republicans have finally unveiled their whopping $1.3  trillion spending bill ahead of the looming government shutdown.  President  Trump endorsed the bill last night.  He tweeted this, \"That $1.6 billion to  start wall on southern border, rest will be forthcoming.  Most importantly  got $700 billion to rebuild our military; $716 billion next year -- most  ever of; had to waste money on Democratic giveaways in order to take care  of military pay increase and new equipment.</p><p>The funding measure needs to make it through the House Rules Committee  before a floor vote.  Some conservative members in the chamber not happy  with this bill -- too much money.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  We continue to fund sanctuary  cities.  We continue to fund Planned Parenthood.  We don't build the wall  but yet we put money in for a tunnel.  The last time I checked, when the  President was campaigning, he wasn't campaigning for a tunnel between New  Jersey and New York.  But I'm not very optimistic that there will be  conservative wins in this.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Arkansas congressman House Budget  Committee chairman, Steve Womack.  Chairman Womack -- thanks so much for  joining us this morning.  </p><p>REP. STEVE WOMACK (R-AR), HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE:  Maria -- it's great to  be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that?  Planned Parenthood, sanctuary cities -- all  of this extra spending has us looking at trillion dollar deficits 10 years  out and beyond -- how do you justify that?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well look, let's first of all understand what we're doing in this  bill and again, this bill is not across the finish line yet but we went  into these negotiations with the express intent of primarily fixing our  military.</p><p>And in order to do that, like any other negotiation, understand that the  other side gets a vote in this thing.  We don't have 60 votes in the  Senate.  So in this four corners negotiation, when you've got members of  the Senate, the minority leader in the senate, the minority leader in the  House and the two majority leaders in the House and Senate on the  Republican side negotiating, they're going to get a vote.</p><p>So in order to beef up the Defense, there were certain things, other  concessions that had to be made and that's just what's going to happen in  negotiation.</p><p>It's a 2,000-page bill.  Members are still sorting through it.  We've got a  short time line that we're being asked to consider this thing, so there's a  lot of activity going on in the nation's capitol today with regard to this  omni-package.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand the need to fund the military and we talk  about that all the time, given the fact that our aging fleet in the Navy  has 50 percent of the planes unable to even fly.  I get all of that.  We're  seeing accidents.</p><p>But did you need to go to that number?  Did you need that much in terms of  military?  Could you have scaled back a bit so that you weren't handcuffed  to put all of this other spending on domestic issues?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well, they wanted dollar for dollar -- Maria.  Remember, the  Democrats expected dollar for dollar and we didn't go dollar for dollar.</p><p>But we took our cues from the leadership in the Pentagon.  Secretary Mattis  was very emphatic as to the numbers that he needed to hit in order to be  able to meet the demands that are created by the threat that is expanding  around the globe.</p><p>And this is not the time for us to be taking a pass on taking care of our  men and women in uniform.  We've got fundamental issues in the Pentagon.   We've got inner (ph) strength (ph) problems.  We've got four structure  problems.  We've got acquisition program problems.</p><p>And we've got an expanding threat around the globe.  It was necessary for  us to take the steps that we've taken in this bill to beef up our military.</p><p>And now, when you do that, you have to make concessions on the other side  and while they didn't get dollar for dollar, there were things in that  bill, there are things in this bill that we'd prefer not to have to do.   But that's what happens when you sit down at the table and have to  negotiate the way we do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman, will you get enough votes for this massive bill?  </p><p>WOMACK:  To be determined.  I'm on the Whip team but I'm not aware of the  Whip count last night.  I know there will be a lot of undecided voters or  undecided members.  We have a 2,000-page bill to sort through.  We know  pretty much what's in it from a numbers perspective but what we don't know  are some of the other things that have been added onto this bill that are  unrelated to the spending provision.</p><p>So that's what members will be going through today to try to figure out  exactly what else is in the bill and whether they can muster, you know, the  votes necessary to be able to put it across the finish line.  We still have  to go through the rule process and there might be some concerns about  whether we can even pass the rule.  But sometime today we'll have that in  clarity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is there a plan to face off against trillion dollar  deficits?  When does that become a priority?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well look, part of what we've got to do in order to be able to fix  the fiscal glide path of this country, we've taken some steps already.  We  worked on the tax code by lowering tax rates.  We think that's part and  parcel to try to grow this economy because you're going to have to grow the  economy to be able to fix -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WOMACK:  -- the deficits and the debt as we know them today.</p><p>We've gone after a lot of the over-regulation that happened in the last  several years.  We're beginning to take steps to be able to rid the private  sector of a lot of this over-regulation.  But growing this economy has to  be a central focal point; a growth model is what's going to fix what ails  this country right now.  So cutting taxes is doing that, cutting  regulations.</p><p>And then we eventually are going to have to deal with the elephant in the  room and that is the mandatory side of spending, about 70 percent of  federal dollars go out to programs that are on auto pilot.  And I believe  you will see this Congress and the next Congress pivot quickly to doing  things that go right to the heart of what's driving the deficits and the  debt in this country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I'm saying.</p><p>WOMACK:  And that's on the mandatory side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I'm saying, sir.  I mean at some point it has to  become a priority.  But now what I hear being talked about is not that, but  phase two of the tax cuts.</p><p>Here's Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy with me yesterday when I asked him  about that, the next step in tax reform.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  I want to see the  individuals made permanent.  But like any big bill when you go through it,  there are going to be other aspects that you didn't think about.  Let's see  where we need to go there.  Let's see how this bill has transferred and  changed the economy.</p><p>Is there places we missed?  Let's listen to the economy and let's go back  and analyze that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, Mr. Chairman?  What do you want to see in  terms of phase two in the tax cuts?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well, certainly we'd like to make the individual cuts permanent.   And there's no question about that.  I mean that's just part of giving  certainty to the economy and certainty to American households. </p><p>But it's still I think a bit early for us to be able to with clarity  understand exactly what this Tax Cut and Jobs Act proposal and law has  actually done.  I think it will take us for the rest of the year to figure  out exactly how it's going to impact businesses, impact families.</p><p>And so if there are tweaks that need to be made, we're all in about that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let ask you -- </p><p>WOMACK:  There was a tweak that we took care of yesterday or at least in  the announcement with the grain farmers.  So we're going to find out a  little bit more about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as we move through the  year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- I want to ask you about Facebook but before I  get to that, I want to read you Governor Mike Huckabee's tweet.  He's  tweeting that he's going to be on this program.  We're going to talk to him  in a few minutes after you.</p><p>He says \"I will be on @MariaBartiromo and will let loose on GOP for  collapsing and surrendering to Pelosi and Schumer on a disgusting spending  bill.  It's not a compromise, it's capitulation.  To borrow a phrase from  Nancy Reagan, \"Just say no\".  What do you want to say to Mike Huckabee?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well look, Mike Huckabee's a great friend of mine.  I was a mayor  in the town of Arkansas when he was my governor.  He was my commander in  chief.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But he says the bill is disgusting.</p><p>WOMACK:  He can say it's disgusting.  And that's easy to say from the  outside looking in.  But as I said before, I believe strongly that we have  a mandate to provide for the security of this country.  And in order to be  able to get the gains that we did for the Pentagon and for the national  security apparatus, there were concessions that had to be made.</p><p>That's going to happen in any negotiation.  You can call it disgusting all  day long.  And there are things in this bill that I would prefer not to  have to vote for.  That's why we're sorting through it today to figure out  are there any other issues that have popped up in this bill that will make  it distasteful enough that we can't support it.</p><p>And look, we've got until tomorrow to fix it.  If not, we'll be looking at  a short-term CR and back to the negotiating table.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- what about Facebook and what we have seen.   These companies are more powerful than they ever have been.</p><p>Zuckerberg -- Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook broke his silence yesterday  on the data mining scandal that affected more than 50 million users in a  new interview.  He hinted of regulation and he said that he's willing to  testify.  Here's what he said, sir.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  We need to make sure there aren't any  other Cambridge Analyticas out there, right; or folks who have improperly  accessed data.  So we're going to go now and investigate every app that has  access to a large amount of information.  </p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Will you testify before Congress?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  So the short answer is I'm happy to if it's the right thing to  do.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of legislation would you like to see or not see?   Tell me what you're thinking in terms of new regulation coming on  technology.  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well, as somebody who pushes back against a lot of federal  regulation because I think we he have a lot of it already, I think where it  concerns the privacy of people, particularly given Internet and the expanse  of the worldwide web and all of the potential problems associated with the  stealing of intellectual property and the stealing of personal identity --  those kinds of things, that Congress does have a role in this and Congress  must address at a minimum issues that protect the privacy of everyday  citizens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So in other words, we will see new regulation, you think?  </p><p>WOMACK:  I think you're going to see some regulation.  You're going to see  hearings here in Washington and you're obviously going to have a regulatory  response to it for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  This from people who don't want to see big government but  there's clearly an issue here.  </p><p>WOMACK:  Yes.  But you have to understand that even though people push back  against regulations in general, that doesn't mean we're a no-regulation  type body.  We just feel like they've got to be smart regulations and I  think that Congress will get there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks very  much.</p><p>WOMACK:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching -- </p><p>WOMACK:  All the best.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the developments today.  Chairman Womack there.</p><p>Still ahead -- stoking fears of a trade war, President Trump set to  announce up to $60 billion in stiff tariffs on Chinese imports and  restrictions on Chinese investments.  What White House Trade Council  director Peter Navarro had to say about the concerns of retaliation.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're looking at markets right now.  Markets are expected to open down.   We're expecting a 200-point selloff right out of the gate this morning,  extending yesterday's losses after the Federal Reserve raised interest  rates yesterday by a quarter of a point.</p><p>Meanwhile the Trump administration set to announce punitive measures  against China today for the country's unfair trade practices.  We're  expecting tariffs as well as restrictions on investment.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details right now and headlines -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we are -- Maria.</p><p>And these measures are expected to include those restrictions on China's  investments and pretty steep tariffs on Chinese goods.  China has been  accused of violating intellectual property rights, pressuring U.S.  companies to transfer our technology and our trade secrets.  The White  House National Trade Council director Peter Navarro -- on this show a bit  ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAVARRO:  It's an historic day.  This is a fundamental shift in American  policy towards China after literally decades of economic dialogue.  And you  know, talk is not cheap with the Chinese.

Liquidation sales at  Toys R Us, they are set to begin today at most of the company's 700  bankrupt stores.  Shoppers are looking for bargains.  They're being advised  to act fast because the popular toys are expected to sell out pretty  quickly.  The company is hoping inventory is cleared by June.  Toys R Us,  as you know, fell victim to competition from online retailers but also the  discount chains and the debt from a leveraged buyout years ago -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.

This decision marks another  step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy  accommodation, a process that has been under way for several years now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell after the Fed's  move to raise interest rates yesterday, first move this year.  Markets  under pressure this morning on the heels of that after being weaker  yesterday as well; not a significant move yesterday but nonetheless on the  downside.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that Nuveen Asset Management chief  equity strategist, senior portfolio manager Bob Doll.  Bob -- good to see  you.  </p><p>BOB DOLL, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST, NUVEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Thank you --  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You were expecting an interest rate hike.  </p><p>DOLL:  Absolutely -- like everybody else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this market -- you're not a fan?  What?  </p><p>DOLL:  Neutral.  I think we're in a trading range.  We're going to flop  around here.  Maybe the high in 2875 in January and the low 2532 and the  correction -- that could be the measure we have for months to come.  We're  just going to bounce around.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  So if you're an investor and you're watching the show, you want  to be a little defensive in a market like this, what do you rotate into  right now?  </p><p>DOLL:  Higher quality.  Just make sure the companies you own have decent  balance sheets and have decent earnings and are not overly priced because  valuation matters as interest rates and inflation creep higher.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Bob -- the Fed was saying yesterday essentially that they think  the economy can grow a little more over the next year, a little faster than  they thought it could.  But they still have a very pessimistic long-term  view that we're kind of stuck in the new normal below 2 percent.  Do you  think they're wrong about that?  </p><p>DOLL:  I hope they're wrong about that.  And look, this tax bill doesn't  solve all our problems but for the first time the tax bill we got a couple  of months ago gives us a chance to get productivity moving.</p><p>We've been stuck at 1 percent productivity.  If we can get some intelligent  capital expenditures, which this bill promotes, we can get productivity  back toward 2 and then we have a higher growth rate than they're looking  at, in my opinion.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about headline risk and regulation risk?  Deregulation has  been a critical theme for this economy from the Trump administration over  the last more than a year.  But you see what's going on with Facebook, just  irresponsible management with really some systemic problems at that company  that investors are just noticing.</p><p>In a market like this which looks a little bit rich, are some stocks more  at risk of these kind of negative headlines?  </p><p>DOLL:  That's absolutely true.  We've been in an environment, thankfully,  where we haven't had to worry about regulation because there have been no  new ones and some of the old ones haven't been enforced, if you will.</p><p>But now we're in a position, Facebook is a good example, where we're going  to have to take a look.  And that will cast a bit of a gray cloud over  those kinds of companies and perhaps the market as a whole.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tech stocks?  </p><p>DOLL:  The big tech stocks that have grown like a weed and aren't domiciled  anywhere and don't pay taxes anywhere, this is a place where the government  is going to look.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you allocate capital then right now?  </p><p>DOLL:  So in my view you de-emphasize some of those stocks.  You can still  own tech but you own Mastercard and Visa and Cisco on the value side.  You  be a little more value-oriented in tech.</p><p>I think you still have to own some financials, Maria.  I wouldn't give up  on the consumer, selected places are still good as a result of the tax bill  we talked about.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you worried about trade?  </p><p>DOLL:  You have to be worried about trade.  When you put -- a tariff is a  tax.  Look, I'm -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DOLL:  -- period, period, period.</p><p>Now, I know we've got to find a way to go after China because they don't  play by the right rules.  Everybody sees that, even the free traders.  So  we've got to find out a way to do that.  So, you know, we started with a  tariff on steel and aluminum for everybody.</p><p>Wait a minute, Mexico and Canada, you're our friends.  We won't go there,  maybe not Europe.  Maybe this will get down to China.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's how I see it.  I talk about Facebook -- that  potential regulation.  I see these tariffs and now companies have to ask  for exemptions or even countries.  That's additional regulation.  You're  putting up hurdles and who does that hurt?  It hurts small business.  This  is something that President Trump knows.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, even those countries that will be exempt, there  will be quotas in place.  So you will say ok, Canada, you're exempt from  the tariffs but here's the amount of product we will take in terms of  imports.  There will be quotas instituted.  They don't want over-capacity.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And some of those countries are also talking about taxing those  tech companies in Europe as well.  So that's a headline that dovetails with  what Dagen had to say.  I agree with that.  So that's a little -- another  little gray cloud over there that we didn't have before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bob -- great to see you.</p><p>DOLL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Bob Doll there.  </p><p>Coming up, new scrutiny over self-driving cars, the very latest as police  release a dash-cam video of that deadly crash involving one of Uber's  autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Then, behind the mask, comedian Jim Carrey showing his true colors with a  controversial painting believed to be White House press secretary Sarah  Huckabee Sanders.

Thanks for joining us everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it  is Thursday, March 22nd.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the  east coast.  Fears of a trade war sparking worries on Wall Street this  morning.  Ahead of the President's announcement on China tariffs and  restrictions to investment here in the U.S.  Futures indicating a decline  of almost 200 points this morning, down 3/4 of a percent.  </p><p>This after modest losses yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised  interest rates for the first time this year.  As you can see, yesterday's  close was down fractional across the board.  Markets across the globe  mixed.  FTSE 100 down 3/4 of a percent.  The CAC (inaudible) and the DAX  index goes down better than 1 percent.  We did have some manufacturing data  out.  The Flash Purchasing Management Index out of Europe and that is one  of the reasons that markets turned lower and the losses are accelerating  this morning.  </p><p>Also Japan Flash Manufacturing also under pressure.  Asia over night as you  can see also weaker although the NIKKEI average reported economic data came  out was up about 1 percent.  A new twist in the firing of Andrew McCabe.   Reports say that the former FBI Deputy Director authorized an investigation  into Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury.  Plus the  subpoena loans the House Judiciary Committee set to demand documents on the  Hilary Clinton email investigation as you hear her first.  We have the very  latest there.  New developments in the Uber self-driving crash  investigation.  Police releasing new video showing the moments just before  the collision. </p><p>And Jim Carrey not quite Picasso.  The actor turned painter under fire over  his portrait of a woman who looks very similar to White House Press  Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  An unbelievable moment in Kosovo's  parliament.  The opposition party sets off tear gas to disrupt the vote.   Ralph Macchio is returning.  The original Karate Kid making his comeback in  a new YouTube series.  All that coming up this morning.  But first, the  aspired FBI official Andrew McCabe reported oversaw a Federal criminal  probe of Attorney General Jeff Sessions according to ABC News.  </p><p>McCabe reportedly authorized an investigation into whether the Attorney  General lacked candor during his Congressional testimony last year about  contact with Russian operatives.  Sessions long time personal lawyer  responded in a statement which reads, \"The Special Counsel's Office has  informed me that after interviewing the Attorney General and conducting an  additional investigation.  The Attorney General is not under investigation  for false statements or perjury in his confirmation hearing testimony and  related written submissions to Congress.\"  </p><p>Joining us now is former presidential candidate from Arkansas Governor Mike  Huckabee.  Governor Huckabee, I find this really rich.  I mean, you know,  here's a guy who basically in spying on Michael Flynn and then releasing  that to the press committed perjury right there.  And - - and that is a  felony for - - for what he did and he also lacked candor himself and  apparently he was investigating Sessions.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  There's a statement Maria, something about karma being, gee I  can't remember the rest of the phrase.  But I would say that it applies  here.  It's just remarkable.  I - - I think it's fine that he wanted to  take a look to see was Jeff Sessions dishonest.  But for all the people who  are just crying big crocodile tears because Andrew McCabe got fired, my  gosh get over it.  Andrew McCabe deserved to be fired according the Office  of Professional Responsibility.  It wasn't Donald Trump who fired him.  It  was his own FBI organization who said he had to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And why should he get a pension.  If he violated the basic  fundamental code of ethics that he supposedly clearly understood.</p><p>BARITROMO:  Yes.  I mean - - we - - we want to move on to the spending and  your tweet earlier.  But - - but I find it really incredible that there are  1.2 million documents that the House Oversight and House Judiciary  Committees have requested from the FBI and they've only sent 3,000  documents, 3,000 documents.  That's why they are subpoenaing those  documents this week.  But, how does that happen?  How do you blow off and  stonewall the committees that have jurisdiction over you for so long?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well that's part of the problem when there's so much power that  has been accumulated at the top of the FBI.  And I think everybody tries to  make the point, this isn't about the rank and file.  This isn't about the  organization but this is about the leadership and the corruption that has  so permeated that organization that they think they have the right to slow  walk getting documents over to the Oversight committee.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That they are constitutionally required to be accountable for.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's absurd and I'm glad Bob Goodlatte is saying, here's a  subpoena.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Cough up - - cough up the stuff. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, by the way, Jason Chavitz tried that too and they - - they  - - he didn't get anywhere either.  He - - he - - remember when he  interrupted a meeting and said you are served.  But anyway, let me switch  gears because Arkansas Congressman and House Budget Committee Chairman  Steve Womack responded to your tweet.  Your tweet called out Republicans  about the Federal spending bill and you - - you called it a disgusting  bill.  Just say no to Pelosi.  Here's what he said earlier right here on  the program.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They needed to make concessions to pay for the military  governor.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well look, Steve is a good friend and I love him.  He's a great  Congressman but I'm going to just say this.  Not one Republican in that  body got elected to fund Planned Parenthood, not fund the Border Wall, give  up for sanctuary cities, trash the 2nd Amendment.  They were elected to go  and do a job that stopped that kind of funding but it did fund the  military.  So lay it on the table and tell the Democrats.  We're going to  fund the military but we're not going to fund some of your pet projects and  you can either be the ones that keep us from having a strong military or  you can join us.  And if you think that we're wrong than you go get elected  to the majorities.  </p><p>These guys have got to start learning to play some hardball.  They have  surrendered to Schumer and Pelosi and to a minority, and there is just no  excuse for just giving up this quickly.  And if the government has to  shutdown in order to push that point, then maybe that's what has to happen  and lay it around the necks of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Democrats  who think that killing unborn children is more important than being able to  preserve the boarders and the security of the United States of America.   That's what's at stake and it's time for them to stand up and do what they  sent them there to do and if they can't, get some more people and let them  have a shot at it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Governor, Mitch Roschelle.  One of the things when I talk to  business leaders I hear a lot of this fear about the mid-term elections and  how that could shift policy for the balance of this Administration's first  term.  How could this budget issue play out in the mid-terms and be used as  sort of fodder for beating up some Republican candidates?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I - - I'll be very blunt.  If the Republicans surrender on this  bill and spend that kind of money on stuff that Republicans find immoral  and just absolutely unacceptable, then Republicans will lose.  They will  deserve to lose.  We're going to have a lousy government under Democrats  when Pelosi goes back in as Speaker.  But it won't be the fault of the  President and it won't be the fault of rank and file Republicans.  It will  be the fault of this Congress for not having the courage to stand up to  these guys and say, we got elected.  Why don't they just say what Obama  did.  Elections have consequences and roll that tape over and over and over  again.  Because I'll guarantee you the Democrats certainly didn't  compromise with Republicans when they had the whole show.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Governor, you make some good points on policies that Washington  shouldn't be funding.  But isn't the big problem here also the overall  level of spending?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Of course it is.  Yes, James it is.  And I think that's another  issue that Republicans went to Congress to cut this runaway spending.  The  - - the - - scenarios where Republicans are willing to spend.  We're  willing to spend to build a border wall, willing to fund the military but  we're not willing to just say let's have a grab bag and everybody gets to  throw in what they want.  $1.3 trillion is - - is way beyond what is should  be and the Republicans act like they don't have a choice.  </p><p>And they're wringing their hands and they're sweating blood.  Well it's  time for them to stand up and say, nope.  Again, we got elected - - we got  elected to do some specific things, here are the specific things and if you  don't want to vote for it we're going to tell the whole country that you  thought that killing unborn babies and running up a huge deficit was more  important to you than making sure that we had security and border  protection.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, let me switch gears, ask you about this crazy photo.   Look, I know that as a father you're incredibly proud of Sarah, your  daughter.  She has to deal with constant everyday pushback from skeptics.   Jim Carrey painted this.  He - - the black lash is incredible after posting  this photo.  It's believed to be Sarah - - Sarah Huckabee Sanders, your  daughter.  Last week he tweeted out this picture with a caption that reads,  this is the portrait of a so-called Christian who's only purpose in life is  to lie for the wicked monstrous.  So, the actor has drawn pictures  criticizing President Trump as well.  What do you say governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well first of all I think as far as his political leanings,  we're going to just mark him down as undecided.  He just hasn't been that  clear where he stands. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But if he wants to paint some ridiculous looking cartoons,  that's what political cartoonists do.  That's one thing.  I - - I'm not as  so much offended by that.  I think it's unfair and unflattering but my  daughter's a beautiful person inside and out.  Here's what I find and take  offense to.  It is the fact that he calls her a so-called Christian and  accusing her of lies without listing what those lies are.  And - - and to  question someone's faith, you don't hear him talk about a so-called Muslim  or a so-called Jew or a so-called Buddhist.  I think it's just something  that the left takes in vogue as to be able to attack people of the  Christian faith and somehow believe that they become judge and jury as if  they are the Father, Son and Holy Ghost when it comes to determining the  authenticity of a person's faith.  That's what I find most offensive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So rude, offensive.  You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  He doesn't know her faith.  That's offensive. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And - - now I'll just add one thing.  These people on the left,  these spew.  They spew hate at me all day long.  If they spent a little  more time trying to get HRC elected, they wouldn't be so doggone angry.   Again, it's asymmetric rage.  Angry at something, angry at something in a  way that doesn't even make any sense.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's all - - that's all they do is shame people and name  call.  It's - - it's - - it's not even a fair fight.  It's - - it's nothing  of substance.  It's just name calling, painting a picture of someone. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  To be fair though, people - - ardent Trump supporters who are  100 percent on board with everything the President does like tariffs.  I've  gotten as much hate from Trump supporters when I talk about tariffs being a  tax.  So I think everybody needs to check their soul.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The governor's daughter is earning all the right enemies here. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well said.  Sometimes you're known by your friends.  Sometimes  you're known by your enemies  And I think, you know, if - - if those are  her enemies than she's in very good shape.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Governor, good to see you sir.  Thanks so  much.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thanks a bunch.  Good to be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee there.  Coming up a vote takes a violent turn in  Kosovo.  Look at this, the chaos after a tear gas grenade is set off in the  middle of the tense debate.</p><p>Welcome back.  Police releasing a disturbing video from last Sunday's  accident when an Uber self driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in  Tempe - - in Tempe, Arizona.  Lauren Simonetti with the details.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hello Maria.  This is video we want to warn you that is pretty  tough to watch.  It shows the safety driver, the minder not looking at the  road in the final moments before he hit - - hit a 49 year old Elaine  Herzberg.  This is believed to be the first fatal crash that involves the  self-driving vehicle and a pedestrian.  Uber has suspended testing of it's  self-driving vehicles.  Toyota has also halted it's tests on - - on public  roads.  But it begs the question, if you're minding the vehicle, do you  have to pay attention at all times even though it's autonomous?  </p><p>All right, take a look at this one.  Some opposition lawmakers in Kosovo  firing tear gas in the parliament chamber.  They wanted to block a vote on  a border deal with Montenegro.  Despite this attack, the - - the measure  was approved in an 80 to 11 vote.  The border deal is set as a pre- condition by the European Union for Kosovo citizens to travel within it's  visa free zone.  So that's what some opposition leaders did there.  And  let's have - - let's lighten if up.  Thirty-four years since Daniel LaRusso  learned to wax on, wax off and his rivalry with Johnny Lawrence lives on in  the YouTube Red series Cobra Kai.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  This is my childhood.  YouTube releasing a trailer for the new  series in which Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprise their roles.  It's  a show that premieres on May 2nd.   (inaudible) takes place in a car  dealership, in the future.  I love it.  Thank you.</p><p>(ROSCHELLE):  Yes baby.  Come on. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I knew you were going to say that. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, bidding like it is 1999.  Your chance to buy a piece  of Prince and other music legends.  A first hand look at the iconic items  hitting the auction block next.</p><p>From Michael Jackson to Elvis Presley and Prince, iconic celebrity items  are coming to the auction block this weekend at GWS Auctions, Legends of  Hollywood and Music Auction.  We have some of the big items right here on  set.  And here joining me to tell us all about it is - - is Brigitte Kruse.   She is owner and chief auctioneer of GWS Auction in Los Angeles.  Brigitte,  good to see you.</p><p>KRUSE:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  I love that you - - that you  brought all this stuff.  We're going to go through it.  How did you get  into this auction business?</p><p>KRUSE:  You know what?  It was a family business.  I'm actually 5th  generation so I don't think I had much choice to get into this business.   It's - - it's a labor of love.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, you must love it.  Because you've got all of  these beautiful things and you - - what - - what moves the price in terms  of some of these items?</p><p>KRUSE:  That is a great question.  It's mostly trends, what's popular,  what's not.  You know, you just kind of have to follow it.  It changes from  time to time.  And then there's things, there's certain asset categories  that just are timeless and always are popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes they sure are.  So let's start with the Prince.  The purple  overcoat used by the late Prince during the filming of \"Purple Rain\".  Tell  us about this item. </p><p>KRUSE:  This piece actually came from the daughter-in-law of one of the set  designers from \"Purple Rain\".  And with it being such an iconic film for  that time, you know, I believe it grossed over $80 million in 1984 which  was unheard of.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KRUSE:  So, you know, with the lace detail and little pearl inserts, it's  just a lovely piece.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KRUSE:  We're really excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think this will go for?</p><p>KRUSE:  You know what, we're predicting somewhere conservatively in the  $3,500 to $5,000 range.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  OK.  And - - and when people buy these items, they do  it to collect and put them somewhere where they will just save them and  cherish them and make sure that the value stays.  You're not going to like  wear it.</p><p>KRUSE:  Definitely.  And that's something that we do that's just a little  bit different.  We actually make sure that these pieces are perfect by the  time they get to the bidder's hands.  So if we have a successful bidder, we  want to make sure that they receive the most pristine asset possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's look at this one.  One of the rare left-handed version of  Michael Jackson's trademark glove.  Tell me about that one.</p><p>KRUSE:  So, this is what they consider the second generation Michael  Jackson glove.  There is the Bill Witten (ph) glove who is, you know, he is  infamous for helping Michael Jackson create the first generation.  And this  is the Michael Bush-Dennis Tompkins era, which is kind of the second  generation glove.  So this was more during the time, right when he married  Lisa Marie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  And then the other one that we wanted to see, Michael  Jackson item is the fedora owned by the King of Pop.  Tell me about that  one.</p><p>KRUSE:  Oh yes.  He made an empire out of fedoras.  So - - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're both his?</p><p>KRUSE:  Yes.  They're both his.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Go ahead.</p><p>KRUSE:  And the neat story with these is there was a gentleman who made a  donation by way of an art piece to one of Michael Jackson's charitable  foundations.  And in - - in time he gave them three fedoras.  So these are  two of those three fedoras and they actually are - - they have great  providence.  They come with a letter of authenticity from MJJ Productions  which is as solid as it gets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So cool.  And this bid starts at $500.</p><p>KRUSE:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So let's go through this one, speaking of kings.   You have an Army book owned and autographed by Elvis Presley himself.  </p><p>KRUSE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KRUSE:  This is one of my favorite items because at the time, in 1958 when  he went to Germany, a lot of people think that that was kind of a turning  point for his career.  Because they say that he never quite came back the  same.  But what makes this piece so special is this was when he met  Priscilla over in Germany when he was stationed there.  And this Army book  actually belonged to someone who served with him and he got so excited when  he saw him, will you please sign it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How fantastic.</p><p>KRUSE:  And it's - - it's never been offered at auction before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do you think that starts at?</p><p>KRUSE:  You know what, the bid is currently at $3,300 and I'm going to tell  you.  I am surprised by that.  So, you know, I think we might end up in the  $5,000 range by the time we have auction (inaudible).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an interesting item.  That's - - that's history right  there. </p><p>KRUSE:  It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The blue fir smock worn by Lady Gaga on American Horror Story.   This is just fabulous.</p><p>KRUSE:  It is actually what we call a bi-lateral celebrity piece.  Because  it was also worn by Halle Barry in \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\", the Frankie  Limon story. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KRUSE:  So, this has got a really cool back story.  And this came from one  of our wardrobe houses in Hollywood.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So where - - where - - where - - why do you have it?  I mean,  after - - after those two celebrities wore it?</p><p>KRUSE:  A lot of these places have to do asset management.  You know, they  have to take care of these assets, get them in, get them out after they've  been used so many times.  So we were just fortunate enough to be the one in  line.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick.  The big pair of sunglasses owned by the late Steve  McQueen. </p><p>KRUSE:  Yes.  Oh my gosh, the Versoles (ph).  I mean, he was known for the  folding sunglasses.  So we're excited about those and the bid is already  over $5,000.  So - - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.  Brigitte, thank you.  The auction begins - - </p><p>KRUSE:  On Saturday, 10 a.m. Pacific. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be checking it out.  Thanks so much.    </p><p>KRUSE:  Thank you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brigitte Kruse.  We'll be right back.

Good Thursday morning.  Thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, March 22nd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the east coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm really sorry,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally speaks out over  the company's growing privacy scandal calling it a major breach of trust.   The fallout for the technology sector as Zuckerberg says he is willing to  testify before Congress if necessary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the race to avoid a shutdown, lawmakers have reached a tentative  agreement on a $1.3 trillion spending bill to keep the government running  but do they have the votes?  The very latest as Congress scrambles to pass  the bill before midnight tomorrow night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trade crackdown, President Trump will announce strict tariffs and  restrictions on Chinese imports and China investing.  That's happening  today at noontime; the move sparking concerns over a possible trade war.</p><p>I spoke with the director of the White House national trade council, Peter  Navarro about what's to come.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  This talk  like this I think is irresponsible in some sense because if you look at the  chess board, I think it's clear that all we want is to defend ourselves  against economic aggression.  And I see this as bullish for corporate  America.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets under pressure today, take a look.  Futures indicating  a decline of about 200 points at the start of trading this morning.  Stocks  settled lower yesterday and that momentum is continuing in a big way this  morning.  The Nasdaq is down 80 points right now.</p><p>The Federal Reserve, of course, raised interest rates yesterday for first  time this year under new Chairman Jay Powell.  Markets traded down after  that.  The Dow Industrials closed down 45 points, the S&amp;P was down 5 and  the Nasdaq was down 19.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are lower right now.  Investors are watching and wait for  the Bank of England's decision on interest rates.  That's due in about an  hour from now when we will get you the news as soon as it hits the tape.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances.  Japan was up -- rest of the majors  were lower but Nikkei average was up 1 percent.  Hang Seng in Hong Kong was  down 1 percent.</p><p>Plus, not playing around, the details as Toys R Us begins to liquidate.</p><p>All those stories this morning coming up and joining me to talk all about  it: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle,  rather; and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor  James Freeman.  Great to see you.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Good to be here -- thanks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So much on the table to talk about.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  There's a ton and we've got the China  sanctions release later today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we've got restrictions on investment as well as  tariffs.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, it's both ways, right.  It's trade tariffs and perhaps  prohibitions on their investment in the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Fed raised interest rates yesterday -- no big deal, I  mean 1.75 percent.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  And the Fed thinks the economy can grow faster and they finally  realized that there are people in the economy who can come in to the labor  market.  So these are good things.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  At the same time those smart gentlemen  and ladies down in D.C. are spending that much more money, driving up the  deficit that much more in the face of higher interest rates -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and a Fed that's winding down its balance sheet and will not  stand at the ready to buy the debt that the federal government will be  trying to sell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.  </p><p>We'll coming up this morning, we've got all that on the table.  Senate  Finance Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch.  We'll talk about that coming up.   Also, former presidential candidate, Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee is  here.  Former presidential candidate Herman Cain is joining us.  And the  host of \"VARNEY AND COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighing in as well.</p><p>All that coming up this morning.</p><p>But first, House Republicans have finally unveiled their whopping $1.3  trillion spending bill ahead of the looming government shutdown.  President  Trump endorsed the bill last night.  He tweeted this, \"That $1.6 billion to  start wall on southern border, rest will be forthcoming.  Most importantly  got $700 billion to rebuild our military; $716 billion next year -- most  ever of; had to waste money on Democratic giveaways in order to take care  of military pay increase and new equipment.</p><p>The funding measure needs to make it through the House Rules Committee  before a floor vote.  Some conservative members in the chamber not happy  with this bill -- too much money.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  We continue to fund sanctuary  cities.  We continue to fund Planned Parenthood.  We don't build the wall  but yet we put money in for a tunnel.  The last time I checked, when the  President was campaigning, he wasn't campaigning for a tunnel between New  Jersey and New York.  But I'm not very optimistic that there will be  conservative wins in this.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Arkansas congressman House Budget  Committee chairman, Steve Womack.  Chairman Womack -- thanks so much for  joining us this morning.  </p><p>REP. STEVE WOMACK (R-AR), HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE:  Maria -- it's great to  be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that?  Planned Parenthood, sanctuary cities -- all  of this extra spending has us looking at trillion dollar deficits 10 years  out and beyond -- how do you justify that?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well look, let's first of all understand what we're doing in this  bill and again, this bill is not across the finish line yet but we went  into these negotiations with the express intent of primarily fixing our  military.</p><p>And in order to do that, like any other negotiation, understand that the  other side gets a vote in this thing.  We don't have 60 votes in the  Senate.  So in this four corners negotiation, when you've got members of  the Senate, the minority leader in the senate, the minority leader in the  House and the two majority leaders in the House and Senate on the  Republican side negotiating, they're going to get a vote.</p><p>So in order to beef up the Defense, there were certain things, other  concessions that had to be made and that's just what's going to happen in  negotiation.</p><p>It's a 2,000-page bill.  Members are still sorting through it.  We've got a  short time line that we're being asked to consider this thing, so there's a  lot of activity going on in the nation's capitol today with regard to this  omni-package.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand the need to fund the military and we talk  about that all the time, given the fact that our aging fleet in the Navy  has 50 percent of the planes unable to even fly.  I get all of that.  We're  seeing accidents.</p><p>But did you need to go to that number?  Did you need that much in terms of  military?  Could you have scaled back a bit so that you weren't handcuffed  to put all of this other spending on domestic issues?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well, they wanted dollar for dollar -- Maria.  Remember, the  Democrats expected dollar for dollar and we didn't go dollar for dollar.</p><p>But we took our cues from the leadership in the Pentagon.  Secretary Mattis  was very emphatic as to the numbers that he needed to hit in order to be  able to meet the demands that are created by the threat that is expanding  around the globe.</p><p>And this is not the time for us to be taking a pass on taking care of our  men and women in uniform.  We've got fundamental issues in the Pentagon.   We've got inner (ph) strength (ph) problems.  We've got four structure  problems.  We've got acquisition program problems.</p><p>And we've got an expanding threat around the globe.  It was necessary for  us to take the steps that we've taken in this bill to beef up our military.</p><p>And now, when you do that, you have to make concessions on the other side  and while they didn't get dollar for dollar, there were things in that  bill, there are things in this bill that we'd prefer not to have to do.   But that's what happens when you sit down at the table and have to  negotiate the way we do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman, will you get enough votes for this massive bill?  </p><p>WOMACK:  To be determined.  I'm on the Whip team but I'm not aware of the  Whip count last night.  I know there will be a lot of undecided voters or  undecided members.  We have a 2,000-page bill to sort through.  We know  pretty much what's in it from a numbers perspective but what we don't know  are some of the other things that have been added onto this bill that are  unrelated to the spending provision.</p><p>So that's what members will be going through today to try to figure out  exactly what else is in the bill and whether they can muster, you know, the  votes necessary to be able to put it across the finish line.  We still have  to go through the rule process and there might be some concerns about  whether we can even pass the rule.  But sometime today we'll have that in  clarity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is there a plan to face off against trillion dollar  deficits?  When does that become a priority?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well look, part of what we've got to do in order to be able to fix  the fiscal glide path of this country, we've taken some steps already.  We  worked on the tax code by lowering tax rates.  We think that's part and  parcel to try to grow this economy because you're going to have to grow the  economy to be able to fix -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WOMACK:  -- the deficits and the debt as we know them today.</p><p>We've gone after a lot of the over-regulation that happened in the last  several years.  We're beginning to take steps to be able to rid the private  sector of a lot of this over-regulation.  But growing this economy has to  be a central focal point; a growth model is what's going to fix what ails  this country right now.  So cutting taxes is doing that, cutting  regulations.</p><p>And then we eventually are going to have to deal with the elephant in the  room and that is the mandatory side of spending, about 70 percent of  federal dollars go out to programs that are on auto pilot.  And I believe  you will see this Congress and the next Congress pivot quickly to doing  things that go right to the heart of what's driving the deficits and the  debt in this country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I'm saying.</p><p>WOMACK:  And that's on the mandatory side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I'm saying, sir.  I mean at some point it has to  become a priority.  But now what I hear being talked about is not that, but  phase two of the tax cuts.</p><p>Here's Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy with me yesterday when I asked him  about that, the next step in tax reform.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  I want to see the  individuals made permanent.  But like any big bill when you go through it,  there are going to be other aspects that you didn't think about.  Let's see  where we need to go there.  Let's see how this bill has transferred and  changed the economy.</p><p>Is there places we missed?  Let's listen to the economy and let's go back  and analyze that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, Mr. Chairman?  What do you want to see in  terms of phase two in the tax cuts?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well, certainly we'd like to make the individual cuts permanent.   And there's no question about that.  I mean that's just part of giving  certainty to the economy and certainty to American households. </p><p>But it's still I think a bit early for us to be able to with clarity  understand exactly what this Tax Cut and Jobs Act proposal and law has  actually done.  I think it will take us for the rest of the year to figure  out exactly how it's going to impact businesses, impact families.</p><p>And so if there are tweaks that need to be made, we're all in about that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let ask you -- </p><p>WOMACK:  There was a tweak that we took care of yesterday or at least in  the announcement with the grain farmers.  So we're going to find out a  little bit more about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as we move through the  year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- I want to ask you about Facebook but before I  get to that, I want to read you Governor Mike Huckabee's tweet.  He's  tweeting that he's going to be on this program.  We're going to talk to him  in a few minutes after you.</p><p>He says \"I will be on @MariaBartiromo and will let loose on GOP for  collapsing and surrendering to Pelosi and Schumer on a disgusting spending  bill.  It's not a compromise, it's capitulation.  To borrow a phrase from  Nancy Reagan, \"Just say no\".  What do you want to say to Mike Huckabee?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well look, Mike Huckabee's a great friend of mine.  I was a mayor  in the town of Arkansas when he was my governor.  He was my commander in  chief.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But he says the bill is disgusting.</p><p>WOMACK:  He can say it's disgusting.  And that's easy to say from the  outside looking in.  But as I said before, I believe strongly that we have  a mandate to provide for the security of this country.  And in order to be  able to get the gains that we did for the Pentagon and for the national  security apparatus, there were concessions that had to be made.</p><p>That's going to happen in any negotiation.  You can call it disgusting all  day long.  And there are things in this bill that I would prefer not to  have to vote for.  That's why we're sorting through it today to figure out  are there any other issues that have popped up in this bill that will make  it distasteful enough that we can't support it.</p><p>And look, we've got until tomorrow to fix it.  If not, we'll be looking at  a short-term CR and back to the negotiating table.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- what about Facebook and what we have seen.   These companies are more powerful than they ever have been.</p><p>Zuckerberg -- Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook broke his silence yesterday  on the data mining scandal that affected more than 50 million users in a  new interview.  He hinted of regulation and he said that he's willing to  testify.  Here's what he said, sir.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  We need to make sure there aren't any  other Cambridge Analyticas out there, right; or folks who have improperly  accessed data.  So we're going to go now and investigate every app that has  access to a large amount of information.  </p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Will you testify before Congress?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  So the short answer is I'm happy to if it's the right thing to  do.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of legislation would you like to see or not see?   Tell me what you're thinking in terms of new regulation coming on  technology.  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well, as somebody who pushes back against a lot of federal  regulation because I think we he have a lot of it already, I think where it  concerns the privacy of people, particularly given Internet and the expanse  of the worldwide web and all of the potential problems associated with the  stealing of intellectual property and the stealing of personal identity --  those kinds of things, that Congress does have a role in this and Congress  must address at a minimum issues that protect the privacy of everyday  citizens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So in other words, we will see new regulation, you think?  </p><p>WOMACK:  I think you're going to see some regulation.  You're going to see  hearings here in Washington and you're obviously going to have a regulatory  response to it for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  This from people who don't want to see big government but  there's clearly an issue here.  </p><p>WOMACK:  Yes.  But you have to understand that even though people push back  against regulations in general, that doesn't mean we're a no-regulation  type body.  We just feel like they've got to be smart regulations and I  think that Congress will get there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks very  much.</p><p>WOMACK:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching -- </p><p>WOMACK:  All the best.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the developments today.  Chairman Womack there.</p><p>Still ahead -- stoking fears of a trade war, President Trump set to  announce up to $60 billion in stiff tariffs on Chinese imports and  restrictions on Chinese investments.  What White House Trade Council  director Peter Navarro had to say about the concerns of retaliation.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're looking at markets right now.  Markets are expected to open down.   We're expecting a 200-point selloff right out of the gate this morning,  extending yesterday's losses after the Federal Reserve raised interest  rates yesterday by a quarter of a point.</p><p>Meanwhile the Trump administration set to announce punitive measures  against China today for the country's unfair trade practices.  We're  expecting tariffs as well as restrictions on investment.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details right now and headlines -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we are -- Maria.</p><p>And these measures are expected to include those restrictions on China's  investments and pretty steep tariffs on Chinese goods.  China has been  accused of violating intellectual property rights, pressuring U.S.  companies to transfer our technology and our trade secrets.  The White  House National Trade Council director Peter Navarro -- on this show a bit  ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAVARRO:  It's an historic day.  This is a fundamental shift in American  policy towards China after literally decades of economic dialogue.  And you  know, talk is not cheap with the Chinese.  It's actually been very  expensive because while we've been talking with them since 2003, they've  been robbing our technology blind.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Beijing is expected to retaliate.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting that China is looking to impose tariffs on U.S. agricultural  exports like soybeans and hogs.  That would target the farm belt and a good  part of Donald Trump's base.</p><p>Massive recall of smoke detectors -- Kidde calling back about half a  million of them because a flaw can interfere with the device's ability to  detect smoke.  The recall includes Kidde dual sensor smoke detectors sold  at retailers including Home Depot, Wal-Mart as well as amazon.com.  If you  have one of these defective models, please contact Kidde for a free  replacement.</p><p>And shocking body camera footage shows the crucial moments.  An Ohio police  officer saved a choking baby.  The officers say they saw the baby's mother  stop her car in traffic as her two-month-old baby girl had milk clogging  her nose and mouth. </p><p>That's when the officer jumped into action.  He administered back thrusts  to eventually clear her airway.  The officer said being a dad of four  helped him know what to do and the baby girl is ok.  Liquidation sales at  Toys R Us, they are set to begin today at most of the company's 700  bankrupt stores.  Shoppers are looking for bargains.  They're being advised  to act fast because the popular toys are expected to sell out pretty  quickly.  The company is hoping inventory is cleared by June.  Toys R Us,  as you know, fell victim to competition from online retailers but also the  discount chains and the debt from a leveraged buyout years ago -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Lauren -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, an interest rate hike sending markets lower this morning.   Futures indicated down 200 points right now.  The aftermath from newly  appointed Fed chair Jay Powell's first policy meeting -- that and worries  over trade.</p><p>Then the best around, \"The Karate Kid\" dusts off his bandanna for a YouTube  original series with a preview of the new take on a classic series, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  As you all would now We decided  today to raise the target rate for the federal funds rate by one quarter of  a percentage point, bring it to 1.75 percent.  This decision marks another  step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy  accommodation, a process that has been under way for several years now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell after the Fed's  move to raise interest rates yesterday, first move this year.  Markets  under pressure this morning on the heels of that after being weaker  yesterday as well; not a significant move yesterday but nonetheless on the  downside.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that Nuveen Asset Management chief  equity strategist, senior portfolio manager Bob Doll.  Bob -- good to see  you.  </p><p>BOB DOLL, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST, NUVEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Thank you --  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You were expecting an interest rate hike.  </p><p>DOLL:  Absolutely -- like everybody else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this market -- you're not a fan?  What?  </p><p>DOLL:  Neutral.  I think we're in a trading range.  We're going to flop  around here.  Maybe the high in 2875 in January and the low 2532 and the  correction -- that could be the measure we have for months to come.  We're  just going to bounce around.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  So if you're an investor and you're watching the show, you want  to be a little defensive in a market like this, what do you rotate into  right now?  </p><p>DOLL:  Higher quality.  Just make sure the companies you own have decent  balance sheets and have decent earnings and are not overly priced because  valuation matters as interest rates and inflation creep higher.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Bob -- the Fed was saying yesterday essentially that they think  the economy can grow a little more over the next year, a little faster than  they thought it could.  But they still have a very pessimistic long-term  view that we're kind of stuck in the new normal below 2 percent.  Do you  think they're wrong about that?  </p><p>DOLL:  I hope they're wrong about that.  And look, this tax bill doesn't  solve all our problems but for the first time the tax bill we got a couple  of months ago gives us a chance to get productivity moving.</p><p>We've been stuck at 1 percent productivity.  If we can get some intelligent  capital expenditures, which this bill promotes, we can get productivity  back toward 2 and then we have a higher growth rate than they're looking  at, in my opinion.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about headline risk and regulation risk?  Deregulation has  been a critical theme for this economy from the Trump administration over  the last more than a year.  But you see what's going on with Facebook, just  irresponsible management with really some systemic problems at that company  that investors are just noticing.</p><p>In a market like this which looks a little bit rich, are some stocks more  at risk of these kind of negative headlines?  </p><p>DOLL:  That's absolutely true.  We've been in an environment, thankfully,  where we haven't had to worry about regulation because there have been no  new ones and some of the old ones haven't been enforced, if you will.</p><p>But now we're in a position, Facebook is a good example, where we're going  to have to take a look.  And that will cast a bit of a gray cloud over  those kinds of companies and perhaps the market as a whole.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tech stocks?  </p><p>DOLL:  The big tech stocks that have grown like a weed and aren't domiciled  anywhere and don't pay taxes anywhere, this is a place where the government  is going to look.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you allocate capital then right now?  </p><p>DOLL:  So in my view you de-emphasize some of those stocks.  You can still  own tech but you own Mastercard and Visa and Cisco on the value side.  You  be a little more value-oriented in tech.</p><p>I think you still have to own some financials, Maria.  I wouldn't give up  on the consumer, selected places are still good as a result of the tax bill  we talked about.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you worried about trade?  </p><p>DOLL:  You have to be worried about trade.  When you put -- a tariff is a  tax.  Look, I'm -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DOLL:  -- period, period, period.</p><p>Now, I know we've got to find a way to go after China because they don't  play by the right rules.  Everybody sees that, even the free traders.  So  we've got to find out a way to do that.  So, you know, we started with a  tariff on steel and aluminum for everybody.</p><p>Wait a minute, Mexico and Canada, you're our friends.  We won't go there,  maybe not Europe.  Maybe this will get down to China.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's how I see it.  I talk about Facebook -- that  potential regulation.  I see these tariffs and now companies have to ask  for exemptions or even countries.  That's additional regulation.  You're  putting up hurdles and who does that hurt?  It hurts small business.  This  is something that President Trump knows.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, even those countries that will be exempt, there  will be quotas in place.  So you will say ok, Canada, you're exempt from  the tariffs but here's the amount of product we will take in terms of  imports.  There will be quotas instituted.  They don't want over-capacity.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And some of those countries are also talking about taxing those  tech companies in Europe as well.  So that's a headline that dovetails with  what Dagen had to say.  I agree with that.  So that's a little -- another  little gray cloud over there that we didn't have before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bob -- great to see you.</p><p>DOLL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Bob Doll there.  </p><p>Coming up, new scrutiny over self-driving cars, the very latest as police  release a dash-cam video of that deadly crash involving one of Uber's  autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Then, behind the mask, comedian Jim Carrey showing his true colors with a  controversial painting believed to be White House press secretary Sarah  Huckabee Sanders.  Her father is with us, former Arkansas Governor Mike  Huckabee will weigh in on an unflattering portrayal of his daughter.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back good Tuesday - - good Thursday morning to you  (inaudible).  Thanks for joining us everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it  is Thursday, March 22nd.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the  east coast.  Fears of a trade war sparking worries on Wall Street this  morning.  Ahead of the President's announcement on China tariffs and  restrictions to investment here in the U.S.  Futures indicating a decline  of almost 200 points this morning, down 3/4 of a percent.  </p><p>This after modest losses yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised  interest rates for the first time this year.  As you can see, yesterday's  close was down fractional across the board.  Markets across the globe  mixed.  FTSE 100 down 3/4 of a percent.  The CAC (inaudible) and the DAX  index goes down better than 1 percent.  We did have some manufacturing data  out.  The Flash Purchasing Management Index out of Europe and that is one  of the reasons that markets turned lower and the losses are accelerating  this morning.  </p><p>Also Japan Flash Manufacturing also under pressure.  Asia over night as you  can see also weaker although the NIKKEI average reported economic data came  out was up about 1 percent.  A new twist in the firing of Andrew McCabe.   Reports say that the former FBI Deputy Director authorized an investigation  into Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury.  Plus the  subpoena loans the House Judiciary Committee set to demand documents on the  Hilary Clinton email investigation as you hear her first.  We have the very  latest there.  New developments in the Uber self-driving crash  investigation.  Police releasing new video showing the moments just before  the collision. </p><p>And Jim Carrey not quite Picasso.  The actor turned painter under fire over  his portrait of a woman who looks very similar to White House Press  Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  An unbelievable moment in Kosovo's  parliament.  The opposition party sets off tear gas to disrupt the vote.   Ralph Macchio is returning.  The original Karate Kid making his comeback in  a new YouTube series.  All that coming up this morning.  But first, the  aspired FBI official Andrew McCabe reported oversaw a Federal criminal  probe of Attorney General Jeff Sessions according to ABC News.  </p><p>McCabe reportedly authorized an investigation into whether the Attorney  General lacked candor during his Congressional testimony last year about  contact with Russian operatives.  Sessions long time personal lawyer  responded in a statement which reads, \"The Special Counsel's Office has  informed me that after interviewing the Attorney General and conducting an  additional investigation.  The Attorney General is not under investigation  for false statements or perjury in his confirmation hearing testimony and  related written submissions to Congress.\"  </p><p>Joining us now is former presidential candidate from Arkansas Governor Mike  Huckabee.  Governor Huckabee, I find this really rich.  I mean, you know,  here's a guy who basically in spying on Michael Flynn and then releasing  that to the press committed perjury right there.  And - - and that is a  felony for - - for what he did and he also lacked candor himself and  apparently he was investigating Sessions.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  There's a statement Maria, something about karma being, gee I  can't remember the rest of the phrase.  But I would say that it applies  here.  It's just remarkable.  I - - I think it's fine that he wanted to  take a look to see was Jeff Sessions dishonest.  But for all the people who  are just crying big crocodile tears because Andrew McCabe got fired, my  gosh get over it.  Andrew McCabe deserved to be fired according the Office  of Professional Responsibility.  It wasn't Donald Trump who fired him.  It  was his own FBI organization who said he had to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And why should he get a pension.  If he violated the basic  fundamental code of ethics that he supposedly clearly understood.</p><p>BARITROMO:  Yes.  I mean - - we - - we want to move on to the spending and  your tweet earlier.  But - - but I find it really incredible that there are  1.2 million documents that the House Oversight and House Judiciary  Committees have requested from the FBI and they've only sent 3,000  documents, 3,000 documents.  That's why they are subpoenaing those  documents this week.  But, how does that happen?  How do you blow off and  stonewall the committees that have jurisdiction over you for so long?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well that's part of the problem when there's so much power that  has been accumulated at the top of the FBI.  And I think everybody tries to  make the point, this isn't about the rank and file.  This isn't about the  organization but this is about the leadership and the corruption that has  so permeated that organization that they think they have the right to slow  walk getting documents over to the Oversight committee.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That they are constitutionally required to be accountable for.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's absurd and I'm glad Bob Goodlatte is saying, here's a  subpoena.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Cough up - - cough up the stuff. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, by the way, Jason Chavitz tried that too and they - - they  - - he didn't get anywhere either.  He - - he - - remember when he  interrupted a meeting and said you are served.  But anyway, let me switch  gears because Arkansas Congressman and House Budget Committee Chairman  Steve Womack responded to your tweet.  Your tweet called out Republicans  about the Federal spending bill and you - - you called it a disgusting  bill.  Just say no to Pelosi.  Here's what he said earlier right here on  the program.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They needed to make concessions to pay for the military  governor.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well look, Steve is a good friend and I love him.  He's a great  Congressman but I'm going to just say this.  Not one Republican in that  body got elected to fund Planned Parenthood, not fund the Border Wall, give  up for sanctuary cities, trash the 2nd Amendment.  They were elected to go  and do a job that stopped that kind of funding but it did fund the  military.  So lay it on the table and tell the Democrats.  We're going to  fund the military but we're not going to fund some of your pet projects and  you can either be the ones that keep us from having a strong military or  you can join us.  And if you think that we're wrong than you go get elected  to the majorities.  </p><p>These guys have got to start learning to play some hardball.  They have  surrendered to Schumer and Pelosi and to a minority, and there is just no  excuse for just giving up this quickly.  And if the government has to  shutdown in order to push that point, then maybe that's what has to happen  and lay it around the necks of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Democrats  who think that killing unborn children is more important than being able to  preserve the boarders and the security of the United States of America.   That's what's at stake and it's time for them to stand up and do what they  sent them there to do and if they can't, get some more people and let them  have a shot at it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Governor, Mitch Roschelle.  One of the things when I talk to  business leaders I hear a lot of this fear about the mid-term elections and  how that could shift policy for the balance of this Administration's first  term.  How could this budget issue play out in the mid-terms and be used as  sort of fodder for beating up some Republican candidates?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I - - I'll be very blunt.  If the Republicans surrender on this  bill and spend that kind of money on stuff that Republicans find immoral  and just absolutely unacceptable, then Republicans will lose.  They will  deserve to lose.  We're going to have a lousy government under Democrats  when Pelosi goes back in as Speaker.  But it won't be the fault of the  President and it won't be the fault of rank and file Republicans.  It will  be the fault of this Congress for not having the courage to stand up to  these guys and say, we got elected.  Why don't they just say what Obama  did.  Elections have consequences and roll that tape over and over and over  again.  Because I'll guarantee you the Democrats certainly didn't  compromise with Republicans when they had the whole show.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Governor, you make some good points on policies that Washington  shouldn't be funding.  But isn't the big problem here also the overall  level of spending?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Of course it is.  Yes, James it is.  And I think that's another  issue that Republicans went to Congress to cut this runaway spending.  The  - - the - - scenarios where Republicans are willing to spend.  We're  willing to spend to build a border wall, willing to fund the military but  we're not willing to just say let's have a grab bag and everybody gets to  throw in what they want.  $1.3 trillion is - - is way beyond what is should  be and the Republicans act like they don't have a choice.  </p><p>And they're wringing their hands and they're sweating blood.  Well it's  time for them to stand up and say, nope.  Again, we got elected - - we got  elected to do some specific things, here are the specific things and if you  don't want to vote for it we're going to tell the whole country that you  thought that killing unborn babies and running up a huge deficit was more  important to you than making sure that we had security and border  protection.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, let me switch gears, ask you about this crazy photo.   Look, I know that as a father you're incredibly proud of Sarah, your  daughter.  She has to deal with constant everyday pushback from skeptics.   Jim Carrey painted this.  He - - the black lash is incredible after posting  this photo.  It's believed to be Sarah - - Sarah Huckabee Sanders, your  daughter.  Last week he tweeted out this picture with a caption that reads,  this is the portrait of a so-called Christian who's only purpose in life is  to lie for the wicked monstrous.  So, the actor has drawn pictures  criticizing President Trump as well.  What do you say governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well first of all I think as far as his political leanings,  we're going to just mark him down as undecided.  He just hasn't been that  clear where he stands. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But if he wants to paint some ridiculous looking cartoons,  that's what political cartoonists do.  That's one thing.  I - - I'm not as  so much offended by that.  I think it's unfair and unflattering but my  daughter's a beautiful person inside and out.  Here's what I find and take  offense to.  It is the fact that he calls her a so-called Christian and  accusing her of lies without listing what those lies are.  And - - and to  question someone's faith, you don't hear him talk about a so-called Muslim  or a so-called Jew or a so-called Buddhist.  I think it's just something  that the left takes in vogue as to be able to attack people of the  Christian faith and somehow believe that they become judge and jury as if  they are the Father, Son and Holy Ghost when it comes to determining the  authenticity of a person's faith.  That's what I find most offensive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So rude, offensive.  You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  He doesn't know her faith.  That's offensive. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And - - now I'll just add one thing.  These people on the left,  these spew.  They spew hate at me all day long.  If they spent a little  more time trying to get HRC elected, they wouldn't be so doggone angry.   Again, it's asymmetric rage.  Angry at something, angry at something in a  way that doesn't even make any sense.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's all - - that's all they do is shame people and name  call.  It's - - it's - - it's not even a fair fight.  It's - - it's nothing  of substance.  It's just name calling, painting a picture of someone. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  To be fair though, people - - ardent Trump supporters who are  100 percent on board with everything the President does like tariffs.  I've  gotten as much hate from Trump supporters when I talk about tariffs being a  tax.  So I think everybody needs to check their soul.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The governor's daughter is earning all the right enemies here. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well said.  Sometimes you're known by your friends.  Sometimes  you're known by your enemies  And I think, you know, if - - if those are  her enemies than she's in very good shape.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Governor, good to see you sir.  Thanks so  much.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thanks a bunch.  Good to be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee there.  Coming up a vote takes a violent turn in  Kosovo.  Look at this, the chaos after a tear gas grenade is set off in the  middle of the tense debate.</p><p>Welcome back.  Police releasing a disturbing video from last Sunday's  accident when an Uber self driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in  Tempe - - in Tempe, Arizona.  Lauren Simonetti with the details.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hello Maria.  This is video we want to warn you that is pretty  tough to watch.  It shows the safety driver, the minder not looking at the  road in the final moments before he hit - - hit a 49 year old Elaine  Herzberg.  This is believed to be the first fatal crash that involves the  self-driving vehicle and a pedestrian.  Uber has suspended testing of it's  self-driving vehicles.  Toyota has also halted it's tests on - - on public  roads.  But it begs the question, if you're minding the vehicle, do you  have to pay attention at all times even though it's autonomous?  </p><p>All right, take a look at this one.  Some opposition lawmakers in Kosovo  firing tear gas in the parliament chamber.  They wanted to block a vote on  a border deal with Montenegro.  Despite this attack, the - - the measure  was approved in an 80 to 11 vote.  The border deal is set as a pre- condition by the European Union for Kosovo citizens to travel within it's  visa free zone.  So that's what some opposition leaders did there.  And  let's have - - let's lighten if up.  Thirty-four years since Daniel LaRusso  learned to wax on, wax off and his rivalry with Johnny Lawrence lives on in  the YouTube Red series Cobra Kai.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  This is my childhood.  YouTube releasing a trailer for the new  series in which Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprise their roles.  It's  a show that premieres on May 2nd.   (inaudible) takes place in a car  dealership, in the future.  I love it.  Thank you.</p><p>(ROSCHELLE):  Yes baby.  Come on. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I knew you were going to say that. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, bidding like it is 1999.  Your chance to buy a piece  of Prince and other music legends.  A first hand look at the iconic items  hitting the auction block next.</p><p>From Michael Jackson to Elvis Presley and Prince, iconic celebrity items  are coming to the auction block this weekend at GWS Auctions, Legends of  Hollywood and Music Auction.  We have some of the big items right here on  set.  And here joining me to tell us all about it is - - is Brigitte Kruse.   She is owner and chief auctioneer of GWS Auction in Los Angeles.  Brigitte,  good to see you.</p><p>KRUSE:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  I love that you - - that you  brought all this stuff.  We're going to go through it.  How did you get  into this auction business?</p><p>KRUSE:  You know what?  It was a family business.  I'm actually 5th  generation so I don't think I had much choice to get into this business.   It's - - it's a labor of love.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, you must love it.  Because you've got all of  these beautiful things and you - - what - - what moves the price in terms  of some of these items?</p><p>KRUSE:  That is a great question.  It's mostly trends, what's popular,  what's not.  You know, you just kind of have to follow it.  It changes from  time to time.  And then there's things, there's certain asset categories  that just are timeless and always are popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes they sure are.  So let's start with the Prince.  The purple  overcoat used by the late Prince during the filming of \"Purple Rain\".  Tell  us about this item. </p><p>KRUSE:  This piece actually came from the daughter-in-law of one of the set  designers from \"Purple Rain\".  And with it being such an iconic film for  that time, you know, I believe it grossed over $80 million in 1984 which  was unheard of.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KRUSE:  So, you know, with the lace detail and little pearl inserts, it's  just a lovely piece.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KRUSE:  We're really excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think this will go for?</p><p>KRUSE:  You know what, we're predicting somewhere conservatively in the  $3,500 to $5,000 range.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  OK.  And - - and when people buy these items, they do  it to collect and put them somewhere where they will just save them and  cherish them and make sure that the value stays.  You're not going to like  wear it.</p><p>KRUSE:  Definitely.  And that's something that we do that's just a little  bit different.  We actually make sure that these pieces are perfect by the  time they get to the bidder's hands.  So if we have a successful bidder, we  want to make sure that they receive the most pristine asset possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's look at this one.  One of the rare left-handed version of  Michael Jackson's trademark glove.  Tell me about that one.</p><p>KRUSE:  So, this is what they consider the second generation Michael  Jackson glove.  There is the Bill Witten (ph) glove who is, you know, he is  infamous for helping Michael Jackson create the first generation.  And this  is the Michael Bush-Dennis Tompkins era, which is kind of the second  generation glove.  So this was more during the time, right when he married  Lisa Marie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  And then the other one that we wanted to see, Michael  Jackson item is the fedora owned by the King of Pop.  Tell me about that  one.</p><p>KRUSE:  Oh yes.  He made an empire out of fedoras.  So - - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're both his?</p><p>KRUSE:  Yes.  They're both his.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Go ahead.</p><p>KRUSE:  And the neat story with these is there was a gentleman who made a  donation by way of an art piece to one of Michael Jackson's charitable  foundations.  And in - - in time he gave them three fedoras.  So these are  two of those three fedoras and they actually are - - they have great  providence.  They come with a letter of authenticity from MJJ Productions  which is as solid as it gets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So cool.  And this bid starts at $500.</p><p>KRUSE:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So let's go through this one, speaking of kings.   You have an Army book owned and autographed by Elvis Presley himself.  </p><p>KRUSE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KRUSE:  This is one of my favorite items because at the time, in 1958 when  he went to Germany, a lot of people think that that was kind of a turning  point for his career.  Because they say that he never quite came back the  same.  But what makes this piece so special is this was when he met  Priscilla over in Germany when he was stationed there.  And this Army book  actually belonged to someone who served with him and he got so excited when  he saw him, will you please sign it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How fantastic.</p><p>KRUSE:  And it's - - it's never been offered at auction before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do you think that starts at?</p><p>KRUSE:  You know what, the bid is currently at $3,300 and I'm going to tell  you.  I am surprised by that.  So, you know, I think we might end up in the  $5,000 range by the time we have auction (inaudible).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an interesting item.  That's - - that's history right  there. </p><p>KRUSE:  It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The blue fir smock worn by Lady Gaga on American Horror Story.   This is just fabulous.</p><p>KRUSE:  It is actually what we call a bi-lateral celebrity piece.  Because  it was also worn by Halle Barry in \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\", the Frankie  Limon story. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KRUSE:  So, this has got a really cool back story.  And this came from one  of our wardrobe houses in Hollywood.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So where - - where - - where - - why do you have it?  I mean,  after - - after those two celebrities wore it?</p><p>KRUSE:  A lot of these places have to do asset management.  You know, they  have to take care of these assets, get them in, get them out after they've  been used so many times.  So we were just fortunate enough to be the one in  line.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick.  The big pair of sunglasses owned by the late Steve  McQueen. </p><p>KRUSE:  Yes.  Oh my gosh, the Versoles (ph).  I mean, he was known for the  folding sunglasses.  So we're excited about those and the bid is already  over $5,000.  So - - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.  Brigitte, thank you.  The auction begins - - </p><p>KRUSE:  On Saturday, 10 a.m. Pacific. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be checking it out.  Thanks so much.    </p><p>KRUSE:  Thank you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brigitte Kruse.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good Thursday morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, March 22nd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the east coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm really sorry,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally speaks out over the company's growing privacy scandal calling it a major breach of trust. The fallout for the technology sector as Zuckerberg says he is willing to testify before Congress if necessary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the race to avoid a shutdown, lawmakers have reached a tentative agreement on a $1.3 trillion spending bill to keep the government running but do they have the votes? The very latest as Congress scrambles to pass the bill before midnight tomorrow night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trade crackdown, President Trump will announce strict tariffs and restrictions on Chinese imports and China investing. That's happening today at noontime; the move sparking concerns over a possible trade war.</p><p>I spoke with the director of the White House national trade council, Peter Navarro about what's to come.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL: This talk like this I think is irresponsible in some sense because if you look at the chess board, I think it's clear that all we want is to defend ourselves against economic aggression. And I see this as bullish for corporate America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Markets under pressure today, take a look. Futures indicating a decline of about 200 points at the start of trading this morning. Stocks settled lower yesterday and that momentum is continuing in a big way this morning. The Nasdaq is down 80 points right now.</p><p>The Federal Reserve, of course, raised interest rates yesterday for first time this year under new Chairman Jay Powell. Markets traded down after that. The Dow Industrials closed down 45 points, the S&amp;P was down 5 and the Nasdaq was down 19.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are lower right now. Investors are watching and wait for the Bank of England's decision on interest rates. That's due in about an hour from now when we will get you the news as soon as it hits the tape.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances. Japan was up -- rest of the majors were lower but Nikkei average was up 1 percent. Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down 1 percent.</p><p>Plus, not playing around, the details as Toys R Us begins to liquidate.</p><p>All those stories this morning coming up and joining me to talk all about it: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle, rather; and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman. Great to see you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Good to be here -- thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So much on the table to talk about.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: There's a ton and we've got the China sanctions release later today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we've got restrictions on investment as well as tariffs.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Well, it's both ways, right. It's trade tariffs and perhaps prohibitions on their investment in the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Fed raised interest rates yesterday -- no big deal, I mean 1.75 percent.</p><p>FREEMAN: And the Fed thinks the economy can grow faster and they finally realized that there are people in the economy who can come in to the labor market. So these are good things.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: At the same time those smart gentlemen and ladies down in D.C. are spending that much more money, driving up the deficit that much more in the face of higher interest rates --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and a Fed that's winding down its balance sheet and will not stand at the ready to buy the debt that the federal government will be trying to sell.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's right.</p><p>We'll coming up this morning, we've got all that on the table. Senate Finance Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch. We'll talk about that coming up. Also, former presidential candidate, Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee is here. Former presidential candidate Herman Cain is joining us. And the host of \"VARNEY AND COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighing in as well.</p><p>All that coming up this morning.</p><p>But first, House Republicans have finally unveiled their whopping $1.3 trillion spending bill ahead of the looming government shutdown. President Trump endorsed the bill last night. He tweeted this, \"That $1.6 billion to start wall on southern border, rest will be forthcoming. Most importantly got $700 billion to rebuild our military; $716 billion next year -- most ever of; had to waste money on Democratic giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.</p><p>The funding measure needs to make it through the House Rules Committee before a floor vote. Some conservative members in the chamber not happy with this bill -- too much money.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA: We continue to fund sanctuary cities. We continue to fund Planned Parenthood. We don't build the wall but yet we put money in for a tunnel. The last time I checked, when the President was campaigning, he wasn't campaigning for a tunnel between New Jersey and New York. But I'm not very optimistic that there will be conservative wins in this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Arkansas congressman House Budget Committee chairman, Steve Womack. Chairman Womack -- thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>REP. STEVE WOMACK (R-AR), HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE: Maria -- it's great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about that? Planned Parenthood, sanctuary cities -- all of this extra spending has us looking at trillion dollar deficits 10 years out and beyond -- how do you justify that?</p><p>WOMACK: Well look, let's first of all understand what we're doing in this bill and again, this bill is not across the finish line yet but we went into these negotiations with the express intent of primarily fixing our military.</p><p>And in order to do that, like any other negotiation, understand that the other side gets a vote in this thing. We don't have 60 votes in the Senate. So in this four corners negotiation, when you've got members of the Senate, the minority leader in the senate, the minority leader in the House and the two majority leaders in the House and Senate on the Republican side negotiating, they're going to get a vote.</p><p>So in order to beef up the Defense, there were certain things, other concessions that had to be made and that's just what's going to happen in negotiation.</p><p>It's a 2,000-page bill. Members are still sorting through it. We've got a short time line that we're being asked to consider this thing, so there's a lot of activity going on in the nation's capitol today with regard to this omni-package.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, I understand the need to fund the military and we talk about that all the time, given the fact that our aging fleet in the Navy has 50 percent of the planes unable to even fly. I get all of that. We're seeing accidents.</p><p>But did you need to go to that number? Did you need that much in terms of military? Could you have scaled back a bit so that you weren't handcuffed to put all of this other spending on domestic issues?</p><p>WOMACK: Well, they wanted dollar for dollar -- Maria. Remember, the Democrats expected dollar for dollar and we didn't go dollar for dollar.</p><p>But we took our cues from the leadership in the Pentagon. Secretary Mattis was very emphatic as to the numbers that he needed to hit in order to be able to meet the demands that are created by the threat that is expanding around the globe.</p><p>And this is not the time for us to be taking a pass on taking care of our men and women in uniform. We've got fundamental issues in the Pentagon. We've got inner (ph) strength (ph) problems. We've got four structure problems. We've got acquisition program problems.</p><p>And we've got an expanding threat around the globe. It was necessary for us to take the steps that we've taken in this bill to beef up our military.</p><p>And now, when you do that, you have to make concessions on the other side and while they didn't get dollar for dollar, there were things in that bill, there are things in this bill that we'd prefer not to have to do. But that's what happens when you sit down at the table and have to negotiate the way we do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. Chairman, will you get enough votes for this massive bill?</p><p>WOMACK: To be determined. I'm on the Whip team but I'm not aware of the Whip count last night. I know there will be a lot of undecided voters or undecided members. We have a 2,000-page bill to sort through. We know pretty much what's in it from a numbers perspective but what we don't know are some of the other things that have been added onto this bill that are unrelated to the spending provision.</p><p>So that's what members will be going through today to try to figure out exactly what else is in the bill and whether they can muster, you know, the votes necessary to be able to put it across the finish line. We still have to go through the rule process and there might be some concerns about whether we can even pass the rule. But sometime today we'll have that in clarity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So is there a plan to face off against trillion dollar deficits? When does that become a priority?</p><p>WOMACK: Well look, part of what we've got to do in order to be able to fix the fiscal glide path of this country, we've taken some steps already. We worked on the tax code by lowering tax rates. We think that's part and parcel to try to grow this economy because you're going to have to grow the economy to be able to fix --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>WOMACK: -- the deficits and the debt as we know them today.</p><p>We've gone after a lot of the over-regulation that happened in the last several years. We're beginning to take steps to be able to rid the private sector of a lot of this over-regulation. But growing this economy has to be a central focal point; a growth model is what's going to fix what ails this country right now. So cutting taxes is doing that, cutting regulations.</p><p>And then we eventually are going to have to deal with the elephant in the room and that is the mandatory side of spending, about 70 percent of federal dollars go out to programs that are on auto pilot. And I believe you will see this Congress and the next Congress pivot quickly to doing things that go right to the heart of what's driving the deficits and the debt in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I'm saying.</p><p>WOMACK: And that's on the mandatory side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying, sir. I mean at some point it has to become a priority. But now what I hear being talked about is not that, but phase two of the tax cuts.</p><p>Here's Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy with me yesterday when I asked him about that, the next step in tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: I want to see the individuals made permanent. But like any big bill when you go through it, there are going to be other aspects that you didn't think about. Let's see where we need to go there. Let's see how this bill has transferred and changed the economy.</p><p>Is there places we missed? Let's listen to the economy and let's go back and analyze that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about that, Mr. Chairman? What do you want to see in terms of phase two in the tax cuts?</p><p>WOMACK: Well, certainly we'd like to make the individual cuts permanent. And there's no question about that. I mean that's just part of giving certainty to the economy and certainty to American households.</p><p>But it's still I think a bit early for us to be able to with clarity understand exactly what this Tax Cut and Jobs Act proposal and law has actually done. I think it will take us for the rest of the year to figure out exactly how it's going to impact businesses, impact families.</p><p>And so if there are tweaks that need to be made, we're all in about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let ask you --</p><p>WOMACK: There was a tweak that we took care of yesterday or at least in the announcement with the grain farmers. So we're going to find out a little bit more about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as we move through the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. Chairman -- I want to ask you about Facebook but before I get to that, I want to read you Governor Mike Huckabee's tweet. He's tweeting that he's going to be on this program. We're going to talk to him in a few minutes after you.</p><p>He says \"I will be on @MariaBartiromo and will let loose on GOP for collapsing and surrendering to Pelosi and Schumer on a disgusting spending bill. It's not a compromise, it's capitulation. To borrow a phrase from Nancy Reagan, \"Just say no\". What do you want to say to Mike Huckabee?</p><p>WOMACK: Well look, Mike Huckabee's a great friend of mine. I was a mayor in the town of Arkansas when he was my governor. He was my commander in chief.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But he says the bill is disgusting.</p><p>WOMACK: He can say it's disgusting. And that's easy to say from the outside looking in. But as I said before, I believe strongly that we have a mandate to provide for the security of this country. And in order to be able to get the gains that we did for the Pentagon and for the national security apparatus, there were concessions that had to be made.</p><p>That's going to happen in any negotiation. You can call it disgusting all day long. And there are things in this bill that I would prefer not to have to vote for. That's why we're sorting through it today to figure out are there any other issues that have popped up in this bill that will make it distasteful enough that we can't support it.</p><p>And look, we've got until tomorrow to fix it. If not, we'll be looking at a short-term CR and back to the negotiating table.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. Chairman -- what about Facebook and what we have seen. These companies are more powerful than they ever have been.</p><p>Zuckerberg -- Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook broke his silence yesterday on the data mining scandal that affected more than 50 million users in a new interview. He hinted of regulation and he said that he's willing to testify. Here's what he said, sir.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: This was a major breach of trust and I'm really sorry that this happened. We need to make sure there aren't any other Cambridge Analyticas out there, right; or folks who have improperly accessed data. So we're going to go now and investigate every app that has access to a large amount of information.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Will you testify before Congress?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: So the short answer is I'm happy to if it's the right thing to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What kind of legislation would you like to see or not see? Tell me what you're thinking in terms of new regulation coming on technology.</p><p>WOMACK: Well, as somebody who pushes back against a lot of federal regulation because I think we he have a lot of it already, I think where it concerns the privacy of people, particularly given Internet and the expanse of the worldwide web and all of the potential problems associated with the stealing of intellectual property and the stealing of personal identity -- those kinds of things, that Congress does have a role in this and Congress must address at a minimum issues that protect the privacy of everyday citizens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So in other words, we will see new regulation, you think?</p><p>WOMACK: I think you're going to see some regulation. You're going to see hearings here in Washington and you're obviously going to have a regulatory response to it for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. This from people who don't want to see big government but there's clearly an issue here.</p><p>WOMACK: Yes. But you have to understand that even though people push back against regulations in general, that doesn't mean we're a no-regulation type body. We just feel like they've got to be smart regulations and I think that Congress will get there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. Chairman -- good to see you this morning. Thanks very much.</p><p>WOMACK: Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching --</p><p>WOMACK: All the best.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- the developments today. Chairman Womack there.</p><p>Still ahead -- stoking fears of a trade war, President Trump set to announce up to $60 billion in stiff tariffs on Chinese imports and restrictions on Chinese investments. What White House Trade Council director Peter Navarro had to say about the concerns of retaliation.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We're looking at markets right now. Markets are expected to open down. We're expecting a 200-point selloff right out of the gate this morning, extending yesterday's losses after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates yesterday by a quarter of a point.</p><p>Meanwhile the Trump administration set to announce punitive measures against China today for the country's unfair trade practices. We're expecting tariffs as well as restrictions on investment.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details right now and headlines -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, we are -- Maria.</p><p>And these measures are expected to include those restrictions on China's investments and pretty steep tariffs on Chinese goods. China has been accused of violating intellectual property rights, pressuring U.S. companies to transfer our technology and our trade secrets. The White House National Trade Council director Peter Navarro -- on this show a bit ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAVARRO: It's an historic day. This is a fundamental shift in American policy towards China after literally decades of economic dialogue. And you know, talk is not cheap with the Chinese.

Liquidation sales at Toys R Us, they are set to begin today at most of the company's 700 bankrupt stores. Shoppers are looking for bargains. They're being advised to act fast because the popular toys are expected to sell out pretty quickly. The company is hoping inventory is cleared by June. Toys R Us, as you know, fell victim to competition from online retailers but also the discount chains and the debt from a leveraged buyout years ago -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Lauren -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, an interest rate hike sending markets lower this morning. Futures indicated down 200 points right now. The aftermath from newly appointed Fed chair Jay Powell's first policy meeting -- that and worries over trade.</p><p>Then the best around, \"The Karate Kid\" dusts off his bandanna for a YouTube original series with a preview of the new take on a classic series, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: As you all would now We decided today to raise the target rate for the federal funds rate by one quarter of a percentage point, bring it to 1.75 percent. This decision marks another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation, a process that has been under way for several years now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell after the Fed's move to raise interest rates yesterday, first move this year. Markets under pressure this morning on the heels of that after being weaker yesterday as well; not a significant move yesterday but nonetheless on the downside.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that Nuveen Asset Management chief equity strategist, senior portfolio manager Bob Doll. Bob -- good to see you.</p><p>BOB DOLL, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST, NUVEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT: Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You were expecting an interest rate hike.</p><p>DOLL: Absolutely -- like everybody else.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But this market -- you're not a fan? What?</p><p>DOLL: Neutral. I think we're in a trading range. We're going to flop around here. Maybe the high in 2875 in January and the low 2532 and the correction -- that could be the measure we have for months to come. We're just going to bounce around.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So if you're an investor and you're watching the show, you want to be a little defensive in a market like this, what do you rotate into right now?</p><p>DOLL: Higher quality. Just make sure the companies you own have decent balance sheets and have decent earnings and are not overly priced because valuation matters as interest rates and inflation creep higher.</p><p>FREEMAN: Bob -- the Fed was saying yesterday essentially that they think the economy can grow a little more over the next year, a little faster than they thought it could. But they still have a very pessimistic long-term view that we're kind of stuck in the new normal below 2 percent. Do you think they're wrong about that?</p><p>DOLL: I hope they're wrong about that. And look, this tax bill doesn't solve all our problems but for the first time the tax bill we got a couple of months ago gives us a chance to get productivity moving.</p><p>We've been stuck at 1 percent productivity. If we can get some intelligent capital expenditures, which this bill promotes, we can get productivity back toward 2 and then we have a higher growth rate than they're looking at, in my opinion.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What about headline risk and regulation risk? Deregulation has been a critical theme for this economy from the Trump administration over the last more than a year. But you see what's going on with Facebook, just irresponsible management with really some systemic problems at that company that investors are just noticing.</p><p>In a market like this which looks a little bit rich, are some stocks more at risk of these kind of negative headlines?</p><p>DOLL: That's absolutely true. We've been in an environment, thankfully, where we haven't had to worry about regulation because there have been no new ones and some of the old ones haven't been enforced, if you will.</p><p>But now we're in a position, Facebook is a good example, where we're going to have to take a look. And that will cast a bit of a gray cloud over those kinds of companies and perhaps the market as a whole.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Tech stocks?</p><p>DOLL: The big tech stocks that have grown like a weed and aren't domiciled anywhere and don't pay taxes anywhere, this is a place where the government is going to look.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you allocate capital then right now?</p><p>DOLL: So in my view you de-emphasize some of those stocks. You can still own tech but you own Mastercard and Visa and Cisco on the value side. You be a little more value-oriented in tech.</p><p>I think you still have to own some financials, Maria. I wouldn't give up on the consumer, selected places are still good as a result of the tax bill we talked about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you worried about trade?</p><p>DOLL: You have to be worried about trade. When you put -- a tariff is a tax. Look, I'm --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DOLL: -- period, period, period.</p><p>Now, I know we've got to find a way to go after China because they don't play by the right rules. Everybody sees that, even the free traders. So we've got to find out a way to do that. So, you know, we started with a tariff on steel and aluminum for everybody.</p><p>Wait a minute, Mexico and Canada, you're our friends. We won't go there, maybe not Europe. Maybe this will get down to China.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, that's how I see it. I talk about Facebook -- that potential regulation. I see these tariffs and now companies have to ask for exemptions or even countries. That's additional regulation. You're putting up hurdles and who does that hurt? It hurts small business. This is something that President Trump knows.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, even those countries that will be exempt, there will be quotas in place. So you will say ok, Canada, you're exempt from the tariffs but here's the amount of product we will take in terms of imports. There will be quotas instituted. They don't want over-capacity.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And some of those countries are also talking about taxing those tech companies in Europe as well. So that's a headline that dovetails with what Dagen had to say. I agree with that. So that's a little -- another little gray cloud over there that we didn't have before.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bob -- great to see you.</p><p>DOLL: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Bob Doll there.</p><p>Coming up, new scrutiny over self-driving cars, the very latest as police release a dash-cam video of that deadly crash involving one of Uber's autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Then, behind the mask, comedian Jim Carrey showing his true colors with a controversial painting believed to be White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Her father is with us, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will weigh in on an unflattering portrayal of his daughter.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back good Tuesday - - good Thursday morning to you (inaudible). Thanks for joining us everybody. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 22nd. Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the east coast. Fears of a trade war sparking worries on Wall Street this morning. Ahead of the President's announcement on China tariffs and restrictions to investment here in the U.S. Futures indicating a decline of almost 200 points this morning, down 3/4 of a percent.</p><p>This after modest losses yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time this year. As you can see, yesterday's close was down fractional across the board. Markets across the globe mixed. FTSE 100 down 3/4 of a percent. The CAC (inaudible) and the DAX index goes down better than 1 percent. We did have some manufacturing data out. The Flash Purchasing Management Index out of Europe and that is one of the reasons that markets turned lower and the losses are accelerating this morning.</p><p>Also Japan Flash Manufacturing also under pressure. Asia over night as you can see also weaker although the NIKKEI average reported economic data came out was up about 1 percent. A new twist in the firing of Andrew McCabe. Reports say that the former FBI Deputy Director authorized an investigation into Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury. Plus the subpoena loans the House Judiciary Committee set to demand documents on the Hilary Clinton email investigation as you hear her first. We have the very latest there. New developments in the Uber self-driving crash investigation. Police releasing new video showing the moments just before the collision.</p><p>And Jim Carrey not quite Picasso. The actor turned painter under fire over his portrait of a woman who looks very similar to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. An unbelievable moment in Kosovo's parliament. The opposition party sets off tear gas to disrupt the vote. Ralph Macchio is returning. The original Karate Kid making his comeback in a new YouTube series. All that coming up this morning. But first, the aspired FBI official Andrew McCabe reported oversaw a Federal criminal probe of Attorney General Jeff Sessions according to ABC News.</p><p>McCabe reportedly authorized an investigation into whether the Attorney General lacked candor during his Congressional testimony last year about contact with Russian operatives. Sessions long time personal lawyer responded in a statement which reads, \"The Special Counsel's Office has informed me that after interviewing the Attorney General and conducting an additional investigation. The Attorney General is not under investigation for false statements or perjury in his confirmation hearing testimony and related written submissions to Congress.\"</p><p>Joining us now is former presidential candidate from Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. Governor Huckabee, I find this really rich. I mean, you know, here's a guy who basically in spying on Michael Flynn and then releasing that to the press committed perjury right there. And - - and that is a felony for - - for what he did and he also lacked candor himself and apparently he was investigating Sessions.</p><p>HUCKABEE: There's a statement Maria, something about karma being, gee I can't remember the rest of the phrase. But I would say that it applies here. It's just remarkable. I - - I think it's fine that he wanted to take a look to see was Jeff Sessions dishonest. But for all the people who are just crying big crocodile tears because Andrew McCabe got fired, my gosh get over it. Andrew McCabe deserved to be fired according the Office of Professional Responsibility. It wasn't Donald Trump who fired him. It was his own FBI organization who said he had to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: And why should he get a pension. If he violated the basic fundamental code of ethics that he supposedly clearly understood.</p><p>BARITROMO: Yes. I mean - - we - - we want to move on to the spending and your tweet earlier. But - - but I find it really incredible that there are 1.2 million documents that the House Oversight and House Judiciary Committees have requested from the FBI and they've only sent 3,000 documents, 3,000 documents. That's why they are subpoenaing those documents this week. But, how does that happen? How do you blow off and stonewall the committees that have jurisdiction over you for so long?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well that's part of the problem when there's so much power that has been accumulated at the top of the FBI. And I think everybody tries to make the point, this isn't about the rank and file. This isn't about the organization but this is about the leadership and the corruption that has so permeated that organization that they think they have the right to slow walk getting documents over to the Oversight committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: That they are constitutionally required to be accountable for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HUCKABEE: It's absurd and I'm glad Bob Goodlatte is saying, here's a subpoena.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Cough up - - cough up the stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, by the way, Jason Chavitz tried that too and they - - they - - he didn't get anywhere either. He - - he - - remember when he interrupted a meeting and said you are served. But anyway, let me switch gears because Arkansas Congressman and House Budget Committee Chairman Steve Womack responded to your tweet. Your tweet called out Republicans about the Federal spending bill and you - - you called it a disgusting bill. Just say no to Pelosi. Here's what he said earlier right here on the program.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: They needed to make concessions to pay for the military governor.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well look, Steve is a good friend and I love him. He's a great Congressman but I'm going to just say this. Not one Republican in that body got elected to fund Planned Parenthood, not fund the Border Wall, give up for sanctuary cities, trash the 2nd Amendment. They were elected to go and do a job that stopped that kind of funding but it did fund the military. So lay it on the table and tell the Democrats. We're going to fund the military but we're not going to fund some of your pet projects and you can either be the ones that keep us from having a strong military or you can join us. And if you think that we're wrong than you go get elected to the majorities.</p><p>These guys have got to start learning to play some hardball. They have surrendered to Schumer and Pelosi and to a minority, and there is just no excuse for just giving up this quickly. And if the government has to shutdown in order to push that point, then maybe that's what has to happen and lay it around the necks of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Democrats who think that killing unborn children is more important than being able to preserve the boarders and the security of the United States of America. That's what's at stake and it's time for them to stand up and do what they sent them there to do and if they can't, get some more people and let them have a shot at it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Governor, Mitch Roschelle. One of the things when I talk to business leaders I hear a lot of this fear about the mid-term elections and how that could shift policy for the balance of this Administration's first term. How could this budget issue play out in the mid-terms and be used as sort of fodder for beating up some Republican candidates?</p><p>HUCKABEE: I - - I'll be very blunt. If the Republicans surrender on this bill and spend that kind of money on stuff that Republicans find immoral and just absolutely unacceptable, then Republicans will lose. They will deserve to lose. We're going to have a lousy government under Democrats when Pelosi goes back in as Speaker. But it won't be the fault of the President and it won't be the fault of rank and file Republicans. It will be the fault of this Congress for not having the courage to stand up to these guys and say, we got elected. Why don't they just say what Obama did. Elections have consequences and roll that tape over and over and over again. Because I'll guarantee you the Democrats certainly didn't compromise with Republicans when they had the whole show.</p><p>FREEMAN: Governor, you make some good points on policies that Washington shouldn't be funding. But isn't the big problem here also the overall level of spending?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Of course it is. Yes, James it is. And I think that's another issue that Republicans went to Congress to cut this runaway spending. The - - the - - scenarios where Republicans are willing to spend. We're willing to spend to build a border wall, willing to fund the military but we're not willing to just say let's have a grab bag and everybody gets to throw in what they want. $1.3 trillion is - - is way beyond what is should be and the Republicans act like they don't have a choice.</p><p>And they're wringing their hands and they're sweating blood. Well it's time for them to stand up and say, nope. Again, we got elected - - we got elected to do some specific things, here are the specific things and if you don't want to vote for it we're going to tell the whole country that you thought that killing unborn babies and running up a huge deficit was more important to you than making sure that we had security and border protection.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Governor, let me switch gears, ask you about this crazy photo. Look, I know that as a father you're incredibly proud of Sarah, your daughter. She has to deal with constant everyday pushback from skeptics. Jim Carrey painted this. He - - the black lash is incredible after posting this photo. It's believed to be Sarah - - Sarah Huckabee Sanders, your daughter. Last week he tweeted out this picture with a caption that reads, this is the portrait of a so-called Christian who's only purpose in life is to lie for the wicked monstrous. So, the actor has drawn pictures criticizing President Trump as well. What do you say governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well first of all I think as far as his political leanings, we're going to just mark him down as undecided. He just hasn't been that clear where he stands.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HUCKABEE: But if he wants to paint some ridiculous looking cartoons, that's what political cartoonists do. That's one thing. I - - I'm not as so much offended by that. I think it's unfair and unflattering but my daughter's a beautiful person inside and out. Here's what I find and take offense to. It is the fact that he calls her a so-called Christian and accusing her of lies without listing what those lies are. And - - and to question someone's faith, you don't hear him talk about a so-called Muslim or a so-called Jew or a so-called Buddhist. I think it's just something that the left takes in vogue as to be able to attack people of the Christian faith and somehow believe that they become judge and jury as if they are the Father, Son and Holy Ghost when it comes to determining the authenticity of a person's faith. That's what I find most offensive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So rude, offensive. You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE: He doesn't know her faith. That's offensive.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And - - now I'll just add one thing. These people on the left, these spew. They spew hate at me all day long. If they spent a little more time trying to get HRC elected, they wouldn't be so doggone angry. Again, it's asymmetric rage. Angry at something, angry at something in a way that doesn't even make any sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But that's all - - that's all they do is shame people and name call. It's - - it's - - it's not even a fair fight. It's - - it's nothing of substance. It's just name calling, painting a picture of someone.</p><p>MCDOWELL: To be fair though, people - - ardent Trump supporters who are 100 percent on board with everything the President does like tariffs. I've gotten as much hate from Trump supporters when I talk about tariffs being a tax. So I think everybody needs to check their soul.</p><p>FREEMAN: The governor's daughter is earning all the right enemies here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well said. Sometimes you're known by your friends. Sometimes you're known by your enemies And I think, you know, if - - if those are her enemies than she's in very good shape.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, absolutely. Governor, good to see you sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Thanks a bunch. Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mike Huckabee there. Coming up a vote takes a violent turn in Kosovo. Look at this, the chaos after a tear gas grenade is set off in the middle of the tense debate.</p><p>Welcome back. Police releasing a disturbing video from last Sunday's accident when an Uber self driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe - - in Tempe, Arizona. Lauren Simonetti with the details.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Hello Maria. This is video we want to warn you that is pretty tough to watch. It shows the safety driver, the minder not looking at the road in the final moments before he hit - - hit a 49 year old Elaine Herzberg. This is believed to be the first fatal crash that involves the self-driving vehicle and a pedestrian. Uber has suspended testing of it's self-driving vehicles. Toyota has also halted it's tests on - - on public roads. But it begs the question, if you're minding the vehicle, do you have to pay attention at all times even though it's autonomous?</p><p>All right, take a look at this one. Some opposition lawmakers in Kosovo firing tear gas in the parliament chamber. They wanted to block a vote on a border deal with Montenegro. Despite this attack, the - - the measure was approved in an 80 to 11 vote. The border deal is set as a pre- condition by the European Union for Kosovo citizens to travel within it's visa free zone. So that's what some opposition leaders did there. And let's have - - let's lighten if up. Thirty-four years since Daniel LaRusso learned to wax on, wax off and his rivalry with Johnny Lawrence lives on in the YouTube Red series Cobra Kai.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: This is my childhood. YouTube releasing a trailer for the new series in which Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprise their roles. It's a show that premieres on May 2nd. (inaudible) takes place in a car dealership, in the future. I love it. Thank you.</p><p>(ROSCHELLE): Yes baby. Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I knew you were going to say that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, bidding like it is 1999. Your chance to buy a piece of Prince and other music legends. A first hand look at the iconic items hitting the auction block next.</p><p>From Michael Jackson to Elvis Presley and Prince, iconic celebrity items are coming to the auction block this weekend at GWS Auctions, Legends of Hollywood and Music Auction. We have some of the big items right here on set. And here joining me to tell us all about it is - - is Brigitte Kruse. She is owner and chief auctioneer of GWS Auction in Los Angeles. Brigitte, good to see you.</p><p>KRUSE: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. I love that you - - that you brought all this stuff. We're going to go through it. How did you get into this auction business?</p><p>KRUSE: You know what? It was a family business. I'm actually 5th generation so I don't think I had much choice to get into this business. It's - - it's a labor of love.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, you must love it. Because you've got all of these beautiful things and you - - what - - what moves the price in terms of some of these items?</p><p>KRUSE: That is a great question. It's mostly trends, what's popular, what's not. You know, you just kind of have to follow it. It changes from time to time. And then there's things, there's certain asset categories that just are timeless and always are popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes they sure are. So let's start with the Prince. The purple overcoat used by the late Prince during the filming of \"Purple Rain\". Tell us about this item.</p><p>KRUSE: This piece actually came from the daughter-in-law of one of the set designers from \"Purple Rain\". And with it being such an iconic film for that time, you know, I believe it grossed over $80 million in 1984 which was unheard of.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>KRUSE: So, you know, with the lace detail and little pearl inserts, it's just a lovely piece.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KRUSE: We're really excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think this will go for?</p><p>KRUSE: You know what, we're predicting somewhere conservatively in the $3,500 to $5,000 range.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see. OK. And - - and when people buy these items, they do it to collect and put them somewhere where they will just save them and cherish them and make sure that the value stays. You're not going to like wear it.</p><p>KRUSE: Definitely. And that's something that we do that's just a little bit different. We actually make sure that these pieces are perfect by the time they get to the bidder's hands. So if we have a successful bidder, we want to make sure that they receive the most pristine asset possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's look at this one. One of the rare left-handed version of Michael Jackson's trademark glove. Tell me about that one.</p><p>KRUSE: So, this is what they consider the second generation Michael Jackson glove. There is the Bill Witten (ph) glove who is, you know, he is infamous for helping Michael Jackson create the first generation. And this is the Michael Bush-Dennis Tompkins era, which is kind of the second generation glove. So this was more during the time, right when he married Lisa Marie.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. And then the other one that we wanted to see, Michael Jackson item is the fedora owned by the King of Pop. Tell me about that one.</p><p>KRUSE: Oh yes. He made an empire out of fedoras. So - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're both his?</p><p>KRUSE: Yes. They're both his.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Go ahead.</p><p>KRUSE: And the neat story with these is there was a gentleman who made a donation by way of an art piece to one of Michael Jackson's charitable foundations. And in - - in time he gave them three fedoras. So these are two of those three fedoras and they actually are - - they have great providence. They come with a letter of authenticity from MJJ Productions which is as solid as it gets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So cool. And this bid starts at $500.</p><p>KRUSE: Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So let's go through this one, speaking of kings. You have an Army book owned and autographed by Elvis Presley himself.</p><p>KRUSE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>KRUSE: This is one of my favorite items because at the time, in 1958 when he went to Germany, a lot of people think that that was kind of a turning point for his career. Because they say that he never quite came back the same. But what makes this piece so special is this was when he met Priscilla over in Germany when he was stationed there. And this Army book actually belonged to someone who served with him and he got so excited when he saw him, will you please sign it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How fantastic.</p><p>KRUSE: And it's - - it's never been offered at auction before.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where do you think that starts at?</p><p>KRUSE: You know what, the bid is currently at $3,300 and I'm going to tell you. I am surprised by that. So, you know, I think we might end up in the $5,000 range by the time we have auction (inaudible).</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's an interesting item. That's - - that's history right there.</p><p>KRUSE: It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The blue fir smock worn by Lady Gaga on American Horror Story. This is just fabulous.</p><p>KRUSE: It is actually what we call a bi-lateral celebrity piece. Because it was also worn by Halle Barry in \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\", the Frankie Limon story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>KRUSE: So, this has got a really cool back story. And this came from one of our wardrobe houses in Hollywood.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So where - - where - - where - - why do you have it? I mean, after - - after those two celebrities wore it?</p><p>KRUSE: A lot of these places have to do asset management. You know, they have to take care of these assets, get them in, get them out after they've been used so many times. So we were just fortunate enough to be the one in line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick. The big pair of sunglasses owned by the late Steve McQueen.</p><p>KRUSE: Yes. Oh my gosh, the Versoles (ph). I mean, he was known for the folding sunglasses. So we're excited about those and the bid is already over $5,000. So - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very cool. Brigitte, thank you.

Good Friday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, January 19th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shutdown showdown -- the House doing its part to avoid a government  shutdown, passing a short-term spending bill last night that will keep the  government funded through February 16th.  However, now it is on to the  Senate where passage remains anything but certain.  One of the major  hurdles: immigration reform, specifically a DACA deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Department of Justice has asked the Supreme Court to overturn a lower  court ruling that blocks the President's decision to phase out the program.   This comes as a new report says as nearly four million Dreamers are in the  U.S. -- a far greater number than originally known.  The latest on  immigration reform, coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning: stocks pulled back slightly yesterday but all three  major indices closed at their second highest level in history.  Yesterday  the Dow down 97 points and part of the reason -- bonds, the yields went up.   The 10-year yield rose to the highest level in nearly four years topping  2.6 percent yesterday.  It remains at that level right now.</p><p>Futures this morning nonetheless bouncing back -- take a look.  We've got  the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 92 points reversing all of yesterday's  selloff.  The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also positively.</p><p>In Europe this morning, similar story.  Money is moving into equities; FT  100 up a quarter of a percent, CAC 40 up almost half a percent, the DAX in  Germany up almost 1 percent.</p><p>Check the Asian markets -- stocks ended the week higher, as you see there.   Best performers were in Asia -- Shanghai and Hang Seng.</p><p>An alarming report to report -- a confidential intelligence memo that  alleges abuses made by government surveillance is being called \"troubling\"  by lawmakers.  Several Republicans want that memo to be made public.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SCOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA:  You knew as soon as you read them and  you think about -- is this happening in America or is it the KGB?  That is  how alarming it is.  </p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO:  What I read today in that classified briefing  room is as bad as I thought it was and every single American citizen should  have the ability to see that information, to know exactly what our FBI was  up to.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So they want to release the memo -- how it ties to Robert  Mueller's Russia probe, coming up.</p><p>Plus Starbucks brewing up a place on Fortune's list of the world's most  admired companies.  It is not number one -- find out who took that top  spot.</p><p>Plus the relationship with the U.S. not the only icy thing in Vladimir  Putin's life.  Check this out.  Why the Russian leader takes a dip in  freezing water.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to break it all  down: former State Department spokesperson, national security adviser to  President Obama's presidential campaign and Fox News contributor Marie Harf  is here; the King's College business and economics professor Brian  Brenberg; and Fox Business Network's Connell McShane.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN HOST:  We can't unsee that, can we?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's the morning -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  No.  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I will never get that two minutes back.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Why did you do that then?  </p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  We already this serious conversation  and then that picture shows up.  You can't remember what you're -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He loves taking off his shirt.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I was about to make a comment -- you know, it's interesting the  markets (INAUDIBLE).  No matter what they kind of -- and then Putin with no  shirt.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARF:  Happy Friday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  Happy Friday.</p><p>MCSHANE:  It is kind of interesting that the markets -- I mean if they're  worried about a government shutdown, right, it's kind of a funny way for  stocks showing it.  They keep on bouncing back.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Maybe a little bit of dollar weakness leading up to this but --  I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You would think that the market is looking for any excuse to  sort of come in just a little after almost, you know, $7.5 trillion in  value in the last year and a half.  And yes, even a government shutdown.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  They must be expecting it to be short.  But I just don't know if  they're going to pull this together in time.  I think Republicans need  something like 12 votes in the Senate in order to get something passed.   Can they do that?</p><p>BRENBERG:  No.</p><p>HARF:  Not by tonight.  I don't think by tonight.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Twelve -- I don't think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big victory in the House because the Freedom Caucus was sort of  pushing, pushing, and actually they were able to rally up the votes and  pass it in the House.</p><p>But now, once again -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Short term maybe.  It's the only thing, right.  Maybe they get to  four or five -- four-day -- they were talking about that last night.  Maybe  something real short-term but there's no way, to your point, to get to 60  on this bill.  No way.</p><p>HARF:  Certainly not.  And not by tonight.  I think they want to make a  point here.  And with a one vote majority in the Senate on the Republican  side -- some folks still not in D.C. I think we shut down for a few days.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  But I think Democrats are really gambling here that Republicans  get blamed for this.  And I just don't know.  I mean I know that's the  trend in the past.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG:  But the way this is shaping up now, especially with the good  news on taxes, the Democrats -- </p><p>HARF:  They're in charge though, man.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I don't know.  I don't know -- Maria.  You've got confidence  there.  But I think this could go the other way.</p><p>HARF:  We'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that and obviously talking about that  all morning this morning.</p><p>Joining the conversation, the counselor to the President -- President  Trump, Kellyanne Conway will join me, coming up.  She will weigh in on the  shocking memo circulating in Congress that allegedly details FISA abuses  and the shutdown showdown in the Senate.  She'll join us shortly.  You  don't want to miss that.</p><p>First though this -- this top story.  And that is the looming government  shutdown.  Congress is deadlocked over the passage of a four-week stop gap  spending, keeping Capitol Hill open past today's deadline.  Tensions are  flaring across the aisle.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Senator Schumer -- do not  shutdown the federal government.  It is risky.  It is reckless.  And it is  wrong.</p><p>I ask the American people to understand this.  The only people standing in  the way of keeping the government open are Senate Democrats.  </p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  I'm not trying to  play for political points, even false ones.  I am trying to get us to come  together on a bipartisan nature to get something done.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning is New York Republican Congressman and  Trump transition team executive committee member Chris Collins.   Congressman -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK:  Yes.  Good to be with you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  What are the chances of a government  shutdown?  </p><p>COLLINS:  Well, you know, we got our job done in the House yet again.  And  this would be a Chuck Schumer shutdown.  The Schumer shutdown does look  like a possibility.  I've just got to hope as he looks into his political  playbook, he realizes he's going to wear this one.</p><p>And we don't know but again, the House did our job.  And it would be a  shame for America to have Senator Schumer not deliver the Democrat vote.   He is all political all the time.  There's no two ways about it.</p><p>I remind people when we saw the tears last time they were real.  He wanted  to be majority leader of the Senate and he still does.</p><p>And so, you know, he is trying to weigh who wears this.  He's not looking  out for what is best for America.  He's looking out what is best for  senator Schumer and how does this play into his desire to be the majority  leader of the Senate.  It is that simple.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do the voters know that?  I mean are the voters going to  hold him accountable come November, you think?  I mean -- or do you think  the Republicans get blamed should the government shutdown?</p><p>COLLINS:  Well, because we did, Maria, passed this in the House, the  Republicans passed it in the House.  The Democrats one and all voted  against the six-year extension of the Child Health Insurance Program --  something that's always been bipartisan.</p><p>And if Senator Schumer says he is looking out for the DACA or the dreamers  I'd like to remind him and remind America back in 2009 and '10 when Harry  Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama controlled the government in its entirety  with 60 senators, they did nothing for these DACA kids other than as Obama  said, \"I've got a phone and a pen\".  He signed an executive order that  effectively expired when he left office.</p><p>So it begs the question Senator Schumer, why didn't the Democrats fix our  immigration issues back in 2009 and '10 when they could have.  And oh, by  the way, why didn't you raise minimum wage back in 2009 and '10 when you  could have?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I wonder if your concerned though about the perception of it  because the Democratic argument here will be that -- hey we've had --  whatever it is 17, 18 shutdowns going back to the 70s but we've never had  one quite like this where one party had the House, the Senate and the White  House.  </p><p>They're going to basically say, as I think Marie said a few minutes, hey  listen, you guys are in charge.  And that argument might resonate.  Are you  concerned with that politically? </p><p>COLLINS:  Well, here is what I hope politically if this does happen that  Leader McConnell realizes it's time to get rid of the filibuster once and  for all.  Because again, we've done it now and the Supreme Court judges  because of senator Schumer. I'll say thank you Senator Schumer for being  such an obstructionist that we had no choice but get rid of the filibuster  through Supreme Court judges.</p><p>Well, maybe here is another example why that rule of the Senate, it's not  in the constitution.  It's nothing more than an archaic rule that should be  eliminated.  Now then you could blame us.  But when you need 60 votes in  the Senate and it's Senator Schumer that's got to deliver.  </p><p>This is a Schumer shutdown were it to occur -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>COLLINS:  -- and I think we would absolutely remind the American public of  that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which is why the President is tweeting on this right now  actually.  He just tweeted on the shutdown saying this, \"Government funding  bill passed last night in the House of Representatives.  Now Democrats are  needed if it is to pass in the Senate.  But they want illegal immigration  and a weak border.  Shutdown coming?  We need more Republican victories in  2018.\"</p><p>So Congressman Collins -- How are you going to get more Republican  victories in 2018 when you are sitting on the precipice of a government  shutdown and the perception will be that Republicans are at fault?  </p><p>COLLINS:  Well, that is perception and we've got to make sure the reality - - the truth comes out and we are sitting now on the most historic tax  reform in 31 years.  And now worker after worker is going to see more money  in their paycheck.  </p><p>And that's the playbook we have is the fundamental tax reform, more money  in workers' pockets, higher 401(k), balances, the economy rocking and  rolling, and we're company after company increasing their starting wages.   And we will make sure that anyone and everyone knows this is, if it  happens, Schumer shutdown.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  But Congressman, you know, to that point, even if this looks  like -- even if people think it is the Schumer shutdown, the problem is  this news dominates headlines instead of the news we've seen over past few  days with Apple and other companies.</p><p>To me the Republicans are going to lose with the shutdown either way  because the good news story, and it's a great news story on tax cuts, just  is not going to get through.</p><p>Frankly I think Democrats like that.  I think that's why they are gunning  for a shutdown here.  </p><p>COLLINS:  Oh, there's no doubt that Senator Schumer is looking -- but it's  risky for him -- at the political outcomes here.  And again, now that we  passed it in the House, it is the Democrats we need in the Senate. </p><p>So we will have to see how this plays out.  Both parties lose, America  loses and that is what I'd be saying to Senator Schumer.  Let's do what's  right for America.  </p><p>We should also remind all Americans, all essential services in the  government will continue, our military and everyone else.  And we're not  going to do the little things that Obama did when we had the shutdown in  '13 like make sure that he put blockades at the turnarounds in the parks  and he closed the World War II Memorial where there is not even any  employees there.</p><p>Barack Obama tried to inflict pain on America in the last shutdown.  That  is not the way Donald Trump -- President Trump operates.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>COLLINS:  We would make this as easy as we could, a shutdown is not good  for America but essential services will continue and I'm confident that  under President Trump the World War II Memorial will be open.  </p><p>HARF:  Congressman, we definitely heard your message to Senator Schumer.   That came across loud and clear.  Do you also have a message for Senator  McConnell and your Republican colleagues in the Senate some of whom have  also said they are against voting for this?  You know, you don't have  Democrats on board but there are still a number of Republican holdouts.   What is your message to your colleagues across the aisle here to get them  on board?</p><p>COLLINS:  Well, my message to Senator McConnell and the Republicans is get  rid of the filibuster.  Then you can blame us.</p><p>And you know, last night we were having to whip out many of our House  Republicans to make sure we got the votes.  So the fact that there are  people that may be leaning yes or undecided in the Senate, we had that last  night in the House.  And we delivered.</p><p>And I'm sure that if there was no filibuster we would deliver in the Senate  as well.  So that's my message to Leader McConnell.  Get rid of the  filibuster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- let's talk about New York for a moment -- a  knife to the Big Apple -- on New York State.  Apparently New Yorkers are  bearing the brunt of tax reform negatives most significantly the  elimination of the SALT deduction -- that $10,000 federal property tax.   And then what can be for New Yorkers who are struggling with tax reform  fallout, tell us how you see it?</p><p>And then there's this.  The cover story of the \"New York Post\" today, \"Land  of the Fee: look out Uber, state is pushing $11.50 toll just to go below  60th street\".  So we're going to have -- they are proposing putting tolls  within New York City -- to go from uptown to downtown?  </p><p>COLLINS:  Sure.  Well, first of all Maria -- 95 percent of New Yorkers are  going to have a significant tax cut.  Certainly up in my district in  western New York, the Buffalo area it's probably 98 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>COLLINS:  What we're hearing is Senator Schumer and King Andrew Cuomo  fighting for the millionaires and the billionaires on Long Island, it's  quite the juxtaposition as the Republicans are fighting for the working  class, the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>COLLINS:  And we've got our supposedly progressive or actually progressive  governor fighting for the millionaires but 95 percent, 98 percent of New  Yorkers are going to see a -- basically a $2,000 a year increase.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  No, I'm aware of that.  I'm aware of that --  Congressman.  But you know, the elimination of the SALT deduction is going  to mean higher taxes for some people. </p><p>COLLINS:  Only the wealthy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Cuomo -- and the governor -- the governor has been  complaining about it.  Now he is threatening he needs to battle congestion,  capitalize on a cash injection by placing tolls on New York City blocks.  </p><p>COLLINS:  Well, this governor has never seen a tax he didn't like or want  to hike.  And now he's going to look for new taxes that he can impose on  us.  And this is just -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there any shot that that passes, tolls within New York City?  </p><p>COLLINS:  Who knows?  I mean with this governor he has -- he rules with an  iron fist -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>COLLINS:  -- and anyone and everyone knows because he controls all the  economic development dollars in New York, you vote his way or you will pay  a price.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Congressman let me switch gears real quick, get your take  on this FISA frenzy -- the circulation of a confidential intelligence memo.   It alleges surveillance abuses made by the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act\", sending shockwaves throughout Congress.</p><p>How do you see it?  Lawmakers -- some of your colleagues are saying that  they want this memo to be made public, reigniting concerns that there is  corruption at the top of the FBI, collusion with Hillary Clinton and the  leadership of the FBI.  </p><p>COLLINS:  Well, Maria -- I'm going to be seeing that memo at 9:00 this  morning.  So I have not yet been down into the secure area to read it  myself.  I'll be doing that in about an hour or maybe two hours from now.  </p><p>But if it is as it's being discussed, something that should be released,  you know, this is America.  We're a democracy.  We should be sharing good  news and bad news with our public and trust that our democracy will hold  up.</p><p>So I have not seen it yet but if it is as you are portraying it I would  tend to be another one that would be saying let's release it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, your colleague, Matt Gaetz, last night on Fox News said I  believe there are people who will go to jail over the intel memo.  So we'd  like to know what's in that memo.</p><p>COLLINS:  Well, I will know in about two hours' time.  But -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should they release the memo?  They've got hashtag --  #ReleasetheMemo that they are circulating.  Do you have any problem not  releasing the memo?  </p><p>COLLINS:  I'm somebody that believes we should live in an open and  transparent society.  So I have not read it yet but I would certainly be  someone that would lean towards releasing it.  I would have to see some  compelling reason not to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- thank you.  We'll see you soon.  Thanks.</p><p>COLLINS:  Good to be with you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chris Collins there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>A suspected serial killer in Arizona now linked to nine killings in three  weeks.  Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this has really rocked the town of  Phoenix -- Maria.  Thirty-five-year-old Cleophus Cooksey Jr. was arrested  in Phoenix last month in connection with the fatal shootings of his mother  and his stepfather.</p><p>Well now he faces additional charges for allegedly killing seven other  people late last year.  Police say that shell casings and cell phone  records have linked Cooksey to the other murders.  He is right now being  held on $5 million bond.</p><p>Well, Pope Francis is under fire in Chile.  The Pontiff accusing clerical  sex abuse victims of slander just days after meeting with survivors and  asking for forgiveness.  Now Francis is defending Bishop Juan Barros who is  accused of covering up the alleged sex crimes committed by a local priest  saying there is no proof against the bishop.  The comments left Chileans  stunned especially since the Pope's trip to Chile was meant to help change  local opinions on the Catholic Church following the abuse scandal.</p><p>Meanwhile the Pope also taking on the role of first responder, halting his  motorcade as you can see there, a policewoman fell off her horse.  Well,  the Pope stood by the woman, he comforted her while waiting for the  ambulance to arrive.  Luckily she was not seriously hurt.  But she took  quite a still off of her horse next to the Pontiff.</p><p>And then finally there is this -- Maria, just in time for breakfast.   Russian President Vladimir Putin is stripping down to his bathing trunks  and he does it on national TV.  He immersed himself in the freezing waters  of a lake yesterday.  This is an Orthodox Christian ritual to mark the  feast of Epiphany.</p><p>Air temps at the time about 21 degrees Fahrenheit.  And there he goes  dipping himself in the water.  Oh, we missed the shot coming back out.  Oh,  well.  Sorry.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  They cut the video.  It's too short.  I think we wanted to see the  reveal. </p><p>MCSHANE:  He doesn't like shirts.  He doesn't like shirts.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He loves taking his shirt off.  </p><p>HARF:  And being photographed taking his shirt off.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I don't know.</p><p>HARF:  There's always photographers there.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I know Brian -- I know you like to dip in the East River but at  least there's no photographers around with you.</p><p>BRENBERG:  That's right.</p><p>MCSHANE:  It might have been different -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRENBERG:  I have that same jacket.</p><p>HARF:  And those boots, I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh boy.  All right.  We're taking a break.</p><p>Coming up, trouble for Takata, the additional car models being recalled  over airbag concerns -- we've got it coming up.</p><p>And then a scientific breakthrough that can catch cancer early -- details  on this revolutionary new test that could save thousands of lives.  Really  exciting -- later this hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>A warning for investors in this week's \"Wall Street Journal\".  And op-ed  this week titled \"stocks headed for a fall\" appearing in Wednesday's paper  saying rising interest rates could trigger declines.</p><p>Joining us now, the author of that op-ed is Marty Feldstein is here right  now, Harvard professor, former council of economic advisers chairman under  President Reagan.  Great to see you -- Marty.</p><p>Martin Feldstein, Harvard professor:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So how significant a fall  might we be looking at?  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  It could be very big.  I mean the market is up so much, driven  by the Fed.  Now the Fed is reversing, it's pushing up interest rates,  undoing long-term bonds so as interest rates.  It's undoing the big buy of  long-term bonds.  So I think as interest rates right, we could see stock  market go back to a much more normal price-earnings ratio.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you're saying driven by the Fed.  I mean just since the  election of Donald Trump, this market's up $7.5 trillion in value.  What do  you think about monetary policy going away, it's been so easy, and fiscal  policy sort of taking a lead here?  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  It's not going to do it.  I mean the news about the advantages  of the tax bill are in the market already.  The real problem is going  forward we will see a rising interest rate for a lot of reasons, not just  the Fed but the fiscal deficit will push up long-term interest rates as  well.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  Will we know it when we see it?  When the markets starts to  turn?  Is it going to happen real quick do you think?  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  It always happens faster than you think.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Yes.  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the trigger?  </p><p>BRENBERG:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the trigger?</p><p>FELDSTEIN:  The trigger is people wake up and say well, maybe I ought to  get out.  And enough people say that and the market moves.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  But to Maria's point, your op-ed is great but it paints a very,  very bleak picture.  I read it and was sort of downcast for half the day  after reading.  But is it not possible that there could be an unwind to the  balance sheet and there could be a rising of interest rates in such a way  that doesn't trigger, you know, a downturn in the market?  Can this be done  in a soft steady gradual way?  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  Well, that's what the Fed hopes.  That's what I hope.  But I  think if, excuse me, if interest rates really do go back to, quote,  \"normal\". So we see a short-term rate that moves up a couple of points, if  we see the loan rate go from 2.5 to 4, 4.5 -- it's hard to believe the  stock market won't notice that.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  But you've got the tax cuts on the table.  We haven't talked  about regulation.  Yet some people would say -- </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  All that is good stuff.</p><p>BRENBERG:  -- you're underestimating the ability of businesses and the  economy to move forward because you have the juice from the regulation.   You have the juice from the tax cut -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really important point that you're making, the  regulatory rollback is being talked about as one of the big movers of the  stock market and the economy.  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  And I certainly believe that it has done that and has  contributed to it.  But if you look at what they price-earnings ratios are  relative to the past.  They are up dramatically relative to where they have  been historically.</p><p>Some of that you can -- well, and they have been there even before the  Trump victory.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's go to the numbers here because earnings are expected to  be up 23 percent in 2018 compare that to valuations.  23 percent for the  S&amp;P 500 is the estimate.</p><p>FELDSTEIN:  So where is the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The PE is -- </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  PE is well, 24 and where was it historically, around 16.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking backward, 24.  Because forward is about 17.5 to  18 -- 18 times earnings if you look at forward earnings. </p><p>Right.  The PE going forward for 2018 would be 18 and the markets and  earnings are supposed to be up 23 percent.  But -- you know.</p><p>FELDSTEIN:  But it's probably true that if you went back historically and  you did forward-looking PEs, they were always lower than the historic  actual backward looking PE.  So I think -- you can't compare the historic  number -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- to the forward.  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  -- to the forward.</p><p>BRENBERG:  You're talking about the people who want you to be wrong  basically.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRENBERG:  You just want to be right.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FELDSTEIN:  I think the real problem is what happens if there is this  downturn -- </p><p>BRENBERG:  Right.</p><p>FELDSTEIN:  -- and the fed doesn't really have the ability to offset it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Downturn in the market or downturn in the economy?  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  In the economy.  If we get a big downturn in the market  consumers are going to respond negatively and businesses are going to  respond negatively.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Marty -- where is the downturn in the economy?  I mean  we're talking about 4 percent growth?  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  It's not there now.  It is certainly not there now.</p><p>MCSHANE:  So you don't think the economy is as strong as people are making  it out to be.  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  No.  I think the economy is fine as long as the market doesn't  turn down.  If the market turns down because of higher interest rates, or  because of external events, if the market turns down, then that will push  us off this very nice path that we're on.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  You must have one piece of good advice for policymakers and how  they can handle all this.  How they can manage all this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  How do you deal with it?</p><p>FELDSTEIN:  Well, I think they have to look beyond the fed.  I think the  Congress, the administration has to say what will we do if the economy  turns down because the Fed is not going to be in a position to cut rates  substantially.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there any other stimulus away from the Fed that can be put  in there?  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  It's called tax and spending policy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's really spending because tax policy we've got. </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  We've got that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FELDSTEIN:  Yes.  And it has to be -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really on the spending.</p><p>FELDSTEIN:  Right.  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marty -- great to see you.  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And you weren't all Dr. Doom.  </p><p>FELDSTEIN:  No, no.  No, I wish I had a different picture about what the  risks are.  But I would say the economy is in great shape but very fragile.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Marty Feldstein joining us there.  We'll see you  soon, sir.  Thank you so much.</p><p>FELDSTEIN:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, troubling claims over government surveillance abuse  -- details on the shocking memo circulating in Congress that some lawmakers  want Americans to read for themselves.

In the space  of a month they voted against a historic tax cut that's leading to  thousands of new jobs; they are repatriating trillions of dollars of  wealth; people they know are getting bonuses and raises and having job  security; and capital investments by the major employers in our country.</p><p>And now to be on the wrong side of history and is saying, no to military  funding, no to funding children's health programs, no to federal workers  being able to rely on the next paycheck, all on the altar of DACA, an issue  that the president told the whole world transparently, a week ago Maria in  that hour-long meeting that he's willing to negotiate and he's willing to  come to a deal.</p><p>So, it's -- it's very concerning that the Democrats are willing to shut  down the government based on that one issue that has a March deadline not a  January 19th deadline.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean you know, Chuck Schumer has said in the past that a  shutdown would be terrible, would be 'stupid,' I think this is one of his -  one of his words.</p><p>And the president has also been vocal about avoiding a shutdown as it's  going to put a damper on the military.</p><p>So, what are the implications?  I mean is there a plan in place should  there be a shutdown in terms of keeping you know, government workers,  sailors (ph), I mean you know, so many who will actually see their  paychecks stopped.</p><p>CONWAY:  And that's the regrettable part and you can play almost any  Democrat's previous statements about government shutdowns and they should  be reminded of that. </p><p>I don't - I don't understand why many of these Democrats and --  auditioning for 2020 are playing to a very left wing, out of - out-of-touch  base and I think imperiling a lot of those red states Democrats who are  going to take some really tough votes today Maria, they have to decide up  or down whether they are for this or that and in addition to those programs  at risk that I just mentioned, that we hope continue to be fully funded.</p><p>You see the CHIP extension, the 9 million or so children who rely on the  Children's Health Program, the House took action on that last night, the  president is committed as he has said in tweets and otherwise, you see the  military funding.</p><p>But also, there's opioid treatment centers, this is the boiling (ph) issue  of our times, a crisis next door, how in the world are some of these  senators going to go home and justify a vote against funding that.</p><p>So, I - look we always have a plan in place here.  This is Donald Trump's  White House, he's had a tremendous year of progress and movement but I just  hope we don't come to that.</p><p>I really - when they - when they meet again together at 11:00 a.m. --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CONWAY:  -- we hope the Senate will come together and people will realize  in the light of day how terrible it would be to the people who don't  deserve to be left on the altar of petty partisan politics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president was expected to go to Florida this weekend, FOX  NEWS is reporting that \"the president will delay his departure to Mar-a- Lago until after he signs a Continuing Resolution,\" is that -- is that a  fact and is that a sign that he expects a deal?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well the president is very hopeful that the Senate will do the  right thing today and follow his lead in the lead of the House in keeping  this government open.</p><p>We are open to a short-term fix but it is not preferable --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CONWAY:  -- and we want that two-year deal or so, it is not preferable -  and the president -- let me repeat, everybody knows it from last week but  geez 10 days is a long time in Washington D.C., people will get amnesia  when they - selective amnesia.</p><p>The fact is Maria, this president has said, 'he's willing to get a deal in  DACA.' but when he talks about Immigration, the president is talking about  four big points, as you know, 'end to chain migration,' 'end to diversity  visa lottery system,' he wants the 'border wall' obviously and the funding  for it and then the 'DACA.'</p><p>But he also has a big 70-point Immigration plan, anybody can pull up, which  also includes things like a 'merit-based' Immigration system; 10,000 new  ICE agents at the border, et cetera, and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>So, this is important because when the - when the president talks about  Immigration, he's talking about a number of different items.</p><p>When the Democrats talk about it, they're talking about DACA only and now  when they talk about what's important to them, it's only DACA, DACA, right,  this makes no sense when the deadline is in March.</p><p>You know, the president is willing to negotiate --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>By the way Kellyanne, there is a report that there are 4 million  'dreamers,' we've been going with the number 800,000.  Is it -- what's the  number?</p><p>CONWAY:  -- I don't know.</p><p>I've seen all different types of figures.  The fact is I don't know the  answer.</p><p>But we do know that they've been - many of them have been on Capitol Hill  this week protesting --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Yes --</p><p>CONWAY:  -- and --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT:  We Are Here to Stay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- yes.  I can see that.</p><p>CONWAY:  -- and locking arms with some of the Democrats.</p><p>I think they should be protesting the Democratic offices.</p><p>Why aren't they out there saying, \"Look, the president has done the  unexpected.\"</p><p>He has said that - he was - he'-- he's s given us a six-month extension to  - he's giving you Congress who's failed to act --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CONWAY:  -- a six-month extension act, let's - let's review very quickly.</p><p>The Congress had nine months in 2017 Maria to do something, to do their job  on DACA to fix what president - what President Obama did by not going  through Congress, and actually even not going through Congress and now it's  an extra six months and still they haven't come up with a solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>Let me -- let me turn to issues of privacy Kellyanne, there is a memo being  called 'blockbuster,' shocking memo circulating in Congress alleging US  government's surveillance abuses, abuses at the top of the FBI certainly.</p><p>Some lawmakers are insisting that this memo be made public for Americans to  read it for themselves.</p><p>Listen to this?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FLA), MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  The  Intelligence memo that we have just read is so alarming that it must be  immediately disclosed to the American people and the disclosure of this  intelligence document must be a top priority for the country immediately.</p><p>I cannot stress how important that is.</p><p>Any American that would see this document would feel as though people like  Rod Rosenstein and Bruce Orr need to be fired immediately.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO:  Wait a minute, this actually happened from our  Justice Department and this FBI, that's how serious this is --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this memo obviously goes right to the Robert Mueller  investigation, the Special Counsel because we know that at the top of the  FBI, FBI agents like Peter Strauch talking to his girlfriend Lisa Page  saying that, 'they needed an insurance policy in place should Donald Trump  win the presidency.' </p><p>Then you've got the number three guy at the Department of Justice, Bruce  Orr, his wife working for Fusion GPS who came up with that dossier, and  whether or not the dossier was actually used as the justification to wire- tap Trump Tower.</p><p>What's your take on this?</p><p>Will this memo be released to the public so that the rest of us could see  what has gone on here?</p><p>CONWAY:  Maria, let's hope so.</p><p>And the reason is very simple, we have spent over a year of taxpayer  dollars and precious time when Americans could have been informed about  what this president has done for veterans; for taxpayers; for property  owners; for coal miners; for anybody facing crushing regulations and  unspeakable tax burdens; what he's done for security, ISIS in retreat;  transparency; accountability; and prosperity.</p><p>We spent a year talking about Russia in this nation.  People have tried to  nullify his election from day one and try to discredit him so all those  folks, all those outlets who have this screaming Russia graphics are  screaming graphics about shenanigans during the campaign last year, they  ought to dust them off and we ought to see the memo.</p><p>I've not seen the memo.  I can't comment, I'm not in Congress.</p><p>But in the issue - in the - in the interest of transparency and  accountability and in interest of fair play here --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are people who want to know if there's going to be --</p><p>CONWAY:  -- That's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- criminal --</p><p>CONWAY:  -- right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- prosecution here Kellyanne, where's the accountability?</p><p>We're in America, if we cannot trust the FBI, the -- agencies like the IRS,  the CIA are going to be independent thinking then why do we say we are in a  free country?</p><p>CONWAY:  Well and this is a very important point because people watching  right now are going to try to say that you or I or both of us are being  mean to the FBI or discrediting them (ph).</p><p>No, we're not.</p><p>There are roughly 25,000 or so men and women working at the FBI; the  president has made it very clear many times, including going down to  Quantico last month, that he respects the rank-and-file.</p><p>We're talking about apparently a few bad actors but they were in positions  of real power and they were --they had positions of power with respect to  an investigation.</p><p>And we see now, we're starting to see that this is a - this is why - this  is why Americans distrust institutions --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CONWAY:  -- so why they think there is no transparency and accountability,  it's frankly, ironically, part of why Donald Trump won because he was seen  as the one who could shake up the system and turn the table over and he's  doing that.</p><p>So, I just hope that folks aren't going to find a slew of excuses Maria for  not investigating the investigators now that we know what's happening here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I know that the March for Life is important, an important  event, what can you tell us about it?</p><p>The president apparently making history at today's March for Life event?</p><p>CONWAY:  It is such a buoyant day for the Pro-Life Movement and the 45th  Anniversary of the March for Life, Donald J. Trump will be the first  sitting president to address the March for Life, live.  He will do so  through video remarks, a satellite feed here, in the Rose Garden.</p><p>And I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CONWAY:  -- attended a reception last night hosted by the vice president  and the second lady and Vice President and Mrs. Pence talked emphatically  and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CONWAY:  -- factually about the Pro-Life Movement.</p><p>And Vice President Pence noted something that indeed will be true, Donald  Trump is the most Pro-Life president ever in our lifetime.  He made good on  so many promises, he's willing to sign that 'Pain-Capable' halfway bill  into law.  He is nominated Pro-Life justices, and it's a really great day  for those who come here to march on behalf of our 'First Right, the Right  to Life.'</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kellyanne, good to see you.</p><p>CONWAY:  Thank --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congrats --</p><p>CONWAY:  -- you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on one year.

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, January 19th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shutdown showdown -- the House doing its part to avoid a government shutdown, passing a short-term spending bill last night that will keep the government funded through February 16th. However, now it is on to the Senate where passage remains anything but certain. One of the major hurdles: immigration reform, specifically a DACA deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Department of Justice has asked the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling that blocks the President's decision to phase out the program. This comes as a new report says as nearly four million Dreamers are in the U.S. -- a far greater number than originally known. The latest on immigration reform, coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning: stocks pulled back slightly yesterday but all three major indices closed at their second highest level in history. Yesterday the Dow down 97 points and part of the reason -- bonds, the yields went up. The 10-year yield rose to the highest level in nearly four years topping 2.6 percent yesterday. It remains at that level right now.</p><p>Futures this morning nonetheless bouncing back -- take a look. We've got the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 92 points reversing all of yesterday's selloff. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also positively.</p><p>In Europe this morning, similar story. Money is moving into equities; FT 100 up a quarter of a percent, CAC 40 up almost half a percent, the DAX in Germany up almost 1 percent.</p><p>Check the Asian markets -- stocks ended the week higher, as you see there. Best performers were in Asia -- Shanghai and Hang Seng.</p><p>An alarming report to report -- a confidential intelligence memo that alleges abuses made by government surveillance is being called \"troubling\" by lawmakers. Several Republicans want that memo to be made public.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SCOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA: You knew as soon as you read them and you think about -- is this happening in America or is it the KGB? That is how alarming it is.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO: What I read today in that classified briefing room is as bad as I thought it was and every single American citizen should have the ability to see that information, to know exactly what our FBI was up to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So they want to release the memo -- how it ties to Robert Mueller's Russia probe, coming up.</p><p>Plus Starbucks brewing up a place on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. It is not number one -- find out who took that top spot.</p><p>Plus the relationship with the U.S. not the only icy thing in Vladimir Putin's life. Check this out. Why the Russian leader takes a dip in freezing water.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down: former State Department spokesperson, national security adviser to President Obama's presidential campaign and Fox News contributor Marie Harf is here; the King's College business and economics professor Brian Brenberg; and Fox Business Network's Connell McShane.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN HOST: We can't unsee that, can we?</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's the morning --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No. No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I will never get that two minutes back.</p><p>MCSHANE: Why did you do that then?</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, THE KING'S COLLEGE: We already this serious conversation and then that picture shows up. You can't remember what you're --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He loves taking off his shirt.</p><p>MCSHANE: I was about to make a comment -- you know, it's interesting the markets (INAUDIBLE). No matter what they kind of -- and then Putin with no shirt.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARF: Happy Friday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my God. Happy Friday.</p><p>MCSHANE: It is kind of interesting that the markets -- I mean if they're worried about a government shutdown, right, it's kind of a funny way for stocks showing it. They keep on bouncing back.</p><p>BRENBERG: Maybe a little bit of dollar weakness leading up to this but -- I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You would think that the market is looking for any excuse to sort of come in just a little after almost, you know, $7.5 trillion in value in the last year and a half. And yes, even a government shutdown.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: They must be expecting it to be short. But I just don't know if they're going to pull this together in time. I think Republicans need something like 12 votes in the Senate in order to get something passed. Can they do that?</p><p>BRENBERG: No.</p><p>HARF: Not by tonight. I don't think by tonight.</p><p>MCSHANE: Twelve -- I don't think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Big victory in the House because the Freedom Caucus was sort of pushing, pushing, and actually they were able to rally up the votes and pass it in the House.</p><p>But now, once again --</p><p>MCSHANE: Short term maybe. It's the only thing, right. Maybe they get to four or five -- four-day -- they were talking about that last night. Maybe something real short-term but there's no way, to your point, to get to 60 on this bill. No way.</p><p>HARF: Certainly not. And not by tonight. I think they want to make a point here. And with a one vote majority in the Senate on the Republican side -- some folks still not in D.C. I think we shut down for a few days.</p><p>BRENBERG: But I think Democrats are really gambling here that Republicans get blamed for this. And I just don't know. I mean I know that's the trend in the past.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BRENBERG: But the way this is shaping up now, especially with the good news on taxes, the Democrats --</p><p>HARF: They're in charge though, man.</p><p>BRENBERG: I don't know. I don't know -- Maria. You've got confidence there. But I think this could go the other way.</p><p>HARF: We'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll watch that and obviously talking about that all morning this morning.</p><p>Joining the conversation, the counselor to the President -- President Trump, Kellyanne Conway will join me, coming up. She will weigh in on the shocking memo circulating in Congress that allegedly details FISA abuses and the shutdown showdown in the Senate. She'll join us shortly. You don't want to miss that.</p><p>First though this -- this top story. And that is the looming government shutdown. Congress is deadlocked over the passage of a four-week stop gap spending, keeping Capitol Hill open past today's deadline. Tensions are flaring across the aisle.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Senator Schumer -- do not shutdown the federal government. It is risky. It is reckless. And it is wrong.</p><p>I ask the American people to understand this. The only people standing in the way of keeping the government open are Senate Democrats.</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: I'm not trying to play for political points, even false ones. I am trying to get us to come together on a bipartisan nature to get something done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us this morning is New York Republican Congressman and Trump transition team executive committee member Chris Collins. Congressman -- it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK: Yes. Good to be with you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think? What are the chances of a government shutdown?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, you know, we got our job done in the House yet again. And this would be a Chuck Schumer shutdown. The Schumer shutdown does look like a possibility. I've just got to hope as he looks into his political playbook, he realizes he's going to wear this one.</p><p>And we don't know but again, the House did our job. And it would be a shame for America to have Senator Schumer not deliver the Democrat vote. He is all political all the time. There's no two ways about it.</p><p>I remind people when we saw the tears last time they were real. He wanted to be majority leader of the Senate and he still does.</p><p>And so, you know, he is trying to weigh who wears this. He's not looking out for what is best for America. He's looking out what is best for senator Schumer and how does this play into his desire to be the majority leader of the Senate. It is that simple.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But do the voters know that? I mean are the voters going to hold him accountable come November, you think? I mean -- or do you think the Republicans get blamed should the government shutdown?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, because we did, Maria, passed this in the House, the Republicans passed it in the House. The Democrats one and all voted against the six-year extension of the Child Health Insurance Program -- something that's always been bipartisan.</p><p>And if Senator Schumer says he is looking out for the DACA or the dreamers I'd like to remind him and remind America back in 2009 and '10 when Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama controlled the government in its entirety with 60 senators, they did nothing for these DACA kids other than as Obama said, \"I've got a phone and a pen\". He signed an executive order that effectively expired when he left office.</p><p>So it begs the question Senator Schumer, why didn't the Democrats fix our immigration issues back in 2009 and '10 when they could have. And oh, by the way, why didn't you raise minimum wage back in 2009 and '10 when you could have?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's a good point.</p><p>MCSHANE: I wonder if your concerned though about the perception of it because the Democratic argument here will be that -- hey we've had -- whatever it is 17, 18 shutdowns going back to the 70s but we've never had one quite like this where one party had the House, the Senate and the White House.</p><p>They're going to basically say, as I think Marie said a few minutes, hey listen, you guys are in charge. And that argument might resonate. Are you concerned with that politically?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, here is what I hope politically if this does happen that Leader McConnell realizes it's time to get rid of the filibuster once and for all. Because again, we've done it now and the Supreme Court judges because of senator Schumer. I'll say thank you Senator Schumer for being such an obstructionist that we had no choice but get rid of the filibuster through Supreme Court judges.</p><p>Well, maybe here is another example why that rule of the Senate, it's not in the constitution. It's nothing more than an archaic rule that should be eliminated. Now then you could blame us. But when you need 60 votes in the Senate and it's Senator Schumer that's got to deliver.</p><p>This is a Schumer shutdown were it to occur --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>COLLINS: -- and I think we would absolutely remind the American public of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- which is why the President is tweeting on this right now actually. He just tweeted on the shutdown saying this, \"Government funding bill passed last night in the House of Representatives. Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate. But they want illegal immigration and a weak border. Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018.\"</p><p>So Congressman Collins -- How are you going to get more Republican victories in 2018 when you are sitting on the precipice of a government shutdown and the perception will be that Republicans are at fault?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, that is perception and we've got to make sure the reality - - the truth comes out and we are sitting now on the most historic tax reform in 31 years. And now worker after worker is going to see more money in their paycheck.</p><p>And that's the playbook we have is the fundamental tax reform, more money in workers' pockets, higher 401(k), balances, the economy rocking and rolling, and we're company after company increasing their starting wages. And we will make sure that anyone and everyone knows this is, if it happens, Schumer shutdown.</p><p>BRENBERG: But Congressman, you know, to that point, even if this looks like -- even if people think it is the Schumer shutdown, the problem is this news dominates headlines instead of the news we've seen over past few days with Apple and other companies.</p><p>To me the Republicans are going to lose with the shutdown either way because the good news story, and it's a great news story on tax cuts, just is not going to get through.</p><p>Frankly I think Democrats like that. I think that's why they are gunning for a shutdown here.</p><p>COLLINS: Oh, there's no doubt that Senator Schumer is looking -- but it's risky for him -- at the political outcomes here. And again, now that we passed it in the House, it is the Democrats we need in the Senate.</p><p>So we will have to see how this plays out. Both parties lose, America loses and that is what I'd be saying to Senator Schumer. Let's do what's right for America.</p><p>We should also remind all Americans, all essential services in the government will continue, our military and everyone else. And we're not going to do the little things that Obama did when we had the shutdown in '13 like make sure that he put blockades at the turnarounds in the parks and he closed the World War II Memorial where there is not even any employees there.</p><p>Barack Obama tried to inflict pain on America in the last shutdown. That is not the way Donald Trump -- President Trump operates.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>COLLINS: We would make this as easy as we could, a shutdown is not good for America but essential services will continue and I'm confident that under President Trump the World War II Memorial will be open.</p><p>HARF: Congressman, we definitely heard your message to Senator Schumer. That came across loud and clear. Do you also have a message for Senator McConnell and your Republican colleagues in the Senate some of whom have also said they are against voting for this? You know, you don't have Democrats on board but there are still a number of Republican holdouts. What is your message to your colleagues across the aisle here to get them on board?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, my message to Senator McConnell and the Republicans is get rid of the filibuster. Then you can blame us.</p><p>And you know, last night we were having to whip out many of our House Republicans to make sure we got the votes. So the fact that there are people that may be leaning yes or undecided in the Senate, we had that last night in the House. And we delivered.</p><p>And I'm sure that if there was no filibuster we would deliver in the Senate as well. So that's my message to Leader McConnell. Get rid of the filibuster.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman -- let's talk about New York for a moment -- a knife to the Big Apple -- on New York State. Apparently New Yorkers are bearing the brunt of tax reform negatives most significantly the elimination of the SALT deduction -- that $10,000 federal property tax. And then what can be for New Yorkers who are struggling with tax reform fallout, tell us how you see it?</p><p>And then there's this. The cover story of the \"New York Post\" today, \"Land of the Fee: look out Uber, state is pushing $11.50 toll just to go below 60th street\". So we're going to have -- they are proposing putting tolls within New York City -- to go from uptown to downtown?</p><p>COLLINS: Sure. Well, first of all Maria -- 95 percent of New Yorkers are going to have a significant tax cut. Certainly up in my district in western New York, the Buffalo area it's probably 98 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>COLLINS: What we're hearing is Senator Schumer and King Andrew Cuomo fighting for the millionaires and the billionaires on Long Island, it's quite the juxtaposition as the Republicans are fighting for the working class, the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>COLLINS: And we've got our supposedly progressive or actually progressive governor fighting for the millionaires but 95 percent, 98 percent of New Yorkers are going to see a -- basically a $2,000 a year increase.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. No, I'm aware of that. I'm aware of that -- Congressman. But you know, the elimination of the SALT deduction is going to mean higher taxes for some people.</p><p>COLLINS: Only the wealthy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Cuomo -- and the governor -- the governor has been complaining about it. Now he is threatening he needs to battle congestion, capitalize on a cash injection by placing tolls on New York City blocks.</p><p>COLLINS: Well, this governor has never seen a tax he didn't like or want to hike. And now he's going to look for new taxes that he can impose on us. And this is just --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is there any shot that that passes, tolls within New York City?</p><p>COLLINS: Who knows? I mean with this governor he has -- he rules with an iron fist --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>COLLINS: -- and anyone and everyone knows because he controls all the economic development dollars in New York, you vote his way or you will pay a price.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. Congressman let me switch gears real quick, get your take on this FISA frenzy -- the circulation of a confidential intelligence memo. It alleges surveillance abuses made by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\", sending shockwaves throughout Congress.</p><p>How do you see it? Lawmakers -- some of your colleagues are saying that they want this memo to be made public, reigniting concerns that there is corruption at the top of the FBI, collusion with Hillary Clinton and the leadership of the FBI.</p><p>COLLINS: Well, Maria -- I'm going to be seeing that memo at 9:00 this morning. So I have not yet been down into the secure area to read it myself. I'll be doing that in about an hour or maybe two hours from now.</p><p>But if it is as it's being discussed, something that should be released, you know, this is America. We're a democracy. We should be sharing good news and bad news with our public and trust that our democracy will hold up.</p><p>So I have not seen it yet but if it is as you are portraying it I would tend to be another one that would be saying let's release it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, your colleague, Matt Gaetz, last night on Fox News said I believe there are people who will go to jail over the intel memo. So we'd like to know what's in that memo.</p><p>COLLINS: Well, I will know in about two hours' time. But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Should they release the memo? They've got hashtag -- #ReleasetheMemo that they are circulating. Do you have any problem not releasing the memo?</p><p>COLLINS: I'm somebody that believes we should live in an open and transparent society. So I have not read it yet but I would certainly be someone that would lean towards releasing it. I would have to see some compelling reason not to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman -- thank you. We'll see you soon. Thanks.</p><p>COLLINS: Good to be with you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chris Collins there. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A suspected serial killer in Arizona now linked to nine killings in three weeks. Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this has really rocked the town of Phoenix -- Maria. Thirty-five-year-old Cleophus Cooksey Jr. was arrested in Phoenix last month in connection with the fatal shootings of his mother and his stepfather.</p><p>Well now he faces additional charges for allegedly killing seven other people late last year. Police say that shell casings and cell phone records have linked Cooksey to the other murders. He is right now being held on $5 million bond.</p><p>Well, Pope Francis is under fire in Chile. The Pontiff accusing clerical sex abuse victims of slander just days after meeting with survivors and asking for forgiveness. Now Francis is defending Bishop Juan Barros who is accused of covering up the alleged sex crimes committed by a local priest saying there is no proof against the bishop. The comments left Chileans stunned especially since the Pope's trip to Chile was meant to help change local opinions on the Catholic Church following the abuse scandal.</p><p>Meanwhile the Pope also taking on the role of first responder, halting his motorcade as you can see there, a policewoman fell off her horse. Well, the Pope stood by the woman, he comforted her while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Luckily she was not seriously hurt. But she took quite a still off of her horse next to the Pontiff.</p><p>And then finally there is this -- Maria, just in time for breakfast. Russian President Vladimir Putin is stripping down to his bathing trunks and he does it on national TV. He immersed himself in the freezing waters of a lake yesterday. This is an Orthodox Christian ritual to mark the feast of Epiphany.</p><p>Air temps at the time about 21 degrees Fahrenheit. And there he goes dipping himself in the water. Oh, we missed the shot coming back out. Oh, well. Sorry.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: They cut the video. It's too short. I think we wanted to see the reveal.</p><p>MCSHANE: He doesn't like shirts. He doesn't like shirts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He loves taking his shirt off.</p><p>HARF: And being photographed taking his shirt off.</p><p>BRENBERG: I don't know.</p><p>HARF: There's always photographers there.</p><p>MCSHANE: I know Brian -- I know you like to dip in the East River but at least there's no photographers around with you.</p><p>BRENBERG: That's right.</p><p>MCSHANE: It might have been different --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRENBERG: I have that same jacket.</p><p>HARF: And those boots, I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh boy. All right. We're taking a break.</p><p>Coming up, trouble for Takata, the additional car models being recalled over airbag concerns -- we've got it coming up.</p><p>And then a scientific breakthrough that can catch cancer early -- details on this revolutionary new test that could save thousands of lives. Really exciting -- later this hour.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A warning for investors in this week's \"Wall Street Journal\". And op-ed this week titled \"stocks headed for a fall\" appearing in Wednesday's paper saying rising interest rates could trigger declines.</p><p>Joining us now, the author of that op-ed is Marty Feldstein is here right now, Harvard professor, former council of economic advisers chairman under President Reagan. Great to see you -- Marty.</p><p>Martin Feldstein, Harvard professor: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So how significant a fall might we be looking at?</p><p>FELDSTEIN: It could be very big. I mean the market is up so much, driven by the Fed. Now the Fed is reversing, it's pushing up interest rates, undoing long-term bonds so as interest rates. It's undoing the big buy of long-term bonds. So I think as interest rates right, we could see stock market go back to a much more normal price-earnings ratio.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you're saying driven by the Fed. I mean just since the election of Donald Trump, this market's up $7.5 trillion in value. What do you think about monetary policy going away, it's been so easy, and fiscal policy sort of taking a lead here?</p><p>FELDSTEIN: It's not going to do it. I mean the news about the advantages of the tax bill are in the market already. The real problem is going forward we will see a rising interest rate for a lot of reasons, not just the Fed but the fiscal deficit will push up long-term interest rates as well.</p><p>BRENBERG: Will we know it when we see it? When the markets starts to turn? Is it going to happen real quick do you think?</p><p>FELDSTEIN: It always happens faster than you think.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes. Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What is the trigger?</p><p>BRENBERG: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the trigger?</p><p>FELDSTEIN: The trigger is people wake up and say well, maybe I ought to get out. And enough people say that and the market moves.</p><p>BRENBERG: But to Maria's point, your op-ed is great but it paints a very, very bleak picture. I read it and was sort of downcast for half the day after reading. But is it not possible that there could be an unwind to the balance sheet and there could be a rising of interest rates in such a way that doesn't trigger, you know, a downturn in the market? Can this be done in a soft steady gradual way?</p><p>FELDSTEIN: Well, that's what the Fed hopes. That's what I hope. But I think if, excuse me, if interest rates really do go back to, quote, \"normal\". So we see a short-term rate that moves up a couple of points, if we see the loan rate go from 2.5 to 4, 4.5 -- it's hard to believe the stock market won't notice that.</p><p>BRENBERG: But you've got the tax cuts on the table. We haven't talked about regulation. Yet some people would say --</p><p>FELDSTEIN: All that is good stuff.</p><p>BRENBERG: -- you're underestimating the ability of businesses and the economy to move forward because you have the juice from the regulation. You have the juice from the tax cut --</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is a really important point that you're making, the regulatory rollback is being talked about as one of the big movers of the stock market and the economy.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: And I certainly believe that it has done that and has contributed to it. But if you look at what they price-earnings ratios are relative to the past. They are up dramatically relative to where they have been historically.</p><p>Some of that you can -- well, and they have been there even before the Trump victory.</p><p>BRENBERG: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's go to the numbers here because earnings are expected to be up 23 percent in 2018 compare that to valuations. 23 percent for the S&amp;P 500 is the estimate.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: So where is the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The PE is --</p><p>FELDSTEIN: PE is well, 24 and where was it historically, around 16.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're talking backward, 24. Because forward is about 17.5 to 18 -- 18 times earnings if you look at forward earnings.</p><p>Right. The PE going forward for 2018 would be 18 and the markets and earnings are supposed to be up 23 percent. But -- you know.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: But it's probably true that if you went back historically and you did forward-looking PEs, they were always lower than the historic actual backward looking PE. So I think -- you can't compare the historic number --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- to the forward.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: -- to the forward.</p><p>BRENBERG: You're talking about the people who want you to be wrong basically.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRENBERG: You just want to be right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FELDSTEIN: I think the real problem is what happens if there is this downturn --</p><p>BRENBERG: Right.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: -- and the fed doesn't really have the ability to offset it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Downturn in the market or downturn in the economy?</p><p>FELDSTEIN: In the economy. If we get a big downturn in the market consumers are going to respond negatively and businesses are going to respond negatively.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But Marty -- where is the downturn in the economy? I mean we're talking about 4 percent growth?</p><p>FELDSTEIN: It's not there now. It is certainly not there now.</p><p>MCSHANE: So you don't think the economy is as strong as people are making it out to be.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: No. I think the economy is fine as long as the market doesn't turn down. If the market turns down because of higher interest rates, or because of external events, if the market turns down, then that will push us off this very nice path that we're on.</p><p>MCSHANE: You must have one piece of good advice for policymakers and how they can handle all this. How they can manage all this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. How do you deal with it?</p><p>FELDSTEIN: Well, I think they have to look beyond the fed. I think the Congress, the administration has to say what will we do if the economy turns down because the Fed is not going to be in a position to cut rates substantially.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is there any other stimulus away from the Fed that can be put in there?</p><p>FELDSTEIN: It's called tax and spending policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it's really spending because tax policy we've got.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: We've got that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: Yes. And it has to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's really on the spending.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: Right. Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Marty -- great to see you.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. And you weren't all Dr. Doom.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: No, no. No, I wish I had a different picture about what the risks are. But I would say the economy is in great shape but very fragile.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Marty Feldstein joining us there. We'll see you soon, sir. Thank you so much.</p><p>FELDSTEIN: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, troubling claims over government surveillance abuse -- details on the shocking memo circulating in Congress that some lawmakers want Americans to read for themselves.

Today Senate Democrats are threatening to block that bill and force a government shutdown.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the Counselor to the President, Kellyanne CONWAY:</p><p>Kellyanne, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much --</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Good --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- for --</p><p>CONWAY: -- morning --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- joining us.</p><p>CONWAY: -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think, will we see a shutdown?</p><p>CONWAY: Oh, we certainly hope not.</p><p>The president of course is committed to not having a shutdown and has -- really very happy that the House came (ph) and passed that bill last night. He hopes that the Senate comes together to negotiate today.</p><p>I think the Democrats are just on the wrong side of history. In the space of a month they voted against a historic tax cut that's leading to thousands of new jobs; they are repatriating trillions of dollars of wealth; people they know are getting bonuses and raises and having job security; and capital investments by the major employers in our country.</p><p>And now to be on the wrong side of history and is saying, no to military funding, no to funding children's health programs, no to federal workers being able to rely on the next paycheck, all on the altar of DACA, an issue that the president told the whole world transparently, a week ago Maria in that hour-long meeting that he's willing to negotiate and he's willing to come to a deal.</p><p>So, it's -- it's very concerning that the Democrats are willing to shut down the government based on that one issue that has a March deadline not a January 19th deadline.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean you know, Chuck Schumer has said in the past that a shutdown would be terrible, would be `stupid,' I think this is one of his - one of his words.</p><p>And the president has also been vocal about avoiding a shutdown as it's going to put a damper on the military.</p><p>So, what are the implications? I mean is there a plan in place should there be a shutdown in terms of keeping you know, government workers, sailors (ph), I mean you know, so many who will actually see their paychecks stopped.</p><p>CONWAY: And that's the regrettable part and you can play almost any Democrat's previous statements about government shutdowns and they should be reminded of that.</p><p>I don't - I don't understand why many of these Democrats and -- auditioning for 2020 are playing to a very left wing, out of - out-of-touch base and I think imperiling a lot of those red states Democrats who are going to take some really tough votes today Maria, they have to decide up or down whether they are for this or that and in addition to those programs at risk that I just mentioned, that we hope continue to be fully funded.</p><p>You see the CHIP extension, the 9 million or so children who rely on the Children's Health Program, the House took action on that last night, the president is committed as he has said in tweets and otherwise, you see the military funding.</p><p>But also, there's opioid treatment centers, this is the boiling (ph) issue of our times, a crisis next door, how in the world are some of these senators going to go home and justify a vote against funding that.</p><p>So, I - look we always have a plan in place here. This is Donald Trump's White House, he's had a tremendous year of progress and movement but I just hope we don't come to that.</p><p>I really - when they - when they meet again together at 11:00 a.m. --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>CONWAY: -- we hope the Senate will come together and people will realize in the light of day how terrible it would be to the people who don't deserve to be left on the altar of petty partisan politics.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The president was expected to go to Florida this weekend, FOX NEWS is reporting that \"the president will delay his departure to Mar-a- Lago until after he signs a Continuing Resolution,\" is that -- is that a fact and is that a sign that he expects a deal?</p><p>CONWAY: Well the president is very hopeful that the Senate will do the right thing today and follow his lead in the lead of the House in keeping this government open.</p><p>We are open to a short-term fix but it is not preferable --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: -- and we want that two-year deal or so, it is not preferable - and the president -- let me repeat, everybody knows it from last week but geez 10 days is a long time in Washington D.C., people will get amnesia when they - selective amnesia.</p><p>The fact is Maria, this president has said, `he's willing to get a deal in DACA.' but when he talks about Immigration, the president is talking about four big points, as you know, `end to chain migration,' `end to diversity visa lottery system,' he wants the `border wall' obviously and the funding for it and then the `DACA.'</p><p>But he also has a big 70-point Immigration plan, anybody can pull up, which also includes things like a `merit-based' Immigration system; 10,000 new ICE agents at the border, et cetera, and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>So, this is important because when the - when the president talks about Immigration, he's talking about a number of different items.</p><p>When the Democrats talk about it, they're talking about DACA only and now when they talk about what's important to them, it's only DACA, DACA, right, this makes no sense when the deadline is in March.</p><p>You know, the president is willing to negotiate --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>By the way Kellyanne, there is a report that there are 4 million `dreamers,' we've been going with the number 800,000. Is it -- what's the number?</p><p>CONWAY: -- I don't know.</p><p>I've seen all different types of figures. The fact is I don't know the answer.</p><p>But we do know that they've been - many of them have been on Capitol Hill this week protesting --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Yes --</p><p>CONWAY: -- and --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: We Are Here to Stay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- yes. I can see that.</p><p>CONWAY: -- and locking arms with some of the Democrats.</p><p>I think they should be protesting the Democratic offices.</p><p>Why aren't they out there saying, \"Look, the president has done the unexpected.\"</p><p>He has said that - he was - he'-- he's s given us a six-month extension to - he's giving you Congress who's failed to act --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: -- a six-month extension act, let's - let's review very quickly.</p><p>The Congress had nine months in 2017 Maria to do something, to do their job on DACA to fix what president - what President Obama did by not going through Congress, and actually even not going through Congress and now it's an extra six months and still they haven't come up with a solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>Let me -- let me turn to issues of privacy Kellyanne, there is a memo being called `blockbuster,' shocking memo circulating in Congress alleging US government's surveillance abuses, abuses at the top of the FBI certainly.</p><p>Some lawmakers are insisting that this memo be made public for Americans to read it for themselves.</p><p>Listen to this?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FLA), MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: The Intelligence memo that we have just read is so alarming that it must be immediately disclosed to the American people and the disclosure of this intelligence document must be a top priority for the country immediately.</p><p>I cannot stress how important that is.</p><p>Any American that would see this document would feel as though people like Rod Rosenstein and Bruce Orr need to be fired immediately.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO: Wait a minute, this actually happened from our Justice Department and this FBI, that's how serious this is --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, this memo obviously goes right to the Robert Mueller investigation, the Special Counsel because we know that at the top of the FBI, FBI agents like Peter Strauch talking to his girlfriend Lisa Page saying that, `they needed an insurance policy in place should Donald Trump win the presidency.'</p><p>Then you've got the number three guy at the Department of Justice, Bruce Orr, his wife working for Fusion GPS who came up with that dossier, and whether or not the dossier was actually used as the justification to wire- tap Trump Tower.</p><p>What's your take on this?</p><p>Will this memo be released to the public so that the rest of us could see what has gone on here?</p><p>CONWAY: Maria, let's hope so.</p><p>And the reason is very simple, we have spent over a year of taxpayer dollars and precious time when Americans could have been informed about what this president has done for veterans; for taxpayers; for property owners; for coal miners; for anybody facing crushing regulations and unspeakable tax burdens; what he's done for security, ISIS in retreat; transparency; accountability; and prosperity.</p><p>We spent a year talking about Russia in this nation. People have tried to nullify his election from day one and try to discredit him so all those folks, all those outlets who have this screaming Russia graphics are screaming graphics about shenanigans during the campaign last year, they ought to dust them off and we ought to see the memo.</p><p>I've not seen the memo. I can't comment, I'm not in Congress.</p><p>But in the issue - in the - in the interest of transparency and accountability and in interest of fair play here --</p><p>BARTIROMO: There are people who want to know if there's going to be --</p><p>CONWAY: -- That's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- criminal --</p><p>CONWAY: -- right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- prosecution here Kellyanne, where's the accountability?</p><p>We're in America, if we cannot trust the FBI, the -- agencies like the IRS, the CIA are going to be independent thinking then why do we say we are in a free country?</p><p>CONWAY: Well and this is a very important point because people watching right now are going to try to say that you or I or both of us are being mean to the FBI or discrediting them (ph).</p><p>No, we're not.</p><p>There are roughly 25,000 or so men and women working at the FBI; the president has made it very clear many times, including going down to Quantico last month, that he respects the rank-and-file.</p><p>We're talking about apparently a few bad actors but they were in positions of real power and they were --they had positions of power with respect to an investigation.</p><p>And we see now, we're starting to see that this is a - this is why - this is why Americans distrust institutions --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: -- so why they think there is no transparency and accountability, it's frankly, ironically, part of why Donald Trump won because he was seen as the one who could shake up the system and turn the table over and he's doing that.</p><p>So, I just hope that folks aren't going to find a slew of excuses Maria for not investigating the investigators now that we know what's happening here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, I know that the March for Life is important, an important event, what can you tell us about it?</p><p>The president apparently making history at today's March for Life event?</p><p>CONWAY: It is such a buoyant day for the Pro-Life Movement and the 45th Anniversary of the March for Life, Donald J. Trump will be the first sitting president to address the March for Life, live. He will do so through video remarks, a satellite feed here, in the Rose Garden.</p><p>And I --</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CONWAY: -- attended a reception last night hosted by the vice president and the second lady and Vice President and Mrs. Pence talked emphatically and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CONWAY: -- factually about the Pro-Life Movement.</p><p>And Vice President Pence noted something that indeed will be true, Donald Trump is the most Pro-Life president ever in our lifetime.

Prima c'era stato Big Steel, lobby dell'acciaio, e poi Big Tobacco, i cinque mega, contestatissimi, brand delle sigarette. Ma chi avrebbe detto che anche l'industria digitale, che doveva guidarci per mano all'utopia della comunicazione diretta, all'Intelligenza Artificiale, alla Rete cui volevamo concedere il premio Nobel per la pace via Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, Twitter, finisse denigrata come Big Tech, totem monopolistico da multare, accusare, trascinare in giudizio?Ieri Facebook ha perso il 6% in Borsa, 30 miliardi di dollari (24 miliardi di euro) sfumati. </p><p>I mercati penalizzano il colosso di Mark Zuckerberg dopo le denunce dell'informatico Christopher Wylie che accusa l'azienda Cambridge Analytica di aver dragato illegalmente 50 milioni di profili di utenti FB, rivendendoli alla campagna elettorale di Trump, via lo stratega nazionalista Bannon e il magnate conservatore Mercer. I leader tecnologici si son illusi di essere salvatori dell'umanit\u00e0, con Ray Kurzweil teorico dell'\u00abera transumana\u00bb, in cui ogni limite della nostra specie, fisico, etico, spirituale, verr\u00e0 oltrepassato, fino all'immortalit\u00e0 e alle macchine pensanti pensiero. La rivoluzione transumana sar\u00e0 innescata dalla \u00abSingularity\u00bb, il momento in cui l'Intelligenza Artificiale liberer\u00e0 l'Homo Sapiens dal giogo del lavoro, dai limiti economici, dalla gravit\u00e0, materiale e morale. Contro questa arroganza, i Greci la chiamavano hybris, si levano i catastrofisti digitali, luddisti del web come gli artigiani inglesi che distruggevano i telai meccanici della rivoluzione industriale: Evgenj Morozov convinto che il mercato web distrugga la creativit\u00e0, Franklin Foer sicuro che \u00abi monopoli del tech vogliono plasmare l'umanit\u00e0 a propria immagine e somiglianza\u00bb e il geniale fisico Stephen Hawking, appena scomparso, ad ammonire che l'invenzione dell'Intelligenza Artificiale, maggiore scoperta umana, potrebbe esser l'ultima se le macchine ci faranno loro schiavi. Incuranti di queste profezie, miliardi di noi han continuato ad usare Facebook per comunicare la propria vita, Google per capire cosa accade nel rione e sul pianeta, Apple per darsi un'identit\u00e0, Twitter, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram per condividerla. In Russia e in Cina il web \u00e8 controllato dallo Stato, nelle democrazie invece, tra privacy e mercato, si crea un vuoto dove spie, lobby occulte, Stati canaglia e seminatori di zizzanie digitali inquinano dibattito ed elezioni.Facebook ha ora guai pesanti. Il presidente del Parlamento Europeo Antonio Tajani twitta di \u00abminaccia al funzionamento della democrazia\u00bb, la Commissione Elettorale britannica cerca prove di manomissione dei dati personali nel voto per Brexit, il Bureau federale per la Protezione dei Consumatori e il ministro della Giustizia del Massachusetts indagano in America. La compagnia rischia negli Usa una multa fino a 40.000 dollari per ogni utente la cui privacy \u00e8 stata violata, e il 25 maggio scatter\u00e0 in Europa una rigidissima norma sulla privacy, General Data Protection Regulation (Gdpr), che imporr\u00e0 sanzioni fino al 4% del fatturato in caso di intrusioni tipo quelle imputate a Facebook. Nel frattempo i giovani, stufi, lasciano il social media, quest'anno tre milioni di americani e inglesi sotto i 25 anni usciranno da Facebook, ormai \u00abnetwork di pap\u00e0 e mamma\u00bb. La tecnologia e i social media non erano talismano magico ieri, non sono stregoneria perversa oggi. Non ci renderanno invulnerabili, n\u00e9 schiavi. Ogni rivoluzione, dopo il primo impatto, \u00e8 stata regolata, ferrovie, energia, telefonia, con i monopoli onnipotenti seguiti da aziende capaci ancora di competere e innovare. Questa stagione si riapre nel digitale, ma gli interventi politici non dovranno in alcun modo ossificare quel che di meraviglioso e libero il web ci ha donato. Le regole non dovranno mai essere camicie di forza: pur colma di buone intenzioni, per esempio, la Gdpr europea di protezione della privacy di maggio rischia di danneggiare, almeno nella prima fase, la sicurezza, l'antiterrorismo, la lotta alle truffe e allo spam online, anticipa l'esperto di cybersecurity Brian Krebs.

Business appears to be booming for the <url normalizedValue=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/taboola-seeking-to-raise-75-million-to-100-million-in-roadshowsources-1410274497\">bigger startups</url> in the \"content recommendation\" space, and Yahoo is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/blog/techflash/2014/09/outbrain-taboola-steel-themselves-for-big-new.html?page=all\">joining</url> the fray too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But at the same time, regular Joes and influential tech leaders <url normalizedValue=\"http://fortune.com/2014/08/18/taboola-outbrain-battle-bad-reputation-each-other/\">say they're tired of</url> sleazy, irrelevant ads appearing on substantive sites, or nonsense fluff passed off as a serious page.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/promo/newyorkemail-haana=om_nyc_emmeaeedit3par\">Get breaking business news delivered to your inbox. Sign up for our free newsletter</url> .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response, the industry is now competing on quality. Outbrain says it internally screens for low-quality ads before they're available on the platform; Taboola lets readers downvote unpleasant ads, and gives publishers the chance to eliminate bad ones too. Smaller competitor nRelate, an InteractiveCorp. (NASDAQ: IACI) subsidiary, recently launched its own plan: A full publisher dashboard that provides a series of ways to filter, pick and choose which ads are eligible to be served by the software, and weigh revenue against strategic brand issues.<br/></p><p>Unless the whole landscape gets better at balancing quality and revenue, <url normalizedValue=\"http://nrelate.com/\">nRelate</url> CEO Neil Mody thinks the entire concept is jeopardy. I caught up with him in an email exchange this week.</p><p>NYBJ: Content recommendation is pretty unpopular with readers, but large tech companies are talking about moving into the business. How do you explain the surge in competition?</p><p>Mody: On one hand, content recommendation is actually very popular and that's why large tech companies are getting involved. On the other, readers are starting to voice their lack of appreciation for the types and quality of recommendations they're seeing. Focusing in on why large tech companies are getting involved, to be perfectly honest, there's a lot of money in play. Like anyone, the big tech companies are always looking for new ways to branch out their offerings and create new revenue channels.</p><p>I'm actually encouraged by the move of some of the bigger companies into content recommendations for two reasons. First, it indicates that there's still plenty of opportunity for growth in the space and that it hasn't succumbed to total banner blindness ( the notion some readers find banner ads so ubiquitous and unwanted that they don't notice them anymore -- editor). Secondly, new competition forces us all to get better and come up with new products and solutions that are attractive to publishers, which is what we're focused on at nRelate.</p><p>NYBJ: You built nControl, which gives publishers more control over what gets recommended and doesn't. Why is that the answer?</p><p>Mody: Let's first step back and clearly define the problem. nControl is about creating transparency and providing publishers with an alternative to being left in the dark about what sponsored content shows up on their site. nControl isn't our attempt to police content quality , but rather to let publishers decide what ads fit with their editorial voice and are most relevant. Some publishers may want celebrity-focused content recommendations. Others that run tech or serious news stories might not want a girl in a bikini next to their articles. Either way, publishers should ultimately control this.</p><p>nControl starts by showing publishers the pool of every possible ad unit that may show up on their site. From there, publishers can make decisions about what ads they don't want to show up and block them accordingly. Publishers can decide to show editorial content, advertorial, or a mix of both. nControl even allows publishers to view and block content by category (e.g. travel, pets, sports, real estate) or keywords (e.g . Bieber, Kardashian). nControl shows publishers exactly how much they earn from each advertiser , and the projected changes to those earnings depending on content they decide to block or allow.</p><p>NYBJ: Everybody wants quality ads. But publishers need revenue. Are they losing anything in the long-term by maximizing their revenue in the short term? If so, what is the trade off?</p><p>Mody: Just as we don't aim to be the arbiters of content quality, we want publishers to make decisions about how they balance the content they allow on their site with their own revenue objectives. There are some publishers - especially those in the blogosphere - that only use content recommendations to drive traffic to their own internal content. Others have much more aggressive revenue goals with how they use content recommendations. Neither is inherently bad. That said, we do believe focusing too much on short-term revenues does carry with it potential risks for many publishers.</p><p>The trade off here can be damage to a publisher's brand image. Many media brands have spent years and even decades building and maintaining a certain reputation. Maximizing short-term revenue by promoting the kinds of ads and content that get clicks no matter where they are (think sex and fear) , but are completely off the mark , can erode reader trust and a publisher's credibility. Publishers need to decide on the balance, but if they don't even know what ads are running on their site to begin with, they could unknowingly be trading reader trust and credibility for short-term clicks.</p><p>Q: What's at risk for the entire concept of content recommendation? You want to find some happy medium that keeps a revenue stream alive while cracking down on the worst content. If you or the rest of the industry isn't successful, what happens?</p><p>Mody: I mentioned \"banner blindness\" earlier, and the belief that content recommendations are going down the same path. Some claim we're already there. This is one unfortunate risk that all of us in the space face if ad tech companies like us, along with publishers , don't succeed in cleaning up the space. Content relevance is one thing, but there are other issues at stake such as content disclosure. When it comes to disclosing sponsored content units, external regulatory agencies <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/24/4-big-threats-native-advertising-faces-in-2015/\">have already become</url> involved. Trying to play a cat-and-mouse game when it comes to disclosure will only lead to more regulation and scrutiny.</p><p>I think we're definitely at a crossroads in the content recommendation landscape. At nRelate, we believe a happy medium is still possible when it comes to keeping sponsored content transparent, relevant and properly disclose, while remaining a viable source of revenue. The alternative is that it becomes so bad it no longer works - and then everyone loses. We think there's still a lot of promise in content recommendations as part of the larger native advertising mix. And when done well, [it] can benefit publishers, ad-tech companies and readers alike.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/promo/newyorkemail-haana=om_nyc_emmeaeediteoa\">Sign up</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">for New York Business Journal's free email newsletter delivering exclusive news scoops and local business intelligence.</emphasis></p><p>Did you find this article useful?

If it does, there will likely be implications for business in Westchester, according to Jonathan H. Hill, dean of the Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems at Pace University.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Westchester is a really important tech hub, in health care R&amp;I), telemedicine, financial technology, even the startup scene,\" Hill said. \"Westchester is getting to be a really exciting place. And all of those businesses thrive on open access to the internet.\"</p><p>Net neutrality refers broadly to a series of regulations meant to ensure all internet traffic is treated equally. The 2015 regulations prevent internet service providers from selling speedier internet access, known as \"fast lanes,\" to certain companies over others.</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai wants to repeal those net neutrality rules, which classified internet service providers as utilities. The FCC in May voted 2-1 to advance that plan. The commission is seeking public input on the matter and has already received more than 9 million comments.</p><p>The original regulations are meant to prevent broadband providers from charging more for certain websites and internet services or blocking websites that use a lot of bandwidth and are deemed by providers to be too demanding.</p><p>Major broadband providers such as AT&amp;T and Comcast have argued that the regulations discourage investment in their networks.</p><p>Talk of rolling back net neutrality has sparked protest from major technology companies, including Google, Facebook, Netflix and Amazon. The companies led a \"day of action\" against the rollback on July 12. Netflix ran a banner on its homepage reading \"Protect Internet Freedom. Defend Net Neutrality. Take Action.\" Twitter promoted the hashtag \"#netneutrality\" on its homepage, while Amazon ran a homepage ad that read \"Net Neutrality? Learn more.\"</p><p>\"If a service provider can block you from seeing certain content or can make you pay extra for it, that hurts all of us and we should have rules against it,\" Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a post on July 12.</p><p>Any rollback of net neutrality regulations is likely to be felt by individual users, according to Hill.</p><p>\"You will begin to see this kind of tiered pricing, with internet providers trying to squeeze people to pay a higher rate for a better-quality internet experience,\" Hill said. \"If you are someone who works from home a great deal, expect to pay more.\"</p><p>Those so-called fast lanes could be particularly concerning for small tech startups, according to Joel Felber, an attorney specializing in computer technology and intellectual property law at Leason Ellis in White Plains.</p><p>\"If you are a small video provider, for example, and you are unable to cut a deal with a major internet service provider, or perhaps the only internet service provider that provides broadband, then you will have a very difficult time competing,\" Felber said.</p><p>Felber said another issue is a lack of competition among the providers. He said there are large swaths of the country that only have one or two broadband providers, if there are any offerings at that speed at all.</p><p>Westchester compares favorably with much of the country in that regard, he said.</p><p>\"We're not somewhere with dial-up as the only option, which is happening for many, many people,\" Felber said. \"It doesn't mean it's a good situation, it's still limited to a few providers, but it's better than other areas. That's important to remember in terms of startups, opportunities.\"</p><p>The Westchester County Association is leading an effort intended to improve upon the county's broadband infrastructure. The business group is working with the mayors of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, White Plains and New Rochelle to try to launch a network of gigabit broadband, which has download speeds about 20 times faster than basic broadband.</p><p>Joan McDonald, a former commissioner of the state Department of Transportation and now an adviser to the Westchester County Association, said it's unclear how changes to the net neutrality regulations could affect that plan.</p><p>\"Right now, it doesn't appear to\" have any effect, she said. \"But that could change. This is an industry that is evolving quickly, both from a tech standpoint and a governance standpoint.\"</p><p>The FCC will seek comments from the public on the matter until mid-August.</p><p>\"Certainly this administration and this Congress are very pro rolling it back,\" Hill said. \"I think a lot of the big tech money remains strongly pro net neutrality, so it will be very, very interesting to see.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WESBUS-1927463276</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WESBUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P73-NWM1-JBHT-D0KC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315828</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 Westfair Communications Jul 24, 2017</copyright><publicationName>Westchester County Business Journal</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1057686X</issn><volume>Vol. 53</volume><issueNumber>No. 30</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 24, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He blamed the global economic upheaval caused by the pandemic and the resulting uncertainty over Toronto's real estate market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\" In October 2017, Sidewalk Labs and Waterfront Toronto set out to plan a shared vision for Quayside, a fundamentally more sustainable and affordable community resulting from innovations in technology and urban design,\" Doctoroff wrote.</p><p>\"So it is with great personal sadness and disappointment that Sidewalk Labs will no longer pursue the Quayside project,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"But as unprecedented economic uncertainty has set in around the world and in the Toronto real estate market, it has become too difficult to make the 12-acre project financially viable without sacrificing core parts of the plan we had developed together with Waterfront Toronto to build a truly inclusive, sustainable community,\" he added.</p><p>\"And so, after a great deal of deliberation, we concluded that it no longer made sense to proceed with the Quayside project, and let Waterfront Toronto know yesterday.\"</p><p>Sidewalk Labs will continue working on urban innovation, he wrote, calling it \"difficult\" to walk away from attempts to reach a final development deal.</p><p>\"Toronto is one of the world's great centres of technological innovation, and nothing about this decision will in any way diminish that,\" he said.</p><p>Keerthana Rang, a spokesperson for Sidewalk Labs said the firm made the decision, then contacted Alphabet, the parent company of Sidewalk Labs and Google on Tuesday.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs will maintain its head office at Parliament Street and Lakeshore Boulevard for now and attempt to redeploy the 30 staffers that work there.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto, a tri-government agency that is steward of Toronto's waterfront lands put out the original request for proposals to develop the 12-acre site in March 2017. Sidewalk Labs won that bid the following October.</p><p>The project, which was to be a mainly residential development with commercial components, became highly controversial, in large part over the collection of data on everything from foot traffic through the community, to the garbage disposal and energy use of residents, weather conditions and more.</p><p>But after a public outcry over privacy and data concerns, Sidewalk Labs agreed to significant concessions, including allowing Waterfront Toronto to be responsible for oversight of how the data collected at Quayside would be stored and managed.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs was also forced to revert to the original 4.8-hectare footprint last fall after backlash over its proposal to help develop as much as 77 hectares of the Portlands.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto chair Steve Diamond said he's disappointed the project fell through, but not surprised by the news of Sidewalk Labs leaving town.</p><p>\"When you look at the deal, this goes back three years. It was really planned and modelled in a pre-COVID environment,\" said Diamond.</p><p>\"Even then, apart from the financial considerations, the complexity of the project and regulatory changes - the contemplation of construction of a tall timber factory (to construct wood framed buildings at Quayside), these are all enormous undertakings. And if you look around the world today, many existing plans have been altered or abandoned based on these (COVID-19) circumstances.\"</p><p>Diamond suggested the departure of Sidwalk Labs, though unfortunate, presents new opportunities around what to do with the 12 acres and more on the eastern waterfront.</p><p>\"Is a smart city the best objective now for the use of these lands? Or, for example, should we be concentrating on innovation but in a different sense - the opportunity to provide more affordable rental and home ownership opportunities? The opportunity to create new and dynamic public open spaces? The opportunity to create, for example, new ways to help small businesses and retailers?\"</p><p>Diamond, who is a real estate developer, went on to say that Thursday's news isn't a set back for the city.</p><p>\"Toronto is an international city people want to invest in,\" he said.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto spokesperson Andrew Tumilty said Thursday the agency spent $16 million over the past three years, less than three per cent of the appraised value of the Quayside land.</p><p>Tumilty said Waterfront Toronto views That money as an \"investment\" in what will one day deliver innovative solutions on the eastern waterfront.</p><p>Sidewalk has spent more than $50 million (U.S.) on the Quayside project.</p><p>Shauna Brail, director and associate professor in U of T's urban studies program, voiced concern about Sidewalk Labs' decision.</p><p>\"There will be many who say that today's decision is a win for Toronto.

He blamed the global economic upheaval caused by the pandemic and the resulting uncertainty over Toronto's real estate market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In October 2017, Sidewalk Labs and Waterfront Toronto set out to plan a shared vision for Quayside, a fundamentally more sustainable and affordable community resulting from innovations in technology and urban design,\" Doctoroff wrote.</p><p>\"So it is with great personal sadness and disappointment that Sidewalk Labs will no longer pursue the Quayside project,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"But as unprecedented economic uncertainty has set in around the world and in the Toronto real estate market, it has become too difficult to make the 12-acre project financially viable without sacrificing core parts of the plan we had developed together with Waterfront Toronto to build a truly inclusive, sustainable community,\" he added.</p><p>\"And so, after a great deal of deliberation, we concluded that it no longer made sense to proceed with the Quayside project, and let Waterfront Toronto know yesterday.\"</p><p>Sidewalk Labs will continue working on urban innovation, he wrote, calling it \"difficult\" to walk away from attempts to reach a final development deal.</p><p>\"Toronto is one of the world's great centres of technological innovation, and nothing about this decision will in any way diminish that,\" he said.</p><p>Keerthana Rang, a spokesperson for Sidewalk Labs said the firm made the decision, then contacted Alphabet, the parent company of Sidewalk Labs and Google on Tuesday.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs will maintain its head office at Parliament Street and Lakeshore Boulevard for now and attempt to redeploy the 30 staffers that work there.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto, a tri-government agency that is steward of Toronto's waterfront lands put out the original request for proposals to develop the 12-acre site in March 2017. Sidewalk Labs won that bid the following October.</p><p>The project, which was to be a mainly residential development with commercial components, became highly controversial, in large part over the collection of data on everything from foot traffic through the community, to the garbage disposal and energy use of residents, weather conditions and more.</p><p>But after a public outcry over privacy and data concerns, Sidewalk Labs agreed to significant concessions, including allowing Waterfront Toronto to be responsible for oversight of how the data collected at Quayside would be stored and managed.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs was also forced to revert to the original 4.8-hectare footprint last fall after backlash over its proposal to help develop as much as 77 hectares of the Port Lands.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto chair Steve Diamond said he's disappointed the project fell through, but not surprised by the news of Sidewalk Labs leaving town.</p><p>\"When you look at the deal, this goes back three years. It was really planned and modelled in a pre-COVID environment,\" said Diamond.</p><p>\"Even then, apart from the financial considerations, the complexity of the project and regulatory changes - the contemplation of construction of a tall timber factory (to construct wood framed buildings at Quayside), these are all enormous undertakings. And if you look around the world today, many existing plans have been altered or abandoned based on these (COVID-19) circumstances.\"</p><p>Diamond suggested the departure of Sidewalk Labs, though unfortunate, presents new opportunities around what to do with the 12 acres and more on the eastern waterfront.</p><p>\"Is a smart city the best objective now for the use of these lands? Or, for example, should we be concentrating on innovation but in a different sense - the opportunity to provide more affordable rental and home ownership opportunities? The opportunity to create new and dynamic public open spaces? The opportunity to create, for example, new ways to help small businesses and retailers?\"</p><p>Diamond, who is a real estate developer, went on to say that Thursday's news isn't a set back for the city.</p><p>\"Toronto is an international city people want to invest in,\" he said.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto spokesperson Andrew Tumilty said Thursday the agency spent $16 million over the past three years, less than three per cent of the appraised value of the Quayside land.</p><p>Tumilty said Waterfront Toronto views that money as an \"investment\" in what will one day deliver innovative solutions on the eastern waterfront.</p><p>Sidewalk has spent more than $50 million (U.S.) on the Quayside project.</p><p>Shauna Brail, director and associate professor in U of T's urban studies program, voiced concern about Sidewalk Labs' decision.</p><p>\"There will be many who say that today's decision is a win for Toronto. I disagree. As a global city, we need to build relationships and partnerships that bring people, new ideas and investments to Toronto.</p><p>\"We won't know the full impact of this decision for some time, however it's safe to say that the implications go well beyond the 12 acres on our waterfront,\" she added.</p><p>\"Regardless of whether or not one agreed with their decision to partner with Sidewalk Labs, Waterfront Toronto will be faced with rebuilding trust - with communities, governments and industry.\"</p><p>Matti Siemiatycki, an associate professor in U of T's geography and planning department said the key now is for Waterfront Toronto to assert itself as the lead planner for that area.</p><p>\"Where the Sidewalk Labs project ran into trouble in the community, is it was unclear who was leading.

Alphabet did very, very well.\"</p><p>\"All of these companies had really strong quarters and all exceeded expectations. Some of them grew the earnings so enormously that it was not in any of the analyst projections, not even on the bullish end of the expectations spectrum. So really a remarkable, remarkable quarter.\"</p><p>Manager of Sarasin &amp; Partners' Digital Opportunities fund Josh Sambrook-Smith observed that the differential in both firms' commercial performance reflected \"the type of advertising they sell\".</p><p>Sambrook-Smith suggested advertisers in Q2 seemed to have reduced their spending on search, as demand was weaker, which led Google to see a decline in revenue growth.</p><p>That reduction in search spend benefited Facebook, whose adverts are more versatile, as firms \"clearly felt placing their advertising dollars higher up the funnel was a better way to invest their budgets\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forget the FAANGs - the top under-the-radar tech opportunities</emphasis></p><p>This, said Raj Shant, portfolio specialist at Jennison Associates, shows investors must look \"under the hood of the big tech companies and not discriminate between the business models\".</p><p>\"There are very real differences in quality and sustainability of the prodigious revenues and cash flows they are currently generating,\" he explained.</p><p>\"While it is tempting to see big tech as one homogeneous entity, it is becoming increasingly imperative to appreciate this is far from the truth.\"</p><p>With the likes of Facebook, Google and their competitors more exposed to advertising revenues that are likely to become increasingly cyclically exposed, \"other business models based on subscription revenues are likely to prove far more enduring\", Shant reasoned.</p><p>\"Similarly, e-commerce penetration may have leapt in recent quarters, but there is still a lot of the retail sales that could still migrate online.</p><p>\"The migration to cloud-based services may also have accelerated sharply during the pandemic but could still have a long runway as corporates have seen the immense convenience and value moving functions onto the cloud can offer.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Artemis US equities head Weldon: Facebook break-up would boost value</emphasis></p><p>While sentiment remains positive on big tech, with Noculak noting \"significant tailwinds\" from a continued shifting or spending from offline to online, there are risks, too, with regulation front and centre.</p><p>Four of the cohort of big tech companies - Facebook, Google, Amazon and Alphabet - were accused of being \"too powerful\" and \"engaged in behaviour that is anti-competitive\" by the US House Antitrust Subcommittee.</p><p>The committee argued that some of these entities \"need to be broken up\", while \"all need to be properly regulated\".</p><p>Investors will eagerly await a report set to be published later this year that could recommend legislative changes. \"These are super profitable companies that have built almost monopolistic positions, are now increasingly being challenged by regulators,\" said Noculak.</p><p>The investment director countered that the risk of regulation is unlikely to be a short-term consideration, \"as there are more urgent things to deal with in this Covid world\". However, as a sector with \"very, very low regulation compared to other parts of the economy\", it is \"a longer term risk that can lead to a cap on future profits\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Polar Capital's Rogoff: Covid-19 will alter people's behaviours forever</emphasis></p><p>But senior markets economist at Capital Economics Oliver Jones noted the antitrust regime, under both Republican and Democratic leadership, has become \"less and less stringent\" since the 1980s.</p><p>\"This suggests to us that a really significant regulatory push against, or break-up of, the big tech firms is highly unlikely in the absence of major political change,\" said Jones.</p><p>Alan Tu, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Equity fund, accepted regulators, politicians and judges are likely to come to different conclusions on the issue and urged investors to \"pay attention as the debate continues\".</p><p>However, he questioned whether these dominant firms are, actually, \"stifling innovation and harming the consumer\".</p><p>Tu believes the opposite may be true. \"The 'Amazon effect' has brought down retail prices, and popular services such as Google Maps or Instagram are free,\" he reasoned.</p><p>\"Appreciation for the services provided by the platform companies during the pandemic has also changed the tone of the conversation, at least temporarily.\"</p><p>Others have drawn parallels with 2020's hearings and the monopolisation case brought agains Microsoft in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when regulators contemplated breaking the firm up, but decided instead to impose conduct remedies demanding the firm to stop behaving badly, Sarasin's Sambrook-Smith recalled.</p><p>That case, noted former assistant attorney general Bill Baer in a recent blog post, took more than three years from initial filing to settlement.</p><p>\"There is no reason to expect that antitrust actions against Google or others will move more rapidly than that one did, or that the courts will be sympathetic to a monopolisation case,\" Baer said.</p><p>As Sambrook-Smith added that by the time Microsoft was sanctioned, one could argue \"the horse had already bolted\", with \"Microsoft still to this day remaining an effective monopoly in the PC market\".</p><p>\"The Microsoft case doesn't exactly imply apocalypse for the FAANGS,\" Sambrook-Smith continued. \"Perhaps just some severe hand slapping and fines?</p><p>\"In any case, a serious economic evaluation of these companies market power certainly doesn't suggest they are dominant. Amazon's share of e-commerce is 45% but its share of US retail spending is less than 10%.

In Brussels, the poll has had a similar effect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the votes are counted in May and MEPs sworn in, there will be a clear-out at the European Commission. Department heads are rushing to complete projects before the new commissioners are appointed in the summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Europe's anti-trust watchdog closed the book on its most significant investigation. Margarethe Vestager, the European Commission's competition chief, fined Google (EURO)1.5 billion for crushing rivals in internet search advertising. It is the third (EURO)1bn-plus sanction that she has meted out to the US giant since 2016.</p><p>The latest case concerns Google's relations with publishers, such as newspaper websites and blogs. Many embed the Google search bar on their sites, and receive a share of the income from related adverts. Google placed onerous restrictions on where publishers could place competing ads, blocking the display of results from rival online search advertisers, which put competitors such as Yahoo and Microsoft at a disadvantage. Google put an end to the practices in 2016, but only after Ms Vestager launched her inquiry.</p><p>The fine comes months after she levied a record (EURO)4.3 billion penalty on Google for abusing its dominant position in mobile phone software to crush competing search and mapping apps. In 2016, Ms Vestager sanctioned Google for doctoring search results to favour its own shopping services. The Silicon Valley tech giant is challenging the first two rulings and is expected to fight the commission's latest fine.</p><p>The connective tissue in all three cases is internet search, where the company controls about 90 per cent of the market. Google has flouted anti-trust rules by using this dominant position as a battering ram to break into new markets and squash putative rivals.</p><p>The commission is to be applauded for holding Google to account, in contrast to the inaction of America's supine competition authority. The question is whether Ms Vestager has achieved her aim of injecting more competition into Europe's digital economy. The answer, at this point, must be \"no\".</p><p>Rivals have failed to establish a foothold in Europe. Despite Ms Vestager's efforts, Google remains in a lucrative feedback loop. The more we use its search engine, the more data it reaps and the fatter profits it can earn from targeted adverts. The fines have barely left a scratch on Google's carapace.

In Brussels, the poll has had a similar effect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the votes are counted in May and MEPs sworn in, there will be a clear-out at the European Commission. Department heads are rushing to complete projects before the new commissioners are appointed in the summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Europe's anti-trust watchdog closed the book on its most significant investigation. Margarethe Vestager, the European Commission's competition chief, fined Google (EURO)1.5 billion for crushing rivals in internet search advertising. It is the third (EURO)1bn-plus sanction that she has meted out to the US giant since 2016.</p><p>The latest case concerns Google's relations with publishers, such as newspaper websites and blogs. Many embed the Google search bar on their sites, and receive a share of the income from related adverts. Google placed onerous restrictions on where publishers could place competing ads, blocking the display of results from rival online search advertisers, which put competitors such as Yahoo and Microsoft at a disadvantage. Google put an end to the practices in 2016, but only after Ms Vestager launched her inquiry.</p><p>The fine comes months after she levied a record (EURO)4.3 billion penalty on Google for abusing its dominant position in mobile phone software to crush competing search and mapping apps. In 2016, Ms Vestager sanctioned Google for doctoring search results to favour its own shopping services. The Silicon Valley tech giant is challenging the first two rulings and is expected to fight the commission's latest fine.</p><p>The connective tissue in all three cases is internet search, where the company controls about 90 per cent of the market. Google has flouted anti-trust rules by using this dominant position as a battering ram to break into new markets and squash putative rivals.</p><p>The commission is to be applauded for holding Google to account, in contrast to the inaction of America's supine competition authority. The question is whether Ms Vestager has achieved her aim of injecting more competition into Europe's digital economy. The answer, at this point, must be \"no\".</p><p>Rivals have failed to establish a foothold in Europe. Despite Ms Vestager's efforts, Google remains in a lucrative feedback loop. The more we use its search engine, the more data it reaps and the fatter profits it can earn from targeted adverts. The fines have barely left a scratch on Google's carapace. The (EURO)8.25 billion of EU penalties is the equivalent of just over three months of after-tax earnings. Alphabet, Google's parent, has a separate reporting line in its accounts, called \"European Commission fines\", suggesting it views the sanctions as a mere business expense.</p><p>On another level, Vestager's campaign has been a success. She has placed the dominance of big tech on the regulatory agenda. The US Federal Trade Commission, dropped an investigation into Google's dominance of internet search in 2013. The tide, however, has turned. Elizabeth Warren, a Presidential hopeful, is among a number of Democrats calling for a break-up of the search giant.</p><p>The EU sanctions are also forcing Google to modify its behaviour.</p><p>Hours before the EU fine was announced, Google said that it would invite Android users in Europe to choose which browsers and search apps they would like to use, instead of crowbarring its own apps on to their home screen.</p><p>It is often said that it is impossible for monopolies to endure in the fastgrowing technology markets.

In Brussels, the poll has had a similar effect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the votes are counted in May and MEPs sworn in, there will be a clear-out at the European Commission. Department heads are rushing to complete projects before the new commissioners are appointed in the summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Europe's anti-trust watchdog closed the book on its most significant investigation. Margarethe Vestager, the European Commission's competition chief, fined Google (EURO)1.5 billion for crushing rivals in internet search advertising. It is the third (EURO)1bn-plus sanction that she has meted out to the US giant since 2016.</p><p>The latest case concerns Google's relations with publishers, such as newspaper websites and blogs. Many embed the Google search bar on their sites, and receive a share of the income from related adverts. Google placed onerous restrictions on where publishers could place competing ads, blocking the display of results from rival online search advertisers, which put competitors such as Yahoo and Microsoft at a disadvantage. Google put an end to the practices in 2016, but only after Ms Vestager launched her inquiry.</p><p>The fine comes months after she levied a record (EURO)4.3 billion penalty on Google for abusing its dominant position in mobile phone software to crush competing search and mapping apps. In 2016, Ms Vestager sanctioned Google for doctoring search results to favour its own shopping services. The Silicon Valley tech giant is challenging the first two rulings and is expected to fight the commission's latest fine.</p><p>The connective tissue in all three cases is internet search, where the company controls about 90 per cent of the market. Google has flouted anti-trust rules by using this dominant position as a battering ram to break into new markets and squash putative rivals.</p><p>The commission is to be applauded for holding Google to account, in contrast to the inaction of America's supine competition authority. The question is whether Ms Vestager has achieved her aim of injecting more competition into Europe's digital economy. The answer, at this point, must be \"no\".</p><p>Rivals have failed to establish a foothold in Europe. Despite Ms Vestager's efforts, Google remains in a lucrative feedback loop. The more we use its search engine, the more data it reaps and the fatter profits it can earn from targeted adverts. The fines have barely left a scratch on Google's carapace. The (EURO)8.25 billion of EU penalties is the equivalent of just over three months of after-tax earnings. Alphabet, Google's parent, has a separate reporting line in its accounts, called \"European Commission fines\", suggesting it views the sanctions as a mere business expense.</p><p>On another level, Vestager's campaign has been a success. She has placed the dominance of big tech on the regulatory agenda. The US Federal Trade Commission, dropped an investigation into Google's dominance of internet search in 2013. The tide, however, has turned. Elizabeth Warren, a Presidential hopeful, is among a number of Democrats calling for a break-up of the search giant.</p><p>The EU sanctions are also forcing Google to modify its behaviour.</p><p>Hours before the EU fine was announced, Google said that it would invite Android users in Europe to choose which browsers and search apps they would like to use, instead of crowbarring its own apps on to their home screen.</p><p>It is often said that it is impossible for monopolies to endure in the fastgrowing technology markets. I'm not so sure. The concentration of personal data in the hands of a small number of companies could give them a decisive lead in new technologies, such as AI. Liberating this data should be the mission of Ms Vestager's successor.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-147557427</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP8-D641-JCBW-N4V7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"638\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They are called Bird scooters. No one asked if they could begin dumping them on our streets, or applied for proper permits to operate legally here. The machines just started appearing in the posher, wealthier, whiter parts of town.  When the city's common council scheduled a hearing on whether to ban the scooters, the Santa Monica-based company that dropped them upon us attempted to foment a protest outside the hearing with an email and Facebook ad campaign. 'Taking away this new, innovative transportation option will hurt Riders. Whether you rely on Bird to help you get around town, to get to work, or to explore local businesses in your neighborhood,' the company implored, 'let's tell the Council that we want them to say, 'NO,' to the proposed ban.' Only about a dozen people showed up to support them, which tracks with the general opinion I heard around town about them. To a person, everyone I spoke to about the scooters\u2014and it was a popular topic for a few weeks\u2014hated them. Matt Wild of the Milwaukee Record[2] called them on their (perhaps not) unique blend of arrogance and cluelessness with a simple, sardonic statement that, without them, 'Sadly, there is now no way to get around town, get to work, or explore local businesses in your neighborhood.'  Apparently, solving the city's transportation needs doesn't include providing adequate public transportation for city residents to get to the manufacturing jobs that have largely relocated to the suburbs over the past two generations, or to give the elderly and other underserved populations living here in the city access to better transportation options, but to give scooters to young urban professionals and tourists along our (admittedly beautiful) lakefront.It wasn't so much the scooters themselves that people objected to, but the hubris with which they arrived and operated. And it wasn't just here in Milwaukee. A similar rollout and backlash has occurred across America.  This rather annoying little episode is more concerning when considered as emblematic of a larger trend in society of tech companies competing to take over or 'disrupt' more and more of the civil services that government has long provided. Once reliant on government contracts and providing business-to-business technology solutions, the latest generation of Silicon Valley has mastered the consumer attention and product business, upending many of the industries that it used to serve in the process, and it is increasingly turning its eye toward larger aspirations. As Lucie Greene writes in her new book, Silicon States[3]: Now, as they mature and start to take themselves more seriously, they're moving into key civic areas and co-opting new power centers. Their cultural influence surpasses government, academic institutions, and even Hollywood. Having taken over our lifestyles, they are vying for our healthcare, infrastructure, energy, space travel, education, and postal systems. Silicon Valley leaders are also starting to think bigger, growing beyond scaling to considering new societal models, systems, town planning, and visions of future worlds. With characteristic hubris, they're also looking at the world around them\u2014they've already changed our social life, our commercial life, why not our political and biological life, as well.  So, what happens when Silicon Valley disrupts and takes over our systems of education, healthcare, and finance? 'What happens,' Greene asks, 'when we all live inside the Silicon State?' Greene uses Robert Moses\u2014a man who championed a culturally insensitive and alienating vision of urban renewal in the mid-20th century, and used it to justify a series of massive building projects that built freeways over existing neighborhoods, erecting housing projects, 'social experiments to accommodate the poor,' in their place\u2014as a warning:  He was immune to the existing and largely successful complex ecosystems housed within cities, which were observed, championed, and highlighted in Jane Jacobs's famous 1961 book, The Death and Life of American Cities[4]. Silicon Valley is selling an updated, data-driven, tech-obsessed vision of a future with similar vision, prejudices, and blind spots.  Greene raises smart questions about Silicon Valley's desire to layer the information superhighway on top of our communities and city services. 'When the city becomes connected,' she warns, 'all urban life becomes another product.'But it is, to a large extent, already happening. Technology companies have already become veritable nation states unto themselves. Facebook has more users than any single nation has citizens. Apple's cash reserves, at $250 billion in 2017, are more than double that of the Federal Reserve. The State Department, in 2016, even appointed an official ambassador to Silicon Valley. And these companies not only surveil the populace more than any government in history, 'they know each individual, in some ways, better than friends or families ever could'\u2014better than we know ourselves in some cases. And the government, once the primary engine of innovation in the world, has largely ceded that role the tech sector.  Where once, government took us to space, our government scientists built the internet, and our prime ministers strategized war\u2014now we look to tech companies to lead us into the future. Greene explains how the media has also been overcome by the narrative and ethos of Silicon Valley, hailing its disruptive startup culture and celebrity CEOs, even as its very business model is being upended by those forces. There are, of course, many issues to take with this disruption, a primary one being that Silicon Valley, which was supposed to level inequality by giving equal footing to anyone with an internet connection, and act as the great democratizer of a connected world, has itself become 'perhaps the most patriarchal white industry around.' And it's not helping that Elon Musk is put on the cover of magazines for digging a hole in a SpaceX parking lot, while Megan Smith, Chief Technology Officer in the Obama administration, is virtually unknown despite her attempt to work on 'the power balance between the government and Silicon Valley, while making sure the government does a few things that Silicon Valley precisely isn't doing: one, making itself accessible to a more diverse workforce. And two, giving credit to women in the story of innovation.' (Musk was again the lead story on The New York Times recently, because it was apparently important for us to know how difficult and painful this year had been for him personally. Meanwhile, Smith has been on a Tech Jobs Tour[5] across America for the past two years discussing how to 'create a workforce that reflects the diversity of America\", which has received approximately zero media coverage.) That should embarrass the media, but tech companies are also undermining journalism itself in more pernicious ways. Because the algorithms of social media (where 62 percent of the population now gets its news) are based on the power the popularity of any given post, memes rise above in-depth reporting and long-form journalism\u2014shock value over truth and accuracy. It's algorithms are designed, asMichiko Kakutani put in in her recent book, The Death of Truth[6], to 'give people news that's popular and trending, rather than accurate or important.' Generated fake news is placed alongside, and on equal footing, with fact-checked journalism and legitimate citizen journalism like user-generated video covering protests and police shootings. It is a state of affairs detrimental to our ongoing experiment in self-governance. But it is the very functions of government that the tech giants have their eyes upon.'Few industries will benefit more than Silicon Valley,\" Greene writes, \"if more aspects of government are privatized.' And their power in already putting pressure on it: Silicon Valley technologies are ultimately exacerbating all the pressures on government and eroding income to government\u2014thus undermining their strength. Automation, Robotics, AI, are all increasing unemployment. Platforms like Airbnb are distorting home and rental prices, forcing out lower income consumers. New technologies are creating swaths of not only ethical dilemmas to research, understand, and forecast but also regulate, putting further pressure on government resources. Widespread drone use alone will need monitoring for privacy reasons. Taken together, it feels like death by a thousand knives, a slow (or not so slow) battle of attrition by 'efficiencies' against the slowness and bureaucracy of government. And its slowness, even when deliberate and considered, is being positioned by tech rivals as a halt on progress. Who will win? This is not helped by the fact that Amazon effectively paid zero taxes in 2017, despite taking in $5.6 billion in U.S. profit, or that between 2010 and 2017, Facebook saved $7.9 billion in federal and state income taxes through a stock option loophole. Meanwhile, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to be seriously considering a run for president, and 'Facebook's board had granted the CEO up to two years leave for public service, while still retaining control of the company, if he wishes,' which is about the amount of time needed to run for office. Of that possibility, Greene writes: The idea of Zuckerberg as politician raises some uncomfortable questions, though. If the [2016] election and Brexit were lessons in the raw power of social media to shape political discourse (and the outcome of elections), what if the mountains of data Facebook has collected were used with strategic intent? It is an alarming proposition, especially in light of the intense lobbying efforts Facebook and other tech companies already have in Washington D.C., which now rival that of oil and big pharma\u2014but with the added benefit of knowing that politicians also rely on these companies for consultation on how to reach constituents on their platforms. And the influence of big tech doesn't end at out borders.Greene also discusses how Silicon Valley is using 'the banners of altruism' to infiltrate and colonize the corners of the world they have not yet reached en masse. Discussing such efforts in Southeast Asia, South America, India, and Africa (even Cuba), Greene writes how: The internet here, like Christianity before it, is presented as the great civilizer, unlocking economies and 'empowering' people to achieve their potential. Free internet infrastructure is being built as a gift in exchange for ownership of the consumer population's digital universe, which of course is infinitely more valuable. The virtual state of Silicon Valley is, here, up against a very real state\u2014China\u2014which is racing to do the same thing. Again, she asks, 'Who will win?' Greene also discusses how the UK's pro-business stance makes it more appealing (or susceptible) to the Silicon Valley ethos, and how Brexit allows it to operate outside of European Union regulation, which is far more stringent. 'London,' Greene writes, 'is already, in many ways, a Silicon Valley colony, a loyal outpost floating alongside a grumpier Europe now clamping down on Big Tech.'And while Greene describes Silicon Valley as more a tribal community than a monolith, she also believes that:Silicon Valley as a concept is important to examine because it has evolved to represent so much more than just a sector or industry in our eyes, and does represent something holistic. It's a culture, a state of mind, and ethos, a language, and an aesthetic.  Silicon States[7] is a history of that culture, and It's encroachment upon popular culture, business culture, and our political culture. Silicon Valley has moved from supplying government (especially the military that funded the research that built it) and consumer business to dirupting those very businesses and government services. Lucie Greene, in looking at the various legal battles and debates around competition, privacy, and a myriad host of other issues arising from this, takes us on a world tour of the current balance of competition. But she also provides glimpse at their desired future. The tech elites now propose to do everything from eliminating disease-spreading mosquitoes to eliminating death itself, has in thier aims everything from digitally colonizing developing countries to establishing literal colonies in the Cosmos. But it is their mission creep into taking over government services that is the primary topic ofSilicon States[8]. And if the rollout and rhetoric around Bird scooters in Milwaukee is any indication, it's not going to be the most inclusive or efficacious of efforts. As Greene writes: The point is most people reading this book aren't the ones who need the government most. It's the people who can't afford an Uber, or the emergency room, those who don't own Macbooks. And they may soon be reliant on the generosity of a group of white, male-dominated, private companies to maintain their livelihood and the marketability of their problems for a new 'social enterprise mission' to survive. Over the time span that tech has come to dominate commerce and culture in this country, 'there has been a fundamental power shift in society from the middle class to the uber-wealthy.' According to the Independent,Just nine of the world's richest men have more combined wealth than the poorest 4 billion people[9], and tech CEOs dominate the list. (Jeff Bezos take the top spot, even asthousands of Amazon workers rely on food stamps[10].) They companies they sit atop have largely avoided regulation, and taxes, as they've climbed their way up that list. As they've built their wealth, society has become more diverse, yet\u2014as many books we've reviewed over the past year, including Brotopia[11] andBroad Band[12], have documented\u2014tech itself has become more exclusively white and male in that time. This has led tech's vision of the future to become, as Greene puts it, one 'architected almost singularly by privileged white men.' That is, it looks a lot like the the nation's past. As tech encroaches upon the civil services we all rely upon, and with all the implications it has for our privacy, and the press, and so much else, Lucie Greene'sSilicon States[13]asks us to pause and ask, is this the future we want?

TECH</p><p>Greene (director, futurist, J. Walter Thompson's Innovation Group) looks at the ways in which multinational tech giants, including Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook and others have resisted government regulation while pushing to take over functions traditionally provided by the state. According to the author, while democratic governments have to balance the interests of constituents, not just shareholders, corporations make decisions based on business goals not moral grounds, despite marketing themselves as being for the social good. Even the philanthropy of corporate leaders is tied to business interests. Greene goes on to explore how Silicon Valley aims to disrupt basic infrastructures of transportation, education, health care, and property ownership in America and abroad, building infrastructure in underdeveloped countries where such services could create monopolistic control. With large amounts of capital plus implementation timescales not tied to an election cycle, they can engage in moonshot projects (sometimes literally) beyond the capacities of individual governments. Ultimately, Greene leaves open the question of whether flaws such as hubris and sexism will check these juggernauts. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> An open-eyed analysis of influential technology companies' ambitions of interest to investors, tech users, and media consumers.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u2014Wade M.

Onstage with the founders of Second Life and LinkedIn, Weizenbaum sulked through his fellow panelists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 talks about the promise of social networks, which at the time were still somewhat novel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These people coming together,\u00e2\u20ac said Philip Rosedale of Second Life, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are building essentially a new society in cyberspace.\u00e2\u20ac Weizenbaum was not convinced. What effects might that virtual society have on the real world? In his long career, he had met many people who earnestly believed technology would soon alleviate humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, and yet salvation always proved to be farther down the road.</p><p>This skepticism--which Noam Cohen highlights in his new book,\u00c2\u00a0The Know-It-Alls--is rare in Silicon Valley today, where large tech companies operate on the premise that they can both change the world and make a lot of money in the process. Facebook promises to make us more connected, Google to organize the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s information, Twitter to democratize free speech and the public sphere, and Amazon to make retail an almost frictionless experience. Together with Microsoft and Apple, these companies are worth over $3 trillion. Their top executives are rewarded with millions in compensation and have acquired the power to shape culture and politics. Google was, for instance, a leading spender on lobbyists in the Obama years, and since the 2016 election, a delegation including Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tim Cook and Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeff Bezos has attended tech summits at Trump Tower and the White House, where they have discussed jobs, immigration, and infrastructure projects.</p><p>Tech leaders, Cohen writes, tend to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153travel in Democratic Party circles but oppose unions, hate-speech codes, or expanded income redistribution.\u00e2\u20ac Their companies sock away billions in offshore havens and funnel their European operations through tax-friendly Ireland. While preaching the values of freedom and independence, these firms collect vast amounts of information on their users, using this welter of data to form detailed dossiers and influence our behavior. Their products are organized less around improving lives than around occupying as much of their users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention as possible. Styling themselves as both pro-corporate and vaguely rebellious, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Know-It-Alls\u00e2\u20ac represent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a merger of a hacker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radical individualism and an entrepreneur\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greed.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>Silicon Valley has not always nurtured these attitudes, nor do they inevitably result from the forward march of technology. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At crucial moments,\u00e2\u20ac Cohen argues, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a relatively few well-positioned people made decisions to steer the web in its current individualistic, centralized, commercialized direction.\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\u00a0The Know-It-Alls\u00c2\u00a0is an attempt to trace the origins of Silicon Valley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s values, by examining some familiar figures--Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, Sergey Brin, and Bill Gates--along with a few lesser-known personalities and their private motivations. How, Cohen asks, did we get to a point where a handful of companies and their executives rule our digital world?</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>In the early 1960s, the Santa Clara Valley was a prosperous region, best known for hosting a few big chip manufacturers that relied on government contracts. Computers were the domain of universities, big business, and the occasional well-heeled hobbyist. There was no software industry to speak of, and some room-sized machines still ran on punch cards. Not until 1971 did the area gain the name Silicon Valley, which the journalist Don Hoefler coined in an\u00c2\u00a0Electronic News\u00c2\u00a0article. The Valley itself was relatively bucolic, honeycombed with orchards and farms.</p><p>Many in the nascent tech industry didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t foresee the rise of the personal computer and thought it laughable that people would want a small computer, with its puny processing power, in their home. As Leslie Berlin writes in her new history of Silicon Valley in the 1970s and \u00e2\u20ac\u212280s,\u00c2\u00a0Troublemakers,\u00c2\u00a0some companies didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to market their inventions. Intel, for instance, began by pitching its microprocessor as a control device used for commercial and industrial applications--farm equipment, elevators, dialysis machines, irrigation. (Early microprocessors were also used in Minuteman missiles.) Software, too, was not considered something that the general public would pay for. Why would they, when it was freely traded among hobbyists?</p><p>Perhaps no story of missed opportunity is as widely mythologized as that of Xerox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PARC research lab. Under the leadership of Robert Taylor, a former Advanced Research Projects Agency official who helped develop the early Arpanet, PARC was renowned for its research and development, which combined academic rigor with a vast corporation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enormous cash reserves. PARC researchers helped design the Alto, an early minicomputer that became widely used within Xerox. But obstinate executives refused to start selling the machine to other companies and individuals, thus missing out on Xerox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best chance to enter the personal computing market. PARC would later become famous for failing to capitalize on many of the innovations developed there, from graphical user interfaces to the mouse.</p><p>The inability of lumbering establishment firms to see opportunity sparked frustration, if not outright revolt, among some employees. Tracing the Valley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history from the \u00e2\u20ac\u212260s to the mid-\u00e2\u20ac\u212280s, Berlin describes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153generational hand-off\u00e2\u20ac that took place when \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pioneers of the semiconductor industry passed the baton to younger up-and-comers developing innovations that would one day occupy the center of our lives.\u00e2\u20ac Many of the characters in\u00c2\u00a0Troublemakers\u00c2\u00a0work at large chip manufacturers or industrial concerns before alighting on some new idea that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be adequately commercialized at their current jobs. Longing for independence, they strike out on their own, perhaps recruiting another founder along the way.</p><p>In many cases, these defections--the courageous moments when a bootstrapping entrepreneur decided to break away from the comfort of an engineering job at Hewlett-Packard or IBM--acquire a mythos of their own. A group of Shockley Semiconductor employees who left to launch Fairchild Semiconductor were called the Traitorous Eight, while the other companies they eventually spawned, like Intel and AMD, came to be known as the Fairchildren. The malaise at Xerox drove a personnel exodus from the lab, and its alumni would go on to found companies like 3Com, Adobe, and Pixar. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We drank at the Xerox PARC well deeply and often,\u00e2\u20ac said Don Valentine, an influential venture capitalist, speaking for the many companies who would benefit from PARC talent.</p><p>A central figure in the shift toward commercialization was Niels Reimers, a former naval officer who, after some time at two electronics firms, took up an administrative post at Stanford. There he would use his professional expertise, along with his connections with what some students had taken to calling the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evil forces\u00e2\u20ac--the Pentagon and defense contractors--to cement Stanford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place in the growing tech industry. At a time when many professors worried that commercializing their discoveries would compromise their academic integrity, Reimers showed no such hesitation. By pushing professors to patent their discoveries, he transformed Stanford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office of Technology Licensing, earning the school hundreds of millions of dollars and establishing it as a key incubator for startups. Among other advances, he helped usher recombinant DNA technology to market under the patronage of Genentech, a Stanford-affiliated startup that would grow into a biotech giant.</p><p>The arc of Reimers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career, as told in\u00c2\u00a0Troublemakers,\u00c2\u00a0tracks the maturing relationship between Stanford and Silicon Valley. By the time Berlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book ends, the two cultures are nearly inseparable. Whole industries have been invented, from personal computing to biotech, while the area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fruit trees have been bulldozed, making way for office parks for the likes of Atari, Apple, and Intel.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>During this time, the tech industry was taking on many of the features that define it today. There is, for one thing, a deep undercurrent of sexism running through the industry in this period. We learn that early word processors were difficult to market to executives, who saw typing as coded female. The offices of the video game company Atari were less than professional, as founder Nolan Bushnell held meetings in hot tubs, and workers smoked weed on the production line. (Bushnell, who would later found Chuck E. Cheese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, was also known to wear a T-shirt that said I LOVE TO FUCK.) A Warner executive who was considering acquiring the company worried that Atari was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bunch of guys getting whacked every day and chasing women.\u00e2\u20ac Sandra Kurtzig--the founder of ASK, for a time one of the largest software companies in the world--\u00e2\u20ac\u0153was mistaken repeatedly for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbooth babe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac at an industry conference in 1976.</p><p>While Berlin acknowledges the backward gender dynamics at play, she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see them as a problem with the industry, so much as a product of the times. That would be a more convincing argument if tech were not still overwhelmingly male-dominated and in many cases hostile to women. Companies like Uber are only beginning to be called to account for their institutional sexism: In February 2017, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote on her personal blog of her experience of sexual harassment at the ride-sharing app. In 2012, Ellen Pao sued the Silicon Valley\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbased venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers for gender discrimination, after being repeatedly passed over for promotion--and lost. Only 31 percent of Google employees are women and, according to an internal study that was leaked to\u00c2\u00a0The New York Times\u00c2\u00a0in September 2017, they are paid less than their male counterparts.</p><p>During the transitional period in Berlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book, Silicon Valley executives and programmers show little concern for the core values of American democracy. Even though\u00c2\u00a0Troublemakers\u00c2\u00a0is partly set in the Bay Area in the \u00e2\u20ac\u212260s and \u00e2\u20ac\u212270s--a hub of activism and protest--her entrepreneurs appear largely insulated from the period\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social and political ferment. A few oppose the war in Vietnam, while others are leery of accepting research funding from the Defense Department, though many still take it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Defense-based industries, with their lack of price sensitivity, had driven technological change in Silicon Valley since before the Second World War,\u00e2\u20ac Berlin writes, when agricultural companies began converting tractor treads into tank treads. In 1960, nearly 40 percent of Stanford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget came from the federal government, Cohen notes in\u00c2\u00a0The Know-It-Alls.</p><p>Economic ties were not the only reason many engineers stayed out of the era\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defining events. Some believed that politics was simply a distraction from the real work of technological disruption: Gordon Moore, one of the founders of Intel, said that engineers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are really the revolutionaries in the world today--not the kids with the long hair and beards.\u00e2\u20ac Silicon Valley companies would go on to disrupt the nature of work, as web sites have replaced many bricks-and-mortar businesses, and apps like Uber and TaskRabbit offer short-term, insecure gigs instead of long-term, salaried employment.</p><p>From their earliest years, the companies Berlin profiles opposed labor protections, convincing workers that they were in fact better off on their own. Indeed, in her account, Berlin conjures an improbable world in which management and frontline workers lived in conflict-free bonhomie. As Fawn Alvarez tells Berlin while describing her life at ROLM, a company that manufactured ruggedized computers for the defense industry before moving into phone systems, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had good chairs, good lighting. We could go to the bathroom without raising our hands. We had dignity. What could we get from a union that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already have?\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>Perhaps unbeknownst to Alvarez, companies like ROLM actively engaged in union-busting tactics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The four ROLM founders shared a dislike of unions, which they believed fostered adversarial relationships among people who should be working together,\u00e2\u20ac Berlin gently notes. Industry organizations \u00e2\u20ac\u0153offered legal aid to companies facing unionization efforts and multiday seminars for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompanies that are nonunion and wish to remain so.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac Along with the offshoring of labor, these efforts would help keep Silicon Valley union-free. Meanwhile, the industry-wide cooperation involved would foreshadow more recent schemes in which top tech firms agreed to fix wages and not to poach one another\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talent.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Berlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history cuts off before she gets a chance to see how the influx of vast sums of money would undermine the idealism of many tech companies. For this, Cohen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book with its focus on \u00e2\u20ac\u212290s companies is instructive. Consider the story of Google, lately rechristened Alphabet. When they were Ph.D. students at Stanford working on early search-engine technology, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, realized that the pursuit of advertising revenue could cause search engines to unfairly promote or bury some search results--a cell phone manufacturer would not, for instance, want its ad to appear next to an article on the dangers of mobile phones. It was a minefield of ethical entanglements and potential unintended consequences. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe,\u00e2\u20ac they concluded, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>The two young computer scientists had stumbled upon a thundering truth, and yet they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heed it. In the mid-to-late \u00e2\u20ac\u212290s, Stanford was a hotbed of entrepreneurship; there was already an on-campus search-engine startup in the form of Yahoo! Venture capitalists were sometimes funding students before they graduated. Brin and Page thought that they could be research-focused computer scientists while also using the might of big business to improve the human condition. As Page remarked, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to just invent things, I also wanted to make the world better.\u00e2\u20ac By 1998, the offers were already coming in, as some of their professors urged them to seek outside funding. Andy Bechtolsheim, a founder of Sun Microsystems, was so impressed by a Google demo that he wrote Brin and Page a $100,000 check, before the company had even been incorporated. Several other outside investors were brought in (one of them was Jeff Bezos), along with an infusion of venture-capital cash.</p><p>Within a few years, Brin and Page caved and began developing the carefully targeted ad products that would soon turn the company into a Goliath. Rather than modeling transparency, Google became secretive in its practices, asking neither forgiveness nor permission when it decided--to name one example among many--to scan the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corpus of books. Even as Google tracked its users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clicks, habits, and locations in a vast feat of surveillance, it continued to style itself as a civic-minded entity, providing information services to a world that increasingly saw being online as something like a human right.</p><p>The awkward fusion of market values and vague humanitarianism has become the defining feature of contemporary Silicon Valley ideology. In a paper published in 1970, John McCarthy, an influential computer scientist who was later a visitor to the Google campus, envisioned the boundless potential of networked communications, an \u00c3\u00a0 la carte system in which users would be free to trawl the sum total of human knowledge. As Cohen notes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only threat McCarthy could see to the beautiful system he was conjuring were monopolists.\u00e2\u20ac Of course, McCarthy became an influence on one of the largest technology companies of them all, one that has frequently been deemed a monopoly for its dominance of search and advertising services. Google has been the subject of a spate of antitrust investigations in Europe, Australia, and the United States, and faces billions in potential fines for everything from mishandling of user data to burying results for competitors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 products--just the kind of behavior about which the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founders once voiced concern.</p><p>To get from the optimism of the \u00e2\u20ac\u212290s to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surveillance-driven monopolies necessarily involves a bending of ideals. Alphabet has benefited from a strong institutional culture--its motto until 2015 was DON\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T BE EVIL--that assures its thousands of employees their work is synonymous with human progress. It similarly reassures its users by projecting an image of public- spiritedness--the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge, provided gratis by Google. And yet, an organization cannot vacuum up the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s information, map its every street and house, and track the tastes and behaviors of billions of people without reproducing some offline biases and inequalities. Facial recognition algorithms have misidentified dark-skinned people as animals. Search results for traditionally black names have produced ads for bail bonds and background checks. Payday lenders use microtargeting to push their products to people who are precariously employed and vulnerable. The list of sins is extensive.</p><p>The promises of convenience and corporate benevolence may have so far limited much of the backlash against tech companies. Longtime Bay Area residents have for years protested the influence of big tech on their communities, where the price of housing stock has risen dramatically. Now the rest of the country is beginning to wake up, partly because of concerns over the way social media contributed to polarization and spread misinformation during the 2016 election. The tech industry now faces a level of congressional scrutiny not seen since the Microsoft antitrust actions of 20 years ago. Its executives have been blasted by congressional committees investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have a huge problem on your hands,\u00e2\u20ac Senator Dianne Feinstein told representatives of Google, Twitter, and others in November 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have to be the ones to do something about it. Or we will.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>A refusal to reckon with things as they are, to speak in plain language, continues to dog conversations about the inequalities produced by the tech industry. The assumption that technology is inherently a force for good and that the social changes it brings are inevitable and irresistible contributes to the power of multinational corporations, discouraging their users from demanding better protections and more regulation.</p><p>Joseph Weizenbaum stood out among his fellow panelists at Davos because he used a different, more critical vocabulary. It seemed as if no one had ever said no to them before, much less attacked the pillars of their industry. He was used to being ignored--a colleague once accused him of being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153carbon-based chauvinist\u00e2\u20ac because he had raised questions about the promise of artificial intelligence. What Weizenbaum wanted, it seems, was some acknowledgment that Second Life, and whatever virtual creations might follow, would always be a sideshow, secondary to the more important work of satisfying basic human needs.</p><p>On the stage in Davos, Weizenbaum pleaded the case for critical thinking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must acknowledge that mankind is a brotherhood and a sisterhood,\u00e2\u20ac he told the audience, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and we should not exploit one another the way we are doing it.\u00e2\u20ac He might as well have been shouting into a void. Silicon Valley has yet, it seems, to develop a theory of its own power, to fully grok its influence on our economic, social, and political lives. With few exceptions, much popular tech writing takes an overwhelmingly admiring approach to its subjects. Meanwhile, the academy is filled with blisteringly smart, well-sourced scholars of technology and communications who carry Weizenbaum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s humanistic torch--such as Latanya Sweeney, who has studied online discrimination, and Shoshana Zuboff, who has written on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153surveillance capitalism,\u00e2\u20ac a term she helped popularize. Like Weizenbaum, these critics find their expertise often overlooked. Who wants to stop and ask questions when the money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rolling in?</p><p>When tech leaders prophesy a utopia of connectedness and freely flowing information, they do so as much out of self-interest as belief. Rather than a decentralized, democratic public square, the internet has given us a surveillance state monopolized by a few big players. That may puzzle technological determinists, who saw in networked communications the promise of a digital agora. But strip away the trappings of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legendary origins or Atari\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s madcap office culture, and you have familiar stories of employers versus employees, the maximization of profit, and the pursuit of power. In that way, at least, these tech companies are like so many of the rest.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>JACOB SILVERMAN\u00c2\u00a0is the author of\u00c2\u00a0Terms of Service: Social Media and the Price of Constant Connection.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a9 2018, The New Republic</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u201a</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWRPB-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWRPB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RPG-DGY1-JBRW-C008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">154997</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New Republic, LLC</copyright><publicationName>The New Republic</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 1, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Social networks would need to show how much time users spend on them and set a default limit of 30 minutes a day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Parents of teenagers mustn't get their hopes up: the Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology (SMART) Act is unlikely to become law. But the fact that it exists\u2014and was put forward by a Republican senator, Josh Hawley of Missouri\u2014shows how quickly the tide has turned in Washington against big technology firms. After decades of letting them do more or less as they please, the state is ready to strike back. Voters are on board: one recent survey found that two Americans in three support breaking the companies up. </p><p>Big Tech is worried. Its bosses, once infrequent visitors to the Beltway, have become a regular fixture. Last month Mark Zuckerberg spent a week there, meeting President Donald Trump and lawmakers. On October 1st a recording surfaced of Facebook's boss describing the plans of Elizabeth Warren, a left-wing Democratic presidential hopeful, to break up his firm and others as an \"existential\" threat. Google's parent company, Alphabet, has recruited as its top lobbyist a former chief of staff to a Republican senator. Wall Street wants to know what all this means for the business models of America's biggest companies. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet are the world's four most valuable listed firms. Add Facebook, which is the sixth, and they are worth a combined $4.3trn.</p><p>Tech bulls can argue, with justification, that all the frenzied activity amounts to little more than exercises, with the odd warning shot. Some tech firms' share prices have been dented by the trade war. None, as yet, has been badly hurt by the techlash at home. Even so, the contours of a battle plan against the industry are emerging. It has two prongs. Officials are using existing laws to pursue the companies, particularly over anticompetitive behaviour. And politicians are drafting new legislation. Neither is yet an all-out assault. Both portend a prolonged pitched battle. </p><p>Start with the investigations. The Department of Justice (DoJ), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the House antitrust subcommittee have all launched inquiries. In a sign that Alphabet's new pointman will be busy, a congressional committee sent the company a 17-page letter last month demanding a decade's worth of emails between senior executives on a range of matters and, on September 9th, 48 state attorneys-general launched an antitrust probe into the company. Any day the attorney-general, William Barr, is expected to announce an investigation into Facebook.</p><p>Most of these efforts so far amount to fishing expeditions. Their precise scope has yet to be determined. Even the division of labour between the investigators is unclear. Although they reportedly agreed to one in June, the DoJ and the FTC have yet to decide which tech titans each will go after, as became apparent when senators quizzed Makan Delrahim, who heads the DoJ's antitrust division, and the FTC's chairman, Joe Simons, on September 17th. </p><p>Even if the FTC and the DoJ argue for radical measures such as break-ups, and convince lower courts, most federal appeals-court judges (not to mention the conservative majority on the Supreme Court) are reluctant antitrust enforcers, steeped in old teachings of the University of Chicago, which urge that companies be left alone so long as they do not harm consumers.</p><p>Still, the general line of attack is clear. Amazon, Apple and Google are being taken to task over their chokehold on e-commerce, app stores and search engines, respectively. Google and Facebook face scrutiny over online advertising, which they dominate. The giants will have to show that buying startups like CTRL-Labs (which develops brain-computer interfaces and has just been acquired by Facebook) is not simply a way to neutralise rivals. </p><p>It is a similar story on Capitol Hill. Bills to regulate tech have mushroomed. Mr Hawley alone has introduced half a dozen since joining the Senate in January. Besides the addictiveness of tech, they cover children's privacy, online gaming and content moderation. Some have Democrat co-authors. One, nicknamed the DASHBOARD Act (don't ask), would require online platforms to disclose the value of data they collect on users; Mark Warner, a former venture capitalist, helped write it. Another, backed by Richard Blumenthal and Ed Markey, would ban video games from letting players (including under-age ones) pay a fee and receive random awards, which looks an awful lot like gambling. </p><p>With the possible exception of a federal privacy bill, which tech firms are promoting before a strict California state law enters into force in January and becomes de facto law of the land, most existing proposals may not get far. Impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump will distract lawmakers for months. If elected next year, a President Warren may not be able to ram her ideas through what is likely to remain a Republican-controlled Senate. </p><p>But Big Tech will be under fire whoever wins the presidency. Agencies and politicians are \"on a steep learning curve\", says another lobbyist. The FTC has a dedicated \"tech task force\" and two activist commissioners. One, Rohit Chopra, cut his teeth at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where he led efforts to reform America's student-loan system. The House has hired Lina Khan, author of an influential paper on Amazon's power, as counsel. </p><p>Trustbusters and lawmakers are also gathering intelligence. Besides the missive to Google, the antitrust subcommittee has sent requests for information to Amazon, Apple, Facebook and dozens of other firms. Oracle, a software-maker and old foe of Google's, got one from Texas's attorney-general. Snap, a social-media firm, is said to keep a dossier documenting Facebook's anticompetitive actions, which it is sure to share with regulators and Congress. </p><p>Think-tanks which get pots of money from Big Tech are no longer the main resource available to its opponents. Less conflicted brain trusts backed by diverse donors, such as the Electronic Privacy Information Centre, which used to specialise in consumer-data protection, or Public Knowledge, once focused on media regulation, now study antitrust, too. Tim Wu of Columbia Law School and others have devised a legal strategy to make Facebook spin off Instagram and WhatsApp. In September a report from the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, of all places, called for vigorous merger control and a \"digital authority\" to oversee online competition. Republicans, who are friendlier to big business but accuse tech platforms (without evidence) of discriminating against right-leaning content, have set up the Internet Accountability Project. </p><p>Big Tech is not standing still. Its lobbyists will try to disarm radical proposals. It has squadrons of lawyers on hand. Firms are adapting in anticipation of rules to come. Facebook, Google and others plan to make it easier for users to move their data between services. Neither Silicon Valley nor Washington is bracing for a Blitz. Rather, prepare for a grinding war of attrition. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-S1870PP</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X65-2271-DY2R-202M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1237\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Confronted by the ghastly reality that some of their proudest creations \u2013 Google, Facebook and Twitter \u2013 helped propel <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>into the White House, the tech titans of Silicon Valley are hitting esc like panic-stricken sophomores whose term papers have frozen before they clicked on the \u201csave\u201d icon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cContent moderators\u201d are being hired by the thousand. Fake accounts are being closed. The News Feed is being \u201cfixed.\u201d Esc, esc, esc. But that page is still frozen. And it will take more than esc to fix this. More like alt+ctrl+del.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. For a time, it seemed as if the internet was on democracy\u2019s side, helping the crowds in Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square or Kiev\u2019s Maidan topple terrible tyrants. \u201cCurrent network technology \u2026 truly favours the citizens,\u201d wrote Google\u2019s <person><nameText>Jared Cohen </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Eric Schmidt </nameText></person>in their 2013 book The New Digital Age. \u201cNever before have so many people been connected through an instantly responsive network,\u201d with truly \u201cgame-changing\u201d implications for politics everywhere.</p><p>Mr. Cohen and Mr. Schmidt\u2019s 2010 article \u201cThe Digital Disruption\u201d presciently argued that authoritarian governments would \u201cbe caught off-guard when large numbers of their citizens, armed with virtually nothing but cellphones, take part in mini-rebellions that challenge their authority.\u201d The \u201creal action\u201d in what they called \u201cthe interconnected estate\u201d could be found in \u201ccramped offices in Cairo\u201d as well as \u201con the streets of Tehran. From these locations and others, activists and technology geeks are rallying political \u2018flash mobs\u2019 that shake repressive governments, building new tools to skirt firewalls and censors, reporting and tweeting the new online journalism, and writing a bill of human rights for the internet age.\u201d</p><p>Even more euphoric was <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>the co-founder and chief executive of Facebook. In 2015, he called the internet \u201ca force for peace in the world.\u201d Connecting people on Facebook was building a \u201ccommon global community\u201d with a \u201cshared understanding\u201d of the problems confronting humanity.</p><p>Oh, happy days. Oh, glad, confident morning. Sadly, over the past two years, it has gradually become apparent that internet may pose a bigger threat to democracies than to dictators. For one thing, the growth of network platforms with unprecedented data-gathering capabilities has created new opportunities for authoritarian regimes, not least in China and Russia, to control their own populations more effectively.</p><p>For another, the networks themselves offer ways in which bad actors \u2013 and not only the Russian government \u2013 can undermine democracy by disseminating fake news and extreme views. \u201cThese social platforms are all invented by very liberal people on the west and east coasts,\u201d said Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital-media director, in an interview last year. \u201cAnd we figure out how to use it to push conservative values. I don\u2019t think they thought that would ever happen.\u201d Too right.</p><p>Having initially dismissed as \u201ca pretty crazy idea\u201d the notion that fake news on Facebook had helped Mr. Trump to victory, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>last year came clean: Russians using false identities had paid for 3,000 Facebook advertisements that sent implicitly pro-Trump messages to Americans before and after the election. By some estimates, between 146 and 150 million users \u2013 more people than voted \u2013 had seen posts from accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, a pro-Kremlin organization, including around 16 million users of Instagram, which Facebook owns.</p><p>One analysis of six Russia-linked Facebook pages found that their posts had been shared 340 million times. And those were just six of 470 pages that Facebook had identified as Russian. Trolls with false identities had also used Facebook Events (the company\u2019s event-management tool) to promote political protests in the United States, including an Aug. 27, 2016, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rally in a rural Idaho town known to welcome refugees.</p><p>In May, 2016, two Russian-linked Facebook groups had organized simultaneous opposing protests in front of the Islamic Da\u2019wah Center of Houston. \u201cHeart of Texas,\u201d a bogus group claiming to favour Texas secession, had announced a noon rally on May 21 to \u201cStop Islamification of Texas.\u201d Meanwhile, a separate Russian-sponsored group, \u201cUnited Muslims of America,\u201d had advertised a \u201cSave Islamic Knowledge\u201d rally for exactly the same place and time. This wasn\u2019t the kind of global community <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>had envisaged.</p><p>This is not just an American story. To an extent that is not well enough appreciated, it is a global crisis of democracy. Similar efforts were made, albeit on a smaller scale, to influence the outcome of the British referendum on European Union membership \u2013 mainly via fake Twitter accounts \u2013 as well as last year\u2019s elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. And the fact that the Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election has since become the focal point of multiple inquiries in Washington \u2013 which may even pose a threat to the legitimacy and longevity of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 does not mean that similar things are not going on in other countries even as you read this article. Canadians have good reason to worry about how social media could impact their country's 2019 federal election, for example. When Facebook and Twitter told MPs last year that they could increase public engagement in the debates between party leaders, some people wondered how much of this would be provided by Russian bots.</p><p>Yet the most alarming revelation of the past year is not the importance of Russian fake news, but its unimportance. Former president Barack Obama implicitly acknowledged that in his recent Netflix interview with David Letterman. Having swept into the White House in 2008 as the first candidate of the social media age, Obama acknowledged that he had \u201cmissed \u2026 the degree to which people who are in power, special interests, foreign governments, et cetera, can in fact manipulate [social media] and propagandize.\u201d</p><p>However, the former law professor made no attempt to lay all the blame on outside forces. \u201cWhat the Russians exploited,\u201d he said, \u201cwas already here \u2026 [The fact that] we are operating in completely different information universes. If you watch Fox News, you are living on a different planet than you are if you listen to NPR. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening with these Facebook pages, where more and more people are getting their news from. At a certain point, you just live in a bubble. And that\u2019s part of why our politics is so polarized right now.\u201d</p><p>What happened in 2016 was much more than just a Kremlin \u201cblack op\u201d that exceeded expectations. It was a direct result of the profound change in the public sphere brought about by the advent and spectacular growth of the online network platforms. In many ways, the obsessive focus of the American political class on the Russian sub-plot is a distraction from the alarming reality that \u2013 as the European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager argued earlier this month \u2013 the big tech companies, and the way their services are used by ordinary people, pose a much bigger threat to democracy. It is the threat from within we really need to worry about \u2013 not the threat from Putin.</p><p>A polarization problem</p><p>We are nearly all addicts. The website eMarketer estimates that adult Facebook users in the United States spent roughly 41 minutes a day on the platform in 2017. And that\u2019s just our favourite app. The average smartphone user clicks, taps and swipes that insidious little device an amazing 2,617 times a day.</p><p>And we don\u2019t just passively read. We engage. We like. We retweet. We reply. We comment. Now, it must be admitted that most of what we write is inane. In Canada, the five most-commonly used words in Facebook status updates are: \u201cday,\u201d \u201changover,\u201d \u201cloud,\u201d \u201cticket\u201d and \u201cword.\u201d (\u201cHangover\u201d is ranked 7th in Britain and 8th in the United States \u2013 make of that what you will.)</p><p>But a fair amount of what we engage with online is news. Two-thirds of U.S. adults are on Facebook. Nearly half \u2013 45 per cent \u2013 get news from Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>\u2019s platform. More than one in 10 Americans get news from YouTube, while roughly the same proportion (11 per cent) get news from Twitter. In Canada, 51 per cent of people get their news from digital sources first. As a recent Harvard paper co-authored by Gary King demonstrates, the network platforms essentially amplify news from established news outlets. As they do so, however, a strange thing happens. Whether one looks at blogs or at Twitter, social media tend to promote polarization. Liberal bloggers link to liberal bloggers, rarely to conservative ones. Liberal Twitter users re-tweet one another, seldom their conservative counterparts. And tweets on political topics \u2013 gun control, same-sex marriage, climate change \u2013 are 20 per cent more likely to be retweeted for every moral or emotional word they employ.</p><p>Note also that political Twitter is not for everyone. As Daniel Hopkins, Ye Liu, Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro and Lyle Ungar have shown, by analyzing nearly five million tweets generated by four thousand Twitter accounts in August, 2016, it is \u201cvery conservative\u201d and \u201cvery liberal\u201d users who are most likely to tweet political words.</p><p>We see a similar phenomenon when we analyze the Facebook followers of U.S. legislators. In both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the pattern is clear: The more ideologically out there you are \u2013 whether to the left or the right \u2013 the more followers you are likely to have.</p><p>In this context, it becomes apparent that Russian fake news represented a drop in an ocean of inflammatory political commentary that was overwhelmingly indigenous. Between March, 2015, and November, 2016, 128 million Americans created nearly 10 billion Facebook posts, shares, likes and comments about the election. Remember how many Russian ads there were? That\u2019s right: a paltry 3,000.</p><p>According to new research by Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College, Andrew Guess of Princeton University and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter, roughly one in four Americans saw at least one false story in the run-up the presidential election. But fake stories were just 1 per cent of the news Hillary Clinton supporters read, and 6 per cent of the news Trump supporters read.</p><p>Remember, too, that not all the Russian-sourced news was fake. The tens of thousands of e-mails hacked from the accounts of John Podesta and other Democrats were as real as they were confidential. But it wasn\u2019t the Russians who were driving the traffic on the Breitbart website to record highs. It wasn\u2019t the Russians who explained to the Trump campaign how they could use targeted Facebook advertising to compensate \u2013 with precision \u2013 for what they lacked in dollars. It was Silicon Valley: its big data, its algorithms, its employees.</p><p>A matter of priorities</p><p>Don\u2019t take it from me. Take it from former Facebook staff who have spoken out in the past year. Antonio Garcia Martinez, the former Facebook engineer and author of the book Chaos Monkeys, put it starkly: \u201cI think there\u2019s a real question if democracy can survive Facebook and all the other Facebook-like platforms,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBefore platforms like Facebook, the argument used to be that you had a right to your own opinion. Now, it\u2019s more like the right to your own reality.\u201d</p><p>Facebook\u2019s propaganda was all about building a global community. But in practice, the company was laser-focused on the bottom line \u2013 and highly resistant to outside criticism. Sandy Parakilas, who worked as an operations manager to fix privacy problems on Facebook\u2019s developer platform in advance of its 2012 initial public offering, has said that the company \u201cprioritized data collection from its users over protecting them from abuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was at Facebook,\u201d he said last year, \u201cthe typical reaction I recall looked like this: Try to put any negative press coverage to bed as quickly as possible, with no sincere efforts to put safeguards in place or to identify and stop abusive developers.\u201d The policy was to \u201creact only when the press or regulators make something an issue, and avoid any changes that would hurt the business of collecting and selling data.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps the most scathing assessment came from former vice-president for user growth, Chamath Palihapitiya. \u201cI think,\u201d he told an audience of students at Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business in December, \u201cwe have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works. \u2026 The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse, no co-operation: misinformation, mistrust. And it\u2019s not an American problem \u2013 this is not about Russians ads. This is a global problem.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Palihapitiya said he felt \u201ctremendous guilt\u201d about his own part in this because he believed he and his former colleagues \u201ckind of knew something bad would happen.\u201d He is not alone in feeling guilty. Facebook\u2019s first president, Sean Parker, has talked in similar terms. Another early employee told Vanity Fair, \u201cMost of the early employees I know are totally overwhelmed by what this thing has become. They look at the role Facebook now plays in society \u2026 and they have this sort of \u2018Oh my God, what have I done\u2019 moment.\u201d</p><p>True, in recent months Facebook has scrambled to respond to all this recrimination. On Sept. 21, for example, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>pledged to work \u201cpro-actively to strengthen the democratic process.\u201d Facebook would require that all political ads disclose which page paid for them and ensure that each ad is accessible to everyone. Later last year, he announced plans to clamp down on \u201cbad content and bad actors\u201d by doubling the number of employees and contractors who handle safety and security issues to 20,000 by the end of 2018. And just last week, he announced an overhaul of the News Feed to prioritize \u201cmeaningful interaction\u201d between users over the kind of media-generated content that advertisers like.</p><p>But if you think this kind of self-regulation is going to fix democracy\u2019s social-media problem, then I have a bridge to sell you. For one thing, it would take at least an order of magnitude more people to achieve meaningful monitoring of the vast amount of content that Facebook\u2019s two billion-plus users produce and share every day. For another, none of this alters the company\u2019s fundamental business model, which is to sell advertisers the precision targeting that Facebook\u2019s user data allows. Political advertising may henceforth be identified as such, in the way that it is on television. But just how much less effective will that make it?</p><p>Google says it will curate its \u201cNews\u201d search results more carefully, to rank established newspaper sites above bulletin boards such as 4chan or Reddit, which are favourite channels for alt-right content. Anyone who thinks that will stop people reading fake news hasn\u2019t found the \u201cscroll down\u201d button on their keyboard.</p><p>A new kind of politics</p><p>The reality is, no matter how Facebook, Google and Twitter tweak their algorithms, a new kind of politics has been born. It can no more be unborn than the new kind of politics born when television revealed how much better-looking John F. Kennedy was than sweaty Richard Nixon, with his five o\u2019clock shadow. Or how easily Lyndon Johnson could make Barry Goldwater seem like a man who wanted to drop atomic bombs on little children.</p><p>There are now two kinds of politicians in this world: the kind that know how to use social media as a campaign tool and the ones who lose elections. All over the world, the distinction is clear. The populists of the right and of the left understand the power of social media. The moderates who occupy the centre ground, with few exceptions \u2013 Justin \u201cSelfie\u201d Trudeau is one of them \u2013 are still playing by 1990s rules.</p><p>Among the few indicators that Mr. Trump had a good chance of beating Ms. Clinton were his enormous leads on Facebook and Twitter throughout the 2016 campaign. Applying similar metrics around the world yields startling results. Take Britain, for example. The Leave campaign\u2019s victory in the 2016 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union owed a great deal to its pioneering use of Facebook advertising. Yet the principal political beneficiary of Brexit \u2013 the woman who became prime minister shortly after the referendum, Theresa May \u2013 is a social-media loser, with little more than half a million Facebook followers and even less on Twitter. By comparison, the Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 a grizzled populist of the left in the style of Bernie Sanders \u2013 has 1.3 million followers on Facebook followers and 1.7 million on Twitter (numbers as of Jan. 18). No other British politician comes close. Boris Johnson is often mentioned in the same breath as Mr. Trump, but all the two men really have in common is big hair. Mr. Corbyn has four times more Twitter followers than \u201cBoJo.\u201d</p><p>Britain has no election scheduled for 2018 \u2013 although it is possible Ms. May\u2019s woefully weak government could fall as the economic costs of Brexit make themselves felt and the harsh realities of the EU\u2019s divorce terms become apparent. Elsewhere, however, electorates are preparing to vote in general elections, notably in Brazil, Colombia, Italy and Mexico. These contests will give us a chance to see how far the new politics has spread.</p><p>Start with Brazil, a country whose political elite has been battered by corruption scandals that led to the impeachment of the Workers\u2019 Party President Dilma Rouseff and probably disqualify her predecessor, Luiz Lula da Silva, from running this year. But who cares? Lula has three million Facebook followers and just 189,000 Twitter followers. Far ahead of him on social media is Luciano Huck, the entrepreneur and television star, host of the hugely popular Saturday night TV show Caldeirao do Huck. With 17 million Facebook followers and nearly 13 million on Twitter, Mr. Huck is in a league of his own in Brazilian politics.</p><p>A Huck candidacy would be the Brazilian equivalent of Oprah Winfrey (FB 11.6m, TW 41.4m) running for president in 2020. He is not a populist; he\u2019s just popular. In second place, however, comes Jair Bolsonaro (FB 5m, TW 0.8m), the former army parachutist whose political positions make Mr. Trump seem like a lily-livered liberal. Mr. Bolsonaro is an unabashed defender of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil between 1964 and 1985. Name any politically incorrect position; Mr. Bolsonaro has taken it. \u201cI would never rape you,\u201d he once told a female politician, \u201cbecause you do not deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Italian politics was in many ways the experimental laboratory for the kind of candidate who combines wealth and celebrity with political incorrectness. Silvio Berlusconi has claimed, not without justification, to have been the prototype Trump. Despite a criminal conviction, Mr. Berlusconi is still a political player, though more of a kingmaker than a candidate these days. Yet he is behind the times (FB 1m, TW 19,300). The King of Twitter in Italy is former prime minister Matteo Renzi (FB 1.1m, TW 3.34m), although on Facebook he trails the populists: the two Five Star Movement leaders, Beppe Grillo (FB 1.9m, TW 2.5m) and Luigi di Maio (FB 1.1m, TW 0.3m), as well as the Northern League leader Matteo Salvini (FB 1.9m, TW 0.6m).</p><p>In Mexico, the best-known populist \u2013 Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, universally known by his initials as \u201cAMLO\u201d \u2013 is a man of the left. On social media (FB 2.3m, TW 3.5m), AMLO is far ahead of the likely PRI nominee Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade (FB 0.3m, TW 1m) and his PAN (National Action Party) counterpart Ricardo Anaya Cortes (FB 0.9, TW 0.4). True, AMLO is not the most followed Mexican politician: Rafael Moreno Valle, the former governor of Puebla, is now neck and neck with him on Facebook. Only just behind AMLO on Twitter is the mayor of Mexico City, Miguel Angel Mancera. But neither Moreno Valle nor Mancera is going to be a presidential candidate.</p><p>Politics on Colombian social media also leans left. There, the leading figure is Gustavo Petro (FB 0.9m, TW 2.8m), the former mayor of Bogot\u00e1, who as a young man belonged to the guerrilla group the 19th of April Movement and who made his political reputation as an opponent of the conservative presidency of \u00c1lvaro Uribe.</p><p>The inescapable threat</p><p>It used to be that all politics was local. Today, perhaps, all politics is becoming social, in that social media have emerged as the crucial battleground of modern elections. Just a few years ago, that would have seemed like a good idea. What could be more democratic, after all, than enabling politicians to communicate their messages directly to individual voters, and to hear back from them in real time? The only thing to worry about was whether or not online speech was truly free \u2013 the core preoccupation of Freedom House\u2019s annual \u201cFreedom on the Net\u201d survey.</p><p>But what if the biggest threat to democracy is not online censorship or surveillance, but the near-total absence of regulation of politics on social media? The public is beginning to sense this. A new Gallup-Knight survey, published last week, revealed that 57 per cent of Americans think that the way sites choose which stories to show to users presents \u201ca major problem\u201d for democracy. Just less than half of those interviewed favoured regulation of how the network platforms provide news.</p><p>The difficulty is knowing what form regulation should take. As Sam Lessin \u2013 another former Facebooker \u2013 has argued, the real transformation of the public sphere is that a candidate \u201ccan for the first time effectively talk to each individual voter privately in their own home and tell them exactly what they want to hear \u2026 in a way that can\u2019t be tracked or audited.\u201d</p><p>Forget fake news, Mr. Lessin argues. Forget the \u201cfeed bubbles\u201d and \u201cecho chambers\u201d that have dominated the discussion in the United States. The real challenge is not that the public sphere has grown polarized. The challenge is that it has been so fragmented by misnamed social media that it is no longer a single public sphere.</p><p>\u201cIt has been a foregone conclusion for a long time,\u201d Mr. Lessin concludes, doubtless remembering the inspirational <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>speeches of the pre-2016 era, \u201cthat the internet has been a vehicle for moving us toward speaking one common language and being able to work together to solve the great problems of our era. \u2026 The sad reality is that the most exciting attempt to bring our world together is putting us at risk of not being able to trust what we see or hear\u201d \u2013 but (and this is the point he missed) voting for the most engaging candidate anyway.</p><p>Hit \u201cesc\u201d all you like. This is the real \u2013 and inescapable \u2013 threat facing every democracy today.</p><p>This excerpt from Niall Ferguson\u2019s new book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Square and the Tower: Networks and Power From the Freemasons to Facebook</emphasis> (Penguin Press), was originally published in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Globe and Mail</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-1989461965</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKD-HC71-JBHT-D2G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 21, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Not only has the US government and its various agencies have been much less vigorous in scrutinising tech giants' power, but at times have actively fought Brussels.</p><p>The two major US tech antitrust probes of the last two decades, in comparison, have achieved little. Microsoft's battle against the American government was dramatic, but ultimately resulted in limited sanctions. An investigation into Google's search dominance that ended six years ago had even fewer consequences.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/15/google-faces-another-fine-eu-next-week/\">World's largest companies</url></p><p>Proponents of more action against big tech often say that American regulators are ill-equipped to take on the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon because while European law looks at whether a market is competitive, US antitrust law is more concerned with with higher prices paid by consumers. Since Google and Facebook are free to the consumer, and Amazon's prices are typically lower than the competition, they are supposedly shielded.</p><p>This is only partially true. American law deals with \"consumer welfare\", a concept that often materialises in higher prices, but is not restricted to it. A lack of choice, or a market starved of innovation, can qualify.</p><p>Consumers actually enjoyed lower prices during Standard Oil's monopolistic peak, partly due to economies of scale, but this did not save it from being broken up into 34 pieces. Anti-competitive behaviour, not high prices, is what did John Rockefeller's company in.</p><p>Not only do US regulators have the power to take on Silicon Valley, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/15/google-faces-another-fine-eu-next-week/\">they appear increasingly willing to do so</url> .</p><p>Joe Simons, who was appointed head of the Federal Trade Commission last year, is a former antitrust lawyer who has wasted little time demanding more powers from the government, and establishing teams to focus on tech in particular. He has suggested regulators should be smarter in monitoring the tactics that companies often use to remain in charge of a market, such as buying small competitors who may one day pose a threat. Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and Google's of advertising service DoubleClick are two such examples.</p><p>The Department of Justice, America's other competition regulator, has also indicated it is increasingly worried about the market power of tech giants. Mayan Delrahim, the head of the department's antitrust division, sent a chill through Silicon Valley with a speech at a recent conference that sounded like a laundry list of concerns.</p><p>Amazon and Google were called out in name, and Facebook in everything but. Their control of search engines, operating systems, social media and ebook sales were all listed as areas of interest.</p><p>Delrahim espoused a surprisingly broad range of potential downsides of tech monopolies, including declining innovation, lower privacy protections and even restrictions on free speech, and said competition law's job was to protect all of them.</p><p>The last matter in particular has the attention of the US president, who has insisted that Google, Facebook and others are politically biased against him and shutting down conservative voices. Donald Trump's\u00a0cause has been taken up by several US senators and congressmen, who have hauled high-ranking tech executives in front of their committees in a way that politicians in the UK and elsewhere have not been able to. This month, Congress's antitrust committee announced an investigation into tech monopolies, sending shares in Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google falling.</p><p>Such investigations are often about theatre as much as policy, but they will put further pressure on competition regulators to do something.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/15/google-faces-another-fine-eu-next-week/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>It is still unclear that these developments will necessarily translate into action. Unlike in Europe, where Brussels can levy unilateral penalties, US competition authorities must seek settlements or take their grievances to court. The Department of Justice knows this only too well, having recently been thwarted in its attempts to block AT&amp;T's $85bn merger with Time Warner.</p><p>Concerns about China are also coming at a convenient time for much of Silicon Valley. Companies have quietly begun to appeal to nationalistic tendencies, saying if their dominance is crimped, Chinese giants will step into the void. As Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg recently pointed out, Beijing is in no rush to break up Tencent, Alibaba or Baidu.</p><p>But the internet titans are clearly shaken by a sudden American willingness to investigate. The growing numbers of former antitrust officials and lobbyists on their payrolls should be evidence enough of that.</p><p>American competition chiefs may not go after big tech as enthusiastically as their European counterparts, but Silicon Valley and Washington are certainly no longer on the same team.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-53913747</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDH-KY91-F021-646V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"947\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Washington, in turn, has responded with aggression. The House Judiciary Committee has announced a \"top-to-bottom\" antitrust investigation of Big Tech firms including Facebook, Apple, Google, and Amazon-making a crackdown on America's technological innovators one of the few points of bipartisan consensus. But this couldn't have come at a worse time.</p><p><br/>Weakening Free Internet<br/>As China seeks to advance an autocratic and censored view of the internet throughout the globe, America's vision for an open internet is under attack. The global expansion of China's rapidly-growing tech industry, which complies with principles laid out by the Communist Party, may continue to close markets for American firms abroad, as it has in China. This presents a threat not only to the global dominance of American tech but also to the free internet itself. For online freedom to survive, Washington and Silicon Valley need to work together.<br/>Both Washington and Silicon Valley are to blame for the current discord and weakened global presence of a free internet. In hearing after hearing, Congress has displayed technical illiteracy, which only justifies tech leaders' wariness of the government's ability to regulate. Policymakers must move away from hampering the tech industry. The blunt instrument of antitrust will not resolve online issues.At the same time, Silicon Valley's libertarian approach-a combination of unbridled techno-optimism and aversion to the federal government-has made them few friends in Washington.<br/>This tension between government and tech has created an opportunity for China to spread its vision of a censored, state-controlled internet to autocratic leaders in its sphere of influence.<br/>That's why policymakers must move away from hampering the tech industry. The blunt instrument of antitrust will not resolve online issues by simply reducing the size of tech firms and will instead make them less productive and give them fewer resources to innovate. Instead of focusing on the size of individual firms, attention should be given the data-driven business models the digital economy has made profitable.<br/>Digital Citizens in a Digital World<br/>One response to these ad-funded, data-driven models is to treat online users as digital citizens who create value through their online activity. This would mean viewing the act of creating data as a form of labor as opposed to simply something tech companies receive.

Washington, in turn, has responded with aggression. The House Judiciary Committee has announced a 'top-to-bottom' antitrust investigation[4] of Big Tech firms including Facebook, Apple, Google, and Amazon\u2014making a crackdown on America's technological innovators one of the few points of bipartisan consensus. But this couldn't have come at a worse time.Weakening Free InternetAs China seeks to advance[5] an autocratic and censored view of the internet throughout the globe, America's vision for an open internet is under attack. </p><p>The global expansion of China's rapidly-growing tech industry, which complies with principles laid out by the Communist Party, may continue to close markets for American firms abroad, as it has in China. This presents a threat not only to the global dominance of American tech but also to the free internet itself. For online freedom to survive, Washington and Silicon Valley need to work together. Both Washington and Silicon Valley are to blame for the current discord and weakened global presence of a free internet. In hearing after hearing, Congress has displayed technical illiteracy, which only justifies tech leaders' wariness of the government's ability to regulate. Policymakers must move away from hampering the tech industry. The blunt instrument of antitrust will not resolve online issues.At the same time, Silicon Valley's libertarian approach\u2014a combination of unbridled techno-optimism and aversion to the federal government\u2014has made them few friends in Washington. This tension between government and tech has created an opportunity for China to spread its vision of a censored, state-controlled internet to autocratic leaders in its sphere of influence. That's why policymakers must move away from hampering the tech industry. The blunt instrument of antitrust will not resolve online issues by simply reducing the size of tech firms and will instead make them less productive and give them fewer resources to innovate. Instead of focusing on the size of individual firms, attention should be given the data-driven business models the digital economy has made profitable.Digital Citizens in a Digital WorldOne response to these ad-funded, data-driven models is to treat online users as digital citizens who create value through their online activity. This would mean viewing the act of creating data as a form of labor[6] as opposed to simply something tech companies receive. Shifting to this philosophy would grant users greater rights over their data and a claim to its economic value. Indeed, adding a personal economic dimension to our digital lives would give us more control[7] over how companies use our data. By changing the dynamics of how Big Tech firms profit and relate to users, we can create a more inclusive model of the digital economy. Google seems to believe it can help increase internet freedom instead of legitimizing the Chinese Communist Party's repressive approach. Crafting a healthy digital world would also make tech companies less prone to political attacks and allow them to promote an American vision of the internet globally. After all, a digital ecosystem that is less divisive is easier to sell against authoritarian alternatives. But this is an ambitious cultural vision and requires less reactionary regulations and more understanding[8] among policymakers. We would also need more robust investigations into how the digital economy operates and more collaboration with the tech industry. As they reckon with these issues, large tech firms have started to move away from their laissez-faire philosophy. We can see this in Google's repeated attempts[9] to re-enter China, in which they've offered to comply with censorship practices that go against their mission to increase access to information. Somehow, Google seems to believe it can help increase internet freedom instead of what it's more likely to do: legitimize the Chinese Communist Party's repressive approach.The Scope of Restrictions MatterThe tech industry also needs to appreciate the unique insights of Washington\u2014its long-term viability depends on it. Big Tech firms criticize the moves toward state-controlled internet in Thailand[10] and Vietnam[11], but they can't seem to stop making things worse for themselves. As long as they keep it up, authoritarians can continue to justify change for the worse. Instead of fundamentally changing, tech firms are compromising their values. In an effort to make concessions, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently[12] advocated for the same kind of narrow and costly regulations that Silicon Valley once fought against. Silicon Valley and Washington need to realize they're on the same team.Prioritizing the short-term economic interests of large firms like Facebook, which can afford to comply with regulations\u2014rather than focusing on expanding opportunity online\u2014is a step in the wrong direction. As long as this narrow approach is taken, the changes needed to fix the digital economy won't happen. Instead, we'll find that growing and oppressive visions of the internet from China and elsewhere will continue to spread around the globe. Silicon Valley and Washington need to realize they're on the same team.

In the week that Margrethe Vestager, the EU's top competition cop, launched a market abuse investigation into Apple, David Cicilline, the congressman leading a Big Tech probe in America, accused his country's biggest company of \"highway robbery\" over the 30% cut it takes from the cash generated by its App Store.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even Microsoft president Brad Smith, who spent a quarter of a century in an anti-trust fight with Washington, said the \"time has come\" for the authorities to look into just how Apple does business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The sudden turn against the iPhone maker, which has avoided the slings and arrows aimed at Facebook, Google and Amazon, was remarkable. For Big Tech's critics, it is the surest sign yet that the years of hand-wringing are over. The West Coast giants, they claim, are about to be walloped by a regulatory crackdown not seen in decades.</p><p>The showdown will even come with a photo op. Some time in the next few weeks, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos at Amazon and Sundar Pichai of Google parent Alphabet will, for the first time, testify together in Congress. Apple's Tim Cook is the only one who has not confirmed his appearance, although Cicilline expects him to show up for a line-up that will be redolent of the appearances of Big Tobacco executives in the 1990s, or Wall Street chief executives after the financial crisis.</p><p>\"I expect that we'll have all four CEOs there,\" Cicilline told The Vergecast podcast. \"This is the Congress of the United States conducting its first major anti-trust investigation in 50 years and their testimony is essential to completing this properly.\"</p><p>Will it be different this time? Will the long-promised regulatory overhaul finally get over the line? And, if so, how far will it go? Will the titans be broken up, or forced to change their ways under threat of huge financial penalties? For clues, look no further than Lina Khan, a 31-year-old lawyer who helped set in motion the reckoning three years ago. While a law student, Khan wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal titled Amazon's Anti-trust Paradox. She argued that the legal conventions that had held since the 1970s had been lapped by the Big Tech platforms.</p><p>The article stoked a debate that still rages. For decades the guiding anti-trust principle in America has been narrow and simple: consumer welfare. If you were not using your power to overcharge customers, you were fine.</p><p>Khan argued that Amazon was different: its empire is so vast, the data on its customers so granular, that it can wield its power in an array of ways to suffocate competitors, reduce choice and hurt consumers. She wrote: \"The current framework in anti-trust - specifically its pegging competition to 'consumer welfare', defined as shortterm price effects - is unequipped to capture the architecture of market power in the modern economy.\" To wit, a recent Wall Street Journal investigation found that the $1.3 trillion (\u00a31 trillion) giant mined data from third-party sellers to create rival products, contradicting its own stated policies.</p><p>Republican senator Orrin Hatch dismissed Khan's ideas as \"hipster antitrust\". The hipster, however, has made it inside the building. Since last year, Khan has been a staff lawyer for Cicilline's House anti-trust subcommittee, helping shape the questions his bipartisan group will ask and the recommendations it will publish to rein in the top platforms.</p><p>Her rise is something of a victory for Barry Lynn, who hired Khan in 2011 as a junior researcher at the New America think tank, where he ran the anti-trust policy unit. Back then, \"I was kind of alone\", Lynn said.</p><p>He had been arguing for a decade that anti-trust policy needed to go back to its roots, when the government broke up the railroads and telecoms monopolies. The problem, he said, was a \"revolution in thinking\" that took hold in 1978. That was when Robert Bork, a libertarian legal scholar, wrote The Anti-trust Paradox. The book elevated consumer welfare as the guiding principle, and sidelined protection of competition.</p><p>The revolution was subtle, done not through the creation of a new body or dissolution of another, but by a shift in interpretation. It was embraced by politicians and the courts, setting the stage for the mega-mergers of the 1980s and a gradual consolidation of power across industries, including the internet.</p><p>Lynn, who now runs the Open Markets Institute, argued that another shift was in order. \"We don't need new laws, we don't need new institutions,\" he said. What was required was a new lens through which to view -and regulate - the digital giants.</p><p>Khan did not respond to request for comment, but it appears that her ideas have helped guide the House subcommittee's thinking. A source said Ciciline's group was looking at how best to transform predatory pricing and other potential abuses back into grounds for action against companies, including potentially breaking them up.</p><p>The source added: \"We have been through a 40-year lobotomy where our antitrust laws were gutted and the core philosophy often promotes monopoly rather than targeting it. The committee wants to recover the traditional tool box that we've had for addressing problems of dominance and private concentrations of economic power.\"</p><p>Last Monday, David Heinemeier Hansson launched a $99-a-year email service, called Hey. When his company, Basecamp, attempted to put an update through the App Store to fix a small bug, Apple said no. Unless Hey required users to sign up for the paid service though the App Store, rather than Hey's website, it could not update the app.</p><p>For Apple, it was no small matter. The company requires all apps to hand over 30% of any revenue: the cost of admission into one of the world's biggest storefronts. Heinemeier Hansson branded Apple a \"mafioso\". Cicilline called the 30% cut \"unconscionable\".</p><p>Tech commentator Ben Thompson said he had heard dozens of similar stories: Apple using the app approval process to ensure it gets its money. \"This is not an accident, but a co-ordinated campaign to drive more App Store revenue,\" he wrote in his Stratechery newsletter. \"The number of ways that Apple can retaliate are so varied and hard to verify that no one is willing to publicly breathe a word against the company.\"</p><p>Apple is not alone. Amazon also levies hefty fees on third parties that sell via its site. This is the core around which the crackdown appears to be crystallising. Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook are very different businesses, but they all act as \"gatekeepers\", controlling the exchange of goods and adverts and ideas online.

In the week that Margrethe Vestager, the EU's top competition cop, launched a market abuse investigation into Apple, David Cicilline, the congressman leading a Big Tech probe in America, accused his country's biggest company of \"highway robbery\" over the 30% cut it takes from the cash generated by its App Store.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even Microsoft president Brad Smith, who spent a quarter of a century in an anti-trust fight with Washington, said the \"time has come\" for the authorities to look into just how Apple does business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The sudden turn against the iPhone maker, which has avoided the slings and arrows aimed at Facebook, Google and Amazon, was remarkable. For Big Tech's critics, it is the surest sign yet that the years of hand-wringing are over. The West Coast giants, they claim, are about to be walloped by a regulatory crackdown not seen in decades.</p><p>The showdown will even come with a photo op. Some time in the next few weeks, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos at Amazon and Sundar Pichai of Google parent Alphabet will, for the first time, testify together in Congress. Apple's Tim Cook is the only one who has not confirmed his appearance, although Cicilline expects him to show up for a line-up that will be redolent of the appearances of Big Tobacco executives in the 1990s, or Wall Street chief executives after the financial crisis. \"I expect we'll have all four CEOs there,\" Cicilline told The Vergecast podcast. \"This is the Congress of the United States conducting its first major anti-trust investigation in 50 years and their testimony is essential to completing this properly.\"</p><p>Will it be different this time? Will the long-promised regulatory overhaul finally get over the line? And, if so, how far will it go? Will the titans be broken up, or forced to change their ways under threat of huge financial penalties? For clues, look no further than Lina Khan, a 31-year-old lawyer who helped set in motion the reckoning three years ago. While a law student, Khan wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal titled Amazon's Anti-trust Paradox. She argued that the legal conventions that had held since the 1970s had been lapped by the Big Tech platforms.</p><p>The article stoked a debate that still rages. For decades the guiding anti-trust principle in America has been narrow and simple: consumer welfare. If you were not using your power to overcharge customers, you were fine.</p><p>Khan argued that Amazon was different: its empire is so vast, the data on its customers so granular, that it can wield its power in an array of ways to suffocate competitors, reduce choice and hurt consumers. She wrote: \"The current framework in anti-trust - specifically its pegging competition to 'consumer welfare', defined as short-term price effects - is unequipped to capture the architecture of market power in the modern economy.\"</p><p>To wit, a recent Wall Street Journal investigation found that the $1.3 trillion (\u00a31 trillion) giant mined data from thirdparty sellers to create rival products, contradicting its own stated policies.</p><p>Republican senator Orrin Hatch dismissed Khan's ideas as \"hipster antitrust\". The hipster, however, has made it inside the building. Since last year, Khan has been a staff lawyer for Cicilline's House anti-trust subcommittee, helping shape the questions his bipartisan group will ask and the recommendations it will publish to rein in the top platforms.</p><p>Her rise is something of a victory for Barry Lynn, who hired Khan in 2011 as a junior researcher at the New America think tank, where he ran the anti-trust policy unit. Back then, \"I was kind of alone\", Lynn said.</p><p>He had been arguing for a decade that anti-trust policy needed to go back to its roots, when the government broke up the railroads and telecoms monopolies. The problem, he said, was a \"revolution in thinking\" that took hold in 1978. That was when Robert Bork, a libertarian legal scholar, wrote The Anti-trust Paradox. The book elevated consumer welfare as the guiding principle, and sidelined protection of competition.</p><p>The revolution was subtle, done not through the creation of a new body or dissolution of another, but by a shift in interpretation. It was embraced by politicians and the courts, setting the stage for the mega-mergers of the 1980s and a gradual consolidation of power across industries, including the internet.</p><p>Lynn, who now runs the Open Markets Institute, argued that another shift was in order. \"We don't need new laws, we don't need new institutions,\" he said. What was required was a new lens through which to view -and regulate - the digital giants. Khan did not respond to a request for comment, but it appears that her ideas have helped guide the House subcommittee's thinking. A source said Cicilline's group was looking at how best to transform predatory pricing and other potential abuses back into grounds for action against companies, including potentially breaking them up.</p><p>The source added: \"We have been through a 40-year lobotomy where our anti-trust laws were gutted and the core philosophy often promotes monopoly rather than targeting it. The committee wants to recover the traditional tool box that we've had for addressing problems of dominance and private concentrations of economic power.\"</p><p>Last Monday, David Heinemeier Hansson launched a $99-a-year email service, called Hey. When his company, Basecamp, attempted to put an update through the App Store to fix a small bug, Apple said no. Unless Hey required users to sign up for the paid service though the App Store - rather than Hey's website - it could not update the app. For Apple, it was no small matter. The company requires all apps to hand over 30% of any revenue: the cost of admission into one of the world's biggest storefronts. Heinemeier Hansson branded Apple a \"mafioso\". Cicilline called the 30% cut \"unconscionable\".</p><p>Tech commentator Ben Thompson said he had heard dozens of similar stories: Apple using the app approval proc-ess to ensure it gets its money. \"This is not an accident, but a co-ordinated campaign to drive more App Store revenue,\" he wrote in his Stratechery newsletter.</p><p>\"The number of ways that Apple can retaliate are so varied and hard to verify that no one is willing to publicly breathe a word against the company.\"</p><p>Apple is not alone in this. Amazon also levies hefty fees on third parties that sell via its site. This is the core around which the crackdown appears to be crystallising.

In the week that Margrethe Vestager, the EU's top competition cop, launched a market abuse investigation into Apple, David Cicilline, the congressman leading a Big Tech probe in America, accused his country's biggest company of \"highway robbery\" over the 30% cut it takes from the cash generated by its App Store.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even Microsoft president Brad Smith, who spent a quarter of a century in an anti-trust fight with Washington, said the \"time has come\" for the authorities to look into just how Apple does business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The sudden turn against the iPhone maker, which has avoided the slings and arrows aimed at Facebook, Google and Amazon, was remarkable. For Big Tech's critics, it is the surest sign yet that the years of hand-wringing are over. The West Coast giants, they claim, are about to be walloped by a regulatory crackdown not seen in decades.</p><p>The showdown will even come with a photo op. Some time in the next few weeks, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos at Amazon and Sundar Pichai of Google parent Alphabet will, for the first time, testify together in Congress. Apple's Tim Cook is the only one who has not confirmed his appearance, although Cicilline expects him to show up for a line-up that will be redolent of the appearances of Big Tobacco executives in the 1990s, or Wall Street chief executives after the financial crisis. \"I expect we'll have all four CEOs there,\" Cicilline told The Vergecast podcast. \"This is the Congress of the United States conducting its first major anti-trust investigation in 50 years and their testimony is essential to completing this properly.\"</p><p>Will it be different this time? Will the long-promised regulatory overhaul finally get over the line? And, if so, how far will it go? Will the titans be broken up, or forced to change their ways under threat of huge financial penalties?</p><p>For clues, look no further than Lina Khan, a 31-year-old lawyer who helped set in motion the reckoning three years ago. While a law student, Khan wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal titled Amazon's Anti-trust Paradox. She argued that the legal conventions that had held since the 1970s had been lapped by the Big Tech platforms.</p><p>The article stoked a debate that still rages. For decades the guiding anti-trust principle in America has been narrow and simple: consumer welfare. If you were not using your power to overcharge customers, you were fine.</p><p>Khan argued that Amazon was different: its empire is so vast, the data on its customers so granular, that it can wield its power in an array of ways to suffocate competitors, reduce choice and hurt consumers. She wrote: \"The current framework in anti-trust - specifically its pegging competition to 'consumer welfare', defined as short-term price effects - is unequipped to capture the architecture of market power in the modern economy.\"</p><p>To wit, a recent Wall Street Journal investigation found that the $1.3 trillion (\u00a31 trillion) giant mined data from third-party sellers to create rival products, contradicting its own stated policies.</p><p>Republican senator Orrin Hatch dismissed Khan's ideas as \"hipster anti-trust\". The hipster, however, has made it inside the building. Since last year, Khan has been a staff lawyer for Cicilline's House anti-trust subcommittee, helping shape the questions his bipartisan group will ask and the recommendations it will publish to rein in the top platforms.</p><p>Her rise is something of a victory for Barry Lynn, who hired Khan in 2011 as a junior researcher at the New America think tank, where he ran the anti-trust policy unit. Back then, \"I was kind of alone\", Lynn said.</p><p>He had been arguing for a decade that anti-trust policy needed to go back to its roots, when the government broke up the railroads and telecoms monopolies. The problem, he said, was a \"revolution in thinking\" that took hold in 1978. That was when Robert Bork, a libertarian legal scholar, wrote</p><p>                    The Anti-trust Paradox</p><p>. The book elevated consumer welfare as the guiding principle, and sidelined protection of competition.</p><p>The revolution was subtle, done not through the creation of a new body or dissolution of another, but by a shift in interpretation. It was embraced by politicians and the courts, setting the stage for the mega-mergers of the 1980s and a gradual consolidation of power across industries, including the internet.</p><p>Lynn, who now runs the Open Markets Institute, argued that another shift was in order. \"We don't need new laws, we don't need new institutions,\" he said. What was required was a new lens through which to view -and regulate - the digital giants. Khan did not respond to a request for comment, but it appears that her ideas have helped guide the House subcommittee's thinking. A source said Cicilline's group was looking at how best to transform predatory pricing and other potential abuses back into grounds for action against companies, including potentially breaking them up.</p><p>The source added: \"We have been through a 40-year lobotomy where our anti-trust laws were gutted and the core philosophy often promotes monopoly rather than targeting it. The committee wants to recover the traditional tool box that we've had for addressing problems of dominance and private concentrations of economic power.\"</p><p>Last Monday, David Heinemeier Hansson launched a $99-a-year email service, called Hey. When his company, Basecamp, attempted to put an update through the App Store to fix a small bug, Apple said no. Unless Hey required users to sign up for the paid service though the App Store - rather than Hey's website - it could not update the app. For Apple, it was no small matter. The company requires all apps to hand over 30% of any revenue: the cost of admission into one of the world's biggest storefronts. Heinemeier Hansson branded Apple a \"mafioso\". Cicilline called the 30% cut \"unconscionable\".</p><p>Tech commentator Ben Thompson said he had heard dozens of similar stories: Apple using the app approval process to ensure it gets its money. \"This is not an accident, but a co-ordinated campaign to drive more App Store revenue,\" he wrote in his Stratechery newsletter.</p><p>\"The number of ways that Apple can retaliate are so varied and hard to verify that no one is willing to publicly breathe a word against the company.\"</p><p>Apple is not alone in this. Amazon also levies hefty fees on third parties that sell via its site. This is the core around which the crackdown appears to be crystallising. Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook are very different businesses, but they all act as \"gatekeepers\", controlling the exchange of goods and adverts and ideas online.</p><p>Lynn said: \"They are the master middlemen of our time.\" He is betting, however, that their time is almost up.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-63796087</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605X-7JP1-F021-6059-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1123\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 21, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Quick Fix    \u2014  Blockbuster hearing back on the calendar:  Wednesday is slated to be the crown jewel of the tech world\u2019s week, marking the first joint, congressional appearance by the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.   \u2014  Social media EO deadline:  Today\u2019s the due date for the Commerce Department, through NTIA and in consultation with the Justice Department, to file a petition for rulemaking with the FCC on President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order targeting Section 230.   \u2014  GIFCT gathers virtually:  The tech industry\u2019s biggest joint counterterror initiative convened its first stakeholder meeting under new leadership and plans to ramp up its work \u2014 and workforce \u2014 in the coming months.

Tech of the Town    HISTORIC TECH CEO HEARING BACK ON THE BOOKS \u2014 The long-awaited House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing with four Silicon Valley CEOs has been rescheduled for Wednesday at noon . Grab the popcorn.   \u2014 Logistics: Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai are expected to testify virtually on a single panel, while lawmakers will attend both virtually and in-person as part of a \u201chybrid\u201d format, senior Judiciary Committee aides told reporters last week. That means that the committee has declined requests by big tech critics to split up CEO testimony with separate, individual panels and from Republicans to hold it at the full committee level .   \u2014 Distinct companies, but similar patterns: While the companies testifying all have unique business structures and complainants have raised distinct issues with each, the hearing will give lawmakers a chance to dig into what those concerns have in common. \u201cThe hearing will be an opportunity to surface some of those similarities, some of those similar fact-patterns,\u201d one of the aides said. (The aides spoke anonymously as a condition of the briefing.) Read more details on what to expect.   \u2014 A marathon, not a sprint: As if this hearing wasn\u2019t enough action for one afternoon, Facebook later that day is set to report its second quarter earnings for 2020; Google, Apple and Amazon release earnings on Thursday.   TECH QUOTE DU JOUR: MUSK ON ZUCK \u2014 Elon Musk is \u201cnot super-confident\u201d about Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s ability to address concerns around how Facebook is affecting democracy, the billionaire Tesla CEO (who has sparred with Zuck before over AI\u2019s impact on our future), told NYT\u2019s Maureen Dowd . \u201cI\u2019m, like, not pro-Facebook. I don\u2019t have a Facebook page. SpaceX and Tesla deleted their Facebook pages. \u2026 I think Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg still have a lot of work to do to restore public trust in Facebook itself.\u201d   \u2014 And when asked whether he believes Zuck is a sociopath: \u201cMark Zuckerberg has some issues, we all have some issues,\u201d Musk said. \u201cMy concern with Facebook is that he just has absolute control over Facebook with the way the voting shares are structured. And it\u2019s also structured such that the Zuckerberg dynasty will have control over Facebook and his great-grandkids will control the thing.\u201d   EYEBALLS WATCHING EMOJI: TRUMP\u2019S SOCIAL MEDIA EO, 60 DAYS LATER \u2014 Today marks 60 days since Trump unveiled his social media executive order targeting the tech industry\u2019s prized legal liability shield, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The order directed the Commerce Department, through NTIA and in consultation with the Justice Department, to file a petition for rulemaking with the FCC \u2014 by today \u2014 asking the agency to review when websites qualify for Section 230\u2019s legal protections and to \u201cexpeditiously propose regulations to clarify\u201d those cases as well as how to determine when tech platforms have not acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d when restricting access to content. We\u2019ll be watching to see how Washington meets that deadline.   \u2014 But wait, there\u2019s more: The Senate Commerce subcommittee on communications and technology is holding a hearing Tuesday on Section 230 and a recent proposal to change it. More on that from Cristiano.    TECH VS. TERRORISM \u2014 The tech industry\u2019s biggest counterterror group late last week convened its first annual stakeholder forum under the organization's new leadership . The virtual gathering of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism came in the wake of worldwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality that saw extremism on social media (from Facebook to Telegram ) boil over into real-life violence. \u201cWe know that terrorist activity and violent extremist engagement in the online environment have been steadily increasing as these groups grow bolder and more sophisticated with their attempts to abuse digital platforms,\u201d GIFCT Executive Director Nicholas Rasmussen said Friday.   \u2014 Context: The organization has seen its fair share of congressional criticism for moving at a sluggish pace since its creation three years ago this month. The recent meeting \u2014 which included participants across government, academia, industry and civil society groups from some 30 countries \u2014 \u201cis a critical step in bringing together the right people across society needed to make real progress towards preventing the exploitation of the internet by terrorists and violent extremists,\u201d said Courtney Gregoire, Microsoft chief digital safety officer and GIFCT chair.   \u2014 New faces: Rasmussen at the forum announced peace activist Bj\u00f8rn Ihler, a survivor of the deadly 2011 terrorist attack in Norway , as inaugural chair of the group\u2019s Independent Advisory Committee, which is tasked with setting the group's goals and tracking its performance. Rasmussen also highlighted six working groups focused on research; content-sharing algorithms, crisis response; legal frameworks; technical approaches; and transparency. Each working group is led by a representative from GIFCT founding members Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube. (Amazon, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Dropbox are also members.)   \u2014 What\u2019s next?: GIFCT did not immediately respond to a request about who is in each working group and when they will convene, but the initiative plans to continue growing in the coming months.     Transitions    Silicon Valley has gotten a new chief innovation officer right in the middle of the pandemic, John reports : Jordan Sun . \u2026 Gus Coldebella , former chief legal officer of Circle, has joined the crypto investment firm Paradigm as general counsel. \u2026 Gallup and the Knight Foundation today launched the media platform NewsLens , a public news aggregator highlighting media issues from across the political spectrum.   In memoriam: The State Educational Technology Directors Association celebrates the life and educational work of executive director Candice Dodson .          Silicon Valley Must Reads    Who\u2019s pulling the levers? Tech companies like Google, Amazon and Qualcomm are bankrolling the Global Antitrust Institute, a part of George Mason University\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School that has pushed for \u201ca hands-off approach to antitrust law,\u201d NYT reports .   Let\u2019s see it: \u201cArizona Republican Rep. Andy Biggs told a Maricopa County Judge overseeing a case related to Google that any trade secret or proprietary information about the tech giant should be made available to the public,\u201d The Washington Examiner reports .   Perspectives on Facebook: The Guardian ran pieces from Ya\u00ebl Eisenstat , former Facebook elections integrity head; Carole Cadwalladr , the investigative journalist who helped expose the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal; and Roger McNamee , an early Facebook adviser turned critic, about their range of concerns around the platform.     Quick Downloads    ICYMI: \u201cA pointed warning Friday about election interference inspired an extended back-and-forth Friday between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats, who argued it wrongly places China and Iran in the same league as the threat posed by Russia,\u201d POLITICO reports .

Another \u00a34bn or so was added to the Bezos wallet.</p><p>Yet the rise in value of the tech giants was all the more astonishing because it came just hours after their chief executives were grilled on Capitol Hill about their alleged abuse of monopoly power and global dominance.</p><p>Perhaps just as well that the results did not come out until a day after the hearing, on what was dubbed 'Super Thursday' so the congressmen were not armed with fresh proof of just how powerful and profitable they are. And the fact all four reported on the same day meant none could be singled out. Strength in unity, as the saying goes.</p><p>As it was, Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg squirmed and struggled to defend themselves during what was a combative hearing in which they did not for once have all the slick answers.</p><p>Zuckerberg admitted to 'neutralising' rivals, and has already described his purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram as a 'digital land grab'.</p><p>Even Bezos sweated when asked about a bookseller being taken out by his Amazonian beast.</p><p>What a land grab it is. The four horsemen control nearly all that we do on the internet: selling apps, sending messages, pestering us with ads, stealing news, answering people's questions and buying just about everything one wants.</p><p>This is extraordinary power. Fortunately, the US politicians are serious about discovering how this power works, how it is wielded and if necessary cracking down on their reach. The sub-committee of the House Judiciary Committee has been investigating their dominance over the internet for a year now, and came well prepared with ammunition to show how the tech titans have been responsible for bullying and destroying small businesses.</p><p>That's on top of charges that big tech controls how we are surveilled and our data manipulated, that Facebook spreads misinformation and censors, while Amazon handles laundered goods.</p><p>BUT what should the policymakers do? Should the big tech behemoths be broken up in the same way Theodore Roosevelt took the axe to Standard Oil and the telephone companies in the 1920s? Or can their power be reined in by higher taxes and stiffer regulation? It's a daunting dilemma. On the one hand, there is a strong argument that the West should support rather than demonise these great success stories, because the real threat is China. Nearly half of the world's biggest online firms - including Alibaba and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.JD.com\">www.JD.com</url> - are Chinese, and they are growing fast.</p><p>There is another point. Would breaking them up benefit the customer? As most of us could testify, going through lockdown without Facetime on our mobile phones and Amazon to shop online may have been tougher still.</p><p>But not impossible. As we also saw during lockdown, small business owners snapped into action and came up with the most enterprising solutions. Now what we need is a fairer environment in which smaller social media outlets or online retailers can compete before being crushed by the big guns. How can a more level playing field be achieved? Well, US politicians should look to the Australian government for inspiration. It has announced plans to force Google and Facebook to pay news outlets for content in an attempt to prevent the country's media from being ravaged.</p><p>If they don't pay, the Australian regulators will fine them hundreds of millions of dollars. Facebook and Google have already threatened to walk away rather than pay for news. Good. Let them walk.</p><p>Unusually, there is cross-party support for change. Both the Republicans and Democrats want to see big tech reformed, to varying degrees and for different reasons. But don't hold your breath, certainly not until after the November US elections. Which is why the share prices of the big tech corporations largely stormed ahead after their results. Investors take the view that the regulators will not be cracking down any time soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMAIL-162021717</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMAIL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GN-WR91-DYTY-C0J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

Another \u00a34bn or so was added to the Bezos wallet.</p><p>Yet the rise in value of the tech giants was all the more astonishing because it came just hours after their chief executives were grilled on Capitol Hill about their alleged abuse of monopoly power and global dominance.</p><p>Perhaps just as well that the results did not come out until a day after the hearing, on what was dubbed Super Thursday' so the congressmen were not armed with fresh proof of just how powerful and profitable they are. And the fact all four reported on the same day meant none could be singled out. Strength in unity, as the saying goes.</p><p>As it was, Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg squirmed and struggled to defend themselves during what was a combative hearing in which they did not for once have all the slick answers.</p><p>Zuckerberg admitted to neutralising' rivals, and has already described his purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram as a digital land grab'.</p><p>Even Bezos sweated when asked about a bookseller being taken out by his Amazonian beast.</p><p>What a land grab it is. The four horsemen control nearly all that we do on the internet: selling apps, sending messages, pestering us with ads, stealing news, answering people's questions and buying just about everything one wants.</p><p>This is extraordinary power. Fortunately, the US politicians are serious about discovering how this power works, how it is wielded and if necessary cracking down on their reach. The sub-committee of the House Judiciary Committee has been investigating their dominance over the internet for a year now, and came well prepared with ammunition to show how the tech titans have been responsible for bullying and destroying small businesses.</p><p>That's on top of charges that big tech controls how we are surveilled and our data manipulated, that Facebook spreads misinformation and censors, while Amazon handles laundered goods.</p><p>But what should the policymakers do? Should the big tech behemoths be broken up in the same way Theodore Roosevelt took the axe to Standard Oil and the telephone companies in the 1920s? Or can their power be reined in by higher taxes and stiffer regulation?</p><p>It's a daunting dilemma. On the one hand, there is a strong argument that the West should support rather than demonise these great success stories, because the real threat is China. Nearly half of the world's biggest online firms - including Alibaba and JD.com - are Chinese, and they are growing fast.</p><p>There is another point. Would breaking them up benefit the customer? As most of us could testify, going through lockdown without Facetime on our mobile phones and Amazon to shop online may have been tougher still.</p><p>But not impossible. As we also saw during lockdown, small business owners snapped into action and came up with the most enterprising solutions. Now what we need is a fairer environment in which smaller social media outlets or online retailers can compete before being crushed by the big guns.</p><p>How can a more level playing field be achieved? Well, US politicians should look to the Australian government for inspiration. It has announced plans to force Google and Facebook to pay news outlets for content in an attempt to prevent the country's media from being ravaged.</p><p>If they don't pay, the Australian regulators will fine them hundreds of millions of dollars. Facebook and Google have already threatened to walk away rather than pay for news. Good. Let them walk.</p><p>Unusually, there is cross-party support for change. Both the Republicans and Democrats want to see big tech reformed, to varying degrees and for different reasons.</p><p>But don't hold your breath, certainly not until after the November US elections. Which is why the share prices of the big tech corporations largely stormed ahead after their results.

And two major Apple Inc.shareholders issued a letter pressing that company to help protect young children from smartphone addiction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The moves are just the latest in a reckoning that is rocking Silicon Valley as some of the technologists and investors who have helped build the world's most powerful tech firms are raising the alarm over the negative consequences of their innovations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/your-smartphone-is-making-you-stupid/article37511900/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/your-smartphone-is-making-you-stupid/article37511900/</url></p><p>Technology companies have faced an onslaught of criticism over the past year about sexist workplace cultures, congressional inquiries into Russian political interference in online political advertising and a growing body of evidence that smartphone addiction is becoming a public health crisis.</p><p>Many of the concerns aren't new. But what has changed is that the loudest warnings are coming from within .</p><p>Facebookshares fell nearly 5 per cent on Friday after chief executive <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said the company would dramatically overhaul its news feed to reduce the number of posts by advertisers and publishers in favour of more content from users' friends and family.</p><p>\"We feel a responsibility to make sure our services aren't just fun to use, but also good for people's well-being,\" Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>wrote. The announcement is largely seen as a sign that the company is worried about the growing backlash over how its technology has been used to manipulate public opinion and is now looking for ways to fix it.</p><p>Former Apple executive <person><nameText>Tony Fadell </nameText></person>took to Twitter this week after investment firm Jana Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, who collectively own $2-billion (U.S.) in Apple stock, pushed the company to do more to protect children from the effects of digital technology. \"We believe there is a clear need for Apple to offer parents more choices and tools to help them ensure that young consumers are using your products in an optimal manner,\" the investors wrote in an open letter.</p><p>\"Device addiction is real,\" Mr. Fadell added in a lengthy series of Twitter posts. He called on device-makers to help. \"Our smartphone 'bottle' needs to tell us we've had enough.\"</p><p>Apple responded by saying it has already added parental controls to its phones and was planning to introduce \"even more robust\" safeguards.</p><p>The events top off what has been a steady stream of condemnations from high-profile entrepreneurs and investors over the past several months. Early Facebookexecutives <person><nameText>Sean Parker </nameText></person>and Chamath Palihapitiya have warned of social media companies' ability to manipulate human behaviour. Twitter co-founder Ev Williams mused that the micro-blogging site had helped fuel the rise of online hate speech.</p><p>The backlash comes at a time when Big Tech is seemingly unstoppable. Major tech firms' stock prices are at record highs. The four largest Silicon Valley companies - Apple, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc. and Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. - now have a combined market capitalization larger than the GDP of Russia. But as their power has grown, tech companies are starting to see a sharp reversal from the sense of idealism that has long underpinned the industry. Digital skepticism is becoming the new normal in Silicon Valley, leading to questions over whether tech companies can fix themselves, or will be forced to by regulators.</p><p>\"There's a tectonic shift in the public's perception of Big Tech,\" said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University who published The Four, a book about the big four tech firms last year. \"A year ago we were talking about which CEO was more Jesus-like or was going to run for president. Now [tech] companies are being referred to as the new tobacco.\"</p><p>Among the most vocal proponents of those downsides is Silicon Valley venture capitalist Roger McNamee. An early investor in Google and Facebook, Mr. McNamee mentored Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>on what he saw as the vast potential of the nascent social media company starting around 2006.</p><p>Over the past year, however, Mr. McNamee - who still holds Facebookstock - has dedicated himself full-time to bringing public attention to the harmful effects of smartphone technology: how it is helping to expose children to inappropriate video content, contributing to a rise in teen suicide, leaving adults lonely and isolated and undermining democratic elections.</p><p>\"All of those things add up,\" he says. \"It suggests we've passed a tipping point and that these companies who have won on every objective measure - they've succeeded beyond their wildest dreams - they can afford to now go and do the right thing.\"</p><p>Mr. McNamee brought some of his concerns directly to both Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and Facebookchief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg in early 2016. They responded quickly and he spent four months talking to executives about how to deal with the threat of bad actors manipulating Facebook's platform. But eventually, he says, Facebookmade it clear it wasn't interested in seriously tackling the problem. That's when Mr. McNamee went public.</p><p>\"The notion was never to cause a problem,\" he says. \"The goal from the beginning has been to have a conversation about what is the appropriate role of social networks in our society?\"</p><p>Many tech insiders who are raising concerns point to the combination of ever-present smartphone technology that can collect reams of data on users, algorithms using that data to develop highly targeted content and the ad-based business model that has made smartphone users a highly lucrative market.</p><p>\"As soon as you have smartphones, you have constant surveillance of people all the time and it naturally progresses from what you could call advertising to... [what] you have to call a constant behaviour modification technology,\" says Jaron Lanier, a computer scientist who is widely credited as the father of virtual reality. \"Now you have these behaviour modification empires that are paid to change society.\"</p><p>Investors are taking notice of the growing chorus of worried voices emanating from Silicon Valley.</p><p>The decision by large shareholders to target Apple over smartphone addiction is a smart strategy, said Kellie McElhaney, a business professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The smartphone-maker has historically been responsive to pressure on social and environmental issues. While Apple isn't solely responsible for the attention-grabbing apps that run on its phone, it's in the best position to push the industry to change.</p><p>\"Apple has a significant amount of influence on every provider to Apple, from the materials in the phone to the app providers,\" she said. \"So that's where I do see a responsibility on Apple to use their power.\"</p><p>This year \"is going to be a turning point for the tech companies,\" said Jonas Kron, director of shareholder advocacy at Boston-based Trillium Asset Management, an investment firm that focuses on social-impact investing. \"I think they're going to be confronting investors' interest and investor attention in a way that they have never had to in the past.\"</p><p>Trillium has filed several shareholder proposals pressing companies including Apple, Tesla, and Google parent company Alphabet over issues such as privacy concerns, workplace diversity and environmental reporting. It recently filed a proposal asking Facebook's board to consider establishing a risk oversight committee to help the social media company combat issues such as fake news and the use of its platform by terrorists.</p><p>Mr. Kron isn't surprised to see the tide of public opinion is turning . Many other industries have introduced new technologies and products to an initial wave of enthusiasm that eventually gives way to concerns about the negative consequences. He points to the food and beverage industry, where decades ago pesticides and monoculture farming were seen as important developments that helped to dramatically reduce the cost of food, but eventually provoked a consumer backlash over environmental and health concerns.</p><p>\"It's not that one day everybody is going to wake up and Facebookor Google is going to find that it has lost half the user base,\" he says. \"It's going to be a much more slow erosion that will leave them scrambling for relevance.\"</p><p>Having sounded the alarm on Silicon Valley's ethical shortcomings, investors and entrepreneurs are turning their attention to how to fix the problems they've created.</p><p>Mr. McNamee offers up several solutions: Facebook, Google and Twitter should directly contact every user who was exposed to the Russian-backed election content to tell them they were being manipulated. Company CEOs should testify publicly before Congress. Regulators should ban fake social media accounts - or bots - and block technology companies from acquiring competitors until they can prove they've fixed their problems. Users should be given more control over their own data, which could include imposing a statute of limitations on how long tech companies can use the information they collect .</p><p>Social media companies ultimately have only a handful of options, Mr. Lanier says. They can allow the backlash to grow until they are eventually forced out of business, or they can shift their business models away from advertising and toward low subscription fees for users along with paying those who produce content. Netflix has used a similar model to usher in a golden era of so-called \"peak television.\"</p><p>\"If people pay for social networking, we'll have peak social networking and it will just get a lot better,\" he says.</p><p>Without major changes by the industry itself, Prof. Galloway predicts that European competition regulators will issue their first fine in excess of  10-billion ($15-billion Canadian) against one of the major tech firms within the next 12 months. There is also an \"outside chance\" that a European country could restrict access to U.S. social media businesses within their borders in order to help local entrepreneurs build their own domestic online platforms. \"Some nation is going to wave their middle finger at Big Tech and say: We're not as fascinated and adoring of you as your colleagues in the U.S.,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. McNamee hasn't heard from anyone at Facebookfor nearly a year, but says he would welcome the chance to help the company solve these issues before the backlash starts to weigh on their financial performance. The default strategy to deflect responsibility for the harmful effects of technology isn't working, he says. \"If they continue to fight, they'll succeed in avoiding regulation for a time. But they're going to harm their brands in some really profound ways.\"</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/silicon-valley-faces-reckoning-as-backlash-grows-against-big-tech/article37595219/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/silicon-valley-faces-reckoning-as-backlash-grows-against-big-tech/article37595219/</url> The viewing of this article is only available to Globe Unlimited subscribers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20180112escenic_37595219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RDB-F9N1-F072-J10J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1867\"/><timeReceived>5:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Cory Booker (N.J.) said. \"We have seen it in the '16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform.\"</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) - who last week bought a Facebook ad claiming, in jest, that the platform had endorsed President Trump - reiterated her call Tuesday to break up what she called \"monopolists\" in Silicon Valley and pressed her rivals in Tuesday's debate to forgo donations from \"the big tech executives.\" Even former tech executive Andrew Yang expressed a desire to find \"the best way we can fight back against big tech companies.\"</p><p>The unanimity of criticism of Big Tech marked a sharp turnabout from 2008, when a then-young social media platform, Facebook, was skillfully deployed to help elect Barack Obama president. Those warm feelings are long past, damaged by Facebook's role in spreading disinformation against Democrat Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign and its refusal to act more aggressively against viral falsehoods in this election season.</p><p>The growing frustration with Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers threatens to put the industry in the crosshairs of a future Democratic White House should the party prevail in 2020. Warren's call for the breakup of Facebook, Google and Amazon has generated backlash within the industry, most visibly when Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told employees in July that he would \"go to the mat . . . and fight\" such an effort in court.</p><p>\"Facebook was a company that was incredibly popular among the public writ large, and particularly liberals, prior to 2016. It now ranks with tobacco companies, oil companies and the NRA in driving Democratic anger,\" said Dan Pfeiffer, a White House communications director under Obama, whose use of Facebook in the 2008 campaign gave early hints of its power as a political organizing tool.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment on the growing Democratic disaffection with Silicon Valley. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Democrats' animosity has only grown in response to Zuckerberg's recent courtship of conservatives, including dinners and other private meetings with right-leaning pundits and lawmakers - all at a time when some of Facebook's most visible leaders in Washington are conservatives, too.</p><p>Katie Harbath, a former Republican strategist, including for Rudolph W. Giuliani,  Trump's personal attorney, is the company's public policy director for global elections. Facebook's vice president for global public policy is Joel Kaplan, a veteran of the George W. Bush White House who, last year, sat two rows behind then-U.S. Appeals Court Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as he denied allegations of sexual misconduct before Congress and battled successfully for a seat on the Supreme Court.</p><p>Over the past few months, Zuckerberg has huddled with prominent conservatives, including Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, and Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), who oversees tech issues as chairman of his chamber's Judiciary Committee. The dinners, confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the private conversations, marked Facebook's latest efforts to try to shore up support with influential political figures on the right who at times have criticized Silicon Valley for targeting Republicans unfairly.</p><p>But the meetings, first reported by Politico, sparked immediate Democratic outrage, including a campaign on Twitter to get users to quit Facebook, under the hashtag #deletefacebook. The report also drew a rare, testy response from Zuckerberg himself, who posted on his Facebook profile that he has dinners with officials on all sides of the political spectrum. \"Meeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning,\" he wrote. \"If you haven't tried it, I suggest you do!\"</p><p>Polls this year have found that large swaths of the American public are skeptical of leading technology companies. A Fox News poll in June asking whether Facebook had \"too much power\" found agreement from roughly three out of five Americans, with little variation based on race, income level, age, gender, region or party affiliation.</p><p>Distaste for major technology companies among conservatives has been obvious for years, with many Republicans - and especially Trump - bashing the industry for unproven allegations of liberal bias in moderating their platforms. They began voicing this critique forcefully ahead of the 2016 vote, leading to a summit in which top executives hosted prominent conservatives at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.For Democrats, though, the shift in opinion followed the 2016 election, when Russian operatives used the platform and other social media to spread viral falsehoods, exposing major weaknesses at Facebook that domestic and foreign sources continue to exploit to this day.</p><p>\"I think that these companies have accomplished something that no one else has been able to accomplish, and that is a bipartisan, bad mood, with the word 'antitrust' being thrown around,\" said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), whose district includes part of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Just how deeply major technology companies have fallen out of favor with Democrats was evident Tuesday as 12 of the party's presidential aspirants took the stage outside of Columbus, Ohio. That a section of the three-hour dialogue was devoted to technology was on its own a sign of the shifting views of a party that once used Facebook and Google's YouTube video service to elevate the country's \"first social media president,\" as Obama was known.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, a top Google executive, was a visible supporter of Obama, and the company's alumni filled key roles in his White House. The industry also was a major source of money for Democrats. Donors in the communications and electronics sectors overwhelmingly backed Clinton in 2016, contributing roughly $62 million to her campaign and outside groups compared with roughly $7 million for Trump, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. </p><p>During a town hall at Facebook's headquarters in the spring of 2011, Obama extolled Facebook for fostering \"dialogue,\" creating the conditions for a \"healthy democracy.\" The Obama-era optimism about social media was reflected globally, with \"Facebook revolutions\" unfolding from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street, from Tehran to Bucharest to Lower Manhattan.</p><p>No longer do Democrats cast Internet dwellers as engaged, enlightened citizens, however. Rather, in the words of Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman from Texas, they represent the \"product\" for social media platforms, which \"abuse that public trust . . . at extraordinary profits.\"</p><p>For Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), the problem stems from the current occupant of the Oval Office, who commands a massive online following, with more than 65 million users tracking the president's comments - many of them attacks on real and perceived rivals - on Twitter. Harris has asked Twitter to suspend Trump's account for violations of its policies against harassment and hateful conduct. The platform has declined to do so, but on Tuesday clarified the rare instances in which it would take action against world leaders.</p><p>Twitter also joined Facebook and Google in refusing a request by the campaign of Joe  Biden, the former vice president, to stop airing an advertisement that made false claims about him and his son's actions in Ukraine.</p><p>That refusal - in contrast with CNN's decision not to air the ad, and NBCUniversal's move to stop airing it - has enraged Democrats and fueled calls for more regulation of campaign speech, putting the party starkly at odds with most of Silicon Valley. Facebook officials explicitly exempt the ads and other \"direct speech\" by politicians from their system of fact-checking, the creation of which was a key reform after Russians and others flooded Facebook, its subsidiary Instagram and other social media platforms with disinformation in 2016.</p><p>Warren's call on Democrats to forgo fundraising in Silicon Valley has not yet caught on. The San Francisco Bay area has been a frequent fundraising stop for Harris as well as for Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both of whom remained quiet during the exchange during the debate on the power of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Even the candidates who don't take contributions from Silicon Valley have still poured money into the companies based there, in the form of digital advertising. The Democratic presidential contenders have spent roughly $5 million on Facebook ads alone during a three-week period ending Oct. 5, according to data compiled by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy.</p><p>The action on the debate stage echoed complaints heard on Capitol Hill, where Democrats say Facebook, Google and other leading companies should be doing more - not just about disinformation but a range of other issues as well.</p><p>\"Before 2016, Silicon Valley was seen by Democrats as unambiguously good,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), whose district includes part of Silicon Valley. \"Now some people in the Democratic Party and perhaps some in Silicon Valley have realized there's too much concentration of wealth . . . there are issues of privacy that are unaddressed. There is a need for thoughtful regulation, there's a need for Silicon Valley to think more broadly about job creation and opportunity.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:isaac.stanley-becker@washpost.com\">isaac.stanley-becker@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-b7d0cd9c-f054-11e9-8693-f487e46784aa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X92-9V61-DXXY-31CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1704\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Cory Booker (N.J.) said. \"We have seen it in the '16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform.\"</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) - who last week bought a Facebook ad claiming, in jest, that the platform had endorsed President Trump - reiterated her call Tuesday to break up what she called \"monopolists\" in Silicon Valley and pressed her rivals in Tuesday's debate to forgo donations from \"the big tech executives.\" Even former tech executive Andrew Yang expressed a desire to find \"the best way we can fight back against big tech companies.\"</p><p>The unanimity of criticism of Big Tech marked a sharp turnabout from 2008, when a then-young social media platform, Facebook, was skillfully deployed to help elect Barack Obama president. Those warm feelings are long past, damaged by Facebook's role in spreading disinformation against Democrat Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign and its refusal to act more aggressively against viral falsehoods in this election season.</p><p>The growing frustration with Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers threatens to put the industry in the crosshairs of a future Democratic White House should the party prevail in 2020. Warren's call for the breakup of Facebook, Google and Amazon has generated backlash within the industry, most visibly when Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told employees in July that he would \"go to the mat . . . and fight\" such an effort in court.</p><p>\"Facebook was a company that was incredibly popular among the public writ large, and particularly liberals, prior to 2016. It now ranks with tobacco companies, oil companies and the NRA in driving Democratic anger,\" said Dan Pfeiffer, a White House communications director under Obama, whose use of Facebook in the 2008 campaign gave early hints of its power as a political organizing tool.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment on the growing Democratic disaffection with Silicon Valley. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Democrats' animosity has only grown in response to Zuckerberg's recent courtship of conservatives, including dinners and other private meetings with right-leaning pundits and lawmakers - all at a time when some of Facebook's most visible leaders in Washington are conservatives, too.</p><p>Katie Harbath, a former Republican strategist, including for Rudolph W. Giuliani,  Trump's personal attorney, is the company's public policy director for global elections. Facebook's vice president for global public policy is Joel Kaplan, a veteran of the George W. Bush White House who, last year, sat two rows behind then-U.S. Appeals Court Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as he denied allegations of sexual misconduct before Congress and battled successfully for a seat on the Supreme Court.</p><p>Over the past few months, Zuckerberg has huddled with prominent conservatives, including Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, and Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), who oversees tech issues as chairman of his chamber's Judiciary Committee. The dinners, confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the private conversations, marked Facebook's latest efforts to try to shore up support with influential political figures on the right who at times have criticized Silicon Valley for targeting Republicans unfairly.</p><p>But the meetings, first reported by Politico, sparked immediate Democratic outrage, including a campaign on Twitter to get users to quit Facebook, under the hashtag #deletefacebook. The report also drew a rare, testy response from Zuckerberg himself, who posted on his Facebook profile that he has dinners with officials on all sides of the political spectrum. \"Meeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning,\" he wrote. \"If you haven't tried it, I suggest you do!\"</p><p>Polls this year have found that large swaths of the American public are skeptical of leading technology companies. A Fox News poll in June asking whether Facebook had \"too much power\" found agreement from roughly three out of five Americans, with little variation based on race, income level, age, gender, region or party affiliation.</p><p>Distaste for major technology companies among conservatives has been obvious for years, with many Republicans - and especially Trump - bashing the industry for unproven allegations of liberal bias in moderating their platforms. They began voicing this critique forcefully ahead of the 2016 vote, leading to a summit in which top executives hosted prominent conservatives at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.For Democrats, though, the shift in opinion followed the 2016 election, when Russian operatives used the platform and other social media to spread viral falsehoods, exposing major weaknesses at Facebook that domestic and foreign sources continue to exploit to this day.</p><p>\"I think that these companies have accomplished something that no one else has been able to accomplish, and that is a bipartisan, bad mood, with the word 'antitrust' being thrown around,\" said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), whose district includes part of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Just how deeply major technology companies have fallen out of favor with Democrats was evident Tuesday as 12 of the party's presidential aspirants took the stage outside of Columbus, Ohio. That a section of the three-hour dialogue was devoted to technology was on its own a sign of the shifting views of a party that once used Facebook and Google's YouTube video service to elevate the country's \"first social media president,\" as Obama was known.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, a top Google executive, was a visible supporter of Obama, and the company's alumni filled key roles in his White House. The industry also was a major source of money for Democrats. Donors in the communications and electronics sectors overwhelmingly backed Clinton in 2016, contributing roughly $62 million to her campaign and outside groups compared with roughly $7 million for Trump, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. </p><p>During a town hall at Facebook's headquarters in the spring of 2011, Obama extolled Facebook for fostering \"dialogue,\" creating the conditions for a \"healthy democracy.\" The Obama-era optimism about social media was reflected globally, with \"Facebook revolutions\" unfolding from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street, from Tehran to Bucharest to Lower Manhattan.</p><p>No longer do Democrats cast Internet dwellers as engaged, enlightened citizens, however. Rather, in the words of Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman from Texas, they represent the \"product\" for social media platforms, which \"abuse that public trust . . . at extraordinary profits.\"</p><p>For Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), the problem stems from the current occupant of the Oval Office, who commands a massive online following, with more than 65 million users tracking the president's comments - many of them attacks on real and perceived rivals - on Twitter. Harris has asked Twitter to suspend Trump's account for violations of its policies against harassment and hateful conduct. The platform has declined to do so, but on Tuesday clarified the rare instances in which it would take action against world leaders.</p><p>Twitter also joined Facebook and Google in refusing a request by the campaign of Joe  Biden, the former vice president, to stop airing an advertisement that made false claims about him and his son's actions in Ukraine.</p><p>That refusal - in contrast with CNN's decision not to air the ad, and NBCUniversal's move to stop airing it - has enraged Democrats and fueled calls for more regulation of campaign speech, putting the party starkly at odds with most of Silicon Valley. Facebook officials explicitly exempt the ads and other \"direct speech\" by politicians from their system of fact-checking, the creation of which was a key reform after Russians and others flooded Facebook, its subsidiary Instagram and other social media platforms with disinformation in 2016.</p><p>Warren's call on Democrats to forgo fundraising in Silicon Valley has not yet caught on. The San Francisco Bay area has been a frequent fundraising stop for Harris as well as for Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both of whom remained quiet during the exchange during the debate on the power of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Even the candidates who don't take contributions from Silicon Valley have still poured money into the companies based there, in the form of digital advertising. The Democratic presidential contenders have spent roughly $5 million on Facebook ads alone during a three-week period ending Oct. 5, according to data compiled by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy.</p><p>The action on the debate stage echoed complaints heard on Capitol Hill, where Democrats say Facebook, Google and other leading companies should be doing more - not just about disinformation but a range of other issues as well.</p><p>\"Before 2016, Silicon Valley was seen by Democrats as unambiguously good,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), whose district includes part of Silicon Valley. \"Now some people in the Democratic Party and perhaps some in Silicon Valley have realized there's too much concentration of wealth . . . there are issues of privacy that are unaddressed. There is a need for thoughtful regulation, there's a need for Silicon Valley to think more broadly about job creation and opportunity.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:isaac.stanley-becker@washpost.com\">isaac.stanley-becker@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-b7d0cd9cf05411e98693f487e46784aa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X92-62R1-JCDY-T1CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1704\"/><timeReceived>2:04 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/10/mark-zuckerberg-speaks-mandarin-blows-everyones-mind/\">Wired</url>: \"Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone's Mind\"); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-01/zuckerberg-to-give-99-of-facebook-stock-away-during-lifetime\">Bloomberg</url>: \"Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard\"). Vanity Fair announced him the \"new establishment king,\" and it blared: \"He changed the world once. He says he'll do it again.\"</p><p><br/>Everyone who doesn't have their retirement savings stashed in Facebook stock will watch his Capitol Hill comeuppance while sipping a glass of chilled schadenfreude. Yet, this is a far bigger moment than that. For its entire history, Silicon Valley has deflected skepticism, building itself a filter bubble that largely protected it from tough questions about its grand plans for remaking humanity and capitalism, about its bulldozing of privacy and media. Tomorrow will be the day Zuckerberg raises his hand before Congress, and it will be the day Silicon Valley no longer floats above the world.<br/>When America's founders designed our system, they created a model where power was meant to be constrained by power: Congress checks the president; the courts check the Congress. This ethos of balancing has extended beyond constitutional schemes, with the later advent of robust, objectively minded newspapers and labor unions, each theoretically serving as a countervailing center of power. Silicon Valley was born into a culture that had no interest in constraint. In the past, Zuckerberg has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/4/9/17214752/zuckerberg-facebook-power-regulation-data-privacy-control-political-theory-data-breach-king\">boasted</url> that he had created a platform as powerful as a nation-state-but it is a nation-state as imagined by Milton Friedman or Sam Brownback. There were essentially no regulators that aimed to curb its abuses. And certainly, there were no politicians attempting to win attention for themselves by interrogating him or the executives of other technology companies, with the sort of vigor sometimes applied to banks and airlines.<br/>The culture of Silicon Valley has exacerbated the sense of impunity. Facebook, with its hacker shtick, came to resemble a cult. (Google, to its credit, has created an atmosphere that places greater value on dissent, despite James Damore's protestations to the contrary. Witness the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html\">staff protest</url> against the company's Pentagon work. And at least Google had the self-awareness to drop its \"don't be evil\" motto.) I've watched many hours of Zuckerberg's vaunted town-hall meetings, full of seemingly canned questions from staff and the tightly wound founder responding to them with feigned surprise. There's a reason we're not suddenly reading news reports about the thwarted warnings that Facebook employees attempted to take to management. The engineers, it seems, blindly followed their leader. One of the salutary benefits of this backlash is that it stands to dent the culture of the company. It creates a new expectation that its employees should be more questioning, less thoughtless about human beings. The congressional flaying will show that there's, at the very least, a social price to be paid for creating such a careless product.<br/><br/>What makes these hearings so consequential is that politicians can now finally see the self-interested reasons for thrashing big tech. Recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cambridge-analytica-apology/americans-less-likely-to-trust-facebook-than-rivals-on-personal-data-idUSKBN1H10AF\">polling</url> shows a loss of faith in Facebook, but the public conversation suggests a much larger shift in consciousness. The coverage of the Cambridge Analytica story has provided a belated and harsh education for the public, illustrating the extent to which it has unwittingly submitted to the manipulation and surveillance of Silicon Valley companies. It's always stunning to hear otherwise media-savvy friends profess shock at how much information they had handed over to Facebook, and how little sensitivity the company showed to its precious cargo. Equally stunning is the fact that many of those who understood Facebook's transactional relationship with its users' private information couldn't seem to muster enough energy to actually care. The surrender of privacy, which had only theoretically bothered consumers, finally seems to have elicited genuine anger. It's a backlash that has been stoked by media, making noises about extracting itself from its own dependence on Facebook.<br/>This makes for a stunning reversal. In the face of Silicon Valley's power, there's a widely shared sense that the public has has no agency. Even if people weren't thrilled with the terms-of-service agreements offered by the companies, they accepted them as the natural course of life on the internet. Media, regulators, and engineers all knew perfectly well that Facebook had created a pernicious system, yet they assumed there was no way to blunt it. This reflected a broader attitude toward both technology and the market.<br/>In this environment, radical proposals suddenly become plausible.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr4077/summary\">Regulation</url>, which conventional wisdom held would never materialize in the United States, is suddenly theoretically       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://digg.com/2018/new-facebook-rules-political-ads\">accepted</url> by Mark Zuckerberg as the cost of his failures. (His porous       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/04/facebook-gdpr-stronger-privacy-protections-eu-data-protection-law-mark-zuckerberg\">half-promise</url> to abide by the principles of forthcoming European privacy rules, however, belie the sincerity of his contrition.) The spirit of the movement has even caught the fancy of Republicans, as well as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/a-policy-at-peace-with-itself-antitrust-remedies-for-our-concentrated-uncompetitive-economy/\">centrists</url>. Plummeting stock prices reflect a growing sentiment that constraints are inevitable. To lambaste Zuckerberg at these hearings is a necessary precondition for the development of robust policy, an important moment in the reordering of political economy-power brought to bear against power.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-siliconvalleyfallstoearth557585</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2R-DGG1-JCG7-V0GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"962\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

In response to email entreaties from Jobs to join the alleged scheme, Palm Inc.CEO Ed Colligan said the proposal was \"not only wrong\" but \"likely illegal.\"</p><p>Jobs even threatened Colligan with lawsuits over Palm's patent portfolio if the company didn't agree to the arrangement, court documents say.</p><p>Googleand Intuit, meanwhile, allegedly tried unsuccessfully to bring Facebook into the scheme, concerned that the social networking giant was \"poaching\" their employees.</p><p>\"Who should contact Sheryl [or] Mark to get a cease fire? We have to get a truce,\" Intuit chairman Bill Campbell allegedly wrote in a 2008 email to Google, referring to Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg.</nameText></person></p><p>Googleand Adobe declined to comment. Apple and Inteldid not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Lucasfilm and Pixar, divisions of Walt Disney, agreed last year to pay $9 million to settle their portion of the case, while Intuit agreed to pay $11 million. Just 8% of the eligible plaintiffs worked at one of those three firms; the court must now decide whether to approve those settlements.</p><p>In 2010, six of the companies -- Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit and Pixar -- agreed to settle a similar Justice Department lawsuit over what regulators say were anti-competitive hiring practices. The tech companies had been accused of violating antitrust law by agreeing not to poach each other's employees but did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20140421silicon-valley-hiring1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C1P-BP21-JBPX-W06G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><timeReceived>5:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>April 21, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002IST</classCode><className>PALM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0007EER</classCode><className>LIEFF CABRASER HEIMANN &amp;
