Across the rest of the world - Denver, Santiago, Toronto, Berlin, \"Silicon Glen,\" \"Silicon Alley,\" \"Silicon Roundabout\", Station F - it seems every city still wants to be a startup hub, dreaming of becoming \"the new Silicon Valley.\" But in the Valley itself? Here it feels like the golden age of the startup is already over.</p><p><br/> Hordes of engineering and business graduates secretly dream of building the new Facebook, the new Uber, the new AirBnB. Almost every big city now boasts one or more startup accelerators, modeled after Paul Graham's now-legendary Y Combinator. Hordes of technology entrepreneurs are reshaping, \"disrupting,\" every aspect of our economy. Today's big businesses are arthritic dinosaurs soon devoured by these nimble, fast-growing mammals with sharp teeth. Right?<br/> Er, actually, no. That was last decade. We live in a new world now, and it favors the big, not the small. The pendulum has already begun to swing back. Big businesses and executives, rather than startups and entrepreneurs, will own the next decade; today's graduates are much more likely to work for Mark Zuckerberg than follow in his footsteps.<br/> The web boom of 1997-2006 brought us Amazon, Facebook, Google, Salesforce, AirBnB, etc., because the Internet was the new new thing, and a handful of kids in garages and dorm rooms could build a web site, raise a few million dollars, and scale to serve the whole world. The smartphone boom of 2007-2016 brought us Uber, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, etc., because the same was true of smartphone apps.<br/> And so, because we've all lived through back-to-back massive worldwide hardware revolutions - the growth of the Internet, and the adoption of smartphones - we erroneously think another one is around the corner, and once again, a few kids in a garage can write a little software to take advantage of it.<br/> But there is no such revolution en route. The web has been occupied and colonized by big business; everyone already has a smartphone, and big companies dominate the App Store; and, most of all, today's new technologies are complicated, expensive, and favor organizations that have huge amounts of scale and capital already.<br/> It is no coincidence that seed funding is down in 2017. It is no coincidence that Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft have grown from \"five big tech companies\" to \"the five most valuable public companies in the world.\" The future belongs to them, and, to a lesser extent, their second-tier ilk.<br/> It is widely accepted that the next wave of important technologies consists of AI, drones, AR/VR, cryptocurrencies, self-driving cars, and the \"Internet of Things.\" These technologies are, collectively, hugely important and consequential - but they are not remotely as accessible to startup disruption as the web and smartphones were.<br/> AI doesn't just require top-tier talent; that talent is all but useless without mountains of the right kind of data. And who has essentially all of the best data? That's right: the abovementioned Big Five, plus their Chinese counterparts Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu.<br/> Hardware, such as drones and IoT devices, is hard to prototype, generally low-margin, expensive to bring to market, and very expensive to scale. Just ask Fitbit. Or Jawbone. Or Juicero. Or HTC. (However, in fairness, software and services built atop newly emerging hardware are likely an exception to the larger rule here; startups in those niches have far better odds than most others.)<br/> Self-driving cars are even more expensive: like biotech, they're a capital-intensive battle between huge companies. A few startups may - will - be expensively acquired, but that's not the same as having a realistic chance of actually becoming major competitors themselves.<br/> AR/VR is already far behind its boosters' optimistic adoption predictions, and is both an expensive hardware problem and a complex software problem. Magic Leap has raised almost two billion dollars without releasing a product (!), but is by most (admittedly sketchy) accounts struggling. Meanwhile, Microsoft's HoloLens, Google's Cardboard / Tango / ARCore, and Apple's ARKit continue to build successfully on their existing platforms.<br/> Cryptocurrencies aren't about making startups valuable; they're about the making the currencies themselves, and their decentralized ecosystems, valuable. The market capitalization of Bitcoin vastly exceeds that of any Bitcoin-based startup. The same is true for Ethereum. True believers argue that cryptocurrencies will overturn everything, in time, but read this Twitter thread and see if, like me, you can't help but finding yourself nodding along, even if, like me, you truly want the Internet and its economy to be decentralized:<br/> One like, one unpopular Blockchain/Cryptocurrency opinion<br/> - Nelson M. Rosario (@NelsonMRosario) October 21, 2017<br/> So where does all this leave tech startups? Struggling, and probably hoping to be acquired by a larger company, ideally one of the Big Five. While some breakout startups will still doubtless arise, they'll be far rarer than they were during the boom years.<br/> We're already seeing this. Consider Y Combinator, by all accounts the gold standard of startup accelerators, famously harder to get into than Harvard. Then consider its alumni. Five years ago, in 2012, its three poster children were clearly poised to dominate their markets and become huge companies: AirBnB, Dropbox, and Stripe. And so it came to pass.<br/> Fast forward to today, and Y Combinator's three poster children are... unchanged. In the last six years YC have funded more than twice as many startups as they did in their first six - but I challenge you to name any of their post-2011 alumni as well-positioned today as their Big Three were in 2012. The only one that might have qualified, for a time, was Instacart. But Amazon broke into that game with Amazon Fresh, and, especially, their purchase of Whole Foods.<br/> From here on in, the existing tech titans will accrue ever more power, and startups will be increasingly hard-pressed to compete. This is not a good thing. Big businesses already have too much power. Amazon and Googleare so dominant that there are loud calls for them to be regulated. Fake news shared on Facebook may have swayed the most presidential election.<br/> What's more, startups bring fresh approaches and thinking, while hidebound behemoths stagnate in their old ways of doing things. But for the next five to ten years, thanks to the nature of the new technologies coming down the pipe, those behemoths will just keep accruing ever more power - until, we can hope, the pendulum swings back again.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10231134</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PSX-5601-DYDW-709F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1122\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 23, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Despite no changes and little amendment to the FOMC statement, the Fed has shown that it will do whatever is in its capacity to support the economy.</p><p>Market participants are growing more confident that interest rates will remain near zero for a long time to come, even if inflation starts to tick higher. That is one risk-supporting factor investors do not need to worry about in the medium-term. However, the line added to the Fed's press release stating that \"the path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus\" should be taken into consideration as to how much risk needs to be in portfolios.</p><p>While some of the worst affected US states have shown that Covid-19 infections have peaked, the virus is not taking a break. Deaths in the US exceeded 150,000 on Wednesday and with a vaccine not expected to hit the market until later this year or 2021, more measures need to be taken to control the pandemic which suggest more economic pain. That is especially the case when we look outside of the US with Brazil reporting a daily record of 69,000 new cases on Wednesday and new outbreaks seen in Asia, Spain and Australia.</p><p>Now, the pressure has turned to the fiscal side and chances for disappointment are high as Democrats and Republicans are nowhere close to a deal. Both parties are struggling to find common ground and with millions of jobless Americans facing the expiration of their $600-a-week unemployment benefit, any further delay could lead to serious economic shocks. Both parties will eventually come to an agreement, but the more compromised the agreement is the more pressure it will put on market sentiment.</p><p>Asian equities traded mostly higher Thursday morning and European equities are expected to show slight gains. However, with US futures turning negative after Wednesday's strong performance, these may not hold.</p><p>There are a lot of earnings releases from Europe and the US on Thursday, but the most watched results will be from the four Big Tech names Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook who report after the market closes. Those companies, including Microsoft, have been the major force driving US equity indices higher, so expect to see a lot of volatility in the next 24 hours.</p><p>For information, disclaimer and risk warning note visit: FXTM</p><p>FXTM Brand: ForexTime Limited is regulated by CySEC and licensed by the SA FSCA.

That word \"fairness\" is crucial when it comes to the future regulation of these tech titans. That's because, in the mouths of different lawmakers, fairness means very different things.   \"These companies, as they exist today, have monopoly power... some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated.\"   Those were the closing remarks of David Cicilline, chairman of the House judiciary committee's anti-trust sub-committee.      For him, fairness means not just clipping the wings of Big Tech, but fundamentally restructuring their relationship with Americans.   Cicilline was one of many lawmakers who came out swinging. At one point he asked Amazon's Jeff Bezos why the company had been compared to a drug dealer.        \"I'll just cut straight to the chase. Big Tech's out to get conservatives,\" said Jordan.   Much of their ire centred around claims of censorship, specifically that Facebook and Google unfairly discriminate against conservatives.   President Trump has suggested likewise. He's already criticised Twitter and Facebook for removing conservative content and even flagging his own posts and tweets.  US elections  This split makes predicting how the US might try to lasso these tech giants difficult.   Republicans are generally against market regulation, against increasing red tape.   It's highly unlikely though that anything much will happen before the US elections in November.   As well as the presidential vote, all the seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, as well as about a third of the Senate.   And so we reach a fork in the road for Big Tech in America.   If the Democrats win, expect more regulation in an attempt to inject more competition into the tech industry.        In reality though, it's unlikely to be that black and white.   There are Republicans that have sympathies for some of the anti-competition arguments, for example.   The accusations around Amazon hurting tens of thousands of small American businesses is a Republican concern as much as a Democrat one.   There may be bipartisan compromises around anti-competition that are palatable to both sides.   But it's hard to avoid the conclusion that whoever wins the next election, Big Tech is going to get whacked. The question is how and by whom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42721696828</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-FV21-F07F-84JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"469\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>BBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We can see our distant loved ones on Skype and FaceTime. We can conduct classes and business meetings. We can work remotely. We can order groceries online. We can binge-watch Tiger King.</p><p>In this emergency, we have been starkly reminded of the value of physical presence - both of the workers who still have to be there to save lives or deliver food and of the comfort of touch whose power is brought home by its aching absence. But we also have every reason to be grateful for the safety net of the virtual. </p><p>It is almost impossible to imagine where we would be without digital connectivity. The paradox of this moment is that the isolation that may save us would be unthinkable if it we did not have another joined-up world to inhabit. If we could not take refuge in the cyber realm, millions of us would have to risk death in the physical domain.</p><p>The 2020 Sign of the Times study - conducted in January and February by Behaviour &amp; Attitudes - tells us just how deeply this technology had penetrated our daily lives before coronavirus hit us. </p><p>Nearly nine in 10 of us have a smartphone and even among the over-65s, it's almost 60 per cent. Eight in 10 adults access the internet at least once a day. Staggeringly, Irish families with teenagers have an average of 10 smart devices in their homes. And thank goodness for them. </p><p>It is not just that the technology has allowed us to keep our distance from one another; it is that it has allowed us to stay relatively sane while doing so.</p><p>Without this digital connectivity, we would have been faced with a terrible choice: carry on as usual and die in vast numbers or be marooned on desert islands of solitary bleakness. With it, there has been, for the first time in the history of pandemics, a third way - a peculiar combination of distancing and intimacy that, on this mass scale, surely counts as an entirely novel collective experience. </p><p>Even 20 years ago, it would have been impossible. It is a distinctive 21st-century mode of being, and staying, alive.</p><h>Existential crises </h><p>And yet it is also profoundly problematic. Existential crises cause new things to happen - and this is certainly one of them - but they also magnify and bring to the surface the contradictions and tensions that are already present. The most striking thing about the Sign of the Times findings is what they reveal about our love-hate relationship with the technology-saturated environment we inhabit. The crisis is very likely to exacerbate both the love and the hate.</p><p>Maybe some of us are still Luddites. Maybe some are still tech utopians. But few can take comfort in these absolutes. We are, rather trapped in a Faustian pact with a very seductive devil. Faust wanted to know everything, to experience everything, to feel everything, to be able to move at will through place and time. The only price for being granted all of this was his soul. </p><p>We, too, have been granted access, instantly, to everything. But there is a twist in the story - Faust knew what he was signing up for. He read the terms and conditions. We, collectively, didn't. But we have given our souls to the controllers of these technological wonders anyway.</p><p>We've now woken up to the price implicit in the bargain. The Sign of the Times study is a distress signal. It shows a sophisticated awareness of the dilemma we have created for ourselves. We are addicts, hooked on the pleasures and the highs of the always-on world. But we know that any substance or habit we are addicted to sucks out part of our souls, the part where free will resides. </p><p>We lose control. The phones, the emails, the social media posts become coercive. We are tyrannised by the peremptory demands of incoming messages, blinded by this blizzard of signals.\u00a0</p><p>We are, in this digital universe, neither properly ourselves nor truly social. We feel compelled to make a show of ourselves: to perform versions of beauty and coolness and success that live up to the expectations of our online friends. We dare not show our faces: Facetune is the niqab of the online world.\u00a0</p><p>We surf an endless wave of communication, and yet 64 per cent of us (up from 50 per cent in 2014) feel that the art of conversation is increasingly being lost. And, conversely, we long for the natural. We hanker after the real, the tangible, the raw, the authentic.\u00a0</p><p>The current crisis will not cut through this double bind. It will intensify it. In the immediate term, it has made us even more dependent on the technology. The traffic has massively increased on both sides of the digital highway. Daily social experiences that were still direct and physical - school and university classes, office life, concerts - have migrated online. </p><p>On the other side, the virtual has annexed ever more of the territory of the actual. The distinction between home and work, already, as the Sign of the Times study shows, under enormous pressure, has been increasingly obliterated.\u00a0</p><p>So we will emerge from this extraordinary period both more inextricably wedded to our smart devices and more anxious about the state of the marriage. Three big concerns, already present but now greatly amplified, will have to be addressed.</p><p>The first is about control. The crisis has made it abundantly clear that the big tech companies are public utilities. What they provide are not, in essence, optional services. They are vital necessities. Just as the 2008 crash revealed to the general public that banks are not private institutions, the pandemic of 2020 reveals that the big IT companies are not just \"too big to fail\" but too crucial to be left to their own devices. If societies - as we are now seeing - cannot afford to be without the technology, they equally cannot afford to be at the mercy of unaccountable monopolies that control it for their own benefit.</p><p>The second is about the barriers between work and life. The erection of these barriers is one of the great achievements of civilisation. Generations of ordinary people fought and struggled to set limits to the working day, and therefore to the proper realm of gainful employment: this is what I owe to my boss, the rest is for me and my family. </p><p>We see in the Sign of the Times study the brutal invasion of this private space enabled by digital technologies: we are finding it increasingly hard even to protect holidays, let alone weekends and evenings, from invasion by work emails.\u00a0</p><p>This invasion is one to which we are being forced by the virus to surrender ever more abjectly. There may, in the short term, be some pleasure and advantage in being able to work while also being with one's kids. But in this blurring of the distinction between the time your boss owns and the time that remains your own, it is not domestic life that wins out. </p><p>If the virus really is the catalyst for a revolution in home working, it has to be accompanied by a great social movement to re-regulate working time. The \"right to disconnect\" recently won in France has to become universal. And the time clawed back from commuting has to belong to the worker, not to the employer.\u00a0</p><h>Connected devices </h><p>Third, we have to confront the step-change in the use of our connected devices for surveillance that is happening in this crisis. The problem we have to reckon with here is not the disadvantage of these technologies, but their great utility. </p><p>As we are already seeing in China, apps that allow authorities to link a person's movements to their health status are immensely powerful tools for controlling a pandemic. They are also, of course, immensely powerful tools for control, full stop. Dystopian visions of systems that can not just monitor what we do but predict it are becoming real very fast.</p><p>We may well have to cede to our governments powers that will be justified by the prevention of mass deaths. But once we've done that, the borders of privacy will have shrunk to virtually nothing. We've already ceded to the tech giants the right to gather and fuse together vast amounts of data on what we read, what we buy, where we go, who we desire, how our moods change, what hidden forces affect our emotions and therefore our actions. </p><p>In what Shoshana Zuboff calls this \"third modernity\", the \"machine hive\" of data-gathering creates the \"human hive\", in which \"individual freedom is forfeit to collective knowledge and action. Nonharmonious elements are pre-emptively targeted with high doses of tuning, herding and conditioning, including the full seductive force of social persuasion and influence.\"\u00a0</p><p>We will learn much more about this new kind of modernity in the aftermath of this crisis. We will also have to learn new kinds of democratic accountability if we are to sort the fabulous benefits of this technology from its fearful dangers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4226502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YMS-KV21-JC8Y-83YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1591\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 11, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001696</classCode><className>TELECOMMUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000022</classCode><className>ADOLESCENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp; REEFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000354</classCode><className>COMPUTER NETWORKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The expansion, which involves building a second pipe along the route of an existing line, will run from outside Edmonton across the Rockies and on to Burnaby, B.C., boosting Alberta's oil exports from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000.</p><p>TMX is a done deal. Albertans will be somewhat mollified. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals will claim to be fulfilling an election promise and demonstrating his government's deep dedication to Albertans. The company has already announced that it has hired more than 2,000 employees since the end of September. Indigenous groups are reportedly eager to take on some ownership and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, scraping for green support, suggested the government's purchase of TMX has nothing to do with promoting the fossil fuel industry in Alberta. \"We purchased it for a reason,\" he said last week, \"We now see how it can help accelerate our clean energy transition by putting any revenues that we get from it into a transition to clean energy.\"</p><p>According to Morneau, about $500 million a year in pipeline revenues will be pumped into clean energy, thus performing the miracle of turning a carbon-emitting fossil fuel pipeline into a carbon-reduction project. One has to wonder, though, where this money will come from.</p><p>Morneau said the government will put \"any revenues that we get\" into green energy projects. But revenues are not profits. Before Ottawa has free cash from TMX to throw around, a lot of money will need to be allocated to paying back the government's massive investment in the project, including the $4.5 billion the Trudeau government paid for the existing pipeline and the estimated $10-billion cost of completing the expansion. It's hard to see how TMX will be throwing up $500 million a year in excess profits for the Liberals to splash around as green energy investments any time soon.</p><p>But since TMX was set to go before the election, Morneau said it will not be a bargaining chip as the Liberals negotiate with other parties to keep their minority government afloat. \"My expectation is that we have much common ground between the other parties,\" said Morneau.</p><p>If TMX is off the table, what are the policies, programs and taxes that the Liberals and NDP (and maybe even the Conservatives) might agree on? Here are five hot chips on the bargaining table that appear to offer \"common ground\" for early adoption. The only common element is that each represents undesirable and harmful government intrusion in the economy. Pharmacare: In one form or another, Canada is about to take a critical plunge into national drug price and supply management.</p><p>The Liberal platform was cautious, promising only to \"take the critical next steps\" to implement national universal pharmacare so that all Canadians have the drug coverage they need at an affordable price. The NDP wants a full national pharmacare plan in place ASAP. The bargaining over pharmacare will focus on how far the federal government should go into taking over the pricing and supply of pharmaceuticals. Media fund: The Trudeau government has already committed to funding journalism and media companies. Mediacare represents a government reach into another market that flies in the face of free market and free media principles. Telecom fees: The Liberal platform promised to lower monthly cellphone bills by 25 per cent over two years \"by using the government's regulatory powers, saving an average middle-class family of four nearly $1,000 per year.\"</p><p>That's a big number, one the Liberals did not account for in their fiscal plan because, obviously, it would have to be paid by the telecom companies. If there are, say, three million families of four in Canada, that's an annual cost of $3 billion. Netflix taxes: All parties seem to agree that international big-tech companies need to be taxed, through a sales tax or some form of revenue tax. The Liberal fiscal plan estimated revenue of $600 million a year from tech companies. If the new tech taxes are limited to collecting GST/HST on Facebook and the other giants, fine. But there are indications that new tech taxes will amount to a grab for more than sales taxes to generate cash to redistribute to Canadian companies. Taxes on wealthy: It is hardly worth mentioning that the first Liberal budget will take a run at raising taxes on higher-income Canadians. The Liberals promised to make sure \"the wealthiest Canadians ... pay a little bit more.\" The NDP has more explicit plans it is certain to insist on when the bargaining chips are down. Also part of the tax-the-rich agenda is the Liberal plan to impose a tax on foreign buyers of housing.</p><p>So while the TMX pipeline green light will be hailed as the Trudeau Liberals'willingness to compromise and at least get a part of the Alberta economy moving, the real indicators of the government's direction are still to come but were comprehensively outlined during the election. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

The expansion, which involves building a second pipe along the route of an existing line, will run from outside Edmonton across the Rockies and on to Burnaby, B.C., boosting Alberta's oil exports from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000.</p><p>TMX is a done deal. Albertans will be somewhat mollified. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals will claim to be fulfilling an election promise and demonstrating his government's deep dedication to Albertans. The company has already announced that it has hired more than 2,000 employees since the end of September. Indigenous groups are reportedly eager to take on some ownership and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, scraping for green support, suggested the government's purchase of TMX has nothing to do with promoting the fossil fuel industry in Alberta. \"We purchased it for a reason,\" he said last week, \"We now see how it can help accelerate our clean energy transition by putting any revenues that we get from it into a transition to clean energy.\"</p><p>According to Morneau, about $500 million a year in pipeline revenues will be pumped into clean energy, thus performing the miracle of turning a carbon-emitting fossil fuel pipeline into a carbon-reduction project. One has to wonder, though, where this money will come from.</p><p>Morneau said the government will put \"any revenues that we get\" into green energy projects. But revenues are not profits. Before Ottawa has free cash from TMX to throw around, a lot of money will need to be allocated to paying back the government's massive investment in the project, including the $4.5 billion the Trudeau government paid for the existing pipeline and the estimated $10-billion cost of completing the expansion. It's hard to see how TMX will be throwing up $500 million a year in excess profits for the Liberals to splash around as green energy investments any time soon.</p><p>But since TMX was set to go before the election, Morneau said it will not be a bargaining chip as the Liberals negotiate with other parties to keep their minority government afloat. \"My expectation is that we have much common ground between the other parties,\" said Morneau.</p><p>If TMX is off the table, what are the policies, programs and taxes that the Liberals and NDP (and maybe even the Conservatives) might agree on? Here are five hot chips on the bargaining table that appear to offer \"common ground\" for early adoption. The only common element is that each represents undesirable and harmful government intrusion in the economy.</p><p>Pharmacare: In one form or another, Canada is about to take a critical plunge into national drug price and supply management.</p><p>The Liberal platform was cautious, promising only to \"take the critical next steps\" to implement national universal pharmacare so that all Canadians have the drug coverage they need at an affordable price. The NDP wants a full national pharmacare plan in place ASAP. The bargaining over pharmacare will focus on how far the federal government should go into taking over the pricing and supply of pharmaceuticals. Media fund: The Trudeau government has already committed to funding journalism and media companies. Mediacare represents a government reach into another market that flies in the face of free market and free media principles.</p><p>Telecom fees: The Liberal platform promised to lower monthly cellphone bills by 25 per cent over two years \"by using the government's regulatory powers, saving an average middle-class family of four nearly $1,000 per year.\"</p><p>That's a big number, one the Liberals did not account for in their fiscal plan because, obviously, it would have to be paid by the telecom companies. If there are, say, three million families of four in Canada, that's an annual cost of $3 billion.</p><p>Netflix taxes: All parties seem to agree that international big-tech companies need to be taxed, through a sales tax or some form of revenue tax. The Liberal fiscal plan estimated revenue of $600 million a year from tech companies. If the new tech taxes are limited to collecting GST/HST on Facebook and the other giants, fine. But there are indications that new tech taxes will amount to a grab for more than sales taxes to generate cash to redistribute to Canadian companies.</p><p>Taxes on wealthy: It is hardly worth mentioning that the first Liberal budget will take a run at raising taxes on higher-income Canadians. The Liberals promised to make sure \"the wealthiest Canadians ... pay a little bit more.\" The NDP has more explicit plans it is certain to insist on when the bargaining chips are down. Also part of the tax-the-rich agenda is the Liberal plan to impose a tax on foreign buyers of housing.</p><p>So while the TMX pipeline green light will be hailed as the Trudeau Liberals'willingness to compromise and at least get a part of the Alberta economy moving, the real indicators of the government's direction are still to come but were comprehensively outlined during the election. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Justice said Wednesday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions will meet with state attorneys general this month to explore the issue (see 1809050057), days after President Donald Trump warned Google and Silicon Valley about violating antitrust law. \"I'd rather get [DOJ] advice before Congress decides to declare [industry] a regulated utility, which I think would be a disaster,\" Cornyn said.</p><p>Asked if Trump's warning influenced DOJ's scrutiny, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told us he doesn't \"necessarily think so.\" It will be interesting to see what DOJ \"methodology would be because it's a very different market,\" Tillis said, and informative to see how antitrust law might apply to free services. \"I don't know exactly how they would do it, but that's one of the reasons why [the] Judiciary [Committee] at least has some role in oversight. We'll just have to wait and see how they map it out.\" Cornyn and Tillis are members of that panel. Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told us antitrust law is designed to protect consumers, so he's supportive of departmental scrutiny if \"they're doing it from the standpoint of protecting consumers.\" DOJ didn't comment.</p><p>Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association CEO Ed Black was skeptical during a conference call Friday of DOJ motivations. It's an \"unfortunate\" attempt to \"marshal the power\" of the government to target a company for nongovernmental purposes, he said. There is certainly a \"hint or tangential linkage\" to political interests, he said: If more than tangential, \"that would certainly become a serious problem.\"</p><p>FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra commented on the agency's upcoming hearings on competition and consumer protection policy (see 1808240027), which start Thursday. Use any rulemaking authority to define \"unfair methods of competition,\" he recommended Thursday. The agency has relied on adjudication to define unfair competition \"case-by-case,\" he said: Rulemaking authority through the Administrative Procedure Act is \"a far more effective tool that would provide greater notice to the marketplace and that is developed through a more transparent, participatory process.\"</p><p>Americans for Prosperity Policy Manager David Barnes denounced political interests influencing enforcement of antitrust law. Echoing Grassley, he said antitrust law exists to benefit consumers: DOJ \"should not wield its authority to subjectively pick winners and losers in the tech industry or to police free speech. Using threats of antitrust or other enforcement as a political weapon should be cause for concern for every American.\"</p><p>It's inappropriate for DOJ or the FTC to take legal action not based on solid evidence, Black argued. On the FTC hearings, he said, \"We hope that by and large most policymakers will be able to distinguish between legitimate, complex questions that need attention and [disregard] wild, unsubstantiated and ill-motivated attacks by others.\" CCIA Competition Director Marianela Lopez-Galdos said tech markets are more competitive than others. The Internet accounted for 21 percent of GDP growth in \"mature economies\" in the past five years, she said, citing McKinsey Global Institute data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6S-Y1H1-JC8G-8466-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>COMPUTER &amp;

Justice said Wednesday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions will meet with state attorneys general this month to explore the issue (see 1809050057), days after President Donald Trump warned Google and Silicon Valley about violating antitrust law. \"I'd rather get [DOJ] advice before Congress decides to declare [industry] a regulated utility, which I think would be a disaster,\" Cornyn said.</p><p>Asked if Trump's warning influenced DOJ's scrutiny, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told us he doesn't \"necessarily think so.\" It will be interesting to see what DOJ \"methodology would be because it's a very different market,\" Tillis said, and informative to see how antitrust law might apply to free services. \"I don't know exactly how they would do it, but that's one of the reasons why [the] Judiciary [Committee] at least has some role in oversight. We'll just have to wait and see how they map it out.\" Cornyn and Tillis are members of that panel. Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told us antitrust law is designed to protect consumers, so he's supportive of departmental scrutiny if \"they're doing it from the standpoint of protecting consumers.\" DOJ didn't comment.</p><p>Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association CEO Ed Black was skeptical during a conference call Friday of DOJ motivations. It's an \"unfortunate\" attempt to \"marshal the power\" of the government to target a company for nongovernmental purposes, he said. There is certainly a \"hint or tangential linkage\" to political interests, he said: If more than tangential, \"that would certainly become a serious problem.\"</p><p>FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra commented on the agency's upcoming hearings on competition and consumer protection policy (see 1808240027), which start Thursday. Use any rulemaking authority to define \"unfair methods of competition,\" he recommended Thursday. The agency has relied on adjudication to define unfair competition \"case-by-case,\" he said: Rulemaking authority through the Administrative Procedure Act is \"a far more effective tool that would provide greater notice to the marketplace and that is developed through a more transparent, participatory process.\"</p><p>Americans for Prosperity Policy Manager David Barnes denounced political interests influencing enforcement of antitrust law. Echoing Grassley, he said antitrust law exists to benefit consumers: DOJ \"should not wield its authority to subjectively pick winners and losers in the tech industry or to police free speech. Using threats of antitrust or other enforcement as a political weapon should be cause for concern for every American.\"</p><p>It's inappropriate for DOJ or the FTC to take legal action not based on solid evidence, Black argued. On the FTC hearings, he said, \"We hope that by and large most policymakers will be able to distinguish between legitimate, complex questions that need attention and [disregard] wild, unsubstantiated and ill-motivated attacks by others.\" CCIA Competition Director Marianela Lopez-Galdos said tech markets are more competitive than others. The Internet accounted for 21 percent of GDP growth in \"mature economies\" in the past five years, she said, citing McKinsey Global Institute data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONSED-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONSED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6S-Y0V1-DYRJ-12T3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Consumer Electronics Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>COMPUTER &amp;

Fridsma referenced Rucker's focus on a \u201clearning health system\u201d and \u201cbulk access to population health level data\u201d alongside Verma's emphasis on making Medicare and Medicaid data readily available to researchers.Reading between the lines, it appears the administration could be focusing on ways to open up data sets to new powerful technologies. </p><p>\u201cIt suggests to me that they are thinking about not only individual data access but the ability to do broader analytics,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's tremendously important when it comes to the research community to understand what works and what doesn't.\u201d</p><p>The meeting was far more widely publicized <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ehr/white-house-interoperability-ehr-jared-kushner-seema-verma-data-sharing\">than last year's series of interoperability meetings</url> that featured many of the same participants discussing a number of the same barriers. Last year's meetings set the stage for the administration's MyHealthEData initiative launched in March, which has been routinely touted by administration officials as an opportunity to improve access for patients.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/information-blocking-provisions-will-be-largely-common-sense-says-onc-s-rucker\">Information blocking provisions will be 'largely common sense,' says ONC's Rucker</url></emphasis></p><p>In addition to keynote speeches by top Trump administration officials, participants engaged in smaller breakout sessions on specific interoperability pain points. Fridsma said his group\u2014which included representatives from Google, IBM, insurers and EHR vendors\u2014focused on privacy and security.</p><p>It's clear that legislators will need to establish a more consistent but flexible framework for patient data. Currently, HIPAA, the Federal Communications Commission and the Common Rule govern bits and pieces of privacy, but gaps remain.</p><p>\u201cIf patients get their data out of an EHR and put it into the app and allow a researcher to use that, they may think the same protections apply, but they don't,\u201d Fridsma said, adding that legislation that ties multiple laws together would be better than regulation in the form of a new rule.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/verma-interoperability-rule-coming-data-sharing-medicare-requirement\">Verma says interoperability rule is coming, backs data sharing as a Medicare requirement</url></emphasis></p><p>A request for information currently under review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) includes possible changes to HIPAA to \u201csupport, and remove barriers to, coordinated care.\u201d</p><p>Everyone's ears were perked for any hints about the forthcoming information blocking and interoperability rules that are still under review by the OMB.

It started as a case studybased approach with little by way of a conceptual foundations. Nevertheless, it has become very successful. Circa one in five students in the US are enrolled in a business education programme.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over time, there emerged prestigious specialised conferences, journals, accreditors and other bodies and metrics that have helped foster a diverse and seemingly robust ecosystem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Things were not always so good. The author studied economics in the UK and recalls the disdain with which business faculty and studies on \"the floor below\" were regarded by economists - as little more than glorified consultants.</p><p>In some ways that was deserved. Emerging business and management schools would normally tend to attract the scholars who could not succeed in their field by being too applied and/or too heterodox and/or simply not good. Few fields, such as marketing and accounting partly escaped the stigma of being compared to scholars and departments of a founding discipline; others such as international business aimed to be multidisciplinary to start with, partly escaping the founding discipline \"curse\", yet struggled to convince the wider academic community of its rigour and sometimes even its raison d'etre.</p><p>In this context the subsequent success of business schools was neither self-evident nor, to my knowledge, has it been adequately understood and explained. There are a few possible related reasons.</p><p>A key reason in my view is that business education has gradually served as a \"general purpose technology\" (GPT). GPTs, such as the internet, are technologies/innovations that have multiple applications and are scalable (consider Google algorithms). Business education - imparted knowledge shares in part, these characteristics.</p><p>Business schools themselves kept improving in numerous ways and gaining academic credibility, often drawing on their disciplinary foundations of economics, sociology, psychology and quantitative methods while increasingly aiming to adapt to business reality and develop and improve new theories for their own purposes.</p><p>The need for and pursuit of scholarly legitimacy also drove the emergence of \"elite\" journals with demanding conceptual and methodological rigour. Books, meanwhile, have been delegated to practitioners and hobbyists.</p><p>As in other subjects, notably economics, the focus on \"research\" gradually gave rise to diminishing returns. The pressures for publication in elite journals with the almost excessive reward in terms of promotion, tenure and overall gravitas has raised concerns about the potential trade-off between research, teaching, leadership and engagement. Many a top publication is seen as largely irrelevant to real-life business and practitioners.</p><p>While a number of top schools had the resources to hire individuals who could excel in elite and relevant research (as well as on teaching and leadership) usually with supporting structures and business models and procedures, not everyone could follow. And the impact on life-work balance gradually started become excessive.</p><p>Students paying high fees began questioning the relevance of top-tier research to their learning experience. Similarly, many businesses and business people questioned the relevance and usefulness of business degrees. All this led to calls for change with a gradual re-balancing and more focus on engagement, impact and teaching.</p><p>It could be argued that the evolution of business education has gone from practice to theory and back to practice. I think, however, that the reality is more nuanced than that. What we see is a re-emergent focus on teaching, engagement, relevance and impact, taking place from stronger conceptual foundations - that of \"engaged scholarship\"- that could be imparted to and co-developed with the student body and other stakeholders.</p><p>The return to practice in the form of engaged scholarship is, in this sense, at a higher plane than before. It has been co-constituted through public policy innovations such as the REF (Research Excellence Framework) and the T(eaching) EF and now the K(nowledge) EF in the UK as well as the role of business school dean associations such as CABS (UK) and ABDC (Australia) and accreditation bodies such as the EFMD, AACSB and AMBA providing rules and metrics to measure and improve sustainable performance.</p><p>Today business education is a multi-billioneuro sector. But it is also looking rather tired and ill-adapted to today's realities. MBA numbers are declining in many countries and the cost-benefit calculus of business degrees is under question. Popular magazines, such as Fortune, wonder what is killing business education in the US.</p><p>Factors such as immigration and neoprotectionist policies by governments contribute. And so does increasing supply and competition from numerous sources including new national markets and alternative providers. All these are widely acknowledged and discussed. The question whether competition harms or helps expand the market remains an open one.</p><p>Here I wish to focus on some aspects that can benefit from more attention. These relate to the student experience, the role of business in the global financial crisis, the 4th industrial revolution and the rise of big tech.</p><p>Starting with students, the success of business education led to business schools often becoming the cash cows of financially challenged institutions. Gradually this has led to lop-sided (as compared to other schools and departments) staff-student-ratios (SSRs), unhealthy life-work balance and high salaries.</p><p>At the same time, increasing fees and even a rather self-defeating approach by some institutions to treat students as \"customers\", have led to those customers demanding value for money and sometimes expecting to \"buy\" what they paid for (a good degree) one way or the other. Combine this with increasing demands on academics for research output as opposed to teaching excellence and things gradually came to a head.</p><p>During the years of \"irrational exuberance\" business scholars like many economists, have gradually come to believe in the self-correcting properties of markets and the ability of business to help address societal problems. That led to a suspicion of public policy and a sharp decline in the perceived need for government involvement in terms of antitrust action, regulation, competition and other policies.</p><p>The focus on business has also been prejudicial on engagement with the \"third sector\". That has helped undermine economic sustainability and in many ways business education became complicit on practices that helped bring about the global financial crisis.</p><p>It was not rare for business school cases to heap praise on the acumen and practices of businesses that were later involved in the major scandals; consider Enron and Theranos.</p><p>In the meantime, the failure to seriously consider antitrust legislation helped the currently dominant tech monopolies, a concurrent worsening in income distribution, little regard for the environment and basically an institutional failure of unprecedented dimension.</p><p>Not surprisingly, many a commentator, including numerous documentaries and dramatisations of the crisis, questioned the role and legitimacy of business education. With business schools depending more than others on business engagement, executive education/ consulting and business-related research, and the emergent conflict of interest is not too hard to see. It is hard to be critical of your funder even at the most basic personal level.</p><p>Increasingly that led to demands for more arm's length engagement and the inclusion of ethics, governance and sustainability-related issues in the business curriculum. Yet its is clear that this follows than leads. Different pressures emerged from the 4th industrial revolution.</p><p>This includes developments such as artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D printing, blockchain, internet of things, self-driving and electric vehicles, smart cities and so on. None of those plays to the current provision of business education. They are simply too science and engineering based for the current business model of business schools.</p><p>Business education needs to adapt and to lead. For this it needs to enhance its provision with subjects that are able to address the key challenges cited above and others. Dealing with social and economic sustainability requires a focus on ethics and morality -this can come from philosophy. The influence of philosophy and epistemology on business has so far been minimal.</p><p>Antitrust action requires incorporating law. Law and economics have found applications in the corporate governance debate but here, too, business scholars mostly followed the economists' emphasis on shareholder value.</p><p>Things are changing, but slowly. Incorporating law into the curriculum can help. The same applies to politics. The current power of big tech is much more than market power - it has morphed into political power. It is important that power becomes a major subject in business curricula - hence politics and geo-politics as well.</p><p>The above has focused on social sciences. The 4th industrial revolution calls for expanding the curriculum to science and engineering. Business schools need to do with relevant science subjects what they before achieved with (selected) social sciences.</p><p>If all the above sounds a bit like \"business education imperialism\" and a very tall order indeed, it is because it is. It cannot be readily achieved by individual schools, even the most resourced and resourceful ones. It requires collaboration, intra and inter-university, close and arm's length collaboration, and partnerships with business but also with the public sector, with the polity (the third sector) and with all key constituents of the supporting ecosystem, such as accreditors.</p><p>It also requires discipline-based interdisciplinary. Despite praise heaped on multi and interdisciplinary behaviour, the reality on the ground remains that these are not rewarded, incentivised or facilitated. They are very few if any inter-disciplinary journals, conferences and accreditation bodies.</p><p>Arguably, inter-disciplinarily works best when each participant is an expert in his or her discipline and learns from each other - not when everyone is a jack-of-all trades and knows a little about everything. While there is need for the rare neo-renaissance multi-expert individual and for \"communication facilitators\", more often than not reality and expanding knowledge calls for specialisation, division of labour and co-operation.</p><p>It is unlikely that the above can be effected with the same modalities as before. For one, the scale may be prohibiting to all but the very few. This requires genuine intra- and inter-university partnerships and deep thinking about what makes good for purpose structures and business models. It also requires accreditors adapting to the new reality. And it requires business education itself not committing euthanasia by undermining the development of the very subject matters on which its continuing sustainable success depends.</p><p>The closures of liberal arts, philosophy, economics and sociology departments on financial grounds kills the goose that lays the golden egg. Business educators should be prepared and willing to keep subsidising the subjects that helped them succeed .</p><p>I will close with a call to bring back the good old book. In my area (strategic international business and organisation) virtually most key ideas emanated from a handful of classic books on economics by Joe Bain, Edith Penrose, Cyert and March, Nelson and Winter, Oliver Williamson and Stephen Hymer.</p><p>In part this is because exploring adequately a single overarching and fungible argument and its implications requires space, time-frame and method that are poorly aligned to elite journal publications. With few exceptions, such as the resource and capabilities based view, the record of management scholars in coming up with new theory is lamentable.

In her words:\"They are not expected to take a significant share of the market from the biggest banks.\"Whether or not this specific group takes market share, the threat facing incumbents from new competition, regulation and innovation is real.To take a look at how we got here let's rewind to 2007. Nearly ten years ago, on 9th August that year, the European Central Bank injected almost euro;100bn into the European banking system, after problems emerged in the sub-prime mortgage sector.The banking crisis sent shockwaves running through the world's largest banks that still reverberate today.In response to the crisis, central banks across the globe cut interest rates to near zero. For many years now, this is where they have remained.Low interest rates have placed significant pressure on bank margins. </p><p>Coupled with higher compliance costs and increased capital requirements, this has pushed European post-crisis bank returns below their cost of equity.At the same time, a new wave of start-ups, enabled by technology and a healthy appetite from venture capital investors, have emerged to challenge individual parts of the financial services value chain.Everywhere a bank looks across its product offering, it is fighting new competition from a fintech company.The challenge posed to banks by new technology and regulation is about to go up a gear. Business models of incumbent banks are coming under significant threat.For years, successive UK Governments have puzzled over how to stimulate competition in the banking industry. While there is still debate on issues such as data privacy and customer consent, we anticipate the government's wish will finally be fulfilled. Competition in the banking sector will explode as a result.New, so-called 'open banking' regulations are coming into force in the UK and across Europe with the objective of stimulating further competition in the banking sector.This is a marriage of two very dangerous business opportunities\u00a0- new regulation and new technology - which will combine to reform banks' business models.The old world of 'closed banking' involves a single bank entity producing and distributing a wide range of commoditised financial products to apathetic customers that see little value in switching providers.The new world of 'open banking' means competition for both who provides the products, and who distributes them.Increased competition can't just be driven by technology and regulation. Customers have to want change as well.Switching rates may have been slow to date, but our data suggests a strong appetite for change.We asked consumers what might induce them to move banks and the most striking thing about what they told us was the sheer breadth of ideas that customers would embrace.For example, over a third told us they would switch banks if a competitor offered compelling biometric driven app access and security. And nearly half said deals and offers tailored to their personal circumstances would get them to switch.New propositions are already emerging to fill these gaps and whilst customers already have an idea of which new services might be valuable to them, it is worth remembering that famous Henry Ford quote about the invention of the motor car:\"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said 'faster horses'\".We can't necessarily predict what new innovations will transform the world of banking, or what great services of tomorrow will change the way we manage our money. But we do know that change is coming and banks must respond.Banks must decide what role they want to play in the lives of their customers.Our view is that the most likely future for banking is a new model, where customers can be offered the products of different providers from a single interface.What is less clear to us, is which companies are best placed to own that interface.There are compelling reasons why incumbent banks could fill this role. They have the trust of their customers, they understand financial regulations, and they have unparalleled insight into customers' financial history.However, there are equally compelling reasons why big tech giants, start-ups, or even price comparison websites might be better placed to take the lead role.The bank of the future is just around the corner. It won't look like the banks we know today. It won't talk like the banks we know today. It might not even be a bank we know today.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

First, I realised that I need to embrace the fact that there will be no such thing as a \u2018going ...</p><p>\u2018NORMAL\u2019 IS NOW AN OXYMORON   After 7 months of riding the pandemic rollercoaster, I recently experienced some penny-drop moments that I wanted to share with you. First, I realised that I need to embrace the fact that there will be no such thing as a \u2018going back to normal\u2019. This is a reset not a mere bump in the road, it\u2019s a pivot point not a mere interruption. There will only be many parallel 'new normals' - and they will differ widely depending on where we are located (Switzerland, in my case), what economic situation we\u2019re in and whether our political leadership is capable or not. There is no uniform response to this crisis and the challenges it presents us with, and no \u2018AI\u2019 will provide us with meaningful advise on the tough social, cultural or political issues we are now facing.    The very word \u2018normal\u2019 has become kind of useless, and the idea of \u2018business as usual\u2019 is becoming laughable, as well. Instead, attempting to \u2018 pivot \u2019 (switching horses in midstream) has become our new routine. Just ask AirBnB, Uber or Carnival Cruises, or any airline CEO, event organiser, restaurant owner or... futurist.          What\u2019s more, what used to be considered utopian, slightly far-out or simply impossible prior to Covid-19 is now becoming a common occurrence: helicopter money, stimulus programs, furlough payments, quasi-basic income support schemes, lock-downs and quarantine measures, tracking and tracing\u2026 the list goes on.     Forget \u2018impossible\u2019 along with \u2018normal\u2019 and reboot your world-views.    The Covid-19 crisis greatly accelerates what was already nascent before (the good and not so good), and we must therefore question our assumptions and take a wider view. Many previously cherished and well-honed revenue streams are evaporating. Think tourism, hotels, airlines, restaurants and conventions - and this is only the tip of the iceberg. Utter disruption is happening to my own business, as well: speaking at large events all over the globe is clearly not a very promising business model these days. It\u2019s all virtual, remote, video and in the cloud now, like it or not. Real-life is out.    We are shifting our thinking and adjusting to a world with/post-corona, and in many cases, \u2018impossible\u2019 is no longer taken for granted. This new narrative causes considerable political tensions (as evidenced in the U.S. right now), and will be a key driver of geopolitics in the years to come. I foresee that it will also trigger dramatic action on climate-change adaptation and mitigation, finally. This may be wishful-thinking as far as Brazil, India and Russia is concerned, for now - but on the other hand Europe is emerging as a \u2018green recovery\u2019 leader which I find very promising. And the U.S.? Anything could happen\u2026 but I have hope for a \u2018great American pivot\u2019 in 2021.         PERMANENT VUCA AHEAD    I think we have to accept that this is a time of permanent transition and perpetual VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity), at least for the next 2-3 years but probably for the entire decade. Utter uncertainty will be the prevailing default, thus resilience, solidarity, compassion, hyper-collaboration and agility will be crucial. While I have sometimes struggled to maintain a positive outlook given this reality, the importance of real-life and human-to-human interaction has come sharply back into focus for me, as well. I have talked about this a lot in my last book, already, as well as in many of my now-virtual keynotes: Technology is fantastic, but we simply won\u2019t find real happiness (as opposed to a kind of digital hedonism which I guess can be a good start, too) on a screen, in the cloud, in VR or with an app. Because technology is not what we seek, but how we seek. Zoom calls are great but hugs are greater.    EXPECT MORE CORONA-COASTING    As we head into 2021, I forecast that instead of enjoying a solid and linear rebound trend we are likely to keep bouncing back and forth between different levels of \u2018much better and even worse\u2019 (such as with travel and meeting restrictions, social distancing, lock-downs and quarantines); even if and when a vaccine is available. This emotional and social \u2018CoronaCoaster\u2019 will continue - so let\u2019s make sure we are ready to support each other, for the long haul.         CONSUMER CHANGES: WHATEVER WAS ALREADY NASCENT BECOMES REALLY BIG NOW    I have noticed that new consumer behaviours that are accelerated in this crisis (rather than initiated) tend to be a lot stickier, such as remote working, online learning, e-commerce and streaming media - and many of them are likely to become default habits. Generally, I sense that there is a definitive global acceleration towards digital-anything and \u2018remote-everything\u2019; albeit from very different local starting points (for example India and Brazil vs USA and EU). This trend could be heaven or it could be hell - all will depend on how we govern exponential technological progress. Determining a healthy and sustainable balance between the increasing capabilities of technology and our human needs (as well as our limitations) will be crucial. After all, \"technology is morally neutral until we use it\" (as William Gibson stated a long time ago).    Many consumers are now quickly trying new things but all too often are not having really great experiences (witness Zoom-fatigue, WFH challenges etc), or simply aren't quite ready to embrace - and learn - these new tools fully, hence they may return to their pre-pandemic patterns as soon as they can. And let\u2019s not forget that how exactly consumers respond to these \u2018new normals\u2019 will remain subject to their specific cultural and societal context (e.g. Brazilians and Italians now seem more inclined to tune out sustainability as a priority , while Germans and French are not). Culture still eats technology for breakfast.    INEQUALITY HAS ONCE AGAIN PROVEN DEADLY    Societies with deeply rooted inequality issues (such as the USA, Brazil and South Africa) have become even more polarised in this crisis, as the well-off can easily protect themselves while the lesser-fortunate have to do whatever it takes to get by. A \u2018K-shaped\u2019 recession would mean that things may look up again, soon, for the top 10% while more misery is awaiting everyone else - this would not bode well for the future.    I have, however, observed that the traditional forms of capitalism, the \u2018free-markets\u2019 principle and the underlying economic logic in general are being increasingly questioned, particularly by the millennials. New paradigms such as stakeholder (not just shareholder) value and people-planet-purpose-prosperity are starting to take hold (witness the recent launch of Long Term Stock Exchange ), and sustainable capitalism (or as we frame that term here in Europe, social capitalism ) finally arrives on the agenda again.    NEW PARADIGMS AND SHIFTING PRIORITIES: THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION    This Great Transformation is vastly accelerated by Covid-19 as the pandemic brings out both the best in us and the worst in us. It\u2019s causing a shake-up in our hierarchy of needs and their respective importance (for example, spending on travel is down while spending on health and wellness is up). The world is being reshuffled.         TECHNOLOGY IS THE WINNER - BUT \u2018TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING\u2019 IS A REAL AND PRESENT DANGER    The big winners of this crisis are (and will continue to be): big tech and big media, big health, big state and big government, and (maybe) big green. Technology is clearly super-important now, and offers exciting new possibilities to help us with this crisis, such as online collaboration and remote teamwork. As long as we are mindful of the lure of \u2018become super-human, transcend human-limitations!\u2019 and Silicon Valley\u2019s shiny \u2018singularity traps\u2019 (see below) I think we can look forward to many exciting innovations in the years to come.    On my end, I can\u2019t wait to buy a ticket for a holographic trip right here at the Swiss counter at Zurich airport, and then hop into a Million-Dollar setup that transports me safely to Beijing just in time for my next keynote, and back home in time for dinner.     I am going deeper down the rabbit-hole of cool technology every day, myself (witness my virtual keynote studio setup ), and ever more dependent on technology. Yet at the same time I am deeply concerned about the dehumanising perils of \u2018 too much of a good thing \u2019. Looking at Elon Musk\u2019s latest Neuralink explorations or Facebook\u2019s (Oculus) VR fake nirvana I often wonder whose job it will be to make sure that all this exponential technological progress remains humanly sustainable and yes, healthy .          One thing is for sure: the explosive rise of platform capitalism and the increasingly corrosive dominance of algorithmic media (aka \u2018social networks\u2019) must and will be tackled in 2021. Technology regulation will certainly be on top of the agenda for the next few years, everywhere, and wise (technology) leaders will embrace it. Side-note: Don\u2019t miss the brand-new \u2018Social Dilemma\u2019 film on Netflix, and read my previous Forbes post on \u2018 The New Human Renaissance \u2019.    GREAT LEADERS WE CAN TRUST    The role of the state, and government in general has exploded during this crisis, and it has become clear that if we can't trust that our leaders and our government officials know what to do (and to actually do the right thing ), emergency situations tend to get much worse, quickly.  Strong, informed, clear-haded and science-based as well as compassionate leadership is now utterly essential, and it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that countries led by women such as New Zealand, Iceland, Taiwan, Finland, Germany and Switzerland have fared much better in dealing with this crisis. Faith in leaders is turning out to be crucial in flattening the infection curve, and reducing fatalities.    My personal bottom line is this: I am learning many good lessons during this crisis. I am questioning many outdated assumptions. I am rethinking my own narratives. I am adapting and practicing my pivots, and I am refocussing on what really matters.    Maybe the future is indeed \u2018better than we think\u2019.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43185283200</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60Y8-G331-JCSC-J40Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1731\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 28, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp; MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DOIB</classCode><className>UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001333</classCode><className>PLATFORMS &amp; ISSUES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST0009S6Z</classCode><className>INCOME ASSISTANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001482</classCode><className>RESTAURANTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>N481100CC</classCode><className>AIRLINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

I recognize that no decision about fall quarter has been made yet, and I know that much rests on how the spread of coronavirus and the testing and tracing situation in California changes over the summer. Nevertheless, regardless of how COVID-19 develops, I strongly believe that the start of the academic year should not be pushed back to January. Instead, classes should resume on time, whether online, in person or a combination of both. This is why:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Disproportionate damage to rising juniors' and seniors' careers</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am a rising senior. This summer was the last summer that my class could complete a full-time internship before we graduated without interrupting our academic schedules. Many employers care deeply about what you did the summer before you graduated, and if you have a gap in your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in the summer before you graduate, they will not even consider you for a full-time job.</p><p>My internship for this summer was cancelled, and my backup summer internship is on hold. Just in between April 20-22, I've read numerous LinkedIn posts from rising juniors and seniors whose internships at private companies were cancelled at the same moment when most companies had implemented hiring freezes.</p><p>While the internship cancellations negatively impact all undergraduates, they have a disproportionate impact on the classes of 2021 and 2022. A lot of us will want to make up for our lost summer by doing an internship in summer 2021, or need a summer 2021 internship to get started in their career. Now, it is possible to take a gap quarter next summer and graduate a quarter later. But I am not optimistic that organizations will adjust their full-time hiring timelines to accommodate schools that have changed their schedule to a winter-spring-summer cycle. Institutions like Harvard, Princeton, UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego have already announced that they are not cancelling the fall. Many others across the country intend to resume some form of instruction this fall. Why should organizations make an exception for Stanford students? They have already enough qualified candidates to draw from.</p><p>More than that, compelling students to make up fall 2020 by taking classes in summer 2021 would jeopardize Stanford-run summer programs, like SIG fellowships, Haas fellowships, Stanford Global Studies internships, BOSP overseas internship programs, Stanford SEED and research programs such as Bio-X, Summer Research College, Chappell-Lougee Scholarships and UAR's Major Grants. These experiences have been critical and formative for students looking toward public service, international careers and research careers. Jeopardizing these opportunities will limit students' chances to explore their interests at an institution where many already feel the pressure to go into consulting, finance or big tech. And it would derail the careers of undergraduates for whom these unique opportunities - all of which you cannot find outside Stanford - could have opened doors.</p><p>Mental health consequences</p><p>In the three weeks between undergraduates being sent home and spring classes starting, I nearly went insane. I tried to keep myself busy with all kinds of things - working on a short story, translating some Russian music, video calling with my friends. But inevitably, I spent most of my day \"doomscrolling\" through social media. Ultimately, those three weeks of idleness in the midst of a global crisis hurt my mental health. Only now, having settled into my spring quarter routine, am I starting to regain my mental composure.</p><p>I cannot imagine what will happen if I have to spend 10 more weeks sitting at home watching the world burn and scraping around for ways to stay busy. It's been demonstrated that in times of stress, humans psychologically cope by developing a routine and staying occupied. There are ways to get involved in one's community while quarantined at home: deliver groceries, sew masks, volunteer at the food bank. But these options are very limited, and many are not possible to students who do not have sewing supplies at home or cannot risk spreading the virus to elderly or immunocompromised family members.</p><p>Of course, what works for my mental health will not work for everyone. Many students will benefit from a break from coursework in the fall. Nevertheless, the administration would do unwisely to cancel fall in the name of mental health - one-size-fits-all approaches seldom work on something as complicated and individual as mental health. Without a doubt, students who know they need time off should be permitted to take a gap quarter free of the worry that it may hurt their financial aid or academic standing. But those whose mental health depends on finding a routine and staying occupied should also have the option of taking classes at Stanford, without needing to temporarily transfer to another university or struggle to piece together another routine.</p><p>Undergraduate, graduate student and faculty equity</p><p>Arguments in favor of student choice introduce the problem of equity. As the ASSU Executive Board said regarding this spring's grading options, \"any policy that is optional will inevitably end up disproportionately benefiting students who are experiencing relative privilege.\" If Stanford brings back fall classes, then no matter what happens, FLI students will be hurt - online classes raise the problem of access, while in-person classes may lead students who cannot afford to take the quarter off to disproportionately put themselves at risk. Besides, the question of grading equity would rear its head if classes are fully online, with the stakes even higher because making a second quarter S/NC could threaten the rigor of Stanford's academics.</p><p>These inequities are real, and they are a major problem. But cancelling fall classes would not eliminate those inequities and would instead create a new set. For one, the impact on job and internship recruiting disproportionately affects FLI and other students who need to gain financial independence or start supporting their families as soon as possible. For them, getting a job one quarter earlier would make a huge difference. Moreover, taking six consecutive quarters - winter-spring-summer, followed by a traditional academic year in 2021-22 - may produce a mental health toll for students who need the summer to recuperate. This toll would accrue disproportionately to students who need to get a job as soon as possible.</p><p>Crucial sources of university financial support would also come into peril. Right now, the Financial Aid Office is providing housing and living support to students enrolled in classes. But an information sheet on their website says they cannot provide any support other than Cardinal Care scholarships to students on leaves of absence. If students cannot take classes this fall, then whether the Financial Aid Office can continue providing living support is unclear - a cruel irony in a time when students need financial support the most.</p><p>Cancelling fall quarter wouldn't just pose problems to undergraduates - it would also put the financial situations of teaching faculty and graduate students at risk. My economics core professors and Russian language teachers are full-time lecturers. Since they don't do research, their employment depends completely on their ability to teach. If fall classes are cancelled, can I trust Stanford to furlough them with full pay and benefits? Maybe, but I find it hard to trust an institution that has stubbornly refused to support its service workers through this crisis. Even if classes are all online, then at least our teaching faculty can be assured to keep some of their salary and benefits through the fall. That all becomes uncertain if classes are completely cancelled.</p><p>Likewise, many graduate students' funding depends on their ability to work as teaching assistants. What happens to their funding if there are no classes to TA? Stanford already severely underpaid graduate students when the economy was growing. Now the pandemic has put the academic job market into turmoil and eliminated significant sources of summer income for graduate students. I am not optimistic that Stanford will guarantee the same level of financial support for graduate students if TAships are eliminated this fall. Even if classes are held online this fall, at least graduate students will have the chance to keep their TAships and hold on to a sliver of certainty in the midst of a devastating economic crisis.</p><p>I do not know what the most equitable solution is. Every possible solution, from fully in-person classes to no classes at all, will produce a different mix of inequities. But Stanford should not fool itself into thinking that cancelling fall classes would solve the problem of inequities. If fall classes are cancelled, then the university needs to commit to protecting the livelihoods of faculty, graduate students, and service workers, not to mention ensure that undergraduates can keep receiving financial support. Stanford has to realize that it cannot escape this great unequalizer that is the pandemic.</p><p>Sustainable solutions</p><p>Researchers say physical distancing will probably need to continue in some capacity until 2021 or even 2022. If we cancel fall quarter, for instance in the hopes that we can bring everyone back on campus by winter, then what's the plan if physical distancing measures are still in place by winter? Are we going to push back classes for another quarter? Are we going to push back classes indefinitely until physical distancing measures are lifted?</p><p>Pushing back classes is not a sustainable long-term solution to the issue of how residential colleges are going to cope in the age of physical distancing. \"Zoom University\" is greatly inferior to the full residential experience of Stanford, but no university at all is still worse than Zoom University. If we push back fall quarter classes only for winter quarter to be held online or highly regulated anyway, then what would be the point of cancelling fall?</p><p>It's hard to propose concrete alternatives right now, since no one knows what the spread of the virus or the testing situation will look like this fall. To its credit, the administration is moving cautiously. Although President Marc Tessier-Levigne has not confirmed or denied that fall could be cancelled altogether, he has noted that the fall quarter options range from fully in-person to fully online classes. I am grateful that the administration is considering all the options at Stanford's disposal.</p><p>Regardless of what happens, I think it is reasonable to ask that Stanford give students the option to take classes in the fall. I understand that that allows for the possibility that we may have another online-only quarter, with its nest of problems. However, the coronavirus is not going away any time soon. If the administration takes an all-or-nothing approach to the Stanford experience, we will almost certainly be left with nothing.</p><p>If Stanford wants to encourage students to take the fall quarter off, they can do so without completely cancelling fall courses. Classes can be added to the 2021 Summer Session, with financial aid expanded to cover summer classes and eliminate summer contributions for 2021. Honors programs can revise timelines so that seniors missing fall quarter can still complete their thesis in three quarters. And students should be given extended time to consider whether to take a gap quarter and be guaranteed that their financial aid will stay with them if they take the fall off. But those who need or prefer to take classes this fall should be able to resume their studies. As much as I love and cherish the residential part of a Stanford education, I do not believe we should sacrifice academic continuity, career exploration or students' mental health in the faint hopes that fully residential education might resume in winter 2021. I implore Stanford to do its part and, at the very least, not exacerbate the tolls already being inflicted by the virus.</p><p>Contact Tiffany Zhu at tzhu10 'at' stanford.edu</p><p>The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.

Shaman. In the piece, Professor Shaman argued that the newfangled technology for displaying phone numbers of incoming calls \"may have disastrous consequences,\" including deterring people \"from calling crisis centers that deal with suicide, rape, child abuse or AIDS for fear of having their identities revealed.\" He also warned that \"psychiatrists, doctors, social workers and lawyers will not be able to return emergency calls from home... Victims of domestic violence will not be able to call spouses or their children...People will be discouraged from making anonymous calls to the police to report crime.\" </p><p><br/>Civil libertarians and privacy advocates also sounded the alarm about the dangers of knowing the phone numbers of incoming calls. Deborah Ellis, the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of New Jersey, said \"banks and other lenders could use the service to discriminate against callers from poor areas.\"Others questioned the motives behind the companies deploying the new technology. Marc Rotenberg, then-director of the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, said, \"This is a case of a company that has a great deal of personal information making money exploiting the sale of that information without the consent of the phone subscriber. Three years ago if a phone company employee had talked about selling someone's phone number to a business, they would have been fired.\"<br/>The apocalypse was nigh, and the fifth Horseman was... Caller ID.<br/>None of these worries came to pass, of course. Telephone systems added the ability to block Caller ID on a per-call basis by dialing *67 before the phone number, heading off most of the potential privacy harms. As for the greedy telephone companies, it is now common for phone contracts to bundle Caller ID into the standard service price at no additional cost. <br/>Many new technologies go through this \"privacy panic cycle\" (e.g., RFID tags, cameras, loyalty cards). It often begins with advocacy groups - such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT), Access Now, and others - feeding the natural tendency of media outlets to exaggerate the risks associated with a new technology because audiences love negative news (\"if it bleeds, it leads\"). As the frenzy escalates, headlines start to declare that the sky is falling. Then, despite the Chicken Little omens, fears begin to diminish over time as reality sets in. The cycle ends - not with a bang, but a whimper - as consumer appreciation of the new technology or service proves the deciding factor in its ultimate widespread adoption.<br/>Privacy Fundamentalism Is a Moral Panic<br/>Sources: Privacy indexes: a survey of Westin's studies; Choice Architecture and Smartphone Privacy: There's A Price for That; and Would a privacy fundamentalist sell their DNA for $1000 ... if nothing bad happened as a result? The Westin categories, behavioral intentions, and consequences<br/>\"Privacy\" is not a term that anyone uses in a negative way. Like money or liberty, it is good by definition; more is better, less is worse. But humans have a multiplicity of values and differing hierarchies - more privacy is not always better when it comes at the expense of another good. That's what makes privacy scholar Alan Westin's privacy segmentation index (PSI), which categorizes people's privacy attitudes as \"pragmatists,\" \"fundamentalists,\" or \"unconcerned\" a useful tool in peering through the often-hysterical nature of the public debate surrounding privacy.<br/>Contrary to the popular narrative, most Americans do not place a high value on their privacy for non-sensitive information, such as purchasing habits or online browsing histories. (However, people do value keeping sensitive information such as health or financial records private.) In surveys over the last few decades, about 50 to 65 percent of Americans are privacy pragmatists, meaning they continually evaluate the trade-offs associated with sharing private information, and make decisions on a case-by-case basis. To be clear, this does not mean they're all reading the legalese in privacy policies - they simply use heuristics to make disclosure decisions.<br/>Source: Pew Research Center<br/>Roughly 10 percent of Americans are privacy unconcerned, which Westin quipped as willing to \"give you any information you want about their family, their lifestyle, their travel plans, and so forth\" for a 5-cent discount. In one experiment, the vast majority of participants were willing to reveal their monthly income to a video rental store in exchange for a one euro discount on a DVD (without the discount, about half still shared this private information in exchange for no benefit). A different study found that most subjects would happily sell their personal information for just 25 cents, and almost all of them waived their right to shield their information.<br/>The remaining 25 to 35 percent of Americans are privacy fundamentalists - those with an ideological commitment to privacy, claiming they would never trade their privacy for economic benefits (even if they often do in practice). This group also wants stronger privacy laws to prevent companies from acquiring anyone's personal information.<br/>In 2001 testimony before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Westin summarized his catalog of research and direct experience with dozens of national privacy surveys going back to 1979 by saying:<br/>American consumers, by large majorities, want all the benefits and opportunities of a consumer service society and of a market-driven social system... We know that a majority of the American public does not favor the European Union style of omnibus national privacy legislation and a national privacy regulatory agency, but when it comes to sensitive information such as financial information or health information, overwhelming majorities are looking to legislative protections to set the rules and the standards for that kind of activity.<br/>According to more recent surveys, not much has changed in the intervening years. As the charts below show, privacy concerns in the United States have, if anything, decreased over time.<br/>Source: National Telecommunications and Information Administration<br/>Source: National Telecommunications and Information Administration<br/>A recent paper in the Journal of Economic Literature summarized the theoretical and empirical research on the economics of privacy, concluding:<br/>Extracting economic value from data and protecting privacy do not need to be antithetical goals. The economic literature we have examined clearly suggests that the extent to which personal information should be protected or shared to maximize individual or societal welfare is not a one-size-fits-all problem: the optimal balancing of privacy and disclosure is very much context-dependent, and it changes from scenario to scenario. [emphasis added] <br/>In the past, privacy fundamentalists and advocacy organizations have relied on the media and our natural predilections to focus on the negative to push a misleading narrative that does a great disservice to evidence-based policy debates. Now, in the ongoing debate over passing prescriptive baseline privacy regulations, they have a powerful new ally: Big Tech.<br/>Big Tech Bootleggers and Privacy Baptists<br/>In 1983, Bruce Yandel, the executive director of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), wrote an article in which he coined the term \"bootleggers and Baptists\" to describe regulations that are supported by a coalition with both virtuous and venal interests. In his canonical example, he observed that bootleggers supported laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol on Sundays because they were good for business; Baptists, on the other hand, were in favor of the same laws for moral or religious reasons. This kind of diverse coalition can prove very effective in passing and maintaining welfare-reducing regulations.<br/>When European Commissioner V?ra Jourov\u00e1 traveled to Silicon Valley last year to meet with American tech firms, including Google and Facebook, she expected to hear grumbling about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's new baseline privacy law. Instead, she said, \"They were more relaxed, and I became more nervous. They have the money, an army of lawyers, an army of technicians and so on.\" Compliance with GDPR would not be a problem for Big Tech.<br/>During a recent Senate hearing, Keith Enright, Google's chief privacy officer, gave a clue as to why that's the case. He estimated that the company spent \"hundreds of years of human time\" to comply with the new privacy rules. \u00a0The Global Fortune 500 will spend an estimated $7.8 billion in compliance costs for GDPR. \u00a0While these are significant costs to Big Tech, they also represent regulatory barriers to entry for small- and medium-sized enterprises trying to become the next Facebook or Apple.<br/>Big Tech has entered into a \"bootleggers and Baptists\" coalition with privacy fundamentalist groups to support new omnibus regulations in the United States. Last month, the Information Technology Industry Council - the lobbying group for, among others, Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft - \u00a0released its policy framework which was \"inspired\" by GDPR and sought to \"create alignment with the privacy protections of other privacy regimes across the globe.\" \u00a0In a keynote speech two days later in Brussels, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, \"We should celebrate the transformative work of the European institutions tasked with the successful implementation of the GDPR ... It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead.\" At the same conference, Facebook's chief privacy officer said the company would \"unequivocally\" support an American version of GDPR.<br/>From the perspective of multinational incumbent technology firms, this is the rational position to take on privacy regulation. Since the European market is large and regulatory compliance costs are fixed, it is often more efficient for global corporations to comply with European regulations everywhere than it would be to meet the local regulatory minimum in each market. This phenomenon where Europe becomes the de facto global regulator via market mechanisms is known as the \"Brussels effect.\" (When this occurs domestically, it's known as the \"California effect\"). Incumbents lobbying to spread de jure GDPR-style regulations to other countries is an obvious strategy to prevent would-be rivals from entering the market. <br/>Regulation is among the most effective ways of raising a rival's cost. Indeed, economists Avi Goldfarb and Catherine Tucker found that smaller and more general websites were hit the hardest in the wake of European privacy regulation in the late 2000s. Evidence from the first six months of GDPR show that Google and Facebook have been winners relative to smaller competitors:<br/>Source: Cliqz<br/>The United States Is Not the Wild West of Privacy<br/>Some have claimed that the United States is the \"Wild West of privacy.\" This is a curious position considering \"there are literally hundreds of laws relating to privacy and data protection in the [United States] - including common law torts, criminal laws, evidentiary privileges, federal statutes, and state laws.\" As the Association of National Advertisers detailed in recent comments to the FTC, the United States has sector- and age-based privacy regulation:<br/>The Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") regulates certain health data; the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\") regulates the use of consumer data for eligibility purposes; the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\") addresses personal information collected online from children; and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"GLBA\") focuses on consumers' financial privacy; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") enforces a variety of anti-discrimination laws in the workplace including the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (\"PDA\") and American with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"); the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\") protects against discrimination in housing; and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\"ECOA\") protects against discrimination in mortgage and other forms of lending. <br/>Additionally, the FTC has broad discretionary authority to police \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" and to \"seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers.\" The Commission, which is known as \"America's top cop on the privacy beat,\" has brought more than 500 enforcement actions on privacy- and security-related issues since 1998.<br/>If this is the Wild West, then the sheriff is doing a pretty good job keeping the outlaws at bay.<br/>Privacy Rights: Some Tradeoffs and Unintended Consequences<br/>While some have applauded specific rights in the GDPR, there are real consequences. \u00a0A right to be forgotten, by its nature, is in direct conflict with free speech. For example, an email is a piece of shared data between two parties. If one party wants it to be \"forgotten\" and the other party wants to keep it, whose right should prevail? Furthermore, for criminal records and other socially-relevant information, the public has a right to know that might trump someone's right to erase it from the Internet. In the EU, convicted scammers and sex offenders have already exploited the right to be forgotten to scrub records of their crimes from websites and search engines. Combined with the right to explanation, the right to be forgotten might also be a regulatory death blow for blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies in Europe.<br/>Rules that place strict limits on how data is used are antithetical to innovation in the age of Big Data. Purpose specification and data minimization rules assume that businesses know all the valuable products and services that can be built using customer data prior to acquiring those customers. Machine learning algorithms, for example, might be able to use an old dataset for a new purpose that creates real value, as some examples in the medical field show. Biomedical researchers have voiced concerns that GDPR \"will make it harder to share information across borders or outside their original research context.\" The Danish Cancer Society study that found no link between mobile phone use and cancer rates used data that was initially collected for a different purpose and probably would have been illegal to conduct in a post-GDPR world.<br/>The right of data portability increases what cybersecurity researchers call the \"attack surface\" by creating additional access points for bad actors to gain access to a network. The Cambridge Analytica scandal was a classic example of data falling into the wrong hands because it was too portable. Data breach notification rights with arbitrarily short deadlines (e.g., within 72 hours) for public disclosure also create perverse incentives. As Alex Stamos, a former chief security officer of Facebook, noted, firms are incentivized to announce the maximum number of users potentially impacted, which spreads undue panic before an investigation can determine who - if anyone - was actually harmed. Additionally, notification rules can hinder coordination with law enforcement and prevent opportunities for gathering information material to identifying and punishing those responsible. In another unintended consequence, a hacker got access to someone's Spotify account and used the right to access to demand a file with all of their account data.<br/>The impact can be best seen in what isn't there. New data from researchers at the Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland has found that post-GDPR, European startups have seen \"a $3.38 million decrease in the aggregate dollars raised, a 17.6% reduction in the number of weekly venture deals, and a 39.6% decrease in the amount raised\" relative to their United States counterparts. A survey released last week by Merrill Corp. reported that \"fifty-five percent of respondents said they had worked on deals that fell apart because of concerns about a target company's data protection policies and compliance with GDPR.\" A separate study by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP last month found that \"fewer than half of international companies worth $100 million or more said they are fully prepared to comply with GDPR.\" These are costs preventing new activity or market entry, but what about the companies that operated in Europe before the law took effect?<br/>Since GDPR went into effect in May, numerous companies have shut down or left the European market due to compliance costs and liability risks. Most of the affected companies offered free or low-cost services that were subsidized by advertisements. GDPR's rules mandating \"opt-in\" consent from users made these ad-based business models unviable. Losses were concentrated in the news, marketing, and video game industries (as shown in the table below). As of November 9th, at least 1,133 news sites based in the United States are still unavailable in the EU due to GDPR. Prices on independent ad exchanges in Europe fell between 25 and 40 percent in the days after the law went into effect.<br/>The statistics regarding the economic impact of GDPR are unambiguous: Compliance costs for firms in the United States with more than 500 employees are estimated to reach up to $150 billion. At least 75,000 new \"Data Protection Officers\" will need to be hired as a result of the law. The annual direct welfare loss per EU household due to increased prices from GDPR is estimated to be between $700 and $4,000. And to date, over 42,000 complaints have been filed with the European Data Protection Board.<br/>In a recent Boston Globe article about California's new GDPR-style law, technology columnist Hiawatha Bray said: <br/>Perhaps strong privacy regulations will prevent the rise of \"the next Facebook,\" but is that a bad thing? Maybe new regulations will result in fewer companies hitting me up for sensitive data. But I'd rather have one or two huge companies tracking me than 20 or 30 smaller ones. There are fewer opportunities for data breaches that way, and it's easier to sue when something goes wrong.<br/>It's refreshing to hear a privacy fundamentalist clarify what is really at stake with these types of broad-based privacy rules, even if we disagree on which outcome is preferable. Yes, preventing the rise of the next Facebook is a bad thing - especially if you dislike how the current Facebook is behaving. <br/>People Care About Privacy. And Convenience, and Choice, and Affordability, and...<br/>In the United States, the right to privacy is implicit in the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and (arguably) Ninth Amendments to the Constitution. However, even if we proclaim privacy to be a fundamental human right that transcends our founding documents, that endowment neither determines the wisdom of different policy proposals that would regulate the flow of information nor limits how individuals should be able to trade in those rights. As Eli Noam, professor of finance and economics at Columbia University, points out, \"A right is merely an initial allocation. It may be acquired without a charge and be universally distributed regardless of wealth, but it is in the nature of humans ... to exchange what they have for what they want. ... Whether we like it or not, people continuously trade in rights.\" <br/>In practice, people often trade the right to privacy for more convenience, lower prices, or greater choice. Tiffany Morris, vice president of global privacy at Lotame, pointed out how California's recent GDPR-style privacy law missed this important feature: <br/>There seems to be an illogical presumption that providing data to companies for marketing purposes creates a special kind of jeopardy for privacy. Yet consumers give away personal data every day - to banks, credit card companies, gyms, community centers, grocery stores and even automated toll takers. There is less scrutiny for those categories, likely because the data is required for the related transactions to function properly. The use of data for marketing and media also serves a legitimate interest, but it seems to be viewed as inherently reckless by regulators, legislators, and privacy vigilantes.<br/>In practice, the trade-offs and choices that users make every day demonstrate that they view privacy as tradeable and, indeed, valuable for marketing and media purposes. In a recent paper, economists from Stanford and MIT noted that:<br/>Whenever privacy requires additional effort or comes at the cost of a less smooth user experience, participants are quick to abandon technology that would offer them greater protection. This suggests that privacy policy and regulation has to be careful about regulations that inadvertently lead consumers to be faced with additional effort or a less smooth experience in order to make a privacy-protective choice.<br/>In other words, as much as some might pretend otherwise, there is no free lunch when it comes to prescriptive privacy regulations.<br/>We Need a Pragmatic Approach to Privacy<br/>Instead of a fanatical commitment to privacy, we need a moderate, balanced approach to policy that accounts for the entire constellation of American values, including free speech and economic prosperity. For each policy decision, which values dominate will vary depending on context. It will be a messy, complex process to figure this out (\"the slow boring of hard boards\"). But figure it out we must, because a pluralistic society demands pluralistic values.<br/>Privacy fundamentalists live in a \"clean and well-lit prison of one idea.\" They believe we should always prioritize safeguarding privacy over accelerating innovation or increasing economic growth. That is not the policy strategy the United States has followed in the past to become the world leader in the digital economy, and it won't be the one that leads to prosperity in the future. Opportunity is calling, let's not panic.<br/>This essay was adapted from a recent series of regulatory comments.<br/>Read the full comments to the NTIA on consumer privacy here.<br/>Read the full comments to the FTC on privacy, big data, and competition here.<br/>Read the full comments to the FTC on AI and consumer welfare here.<br/>Endnotes<br/>Tsai, J., Cranor, L., Acquisti, A., &amp; Fong, C. (2006). What's it to you? a survey of online privacy concerns and risks.<br/>The questions are as follows:<br/>Consumers have lost all control over how personal information is collected and used by companies. (Strongly disagree = 0 to Strongly Agree = 6)<br/>Most businesses handle the personal information they collect about consumers in a proper and confidential way. (Strongly disagree = 0 to Strongly Agree = 6)<br/>Existing laws and organizational practices provide a reasonable level of protection for consumer privacy today. (Strongly disagree = 0 to Strongly Agree = 6)<br/>Participants are classified into three categories: privacy fundamentalists, privacy pragmatists, and the privacy unconcerned. The descriptions of these categories are as follows (Harris, 2001):<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy Fundamentalists:</emphasis> At the maximum extreme of privacy concern, Privacy Fundamentalists are the most protective of their privacy. These consumers feel companies should not be able to acquire personal information for their organizational needs and think that individuals should be proactive in refusing to provide information. Privacy Fundamentalists also support stronger laws to safeguard an individual's privacy.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy Pragmatists:</emphasis> Privacy Pragmatists weigh the potential pros and cons of sharing information; evaluate the protections that are in place and their trust in the company or organization. After this, they decide whether it makes sense for them to share their personal information.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy Unconcerned:</emphasis> These consumers are the least protective of their privacy - they feel that the benefits they may receive from companies after providing information far outweigh the potential abuses of this information. Further, they do not favor expanded regulation to protect privacy.<br/>According to Westin's classification, privacy fundamentalists agree with statement 1 and disagree with statements 2 and 3. The privacy unconcerned disagree with statement 1 and agree with statements 2 and 3. The remaining respondents are privacy pragmatists.<br/>The post Against Privacy Fundamentalism in the United States appeared first on Niskanen Center.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-42941</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRM1-F03R-W0H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4064\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Niskanen, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Niskanen Center</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 19, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Uncategorized</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The cranes symbolize a building frenzy driven by an influx of high-paying tech jobs that most cities would envy -- but one that has also brought worsening traffic jams, soaring housing costs and tear-down threats to popular landmarks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The cranes themselves turned menacing on Saturday, when pieces of one came crashing down from atop a building being built for Google, killing two ironworkers who were involved with taking the crane apart and two passers-by on the busy street below. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Residents said on Sunday that they were withholding judgment until more is known about the cause of the accident, which happened on a day with erratic weather. But they are resigned to the reality that Seattle will be one giant construction site for the foreseeable future.</p><p>  ''It's the city of cranes,'' said Daniel Kahane, a violin teacher who lives on a boat on Lake Union, near the accident site. ''They are a necessity if we want to grow this city. I walk under them, but I do have my eyes to the sky.''</p><p>  The latest building craze was touched off largely by Amazon, which decided in 2007 to locate its headquarters in the South Lake Union district just north of downtown. Other big tech companies followed, and so many streets now have blocked lanes or closed sidewalks to accommodate construction that navigating parts of the core business district can feel like a game of Frogger.</p><p>  Tiara Jewell and her family used to live in South Lake Union, where she could count 16 cranes from her apartment window. But they moved after two buildings on either side of theirs were torn down to make way for large new ones. ''I was concerned about having to walk under the construction site, and with all the debris,'' Ms. Jewell said.</p><p>  She used to take precautions like crossing the street to stay away from building sites, she said, but ''it has become so ubiquitous, you can't avoid it.'' But now, she said, ''I shouldn't take anything for granted.''</p><p>  Ms. Jewell said she was a block away from the accident site a few hours before the crane fell down on Saturday, taking her son for vaccinations and then a doughnut afterward as a reward. When she heard about the accident, she was shaken.</p><p>  ''If everything is moving so fast, are we actually taking the time to make sure things are safe?'' she said.</p><p>  By Sunday morning, crews had cleared the crushed cars and crane debris from Mercer Street, a major thoroughfare that passes the accident site and connects to Interstate 5. Much of the equipment used for the cleanup was gone by late afternoon. Officials said Mercer Street may be reopened for the Monday evening commute.</p><p>  And overhead, construction crews were once again taking apart the stricken crane, lowering sections that flatbed trucks hauled away to a storage lot.</p><p>  King County officials have not released the names of the four people killed, but on Sunday, Seattle Pacific University, a Christian college a few miles north of downtown, said that one of them was Sarah Wong, a freshman who intended to major in nursing. She was in a car driving down Mercer Street that was struck by part of the falling crane.</p><p>  ''While we grieve the sudden and tragic loss of our precious student, we draw comfort from each other, our strong community of faith, and God's presence with us in times of sorrow,'' the school said in a statement.</p><p>  The Washington Department of Labor and Industries is responsible for investigating the accident. Tim Church, a spokesman for the department, said that when he reached the scene late Saturday, ''it looked like something had exploded.'' Machinery was strewn across the street, he said, and the roofs of cars had been ripped open by rescue workers to free people inside.</p><p>  Mr. Church said four companies would be involved in the investigation: GLY Construction, the general contractor on the building; Morrow Equipment, which owned the crane; Northwest TowerCrane Service, which was disassembling it; and Omega Rigging and Machinery Moving, whose mobile crane was being used to lower detached sections. ''You can see there are a lot of people involved, and it was very complex,'' he said.</p><p>  GLY said in a statement that it was ''heartbroken'' by the accident, and that it and its relevant subcontractors are ''cooperating fully with investigators and assisting the local authorities.''</p><p>  The state tightened the regulation of cranes after one collapsed in Bellevue in 2006, killing a Microsoft lawyer in his apartment. The state got more resources for overseeing cranes after that, but ''with 120 tower cranes and seven investigators, you can tell they are very busy all the time,'' Mr. Church said.</p><p>  It may be a while before the cause of Saturday's accident is determined. The 2006 investigation, which took roughly six months, ultimately cited faulty design of the crane's base.</p><p>  For years, much of South Lake Union was a hodgepodge of warehouses, car repair shops and light industry. Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, bought a lot of the land in the district and hoped to turn it into Seattle's version of Central Park, but the public voted down the plans. Mr. Allen's real estate company, Vulcan, then had ideas about developing it as a medical research center, before Amazon agreed to use much of the land for its headquarters campus.</p><p>  Drawn by the engineering and technical talent that Amazon and Microsoft built up in the region, more than a dozen other major tech companies have built major outposts in Seattle, including Facebook and Uber.</p><p>Google's Seattle headquarters was being developed by Vulcan on a prominent spot, the last available development site just south of Lake Union. People who regularly pass through the area had seen indications recently that the building was nearly finished and that Google would soon be moving in.</p><p>  Alex Watson, who operates a streetcar that passes by the building, said he saw last week that workers had hung a large, brightly colored logo for Google's cloud division on the facade.</p><p>  Mr. Watson said he had once trained to be a crane operator, so he was interested in cranes and had hoped on Saturday morning to catch glimpses of the big one on the Google building being dismantled. The horizontal boom was already down, he said, but by the time he had to move on, the vertical tower was still standing.</p><p>  Shaking his head on Sunday at the scale of the accident, he said, ''Imagine a semi-truck fell down off a 10-story building onto the street.''</p><p>  But the city has to keep building just the same, he said: ''It's life, it's what we need.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-830186190429</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0K-D391-DXY4-X0CH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1122\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/us/seattle-crane-collapse-accident.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/us/seattle-crane-collapse-accident.html</url><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 29, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DL7V</classCode><className>CRAFT &amp; TRADE WORKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp; CHRISTIANITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N230000CC</classCode><className>CONSTRUCTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N518112MM</classCode><className>WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009S2V</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000580</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000962</classCode><className>WEBSITES &amp; PORTALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001536</classCode><className>SEARCH ENGINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GX518</classCode><className>SEATTLE, WA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Pedro Tavares/Shutterstock.com[1]  Courtesy ofBhaskar Chakravorti[2], Tufts University[3] Smartphones, computers and social media platforms have become indispensable parts of modern life, but the technology companies that make them and write their software are under siege. In any given week, Facebook[4] or Google[5] or Amazon[6] does something to erode public trust in them. Now could be a moment for the industry to make good on Bill Gates's promise of technology to do good, by 'unlocking the innate compassion[7] we have for our fellow human beings' and improving the world - or Mark Zuckerberg's dream of building a 'new social infrastructure[8] to create the world we want for generations to come.' </p><p>Around the globe, countries and societies are falling behind[9] on reducing social inequalities and meeting goals for economic development and environmental sustainability. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change[10] is issuing increasingly dire warnings about the effects climate change will have on human life on Earth - the beginnings of which are already unfolding. I lead a major research initiative called The Digital Planet[11] at the Fletcher School at Tufts where we study how technology is changing lives and livelihoods around the world. Here is an outline of how technology giants or nimble startups could help make Gates's and Zuckerberg's promises a reality. Identify a big hairy problem There is a long list of global problems to combat, including hunger, drought, poverty, bad health, polluted water and poor sanitation. One that's connected to all the others is the recent bombshell news[12] that climate change is accelerating: Over the next 20 years, Earth's atmosphere will reach average temperatures as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels. Consequently, extreme weather and natural disasters, food shortages, inundated coastlines and the near-elimination of coral reefs will likely happen even sooner than previously anticipated. The scope of climate change gives companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon[13] excellent opportunities to find specific approaches that would have meaningful effects. Trace the root causes There are, of course, many elements driving climate change. Consider the agriculture sector, which produces one-third[14] of all greenhouse gas emissions. Farms emit the largest share[15] and could benefit from a range of technologies, such as data analytics and artificial intelligence. As a bonus, innovating in agriculture could help feed more people[16]. Identify how technology can make a big difference Technological tools could help farmers collect and use data to manage their crops more precisely[17] in ways that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions - such as using less fertilizer and plowing and planting fields more efficiently. Specifically, better data on soil and plant health could help farmers know where they need to increase or decrease irrigation or pesticide and fertilizer use. These practices save farmers money and increase farms' productivity, generating more food with less waste. Recognize how you can make money from it If companies are to get involved, there needs to be an opportunity to earn money - and the more, the better. One estimate suggests that making changes in farming and food practices that enhance productivity, promote sustainable methods and reduce waste could produce commercial opportunities and new savings worth US$2.3 trillion[18] overall worldwide annually. Our research team[19], in work that is ongoing, has estimated that of that $2.3 trillion a year, $250 billion could come from the application of artificial intelligence and other analytics for precision farming alone - $195 billion of which would be in the developing world, with $45.6 billion in South Asia and $13.4 billion in East Africa. Other estimates for the effects of AI and analytics are less specific, but still within the same range - between $164 billion and $486 billion[20] annually. There is indeed money to be made by technology companies interested in developing climate-friendly, productivity-improving interventions in agriculture. Innovate to overcome the many barriers to change Before the commercial value can be unlocked, however, there are many barriers to consider. Many rural areas, even in the developed world, don't have affordable high-speed internet connections[21] and, particularly in the developing world, the farming community is not as technology savvy as other professions. Further, farming practices have been handed down through generations and the idea of using data to make modifications to such long-held beliefs and methods can be countercultural. In addition, there are many practical realities: 83 percent of the world's cultivated land[22] is fed only by rain, with no irrigation systems to make use of better data. Beyond that, in most parts of the world, seeds and fertilizer are not high-quality[23], lowering crop efficiency. Further, a lot of farms' output is wasted[24] because of lack of refrigeration and slow transportation from fields to consumers. With all those obstacles, it is understandable that investments in data-driven agriculture dropped 39 percent[25] from 2015 to 2016. There are groups still working, though. FarmBeats[26] is a Microsoft project that combines low-cost sensors in the ground with drones that both create aerial maps and act as wireless data relay points. Nigeria's Zenvus[27] and India's Aibono[28] analyze soil data. Kenya's FarmDrive[29] develops credit scores for people without formal bank accounts or standard borrowing histories by using alternative data, like mobile phone and social media activity, together with local agricultural and economic information. Ghana's Farmerline[30] tells farmers about weather forecasts, market information and financial tips. These are creative efforts to solve deep and complex problems, but clearly there is room for large, well-resourced technology companies to step in, make a difference with big ideas, deep pockets and global support. Invest in partnerships Technology entrepreneurs will need to develop business models and organizational structures that are better at collaborating with local agricultural communities and businesses, to navigate personal and political relationships as well as regulations and government programs. Technology will not, on its own, be some sort of silver bullet that will unlock prosperity. Changing technology companies into agents for widespread global good will not be easy - and it can be done in areas beyond agricultural innovation, too. There has been no shortage of talk about these ideas: 50 CEOs[31] met with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss socially positive technologies; World Economic Forum events around the world discuss societal benefits of a Fourth Industrial Revolution[32]; and some companies, such as Ericsson[33] and SAP[34], are already committed to fulfilling United Nations goals for global sustainability[35]. We still have a long way to go. There is still a chance for technology companies to move fast and fix things by truly helping save the world - but sea levels are rising, so the time is now.

What we've asked for is when we have a warrant from a court, that we should be able to get into those cell phones. That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies,\u201d Barr said.</p><p>Barr singled out Apple and Microsoft and hinted that companies pushing China's interests could face pushback under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law requiring Americans to disclose lobbying on behalf of other countries.</p><p>\u201cThe ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States; it is to raid the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are an American business leader, appeasing the [People's Republic of China] may bring short-term rewards.

Barr issued the following transcript of remarks on July 17 regarding China policy at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you very much, Andrew for your very kind introduction and I'd like to say that I really appreciate the work that Andrew and Matt, our U.S. Attorneys for the Eastern and Western District of Michigan our doing here for the people of Michigan and all the law enforcement community from Michigan, that is here today. We really appreciate your work and as Andrew said, after my remarks they are going to put on a presentation of the China Initiative, which I think you'll find very interesting, so if you have the time I urge you to stay for that. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum - especially Elaine Didier - for hosting this event. I also thank the Ford Presidential Foundation and its Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, it's hard to put together an event like this, but in the current circumstances it's especially challenging and I really appreciate it. And I really appreciate all of you who've come, I know many have come from around the state and I appreciate the effort that was made to be here for these remarks.</p><p>I was last in Grand Rapids, it would be 30 years ago John. John Smietanka, from here, was one of my Principal Deputy when I was Deputy Attorney General and stayed on while I was Attorney General. He was U.S. Attorney here in the Western District, so John it's great to see you here. I feel a special bond to the Ford Administration so it's appropriate to be here today for these remarks, because I started out in the CIA in 1973 and President Ford took office and because of what was going on at the agency, I had the privilege of working closely with many of the superb people that he brought into government. Many of whom I had the opportunity to work with over the years, several of whom were my mentors. One of the people I met was the Attorney General, at that time, Ed Levi, who President Ford made Attorney General. His portrait is up in my conference room and his grandson Will Levi is my Chief of Staff, so as I say, I feel a special closeness with the Ford Administration even though I wasn't a political appointee in that administration. Many of the political appointees that I work with over the years really cut their teeth during the Ford Administration.</p><p>I'm privileged to speak here today about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century and that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will continue, will control the future. Since the 1890's, at least, the United States has been the technological leader of the world. And from that prowess, has come our prosperity, the opportunity for generations of Americans, and our security. It's because of that that we were able to play such a pivotal role in world history, but turning back the threat of fascism and the threat of communism. What's at stake these days is whether we can maintain that leadership position and that technological leadership. Are we going to be the generation that has allowed that to be stolen- which is really stealing the future of our children and our grandchildren?</p><p>Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that \"the days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.\" And last week, the FBI Director Chris Wray, described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through the nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities. In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. Now, Chris Wray, told me that shortly after his speech last week, one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party pronounced that his speech was particularly disgusting. I told him that I was going to aim to be despicable, but I'll settle for especially disgusting. But no matter how the Chinese seek to characterize it I do hope that my speech and Mike Pompeo speech will encourage the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. It is fitting that were here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served in the highest echelons of the government at the dawn of America's reengagement with China, which began obviously with President Nixon in 1972, and three years later in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders including Mao Zedong.</p><p>At the time it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. And even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then minority leader Gerald Ford wrote: \"If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge as a self-sufficient power of a billion people... this last impression - of the reality of China's colossal potential - is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\" It is now nearly fifty years later and the pressing pondering as of these two congressmen have come to pass.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reform launched China's remarkable rise had a famous motto: \"hide your strength and bide your time.\" That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980, to nearly 20 percent today. And by some estimates based on purchasing parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving closer to the center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and replacing the American dream with the Chinese solution. China is no longer hiding it strength nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.</p><p>The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg--an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent technological superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Chinese Communist Party's \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles, and many other technologies. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \"Made in China 2025\" sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.</p><p>\"Made in China 2025\" is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and industrial espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have been connected to China.</p><p>The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats.</p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure initiative. Although billed as \"foreign aid,\" in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.</p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its \"Digital Silk Road\" initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields, like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill, much like chess or the even more complex Chinese game, Go. In 2017, Beijing unveiled its \"Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\" a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.</p><p>The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production. \"Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\" in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter economic and environmental regulation.</p><p>The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these essential materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us. As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer - allowing us to serve as the world's \"arsenal of democracy.\" China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's \"arsenal of dictatorship.\"</p><p>How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.</p><p>Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \"How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\" The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.</p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers - including American companies - from exporting them to other countries that needed them. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing for these shipments.</p><p>China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \"creating their own competitors.\"</p><p>America also depends on Chinese supply, Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \"APIs.\" As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \"[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\" it \"could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\"</p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they've used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \"high-value-added-industry\" and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates. Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.</p><p>In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.</p><p>As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, \"[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.\"</p><p>Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Chinese Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.</p><p>If what happened in China stayed in China, that would be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, \"the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders.\" Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.</p><p>All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence - even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.</p><p>Take Hollywood. Hollywood's actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.</p><p>For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.</p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \"Ancient One,\" a Tibetan monk in the comic book, changed it from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \"if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\" Or, as the Chinese government might say, \"[w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\"</p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to please the CCP. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market - both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only three percent five years earlier.</p><p>But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than in co-opting Hollywood - and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \"[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\" Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.</p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \"liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\" Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies, such as Cisco, helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China - the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about the coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the Communist Party easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the iCloud.</p><p>Recently, we were able to get into two cell phones used by the Al-Qaeda terrorist who shot eight Americans at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. During the gun fight with him, he stopped, disengaged, put his cell phones down and tried to destroy them, shooting a bullet into one of his two cell phones and we thought that suggested that there may be very important information about terrorist activities in those cell phones. And for four and a half months we tried to get in, without any help at all from Apple. Apple failed to give us any help getting into the cell phones. We were ultimately able to get in through a fluke that we will not be able to reproduce in the future, where we found communications with Al-Qaeda operatives in the Middle East up to the day before the attack. Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities. And what we've asked for is a warrant - when we have a warrant from a court - that we should be able to get into because cellphones. That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies.</p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives - efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.</p><p>As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Justice Department has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or U.S. politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence campaigns and put a \"friendly face\" on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from these American businessmen is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.</p><p>America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \"guanxi\" - or system of influential social networking - necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the \"agents\" of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship, and their political or other similar activities, by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating credibility.</p><p>By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations in the United States. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \"Confucius Institutes,\" which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands.</p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength.</p><p>Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. There was a time American companies understood this and they saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.</p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.</p><p>I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a \"stupid mistake.\" Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures at the facility during business hours.</p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.</p><p>American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarter's earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.</p><p>During the Cold War, Lewis Powell - later Justice Powell - sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. \"[T]he time has come,\" he said, \"indeed, it is long overdue - for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.\" So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.</p><p>If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: \"Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.\" Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm and how long they will hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule.</p><p>The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before and we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we - the American people, the American government, and American business together - can do it again. Our freedom depends on it.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7180170 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7180170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D0-6261-JC11-11C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5464\"/><timeReceived>1:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 18, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Barr issued the following remarks at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum regarding China policy:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you, Andrew for that very kind introduction and for the excellent work that you and your team have done in protecting the people of the Western District of Michigan. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum -- especially Director Elaine Didier -- for hosting today's event. I'd also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging. Thank you for accommodating us. I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today.</p><p>It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century -- that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future.</p><p>Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that \"[t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.\"[/1] Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.[/2] In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party.</p><p>It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America's reengagement with the People's Republic of China, which began with President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong.</p><p>At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. Yet even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote: \"If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people .... This last impression--of the reality of China's colossal potential--is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\"[/3] It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China's remarkable rise, had a famous motto: \"hide your strength and bide your time.\"[/4] That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today. By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving \"closer to center stage,\" \"building a socialism that is superior to capitalism,\" and replacing the American Dream with the \"Chinese solution.\"[/5] China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.</p><p>The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg--an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party's \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \"Made in China 2025\" sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.</p><p>\"Made in China 2025\" is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China.</p><p>The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats.</p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure initiative. Although billed as \"foreign aid,\" in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.</p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its \"Digital Silk Road\" initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go. AI long ago outmatched the world's chess grandmasters. But the PRC's interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea. The following year, Beijing unveiled its \"Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\" a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.</p><p>The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.[/6] \"Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\" in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation.[/7]</p><p>The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us.</p><p>As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer -- allowing us to serve as the world's \"arsenal of democracy.\" China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's \"arsenal of dictatorship.\"</p><p>How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.</p><p>Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \"How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\"[/8] The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.</p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers -- including American companies -- from exporting them to countries in need. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing.</p><p>China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \"creating their own competitors.\"[/9]</p><p>America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \"APIs.\" As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \"[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\" it \"could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\"[/10]</p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \"high-value-added-industry\" and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.[/11] Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.</p><p>In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.</p><p>As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, \"[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.\"[/12]</p><p>Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.</p><p>If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, \"the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders.\"[/13] Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.</p><p>All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence--even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.</p><p>Take Hollywood. Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.</p><p>For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.) But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.</p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \"Ancient One,\" a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \"if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\"[/14] Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say \"[w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\"[/15]</p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market--both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier.</p><p>But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood--and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \"[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\"[/16] Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.</p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.</p><p>In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \"liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\"[/17] Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China--the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud.</p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives -- efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.</p><p>As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a \"friendly face\" on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.</p><p>America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \"guanxi\" -- or system of influential social networks--necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the \"agents\" of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility.[/18]</p><p>These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern.</p><p>By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \"Confucius Institutes,\" which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands.</p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength.</p><p>Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.</p><p>There was a time American companies understood that. They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.</p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.</p><p>I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States.</p><p>But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a \"stupid mistake.\"[/19] Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours.</p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.</p><p>American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.</p><p>During the Cold War, Lewis Powell -- later Justice Powell -- sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. \"[T]he time has come,\" he said, \"indeed, it is long overdue--for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.\"[/20]</p><p>So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.</p><p>If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: \"Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.\"[/21] Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule.</p><p>The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before. If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we--the American people, American government, and American business together--can do it again. Our freedom depends on it.</p><p>[1/] Robert C.

China's goal is to 'raid' the United States and bilk American businesses, Barrsaid[1]during a speech in Michigan. He also suggested there could be serious repercussions for Silicon Valley companies that give deference to China over the U.S. 'Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities?'</p><p> Barr said during the speech. 'They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities. What we've asked for is when we have a warrant from a court, that we should be able to get into those cell phones. That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies,' Barr said. Barr singled out Apple and Microsoft and hinted that companies pushing China's interests could face pushback under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law requiring Americans to disclose lobbying on behalf of other countries. 'The ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States; it is to raid the United States,' he said. 'If you are an American business leader, appeasing the [People's Republic of China] may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you.' 'Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP,' Barr said.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Apple has faced criticism for complying with China's demands in years past. The companyremoved[2] The New York Times app from its Chinese app store in 2017, for instance, in an effort to comply with a request from Chinese regulators, the NYT reported in 2017. Apple also built[3]a data center in China to act in accordance with the country's cybersecurity laws, which give officials the ability toseize[4]data on political dissidents. Barr criticized[5] Apple in May for not being more helpful as the Department of Justice attempted to collect data from the iPhone of a man who shot and killed three sailors in Florida. The Justice Department has not explained how the FBI managed to gain access to Second Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani's data without Apple's help. If investigators had to use tools to guess the shooter's password[6], then the effort could have taken anywhere between two days to several years, depending on the uniqueness of the password. A password containing letters and numbers means a larger number of passcodes, making the phone harder to break into. Investigators reportedly used[7] the data to discover a connection[8] between Alshamrani and an al-Qaeda operative before his 2019 shooting spree.

China\u2019s goal is to \u201craid\u201d the United States and bilk American businesses, Barr  said  during a speech in Michigan. He also suggested there could be serious repercussions for Silicon Valley companies that give deference to China over the U.S.    \u201cDo you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities?\u201d Barr said during the speech.    \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities. What we\u2019ve asked for is when we have a warrant from a court, that we should be able to get into those cell phones. That\u2019s the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies,\u201d Barr said.    Barr singled out Apple and Microsoft and hinted that companies pushing China\u2019s interests could face pushback under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law requiring Americans to disclose lobbying on behalf of other countries.    \u201cThe ultimate ambition of China\u2019s rulers isn\u2019t to trade with the United States; it is to raid the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are an American business leader, appeasing the [People\u2019s Republic of China] may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC\u2019s goal is to replace you.\u201d    \u201cOver the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP,\u201d Barr said.   (Article Continues Below Advertisement)    Apple has faced criticism for complying with China\u2019s demands in years past. The company  removed The New York Times app from its Chinese app store in 2017, for instance, in an effort to comply with a request from Chinese regulators, the NYT reported in 2017. Apple also built  a data center in China to act in accordance with the country\u2019s cybersecurity laws, which give officials the ability to  seize  data on political dissidents.    Barr criticized Apple in May for not being more helpful as the Department of Justice attempted to collect data from the iPhone of a man who shot and killed three sailors in Florida. The Justice Department has not explained how the FBI managed to gain access to Second Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani\u2019s data without Apple\u2019s help.        If investigators had to use tools to guess the shooter\u2019s password , then the effort could have taken anywhere between two days to several years, depending on the uniqueness of the password. A password containing letters and numbers means a larger number of passcodes, making the phone harder to break into.        Investigators reportedly used the data to discover a connection between Alshamrani and an al-Qaeda operative before his 2019 shooting spree.    Apple has not responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s request for comment.

The complexity of managing digital, specialist, online, offline and in-between providers has helped CMOs learn, but has also left many of them without the one thing every organisation needs now. Agility.</p><p><br/><br/>-<br/>Specialist or integrated?<br/><br/>Even while flexibility in the age of instant messaging is vital, the quest for data that can be used to personalise messaging, new technology and tighter regulations has led to marketers trying to determine whether integrated agencies or specialist firms would best meet their needs. <br/><br/>Scopen s Agency Scope 2019/2020 report undertook face-to-face interviews with marketing decision makers in 207 companies across South Africa and found 47% of respondents currently working with an integrated agency, where the global figure is 54.3%.<br/><br/>The South African percentage opting for a specialised agency was 53%, but here s where it gets interesting...When asked their preference for future work, 52.9% said they d prefer to work with integrated agencies but only 47% do, a 5.9% gap between desire and reality. However, as the number of touchpoints with consumers has grown with the tsunami of choice that is digital and all its various tributaries, many CMOs have been overwhelmed by both choice and feedback. This has led to the appointment of several agencies and what is becoming known as scope creep   the services of one agency overlapping another.While overlapping skills may be handled by several contractors in the manufacturing industry, the nature of creativity means a marketing campaign can rarely be handed over to another agency and retain effective results.<br/><br/>The art / science of agility<br/><br/>In its report Evolving Client Agency Models by Neil Perkin, the UK s client-agency relations experts AAR Group, the international partners of IAS Independent Agency Search &amp; Selection, note the transformation happening in the industry and cites one CMO as noting that marketing is becoming  less of an art and more of a science .<br/><br/>I believe that success lies in the monitoring of how much art and how much science is required by brands, and ensuring marketers are not drowning in the duplication of services that transforms them into project managers.<br/><br/>Noting that the marketing technology (martech) landscape has grown from 150 separate martech vendors in Europe in 2011 and in 2018 the number had ballooned to 6,829, it s apparent that an independent audit by reputable consultants should be undertaken fairly regularly to ensure marketers are not merely being swamped by stats.<br/><br/>The IAS is seeing an increasing demand by marketers and procurement to ensure that the service providers, agencies and their martech partners are aligned and relevant to the changing needs of the marketer and their brands and services.  <br/><br/>This does not necessarily mean that that the number of agencies will be reduced, but it does mean that scopes of work for each agency in the ecosystem will be thoroughly evaluated to ensure minimal overlap and maximum optimisation of efficiencies. <br/><br/>Digital, offline, above the line or below, the messenger may look different but the ultimate message is still customer satisfaction, and today s customer is agile.<br/><br/>Agency Scope is a study of the creative and media agency landscape in South Africa. It is a biennial study conducted by Scopen Africa which is part of the Scopen Global group that is active in 12 countries. Our universe of analysis in 2019/2020 in South Africa consisted of 239 face-to-face interviews with the highest-level decision makers in marketing.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BIZSAM-1204738</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BIZSAM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602D-9BB1-JBH4-J00F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">376638</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"639\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bizcommunity Publishing SA (Pty) Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Marketing and Media)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13292\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 4, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Johanna McDowell</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>agility</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SCOPEN Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Scopen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Agency Scope</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Agency Scope Insights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Agency Scope South Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Scopen Global</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000956</classCode><className>FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

Google will also add audio and visual alerts to the app for when drivers use the turn-by-turn navigation feature. </p><p>  There are about 130,000 public and 85,000 private grade, or level, crossings across the country. The number of accidents at crossings had declined more than 80 percent, to about 2,000 a year in recent years from about 12,000 a year in the 1970s. But last year, the number rose by 9 percent.</p><p>  This upswing has prompted the railroad agency to seek new ways to stem this longstanding hazard through technology. Last year, 270 people died in highway-rail collisions, up from 232 the previous year, and 843 people were injured, according to federal safety statistics. </p><p>  Grade-crossing accidents are the second-highest cause of rail fatalities after trespassing accidents, which killed 533 people last year.</p><p>  Drivers are increasingly reliant on their smartphones for directions, and major tech firms -- including Google, Apple and Facebook -- have developed location-based services that make the most of their capabilities. Google has been a pioneer in mapping, and its mobile app is one of the most popular maps for Android phones and iPhones.</p><p>  The partnership with Google is likely to precede other announcements. The agency said it had also reached out to four other map makers -- Apple, MapQuest, TomTom and Garmin -- to include similar features on their apps or mapping devices. </p><p>  Grade-crossing accidents are generally caused by driver inattention and error, according to the rail regulator. In many instances, there are no gates or blinking lights to warn drivers of an oncoming train -- just a crossing sign or a crossbuck (a white ''X'' marked with the words ''railroad crossing''). </p><p>  Officials and safety advocates do not have a precise explanation as to why grade accidents rose last year. A growing economy might have contributed to increasing freight train traffic and put more people on the roads. Distracted driving might be another factor.</p><p>  ''The vast majority of these accidents and deaths are preventable,'' said Sarah Feinberg, the Federal Railroad Administration's acting administrator. ''In some cases, maybe a driver intends to beat the train, thinks they are familiar with the route or still have time to cross. But there are many cases where drivers lack situational awareness, because it may be dark or the route is unfamiliar.''</p><p>  She points out that many drivers now routinely plug their destination into their smartphones, often to find the fastest itinerary or avoid traffic.</p><p>  No date has been given for when the crossing information will be available on Google Maps, but Department of Transportation officials say the company has made the project a priority. </p><p>  ''We're happy to help the Federal Railroad Administration as we're always looking for new ways to make maps useful to our users,'' Mara Harris, a Google spokeswoman, said.</p><p>  The Department of Transportation has developed its own app, called the Rail Crossing Location Mobile Application, that provides drivers with a catalog of all crossing locations. But the app does not alert drivers when they are about to cross over tracks. It is also not used much. The same data found on this app would also be used by Google and others.</p><p>  ''We have some really good data on these crossings but we have to put the data where people are using it,'' Ms. Feinberg said. ''What makes sense is to take that data where people are gathering. It makes much more sense for me to share my data with Google, rather than try to get Google users to come to my app. For us, it makes a ton of sense to get that information out there.''</p><p>  In February, a Metro-North commuter train struck a sport utility vehicle that was stuck on the tracks, killing six people. That accident took place just weeks after Ms. Feinberg, formerly the chief of staff to the secretary of transportation, was named as the railroad agency's acting administrator.</p><p>  The accident, along with last year's uptick in the number of fatalities, prompted Ms. Feinberg to turn to technology partners for help. Before joining the Department of Transportation, Ms. Feinberg, a former White House employee, had worked at Facebook, giving her knowledge of how big tech companies develop their products. </p><p>  Joyce Rose, president of Operation Lifesaver, a rail safety educational group, welcomed the new initiative.

The company recently debuted a version of its e-commerce site in Hindi, a move Amazon's top India executive              said was part of its effort to attract \"the next 100 million customers,\" in what analysts described as the company's most important market abroad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet whether India continues to welcome Amazon is an open question. The country's policymakers recently raised alarm bells about what they describe as a \"handful of companies\" that \"dominate the digital economy\" and earlier this year instituted a rule change that forced Amazon to scale back aspects of its business in India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The country of more than 1.3 billion people is not the only place where Amazon is experiencing challenges.</p><p>Three sets of regulators in Europe over the past year have opened investigations into whether Amazon is a threat to open competition, underscoring how foreign markets are demonstrating the type of concern about the company's power that is only beginning to draw attention in the United States.</p><p>If policymakers in these countries end up moving to limit Amazon - in effect protecting homegrown businesses - that would present a barrier to continuing the company's record of unbridled growth  . Amazon has rapidly grown its sales over the past two decades, but some analysts are now questioning whether the U.S. market is becoming saturated, putting an increased burden on foreign sales.</p><p>The challenges abroad could also be a hint of what's to come in the United States, where a small but growing number of political leaders are taking aim at the company.</p><p>\"Just because they were successful in the U.S. doesn't mean they'll be successful internationally,\" said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. \"The international side of things definitely creates speed bumps. . . . As it becomes more and more difficult, does the company have to pivot or decide to exit some of these markets?\"</p><p>Amazon, for its part, said in a statement, \"People like low prices, big selection and fast delivery, pretty much everywhere around the world.\" While there may be differences in how the company markets certain programs or delivery options, \"we don't change our approach as we move around the world, and we face stiff competition everywhere we operate.\"</p><p>(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Jay Carney, Amazon's senior vice president of global corporate affairs, told The Post that while Amazon is a tech company, \"a lot of the issues that are front and center in Europe, as well as here, that raise concerns are simply not ones that are prominent for us because of our business model.\" Still, he said part of his job involves working with policymakers around the world to \"build and invest and hire and meet the needs of governments.\"</p><p>\"We're not morally superior,\" Carney said. \"We just have a different business model.\"</p><p>Amazon's international business is important to its overall model, accounting for 28 percent of its revenue in 2018 - although it has long been a money-losing unit. Adding to the importance of succeeding in India and Europe, the top market for many American companies, China, has long been difficult for Amazon. It purchased a subsidiary online retailer there in 2004 and has worked for more than a decade to build its Chinese e-commerce business. But the country has become almost entirely cut off to foreign online retailers, given the dominance of platforms like Alibaba and JD.com, which together account for almost 75 percent of all retail e-commerce sales in China in 2018, according to eMarketer.</p><p>Amazon officially threw in the towel in the domestic Chinese market earlier this year, announcing it would close its marketplace in July.</p><p>Amazon's investments will only become more important should American retail sales level out, Yarbrough said. That means heavy investment in countries like India, with the hope that profits are not far behind.</p><p>\"They're sinking all this money into the India market,\" Yarbrough said, \"and they're saying they're going to replicate what they did in the U.S. after years and years of investment.\"</p><h>It's 'about the data'</h><p>The pushback from India and Europe has important differences, but there is a common thread: As Amazon points its ambition abroad, foreign governments are pushing back in ways the U.S. government has not.</p><p>The biggest broadside came in September from Margrethe Vestager - the European Union's top competition enforcer, who has taken a tough stand against big technology companies. That month, she launched a preliminary antitrust investigation into Amazon, probing whether Amazon's \"dual role\" as a seller of its products and a marketplace for others gives the company too much power. Vestager said her concern is that Amazon could use data from its rivals - namely merchants who sell on its platform - to edge out the competition.</p><p>The probe followed up on concerns raised by retailers who say Amazon's model gives it an unfair advantage.</p><p>\"The question here is about the data,\" Vestager said in September. \"If you as Amazon get the data from the smaller merchants that you host - which of course can be completely legitimate because you can improve your service to these smaller merchants - do you then also use this data to do your own calculations on what is the new big thing? What is it that people want?\"</p><p>The preliminary probe, which she said in March was in \"quite advanced\" stages, includes sending questionnaires to online sellers and could be the first step toward a more formal investigation.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment on the E.U.'s probe into antitrust concerns.</p><p>Vestager has made her mark going after Big Tech. Consider Google: In March, the E.U. fined Google roughly $1.7 billion for advertising practices the European Commission said violated antitrust laws. Last year, Vestager handed the tech giant a $5 billion antitrust fine and required the company to change how it places search and Web browser functions into Android phones. And in 2017, Vestager levied a $2.7 billion fine on Google for how it steered users toward its comparison shopping site.</p><p>\"The European Union has always been preoccupied with very large companies,\" said Scheherazade Rehman, a professor of international business at George Washington University. \"Whether it's Microsoft or Facebook or Amazon . . . their focus is antitrust and, more recently, privacy.\"</p><p>In mid-April, Italy's competition authority said it, too, would launch a preliminary probe into how Amazon used its e-commerce and logistics services. Regulators said they would look into whether Amazon boosted third-party vendors that used its logistics service over other sellers that did not.</p><p>Germany has also announced an antitrust investigation into Amazon.</p><p>In India, the pushback against Amazon is part of a broader response to the rise of foreign players in the e-commerce industry. The country's Hindu nationalist ruling party, which is seeking reelection, has long drawn strength from the owners of the country's millions of mom-and-pop stores. Those shopkeepers have complained loudly about the growing influence of companies like Amazon.</p><p>Experts say India has become Amazon's most important emerging market. Amazon said it has committed more than $5 billion to India, including building more than 50 warehouses to make deliveries all over the country. According to British bank Barclays, Amazon is the country's No. 1 Internet marketplace in terms of total value of merchandise sold.</p><p>Big companies all have the same goals, said Praveen Khandelwal, who heads the Confederation of All India Traders, an association that says it represents 70 million small retailers. \"Number one, to control, dominate and monopolize the market, and second, to crush the competition,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are not against e-commerce,\" he continued, but companies like Amazon indulge in \"malpractices which include predatory pricing, deep discounting and loss funding . . . to the utter disadvantage of the retail sector of India.\"</p><p>Amazon says the prices for products sold on its Indian marketplace are determined by the sellers. The company said it invests in services, like Fulfilled by Amazon and Easyship, which help sellers lower their costs as they scale up to sell nationally.</p><p>At the end of December, India's Commerce Ministry issued new rules that targeted how Amazon and Walmart did business in the country. Under existing Indian regulations, Amazon could not control its own inventory, as it does in the United States. But it worked with two key sellers - Cloudtail and Appario - in which it indirectly held a stake. The rule change aimed to close that loophole.</p><p>\"It was a bit of an ambush,\" said one person involved in the industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.</p><p>Amazon and Walmart urged the Indian government to delay the implementation of the rules, but it refused. As a result, when the rules came into force in February, all the products sold by Cloudtail and Appario disappeared from the Amazon site. But within two weeks, they were back - after Amazon had reduced its stake in the parent companies of both firms.</p><p>\"I would expect them to continue fighting and not to give up because the potential upside is almost limitless,\" said Michael Auslin, an expert on U.S. policy in Asia and a fellow at the Hoover Institution.</p><p>In February, the Indian government released a new draft of a national e-commerce policy that aims to provide a \"level playing field\" for all companies. It seeks to empower domestic entrepreneurs and warns of \"enterprises with deep pockets\" that \"threaten the existence of small businesses\" and discourage competition. Among the changes it proposes are restrictions on how data from Indian consumers can be used.</p><p>The government is soliciting feedback on the policy, but a final version is unlikely to emerge until after India's national elections conclude in late May.</p><p>\"Definitely, the idea is to promote domestic market players, be they big or small,\" said Atul Pandey, a partner at Khaitan &amp; Co., a major Indian law firm, who focuses on cross-border transactions.</p><p>But others say India's objective is more far-reaching: to create a \"China-like situation\" where the barriers to foreign players \"progressively become higher,\" said Nikhil Pahwa, a technology expert who has written extensively on Indian government policy.</p><p>The government sees \"data as a national asset and control of the Internet economy as a nationalistic objective,\" he said.</p><p>Representatives of India's Commerce Ministry declined to comment.</p><h>The focus of U.S. debates</h><p>So far, American antitrust law has not posed a threat to Amazon's business model. The company's portfolio spans e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising and more.</p><p>But more policymakers on both sides of the aisle have been viewing Amazon with a skeptical eye.</p><p>In 2017, a lengthy essay published in the Yale Law Journal by then-law-student Lina M. Khan made a case for why American antitrust law is no longer fit to take on Amazon and tech giants like it. Khan's argument has proved influential among a number of U.S. policymakers, and she has subsequently advised the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>The 2020 elections could further debates around antitrust law and its ability to rein in Amazon. Those calls have largely come from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who said she would move to break up Amazon, Facebook and Google if she became president.

The company recently debuted a version of its e-commerce site in Hindi, a move Amazon's top India executive              said was part of its effort to attract \"the next 100 million customers,\" in what analysts described as the company's most important market abroad.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet whether India continues to welcome Amazon is an open question. The country's policymakers recently raised alarm bells about what they describe as a \"handful of companies\" that \"dominate the digital economy\" and earlier this year instituted a rule change that forced Amazon to scale back aspects of its business in India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The country of more than 1.3 billion people is not the only place where Amazon is experiencing challenges.</p><p>Three sets of regulators in Europe over the past year have opened investigations into whether Amazon is a threat to open competition, underscoring how foreign markets are demonstrating the type of concern about the company's power that is only beginning to draw attention in the United States.</p><p>If policymakers in these countries end up moving to limit Amazon - in effect protecting homegrown businesses - that would present a barrier to continuing the company's record of unbridled growth  . Amazon has rapidly grown its sales over the past two decades, but some analysts are now questioning whether the U.S. market is becoming saturated, putting an increased burden on foreign sales.</p><p>The challenges abroad could also be a hint of what's to come in the United States, where a small but growing number of political leaders are taking aim at the company.</p><p>\"Just because they were successful in the U.S. doesn't mean they'll be successful internationally,\" said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. \"The international side of things definitely creates speed bumps. . . . As it becomes more and more difficult, does the company have to pivot or decide to exit some of these markets?\"</p><p>Amazon, for its part, said in a statement, \"People like low prices, big selection and fast delivery, pretty much everywhere around the world.\" While there may be differences in how the company markets certain programs or delivery options, \"we don't change our approach as we move around the world, and we face stiff competition everywhere we operate.\"</p><p>(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Jay Carney, Amazon's senior vice president of global corporate affairs, told The Post that while Amazon is a tech company, \"a lot of the issues that are front and center in Europe, as well as here, that raise concerns are simply not ones that are prominent for us because of our business model.\" Still, he said part of his job involves working with policymakers around the world to \"build and invest and hire and meet the needs of governments.\"</p><p>\"We're not morally superior,\" Carney said. \"We just have a different business model.\"</p><p>Amazon's international business is important to its overall model, accounting for 28 percent of its revenue in 2018 - although it has long been a money-losing unit. Adding to the importance of succeeding in India and Europe, the top market for many American companies, China, has long been difficult for Amazon. It purchased a subsidiary online retailer there in 2004 and has worked for more than a decade to build its Chinese e-commerce business. But the country has become almost entirely cut off to foreign online retailers, given the dominance of platforms like Alibaba and JD.com, which together account for almost 75 percent of all retail e-commerce sales in China in 2018, according to eMarketer.</p><p>Amazon officially threw in the towel in the domestic Chinese market earlier this year, announcing it would close its marketplace in July.</p><p>Amazon's investments will only become more important should American retail sales level out, Yarbrough said. That means heavy investment in countries like India, with the hope that profits are not far behind.</p><p>\"They're sinking all this money into the India market,\" Yarbrough said, \"and they're saying they're going to replicate what they did in the U.S. after years and years of investment.\"</p><p>          It's 'about the data'          </p><p>The pushback from India and Europe has important differences, but there is a common thread: As Amazon points its ambition abroad, foreign governments are pushing back in ways the U.S. government has not.</p><p>             The biggest broadside came in September from Margrethe Vestager - the European Union's top competition enforcer, who has taken a tough stand against big technology companies. That month, she launched a preliminary antitrust investigation into Amazon, probing whether Amazon's \"dual role\" as a seller of its products and a marketplace for others gives the company too much power. Vestager said her concern is that Amazon could use data from its rivals - namely merchants who sell on its platform - to edge out the competition.</p><p>The probe followed up on concerns raised by retailers who say Amazon's model gives it an unfair advantage.</p><p>\"The question here is about the data,\" Vestager said in September. \"If you as Amazon get the data from the smaller merchants that you host - which of course can be completely legitimate because you can improve your service to these smaller merchants - do you then also use this data to do your own calculations on what is the new big thing? What is it that people want?\"</p><p>The preliminary probe, which she said in March was in \"quite advanced\" stages, includes sending questionnaires to online sellers and could be the first step toward a more formal investigation.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment on the E.U.'s probe into antitrust concerns.</p><p>Vestager has made her mark going after Big Tech. Consider Google: In March, the E.U. fined Google roughly $1.7 billion for advertising practices the European Commission said violated antitrust laws. Last year, Vestager handed the tech giant a $5 billion antitrust fine and required the company to change how it places search and Web browser functions into Android phones. And in 2017, Vestager levied a $2.7 billion fine on Google for how it steered users toward its comparison shopping site.</p><p>\"The European Union has always been preoccupied with very large companies,\" said Scheherazade Rehman, a professor of international business at George Washington University. \"Whether it's Microsoft or Facebook or Amazon . . . their focus is antitrust and, more recently, privacy.\"</p><p>In mid-April, Italy's competition authority said it, too, would launch a preliminary probe into how Amazon used its e-commerce and logistics services. Regulators said they would look into whether Amazon boosted third-party vendors that used its logistics service over other sellers that did not.</p><p>Germany has also announced an antitrust investigation into Amazon.</p><p>In India, the pushback against Amazon is part of a broader response to the rise of foreign players in the e-commerce industry. The country's Hindu nationalist ruling party, which is seeking reelection, has long drawn strength from the owners of the country's millions of mom-and-pop stores. Those shopkeepers have complained loudly about the growing influence of companies like Amazon.</p><p>Experts say India has become Amazon's most important emerging market. Amazon said it has committed more than $5 billion to India, including building more than 50 warehouses to make deliveries all over the country. According to British bank Barclays, Amazon is the country's No. 1 Internet marketplace in terms of total value of merchandise sold.</p><p>Big companies all have the same goals, said Praveen Khandelwal, who heads the Confederation of All India Traders, an association that says it represents 70 million small retailers. \"Number one, to control, dominate and monopolize the market, and second, to crush the competition,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are not against e-commerce,\" he continued, but companies like Amazon indulge in \"malpractices which include predatory pricing, deep discounting and loss funding . . . to the utter disadvantage of the retail sector of India.\"</p><p>Amazon says the prices for products sold on its Indian marketplace are determined by the sellers. The company said it invests in services, like Fulfilled by Amazon and Easyship, which help sellers lower their costs as they scale up to sell nationally.</p><p>At the end of December, India's Commerce Ministry issued new rules that targeted how Amazon and Walmart did business in the country. Under existing Indian regulations, Amazon could not control its own inventory, as it does in the United States. But it worked with two key sellers - Cloudtail and Appario - in which it indirectly held a stake. The rule change aimed to close that loophole.</p><p>\"It was a bit of an ambush,\" said one person involved in the industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.</p><p>Amazon and Walmart urged the Indian government to delay the implementation of the rules, but it refused. As a result, when the rules came into force in February, all the products sold by Cloudtail and Appario disappeared from the Amazon site. But within two weeks, they were back - after Amazon had reduced its stake in the parent companies of both firms.</p><p>\"I would expect them to continue fighting and not to give up because the potential upside is almost limitless,\" said Michael Auslin, an expert on U.S. policy in Asia and a fellow at the Hoover Institution.</p><p>In February, the Indian government released a new draft of a national e-commerce policy that aims to provide a \"level playing field\" for all companies. It seeks to empower domestic entrepreneurs and warns of \"enterprises with deep pockets\" that \"threaten the existence of small businesses\" and discourage competition. Among the changes it proposes are restrictions on how data from Indian consumers can be used.</p><p>The government is soliciting feedback on the policy, but a final version is unlikely to emerge until after India's national elections conclude in late May.</p><p>\"Definitely, the idea is to promote domestic market players, be they big or small,\" said Atul Pandey, a partner at Khaitan &amp; Co., a major Indian law firm, who focuses on cross-border transactions.</p><p>But others say India's objective is more far-reaching: to create a \"China-like situation\" where the barriers to foreign players \"progressively become higher,\" said Nikhil Pahwa, a technology expert who has written extensively on Indian government policy.</p><p>The government sees \"data as a national asset and control of the Internet economy as a nationalistic objective,\" he said.</p><p>Representatives of India's Commerce Ministry declined to comment.</p><p>          The focus of U.S. debates          </p><p>So far, American antitrust law has not posed a threat to Amazon's business model. The company's portfolio spans e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising and more.</p><p>But more policymakers on both sides of the aisle have been viewing Amazon with a skeptical eye.</p><p>             In 2017, a lengthy essay published in the Yale Law Journal by then-law-student Lina M. Khan made a case for why American antitrust law is no longer fit to take on Amazon and tech giants like it. Khan's argument has proved influential among a number of U.S. policymakers, and she has subsequently advised the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>The 2020 elections could further debates around antitrust law and its ability to rein in Amazon. Those calls have largely come from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who said she would move to break up Amazon, Facebook and Google if she became president. The companies have \"too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy,\" she said.</p><p>Talking specifically about Amazon, Warren said the company should be able to operate its own platform - but not also own the auxiliary businesses that sell on it.</p><p>\"It's like in baseball,\" Warren said in an interview with The Washington Post last month. \"You can be the umpire; that's like the platform.

Yet an internal discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News reveals Google regularly intervenes in search results on its YouTube video platform - including a recent intervention that pushed pro-life videos out of the top ten search results for 'abortion.' The term 'abortion' was added to a 'blacklist' file for 'controversial YouTube queries,' which contains a list of search terms that the company considers sensitive. According to the leak, these include some of these search terms related to: abortion, abortions, the Irish abortion referendum, Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and anti-gun activist David Hogg. </p><p>The existence of the blacklist was revealed in an internal Google discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News by a source inside the company who wishes to remain anonymous. A partial list of blacklisted terms was also leaked to Breitbart by another Google source. In the leaked discussion thread, a Google site reliability engineer hinted at the existence of more search blacklists, according to the source. 'We have tons of white- and blacklists that humans manually curate,' said the employee. 'Hopefully this isn't surprising or particularly controversial.' Others were more concerned about the presence of the blacklist. According to the source, the software engineer who started the discussion called the manipulation of search results related to abortion a 'smoking gun.' The software engineer noted that the change had occurred following aninquiry from a left-wingSlatejournalist[3]about the prominence of pro-life videos on YouTube, and that pro-life videos were replaced with pro-abortion videos in the top ten results for the search terms following Google's manual intervention. 'TheSlatewriter said she had complained last Friday and then saw different search results before YouTube responded to her on Monday,' wrote the employee. 'And lo and behold, the [changelog] was submitted on Friday, December 14 at 3:17 PM.' The manually downranked items included several videos from Dr. Antony Levatino, a former abortion doctor who is now a pro-life activist. Another video in the top ten featured a woman's personal story of being pressured to have an abortion, while another featured pro-life conservative Ben Shapiro. TheSlatejournalist who complained to Googlereported[4] that these videos previously featured in the top ten, describing them in her story as 'dangerous misinformation.' Since theSlatejournalist's inquiry andGoogle's subsequent intervention, the top search resultsnow[5]feature pro-abortion content from left-wing sources like BuzzFeed, Vice, CNN, andLast Week Tonight With John Oliver.In herreport[6], theSlatejournalist acknowledged that the search results changed shortly after she contacted Google. The manual adjustment of search results by a Google-owned platform contradicts a keyclaim[7]made under oath by Google CEO Sundar Pichai in his congressional testimony earlier this month: that his company does not 'manually intervene on any search result.' A Google employee in the discussion thread drew attention to Pichai's claim, noting that it 'seems like we are pretty eager to cater our search results to the social and political agenda of left-wing journalists.' One of the posts in the discussion also noted that the blacklist had previously been edited to include the search term 'Maxine Waters' after a single Google employee complained the top YouTube search result for Maxine Waters was 'very low quality.' Google's alleged intervention on behalf of a Democratic congresswoman would be further evidence of the tech giant using its resources to prop up the left. Breitbart News previously reported on leaked emails revealing the company targeted pro-Democrat demographics in its get-out-the-vote efforts in 2016. According to the source, a software engineer in the thread also noted that 'a bunch of terms related to the abortion referendum in Ireland' had been added to the blacklist - another change with potentially dramatic consequences on the national policies of a western democracy. youtube_controversial_query_blacklist At least one post in the discussion thread revealed the existence of a file called 'youtube_controversial_query_blacklist,' which contains a list of YouTube search terms that Google manually curates. In addition to the terms 'abortion,' 'abortions,' 'Maxine Waters,' and search terms related to the Irish abortion referendum, a Google software engineer noted that the blacklist includes search terms related to terrorist attacks. (the posts specifically mentions that the 'Strasbourg terrorist attack' as being on the list). 'If you look at the other entries recently added to theyoutube_controversial_query_blacklist(e.g., entries related to the Strasbourg terrorist attack), the addition of abortion seemsout-of-place,' wrote the software engineer, according to the source. After learning of the existence of the blacklist, Breitbart News obtained a partial screenshot of the full blacklist file from a source within Google. It reveals that the blacklist includes search terms related to both mass shootings and the progressive anti-second amendment activist David Hogg. This suggests Google has followed the lead of Democrat politicians, who haverepeatedly pushed tech companies[8]to censor content related to the Parkland school shooting and the Parkland anti-gun activists. It's part of a popular new line of thought in the political-media establishment,which views the public as too stupid to question conspiracy theories for themselves[9]. Here is the partial blacklist leaked to Breitbart:2117 plane crash Russian 2118 plane crash 2119 an-148 2120 florida shooting conspiracy 2121 florida shooting crisis actors 2122 florida conspiracy 2123 florida false flag shooting 2124 florida false flag 2125 fake florida school shooting 2126 david hogg hoax 2127 david hogg fake 2128 david hogg crisis actor 2129 david hogg forgets lines 2130 david hogg forgets his lines 2131 david hogg cant remember his lines 2132 david hogg actor 2133 david hogg cant remember 2134 david hogg conspiracy 2135 david hogg exposed 2136 david hogg lines 2137 david hogg rehearsing 2120 florida shooting conspiracyThe full internal filepath of the blacklist, according to another source, is: //depot/google3/googledata/superroot/youtube/youtube_controversial_query_blacklist Contradictions Responding to a request for comment, a YouTube spokeswoman said the company wants to promote 'authoritative' sources in its search results, but maintained that YouTube is a 'platform for free speech' that 'allow[s]' both pro-life and pro-abortion content. YouTube's full comment:YouTube is a platform for free speech where anyone can choose to post videos, as long as they follow ourCommunity Guidelines[10], which prohibit things like inciting violence and pornography. We apply these policies impartially and we allow both pro-life and pro-choice opinions. Over the last year we've described how we are working tobetter surface news sources[11]across our site for news-related searches and topical information. We've improved our search and discovery algorithms, built new features that clearly label and prominently surface news sources on our homepage and search pages, and introduced information panels to help give users more authoritative sources where they can fact check information for themselves.In the case of the 'abortion' search results, YouTube's intervention to insert 'authoritative' content resulted in the downranking of pro-life videos and the elevation of pro-abortion ones. A Google spokesperson took a tougher line than its YouTube subsidiary, stating that 'Google has never manipulated or modified the search results or content in any of its products to promote a particular political ideology.' However, in the leaked discussion thread, a member of Google's 'trust ...fety' team, Daniel Aaronson, admitted that the company maintains 'huge teams' that work to adjust search results for subjects that are 'prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content' - all subjective terms that are frequently used to suppress right-leaning sources. He also admitted that the interventions weren't confined to YouTube - they included search results delivered via Google Assistant, Google Home, and in rare cases Google 's organic search results. In the thread, Aaronson attempted to explain how search blacklisting worked. He claimed that highly specific searches would generate non-blacklisted results, even controversial ones. But the inclusion of highly specific terms in the YouTube blacklist, like 'David Hogg cant remember his lines' - the name of an actual viral video - seems to contradict this. Aaronson's full post is copied below:I work in Trust and Safety and while I have no particular input as to exactly what's happening for YT I can try to explain why you'd have this kind of list and why people are finding lists like these on Code Search. When dealing with abuse/controversial content on various mediums you have several levers to deal with problems. Two prominent levers are 'Proactive' and 'Reactive':Proactive: Usually refers to some type of algorithm/scalable solution to a general problem E.g.: We don't allow straight up porn on YouTube so we create a classifier that detects porn and automatically remove or flag for review the videos the porn classifier is most certain ofReactive: Usually refers to a manual fix to something that has been brought to our attention that our proactive solutions don't/didn't work on and something that is clearly in the realm of bad enough to warrant a quick targeted solution (determined by pages and pages of policies worked on over many years and many teams to be fair and cover necessary scope) E,g.: A website that used to be a good blog had it's domain expire and was purchased/repurposed to spam Search results with autogenerated pages full of gibberish text, scraped images, and links to boost traffic to other spammy sites. It is manually actioned for violating policy These Organic Search policies and the consequences to violating them are public[12] Manually reacting to things is not very scalable, and is not an ideal solution to most problems, so the proactive lever is really the one we all like to lean on. Ideally, our classifiers/algorithm are good at providing useful and rich results to our users while ignoring things at are not useful or not relevant. But we all know, this isn't exactly the case all the time (especially on YouTube). From a user perspective, there are subjects that are prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content. Now, these words are highly subjective and no one denies that. But we can all agree generally, lines exist in many cultures about what is clearly okay vs. what is not okay. E.g. a video of a puppy playing with a toy is probably okay in almost every culture or context, even if it's not relevant to the query. But a video of someone committing suicide and begging others to follow in his/her footsteps is probably on the other side of the line for many folks. While my second example is technically relevant to the generic query of 'suicide', that doesn't mean that this is a very useful or good video to promote on the top of results for that query. So imagine a classifier that says, for any queries on a particular text file, let's pull videos using signals that we historically understand to be strong indicators of quality (I won't go into specifics here, but those signals do exist). We're not manually curating these results, we're just saying 'hey, be extra careful with results for this query because many times really bad stuff can appear and lead to a bad experience for most users'. Ideally the proactive lever did this for us, but in extreme cases where we need to act quickly on something that is so obviously not okay, the reactive/manual approach is sometimes necessary. And also keep in mind, that this is different for every product. The bar for changing classifiers or manual actions on span in organic search isextremelyhigh. However, the bar for things we let our Google Assistant say out loud might be a lot lower. If I search for 'Jews run the banks' - I'll likely find anti-semitic stuff in organic search. As a Jew, I might find some of these results offensive, but they are there for people to research and view, and I understand that this is not a reflection of Google feels about this issue. But if I ask Google assistant 'Why do Jews run the banks' we wouldn't be similarly accepting if it repeated and promoted conspiracy theories that likely pop up in organic search in her smoothing voice. Whether we agree or not, user perception of our responses, results, and answers of different products and mediums can change. And I think many people are used to the fact that organic search is a place where content should be accessible no matter how offensive it might be, however, the expectation is very different on a Google Home, a Knowledge Panel, or even YouTube. These lines are very difficult and can be very blurry, we are all well aware of this. So we've got huge teams that stay cognizant of these facts when we're crafting policies considering classifier changes, or reacting with manual actions - these decisions are not made in a vacuum, but admittedly are also not made in a highly public forum like TGIF or IndustryInfo (as you can imagine, decisions/agreement would be hard to get in such a wide list - image if all your CL's were reviewed by every engineer across Google all the time). I hope that answers some questions and gives a better layer of transparency without going into details about our 'Pepsi formula'. Best, DanielThe fact that Google manually curates politically contentious search results fits in with a wider pattern of political activity on the part of the tech giant. In 2018, Breitbart News exclusively published a leaked video from the company that showedsenior management in dismay at Trump's election victory[13], and pledging to use the company's power to make his populist movement a'hiccup' in history[14]. Breitbart also leaked'The Good Censor,'[15]an internal research document from Google that admits the tech giant is engaged in the censorship of its own products, partly in response to political events. Another leak revealed that employees within the company, including Google's current director of Trust and Safety,tried to kick Breitbart News off Google's market-dominating online ad platforms[16]. Yet another showed Google engaged intargeted turnout operations[17]aimed to boost voter participation in pro-Democrat demographics in 'key states' ahead of the 2016 election. The effort was dubbed a 'silent donation' by a top Google employee. Evidence for Google's partisan activities is now overwhelming.President Trump has previously warned Google[18], as well as other Silicon Valley giants, not to engage in censorship or partisan activities. Google continues to defy him. Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

The majority of the money (88pc) raised went to companies seeking expansion capital, according to the Irish Venture Capital Association, which measured the activity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Belfast-based financial cloud firm Options had the largest single fundraising event of the year with a (EURO)100m round in the first half of 2017.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dublin-based IT service company Version 1 was next, raising (EURO)90m from UK equity firm Volpi Capital.</p><p>Barry Napier's Cubic Telecom raised (EURO)40m in August, bringing the company's total funding close to (EURO)80m. The company, which employs 160 people in Sandyford, has deals in place with approximately 80 mobile operators around the world. It recently began trials with China Mobile, the world's biggest operator.</p><p>Smaller rounds include (EURO)10m each for telecoms firm Blueface and Atlantic Therapeutics.</p><p>The majority of funding rounds in Ireland are under (EURO)3m, while European venture capital funds have performed above average compared to other investment sources over the last 10 years.</p><p>2 The continued growth of tech multinationals in Ireland Last year saw both gains and losses in job counts for multinational tech firms based here. Facebook and Google continued to add to their huge Dublin presence, with Facebook nearing 2,000 staff and more promised for 2018.</p><p>Some other tech firms continued to similarly scale their presence in Dublin.</p><p>However, there were some job losses. HP let 500 people go when they announced the closure of their Leixlip site in February.</p><p>In October, Swedish tech giant Ericsson indicated that it would cut up to 130 jobs from its Irish operation, which is split between Athlone and Dublin.</p><p>3 The EU got even tougher with big tech While 2016 may have seen the biggest move against a multinational tech company in the form of the (EURO)16bn back-tax ruling against Apple, there was no let-up in 2017.</p><p>The European Commission fined Google (EURO)2.4bn for abuse of its dominant position as a search engine in giving its own shopping comparison service an unfair boost.</p><p>The penalty was the biggest-ever fine handed down by Brussels on a business in a competition case. It also made Amazon pay (EURO)250m in back tax to Luxembourg, which had allowed Amazon to channel a significant portion of its profits to a holding company without paying tax.</p><p>But while critics of the EU regulatory action claim geo-political bias, not everyone in the industry regarded it as a US-EU rivalry.</p><p>Oracle, Yelp and a handful of other big American companies supported the Commission's Google fine.</p><p>They even sent a letter of support to the European Commission about it. \"Google and its allies will no doubt continue to press through its lobbying and public relations machine the fiction that any adverse decision amounts to European protectionism,\" said the letter.</p><p>\"As US-based companies, we wish to go on record that enforcement action against Google is necessary and appropriate, not provincial. We have watched Google undermine competition in the United States and abroad.</p><p>\"Google operates on a global scale and across the entire online ecosystem, destroying jobs and stifling innovation.\"</p><p>4 A year when Ireland's planning system cost it a major infrastructure project In October, the High Court finally cleared the way for Apple to build a data centre in Athenry in Co Galway.</p><p>But after a delay of two years, Apple indicated it may not proceed with the project. The company, which prefers certainty in planning for the long term, lost faith in the country's higgledy-piggledy system of planning appeals and endless judicial review processes.</p><p>The company had seen a Danish data centre, announced at the same time as its Athenry project, completed in the time it took Irish authorities to give it the go-ahead. A second Danish data centre has now been commissioned by Apple.</p><p>The matter surfaced in a meeting between Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Apple chief executive Tim Cook in California toward the end of the year.</p><p>At that meeting, Mr Cook reportedly stopped short of reassuring the Taoiseach the project would still go ahead.</p><p>Other companies appeared to take note. \"There has been reputational damage to Ireland from what is happening in Athenry,\" said Tanya Duncan, managing director of Interxion, one of the biggest 'carrier neutral' data centre companies operating in Ireland.</p><p>\"This is especially so among the hyperscale players at the level of the Amazons and the Googles. There will be big companies who are thinking about putting their data centres in Ireland and now wondering 'Is there something up here?' \"Maybe when they dig into it, they'll discover that this sort of thing won't affect them.</p><p>\"But certainly, there would now be certain organisations questioning the option where they wouldn't before.\"</p><p>5 Ireland inched toward better rural broadband coverage For businesses in rural parts of Ireland, 2017 was a case of modest progress mixed with a little frustration. The improvements came in the shape of buildouts from Siro (the joint fibre broadband venture between Vodafone and the ESB) and Eir in regional towns.</p><p>In all, at least 150,000 additional premises (between residential and commercial) were added into fibre broadband connectivity during the year.</p><p>Eir also committed to an overall net connection increase of 300,000 businesses and homes in rural and regional areas not served by proper broadband by the end of 2018.</p><p>That's a sizable chunk of those outside cities who cannot get decent internet connectivity.</p><p>On the other hand, there were also setbacks. Siro decided to withdraw from the state-subsidised National Broadband Plan process at a late stage.</p><p>It meant that the shortlist of competitors for the massive scheme, which aims to connect every last rural business and home to fibre-grade broadband (540,000 in number), was reduced to two players: Eir and Enet.</p><p>That means less competition, which could yield a potentially bigger bill for the taxpayer and longer to wait until it begins (because the Government has fewer options if one of the remaining players asks for more time).</p><p>The event that caused Siro to withdraw was a deal between the government and Eir, which reduced the National Broadband Plan intervention area from 840,000 to 540,000. This, said Siro, made the proposition uneconomic for it to consider, subsidy or no subsidy. All of this contributed to further delays to the National Broadband Plan, which look set to affect timescales in 2018.</p><p>Whereas the Government had been intimating that rural businesses and residents would see the first wave of subsidised connections in 2018, this now looks likely to be confined to a handful of the 540,000 premises, if any at all.</p><p>6 Eir changed ownership again The biggest tech-related acquisition of the year in Ireland was Eir, which changed hands for the ninth time in 20 years.</p><p>This time, the new owner is Xavier Niel, a French telecoms billionaire who owns the 'Free' mobile operator and internet service provider in France and also co-owns 'Le' newspaper.</p><p>The deal, which saw Niel's NJJ consortium take a twothirds stake in Eir in a deal that values the company at (EURO)3.5bn, reportedly led to massive bonus payouts for Eir's senior management, running into the tens of millions for some high-ranking executives. The existing owners retained a minority share in the company.</p><p>7 The year that Facebook made enemies 2017 was the year when public opinion started to turn sour on the world's biggest social networks, treated as plucky, loveable underdogs up until this point. Facebook, in particular, became a target on multiple fronts, from its perceived role in facilitating 'fake news' stories to privacy, allowing Russian provocateurs to buy subversive ads and the psychological effect its services have on users.</p><p>Founder Mark Zuckerberg performed an about-turn on his view that the platform had little to answer for with regard to other countries' agencies undermining US elections through the purchase of ads and gaming of sharing algorithms. It also came under sustained pressure from social commentators, politicians and former executives over the behavioural effects that its service has on users.</p><p>This included criticism from Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook vice-president between 2007 and 2011, who said that he felt \"tremendous guilt,\" about the products he built because they were addictive and that Facebook was \"ripping apart the social fabric of how society works\".</p><p>Former Facebook president Shawn Fanning also piled on, claiming that he helped Facebook grow by \"exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology\". \"We need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while,\" he said. \"Because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever... it's a social-validation feedback loop.\"</p><p>Last year was also when media companies, long under siege through the loss of digital ad revenue to Facebook and Google, decided to ramp up their own hostility toward big social media and digital firms. However, the antipathy was not shared among the general public, who continue to use Facebook in growing numbers. In Ireland, Facebook has 2.4 million adult users with 1.7 million using it daily. That's a bigger overall audience than almost any other media entity.</p><p>8 The end of mobile roaming finally occurred Last year saw one huge gain for ordinary phone users, as the EU banned most mobile roaming fees between its 28 countries.</p><p>It was widely hailed as big step forward in consumer rights across the continent. However, the occasion was soured a little by a get-out clause for operators on mobile data. According to the law, consumers became entitled to around 2GB of EU roaming data for every (EURO)10 they spend on their normal monthly mobile plan here, up to the limit of what they get domestically. This can be imposed by the mobile operator even if the consumer has a large or 'all you can eat' data allowance at home.</p><p>So a person who spends (EURO)20 per month on a prepay mobile service that includes 30GB of data here would only be entitled to around 4GB of that data when travelling in the EU, before big roaming fees kick in again.</p><p>The EU move came as figures from Ireland's telecoms regulator show that Irish people now use their phones more for data services such as Facebook than for calls or texts.</p><p>10IT security and privacy breaches soared It was a year which saw an epidemic of ransomware attacks on businesses' computer systems and a large number of companies admitting that they had suffered cyberattacks.</p><p>The 'Wannacry' ransomware outbreak in May saw the HSE forced to take systems offline while they worked to fix them. That same ransomware malware caused havoc in UK hospitals.</p><p>Surveys showed that Irish small firms were particularly vulnerable to security woes during the year.</p><p>One poll by the business lobby group ISME indicated that 81pc of Irish small firms fell victim to cybercrime, with two-thirds saying they suffered a computer virus infection. Cybercrime is now the third most common crime reported by small businesses in Ireland after burglary and vandalism, according to the ISME survey.</p><p>But it wasn't just small companies who were attacked. Toward the end of the year, Yahoo admitted that all 3bn of its email accounts were hacked in 2013.</p><p>In what was described as the biggest shambles in recent security history, the company says it underestimated its initial tally of a 2013 breach.

Between privacy scandals, security gaffes, and the growing importance of the role technology plays in politics, authorities in the United States are in line with global trends and are re-examining the manner wherein the Silicon Valley and tech circles in the country are and\u2014 more importantly\u2014 aren't regulated. \"You cannot allow this power to accumulate in the hands of this few people,\" AG Hood said[1] in a recent interview. </p><p>Running low on friends The technology industry is largely responsible for the fact the U.S. continues to maintain its title of the world's strongest economy by virtually every metric conceivable. The combination of that state of affairs and the fact that the average entry-level position in the field most often attracts young, liberal-minded people is widely believed to be the reason why big tech was is traditionally big friends with left-leaning governments. That was most recently evident with the Obama administration which was particularly cozy with Google, though its relationship with the segment started growing cold during the 2016 presidential race which saw foreign election interference succeed on a large scale despite government warnings. E.g. President Obama personally warned Facebook co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg of Russian meddling in 2016 but the multi-billionaire did not perceive it as a credible threat until the damage was already done, as per his own admission. These days, the technology segment is being attacked by both sides of the political spectrum in the U.S. The right is still accusing it of leftist biases, with that sentiment being propagated on virtually all levels of the GOP, right up to the White House. President Trump publicly threatened Twitter and Google with regulations on numerous occasions during his first two years in the highest U.S. office, though nothing came of that so far. Then again, he also called Google \"a great compan[2]y\" when the Internet juggernaut was hit by the European Commission last year, having been served a record antitrust fine for anti-competitive practices related to the Android ecosystem. At the same time, the left side of the political spectrum in the U.S. is unsurprisingly still pushing for investigations into the 2016 interference and how it may have contributed to the loss of its candidate. Most of those looking to win the DNC nomination in 2020 went on record to criticize big tech; political heavyweight Elizabeth Warren did so most prominently, especially after Facebook slipped yet again and banned some of her ads criticizing it as a monopoly, subsequently feeling the full blow[3] of the Streisand effect. By most accounts, the technology sector in the U.S. is running low on friends in high places, facing that issue at a time when nationwide privacy regulations and other legislation aimed at curbing its reach seem likelier than ever. How it fares in light of those challenges remains to be seen but one thing is certain - smooth sailing in the near term is absolutely out of the question and the run-up to the 2020 election isn't going to be pretty for anyone involved.

Acrescenta que \"o aparecimento disruptivo, se n\u00e3o devidamente regulado e acompanhado, pode criar s\u00e9rios problemas com implica\u00e7\u00f5es na sociedade\".<br/>\"O regulador tem de estabelecer um \u2018level playing field\u2019 e nivelar as v\u00e1rias preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es de estabilidade financeira, prote\u00e7\u00e3o e privacidade dos dados, concorr\u00eancia. A Apple tem o seu sistema de pagamentos fechado e poderia ser integrado nas \u2018apps\u2019 dos bancos. Est\u00e1 estipulado o \u2018open banking\u2019 para os bancos e sabemos que estes novos \u2018players\u2019 t\u00eam muita informa\u00e7\u00e3o que seria muito \u00fatil para n\u00f3s mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 disponibilizada atrav\u00e9s da API\", sustenta Maria Jos\u00e9 Campos, administradora do Millennium bcp. <br/>\"O sistema banc\u00e1rio europeu, atrav\u00e9s dos desenvolvimentos que s\u00e3o feitos na EBF [Federa\u00e7\u00e3o Banc\u00e1ria Europeia], considera que assegurado um \u2018level playing field\u2019 correto, est\u00e1 em perfeitas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de enfrentar esta concorr\u00eancia por muito agressiva que seja.

No caso do MB Way, o Apple Pay impedia os pagamentos NFC (\"contactless\"). Na Su\u00ed\u00e7a, o Twint, rival de pagamento m\u00f3vel, pediu uma investiga\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 autoridade da concorr\u00eancia contra o Apple Pay que bloqueava o aplicativo Twint, quando um telefone digitalizava um c\u00f3digo QR para fazer um pagamento, diferendo que foi resolvido depois. Segundo Ricardo Chaves, \"a SIBS j\u00e1 pediu/exigiu \u00e0 Apple o acesso a essa pe\u00e7a de desenvolvimento para os bancos que est\u00e3o a por as funcionalidades MB Way nas \u2018apps\u2019 e para a pr\u00f3pria \u2018app\u2019 do MB Way\". Explica que \"h\u00e1 ano e meio que os clientes poderiam utilizar a funcionalidade, porque 70% da transacionalidade est\u00e1 no IOS e n\u00e3o pudemos fazer e tivemos de inventar um pagamento por Q-code, que \u00e9 menos eficaz, para contornar essa dificuldade, porque o regulador n\u00e3o decide\".<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Again, we'll see the details we have is simply that the energy secretary of the United States is stepping down, Rick Perry. No word yet on who might replace him, but a battle royal is on for that job. Here comes \"THE FIVE.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Martha MacCallum, and Greg. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump declaring a big win for America as Turkey agrees to a 120 hour ceasefire in Syria, ending the violence between that country and the Kurds. Here's the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: This is an amazing outcome. Now, this was something that they've been trying to get for ten years. You would have lost millions and millions of lives. They couldn't get it without a little rough love, as I called it. The process started and we started to negotiate. It's a great day for the United States. It's a great day for Turkey. The Kurds were great. A great day for the Kurds. It's really a great day for civilization.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: This comes as chaos erupts on Capitol Hill when top Democrats stormed out of the White House meeting on Syria, leading to a war of words between President Trump and Speaker Pelosi. They're accusing each other of having a meltdown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Why are our troops going to Saudi Arabia if we promised to bring them home? He said the Saudi Arabians are paying for it, really? We're putting our troops in harm's way for Saudi Arabia because they're paying -- it just didn't add up. And what it did do was cause a meltdown on the part of the president because he was unhappy with that -- those questions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: President Trump tweeted this photo calling out, quote, nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown. And she made it her twitter cover photo. Meanwhile, the media are predictably slamming Trump and praising Nancy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should Americans be worrying about the behavior of President Trump?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I mean, look at that photo of one woman standing up and, you know, giving it to the President of the United States at a table with all men.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president who surrendered again to Putin, who surrendered again to Syria, who has surrendered again to Iran. And I just want you to look at the people on the president's side of the table, the generals, the congressman, the leaders, bowing their heads in shame.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Let's now take it to our chief meltdown correspondent, Greg Gutfeld. What say you, Greg?</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: I love how -- was that Joe Scarborough?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: Remember, this is the guy whose sole employment skill is reading people's minds. He knows what they're thinking. Now, he can read body language. One thing that I'm tired of is the word meltdown. This phrase came from media blogs. Whenever they see somebody who gets mad or has a strong point of view, they go, ah, that person melted down. It is so overused. Nobody -- I doubt anybody melted down in that meeting. Trump didn't. Nancy didn't. Nobody melted down. It's an overused word. Let's ban it.</p><p>But here's my -- here's the big point here. So you say you care about the Kurds. You don't want the Kurds to die, but you walk out of a meeting because Donald Trump was rude to you. So, A, you really didn't care about the Kurds if, like, an insult made you leave. Or, B, you've been exaggerating the consequences of this entire story ever since. Case in point, nobody really knows or is talking about what's going on anymore.</p><p>It was basically just another strategically political attempt to mess with Trump, because why would you leave a meeting if you really care? I would - - if you're insulting me, Martha, right now, I would take it if it was to save Jesse's life.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WATTERS: Are you sure about that?</p><p>GUTFELD: No, I'm not sure. Juan, I would --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think that Greg might be right? Do you think she maybe went into the meeting ready to run out of there or do you think it was a spur of the moment thing?</p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS HOST: I mean, the picture stuff reminds me of just like bad, you know, high school social media, you know, tit for tat. And I'm thinking that people are looking down at the desk because they're lots of spit flying across the room.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: And so, they're probably just trying to stay out of it. But I agree with Greg, you know, this -- I think this is a very serious issue no matter which side of it you stand on. And I think there's a lot that's still to be resolved here regardless of what we heard this afternoon, whether or not the Kurds are going to accept this ceasefire. And I think that people look at what happened in that room yesterday and they say seriously?</p><p>WATTERS: Yeah.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You people cannot sit down and have a discussion on this? On the other hand, how are you supposed to do that given the environment? Everybody who is in that room on the other side of the table is telling him he's the most corrupt person to ever hold the White House office.</p><p>I mean, when people are saying we need -- you're illegitimate and you must go instantly. Now -- but please, come on over. Let's chat. I mean, this is an impossible environment for them to work --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Who invited them to the chat? It was the president who --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm sorry.</p><p>MACCALLUM: He says the opposite.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, obviously, it was at the White House --</p><p>GUTFELD: Don't meltdown, Juan.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, with climate change, anything is possible. But the second point I would make is that -- it was so many Republicans. This is not Democrats versus Republicans where he says, oh, it's just the Democrats. You know they don't like Trump. No, no, no. It was 129 Republicans who voted to condemn Trump's decision to pull the troops in Syria.</p><p>So here's a situation. What really angered him was when Nancy Pelosi said, Mr. President, I have to inform you that the majority of the House of Representatives condemning your decision on Syria, including 129 Republicans. And then that's when he started calling her a third-rate politician. So here's --</p><p>GUTFELD: A third grade.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Here's the thing, I don't usually give any advice to Donald Trump because he doesn't want to hear my words anyway.</p><p>GUTFELD: You wrote an entire book on him.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yeah, but that was about racism. But I will give him this political advice, Gregory.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think it's a mistake, and it's a proven mistake to think that Nancy Pelosi is any third-rate politician. Nancy Pelosi, go back, asked John Boehner. Ask Paul Ryan about accomplishments being Speaker. And you know -- at this table we thought, oh, she's not going to get reelected as speaker. She's a has-been. She's a historic figure at this point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: If she wants to save the Kurds, to walk out at a meeting over name-calling when Kurds are dying.</p><p>WILLIAMS: She's trying to get something done. All he's doing is calling - - look, this is a guy --</p><p>GUTFELD: She could have stayed.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Who is erratic here, Greg? Who's melting down to use your phrase? Is it -- did you see the letter he wrote to the Turkish president?</p><p>GUTFELD: A beautiful letter.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah. You're a damn fool, Mr. President.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: So what do you think about the fact that Nancy was the one that left, but all of her other Democratic colleagues, they've stayed.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's not true?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Schumer walked out, too.</p><p>WATTERS: It was Schumer and Nancy left, and everybody else stayed.</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes, it speaks to volumes --</p><p>GUTFELD: Schumer was carrying her jacket.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COMPAGNO: He says they insulted Nancy, so we left. It speaks volumes about their priorities. And this is a perfect illustration that contrary to what the Democrats are saying, the Democratic candidates, specifically, that, no, you cannot walk and chew gum at the same time. No, you cannot target Trump and legislate at the same time because in a meeting like this where it's the highest stakes ever, right? Lives being lost, you still can't get it together enough to legislate, which is what we are paying for. We are paying Pelosi and Schumer to legislate.</p><p>And to -- in that moment, to help come to a consensus and agree to save lives. Second point, they're squawking about the insult to the coequal branch of government, and I see Pelosi and Schumer as really equating themselves individually with the office of the presidency, rather than the executive and legislative branches being equal. They're not proving to me that their individual hubris is outranked by the duty to the American people.</p><p>WATTERS: So, to your second point that you made, Greg, remember when the president was thinking about impeachment on the way? He said if you're going to do impeachment, we're not gonna do anything. We're not going to get anything done. And it looks like that's happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, you know, what's interesting -- and to address Juan's illegitimate point about these Republicans, it is. There's a disconnect between the old guard and the old warriors and new thinking. You know, the problem with winning a war is you've got to stay there. The great thing about economic warfare, you can do it from home. And I think that's the way Trump sees it. He sees economic warfare, the threat that he did to North Korea, the threats he does to Turkey, as a way to pull the levers of globalism.</p><p>You know, globalism only works if you can manipulate the levers, right? So he's doing that instead of throwing American bodies into -- as he would call it, a pile of sand. So, I think instead of bombs to drop, levers to pull makes more sense. And I think the old guard -- even if people who are critical of this here, I don't think they're ready for this new kind of thinking.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So you think Republicans are the old guard. The Republicans who voted against Trump.</p><p>GUTFELD: I think, like, Lindsey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Here's what the reality is. If you do something on an erratic basis without thinking out the repercussions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, but wait. You look at the damage that he has done --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Fox News alert. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has notified President Trump today that he plans to resign, according to two administration sources familiar with the matter. Kevin Corke has more. What's up, Kev?</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Jess. We've actually learned -- you probably remembered this, a couple of weeks ago, Politico reported that Rick Perry would be stepping down probably in November, but by making the request today to leave the post of the president, it's very interesting because it makes us wonder was this related to the whole Ukraine story. In fact, sources tell Fox News that it was Perry along with E.U. ambassador, Sondland, Kurt Volker, all working with Rudy Giuliani on this idea of getting the Ukrainians to participate or at least not obstruct any possible investigations into malfeasance dating back to 2016.</p><p>That's what some sources are telling us. Again, keep this also in mind, Rick Perry has been on the job, guys, since March of 2017. So he's one of the originals. The idea that a secretary -- a cabinet secretary would step away after that much time is not that uncommon, but the timing and, in particular, this particular cabinet secretary, perhaps, stepping away very soon is curious.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, thank you very much, Kevin. Liberals are going to meltdown. Meltdown?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WATTERS: Over this next one, this very accurate election model shows, you know what, Trump winning reelection.</p><p>GUTFELD: Great news for Democrats. One of the most accurate predictors of presidential elections indicates that President Trump will easily win reelection. According to Moody's analytics, Trump should get at least 289 electoral votes and up to 351. Its projections are based on how voters feel about their finances, prospects for employment, which are awesome, and stock market gains which are great. But we knew this. People vote with their pocketbooks and Trump is fatting them up. Leftists would call this shallow, short sighted, self-interest, as if having more money to spend on food and clothes for your kids is insidiously selfish.</p><p>But is this great economy that explains the orchestrated drama driven by an angry media and its protective class, the Democrats. The better the country does, the crazier they become. Talk about cause and effect. So I said this was great news for the Democrats. Why? Well, now they can let it go and start planning for 2024. You can stop hammering Trump's personality, and instead find coherence, hopeful, positive systems that tackle real problems. And now that Trump has the big things running fine, he can focus on other stuff that could have lasting benefits too.</p><p>A climate plan that puts nuclear front and center, a strategy that helps the mentally ill off the streets, and a plan to end rampant homelessness. Of course, for these things to happen he's going to need help. What are the chances the Dems might stop chasing fake problems and help solve real ones? Well, we can dream.</p><p>So, Martha, I think the theory for this is that no one takes risks on an economy that's flowing smoothly. You don't, like, decide you're going to put Bernie in, you know, like, if this thing is going great.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I mean, when you look, historically, there've only been two presidents in recent history who have been able to unseat a sitting president, and who are they? You know, two of the biggest superstars in political history, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. So you look at that stage and you ask yourself, is there somebody who has that kind of star power, that kind of vision? And both of them, you know, what they won on was just like a super uplifting new vision for America. And I think that's one of the things that's really missing from these Democratic debates is that sort of, you know, uplifting image.</p><p>GUTFELD: Marianne Williamson and they totally --</p><p>MACCALLUM: She's on my show tonight --</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, can you tell her hello.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I sure will.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yeah, I think we have a special connection.</p><p>MACCALLUM: She said there's no way I'm dropping out after I saw what I saw --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's like -- she's above all of that. And she's like looking down at them and going, those fools. Jesse, I'm losing my train of thought here --</p><p>WATTERS: Yeah, you're going to be hanging out in the green room --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: You notice the stronger our economy gets, the more intense the Dems hatred is for Trump?</p><p>WATTERS: I have such a great statistic that I cannot wait to share with America. You guys ready for this? Average household income for middle- class families, eight years under President Bush went up $400. Eight years under Barack Obama went up $1,000. In just two and a half years under President Trump, average middle-class family income has gone up $5,000 in two and a half years. And when you add the tax cuts to that, it's $6,000. That is a $6,000 raise for average families in two and half years. They have never seen that kind of income boost in -- I don't know? Maybe the last 20.</p><p>So when you add that to the fact that you have an economy producing a lot of jobs, low unemployment, stock market up 34 percent, crime is down. Household prices are up. It's a beautiful economy and it's a middle-class boom that's going on. And the only thing that can really screw it up is a major thing with China, or maybe a self-inflicted wound by the president.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You're really depressing Juan.</p><p>WATTERS: I know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I just realized, you know, if you ask most Americans, right now, they talk about income inequality, struggling to make it --</p><p>GUTFELD: Where are these people?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know what? Here's the thing, I happen to agree with you that if just you look at the economic numbers, they look fine. You say -- but here's the curious thing because Moody's analysis is based on those economic numbers. By the way, they also said Hillary was going to win.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But here's the thing, most Americans can see the economy doing what -- if you believe --</p><p>WATTERS: The census bureau?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, Jesse --</p><p>WATTERS: The census bureau?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Jesse, you push -- believe me, if the middle-class felt the way you did, why is it, and this is the point, why is it that, in fact, President Trump has never reached 50 percent approval.</p><p>GUTFELD: Because you don't have to like your boss.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I see. In other words, most Americans say they're not going to vote to reelect Trump. Oh, so in other words, Moody is based on a model in which they have a normal president. This guy is not a normal president.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: He's abnormal. Everybody knows that.</p><p>WATTERS: It's political model and the analysis as well. It's not just economics. No, look at the statistics, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And here's the thing, do know what his average is right now, Real Clear Politics? Forty two percent -- oh, wait a minute. You were just citing a poll.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily, I want to hear you explain why this is so important to America. No pressure.</p><p>COMPAGNO: In my opinion, it's because this illustrates what is fundamental to voters which is economic security. It's being able to provide for your family, right? So everything that the Democratic candidates have been talking about, it's relevant. All those issues are relevant, sure. But they're missing the mark. And we saw that, especially, coming from CNN who lead with a question of impeachment and never asked an independent question on jobs or the economy.</p><p>But at the end of the day, what people are doing when they're sitting around their dinner table is caring about their job security and where their paychecks are going to come from and whether they can count on it. And I think that -- there was a caveat in that model also about voter turnout, and that's why it's so crucial that Trump has been leading these really successful campaign style rallies.</p><p>Obviously, tonight he's in Dallas. It's his third this week, his sixth time in Texas this year alone, 12 since he took office. And that's more than Obama went to Texas in his entire administration. That's huge for Republicans and will continue to be throughout this --</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, healthcare -- healthcare, paying for college, these are economic issues and Trump has done nothing.</p><p>GUTFELD: More important, Juan, caveat.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Caveat?</p><p>GUTFELD: Caveat.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Caveat.</p><p>GUTFELD: Caveat.</p><p>WATTERS: Caviar.</p><p>GUTFELD: Caviar. I just like -- pain in the ass. Next, Beto's gun grab plan gets worse. That's next.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Beto O'Rourke drawing major criticism over his plan for a mandatory assault weapons buyback program. The 2020 Democrat has made it a big issue in the campaign. He's now elaborating more on what the consequences would be for people who refused to give up their guns.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's say I have an AR-15. I bought it legally five years ago. I'm a law-abiding citizen. You want to buy it back as President of the United States, I say no. I live on a ranch. I need it for protection. What would you do then?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There has to be consequences. You know, in that case, I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and to make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be potentially used against somebody else.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Emily, at the last debate, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, said that he thought Beto was playing into Republicans' efforts to scare gun owners to back Trump with this kind of talk. What do you think?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, I think Beto's entire proposal and his continued digging of holes is complete fantasy. It is not achievable, it's not actionable, and he is living in a world that -- it's doublespeak. So for all of his shouting about the needless lives that are being sacrificed in Syria, what would that do? Whose lives would he be sacrificing? To me, it would be uniformed men and women who are going to these places, and as he said, oh, but your fellow Americans, they would volunteer their arms back. No, they wouldn't.</p><p>And we also are now dealing with the Atiana Jackson situations. So, to me, it's turning both law-abiding gun-owning citizens and also our uniformed men and women into cannon fodder, if something as ridiculous as this plan, actually, came into effect.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, Jesse, I was interested in seeing exactly what kind of support this has. Right now a majority of Americans, majority of Democrats, and remember he's running for the Democratic nomination, support background checks, bans on assault weapons, 70 percent of Democrats support mandatory buyback, just under half of all Americans.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, more polls, huh, Juan. I don't believe that. And I just don't think that's accurate. We're joking on Wednesday on Watters' last night that Beto likes to livestream things like his dentist appointment. Maybe he should livestream knocking on peoples doors and telling them to turn their guns over. That will go viral because that will not go well.</p><p>Here's the deal, Juan, and you can write this down because these are some great statistics, Emily. According to the FBI, did you know that knives kill more people than rifles? And not only that, hammers and blunt objects kill more people than rifles. Rifles like an AR is demonized because a lot of these mass shooters like to use them, but if you've ever notice whenever there's a mass shooting with a pistol or a shotgun, the media doesn't really report it that much.</p><p>It's called America's favorite weapon for a reason. It's lightweight. It's versatile. It's accurate. You can use it for self-defense, for sport, for anything -- hunting. And so, they're sold very well because people love them and there's millions of them. And the feds can't track who has them or where they are, so you don't know when you're showing up as an armed federal agent, you're knocking on the door if anybody even has a gun. So, how does that make sense at all? It's like -- it's like a second Lexington and Concorde. I don't even know if he realizes that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, Martha, let's give Beto the benefit of the doubt. He says people are trying to, sort of, nitpick and says what about this, what about that, who gets the weapons? He says look at the big picture, look at the mass killings. We've got to do something about it. Americans want to do something and this is his idea. He doesn't want to get into the details because as Jesse says, some of them don't seem practical.</p><p>MACCALLUM: But that's the problem. You know, it's so much of what he proposes is almost like he's thinking through what his plan is in the middle of his answer. He says, yeah. Yes, so, of course -- well, yeah. But I think those people would just give up their AR-15 -- 47. He says they would concede that they don't need it for self-protection.</p><p>In what world in terms of Joe Scarborough's scenario where someone is living on a ranch and they say I need this for protection. And Beto is sort of like coming up with this plan as he speaks that he's going to knock on the door and they're going to give it up and say, you know what, , I actually don't need this thing for protection.</p><p>Now, no matter what you think about these horrific shootings that we have in this country. You need to come up with a plan that is a little bit more planned out, little bit more thought out. The last time they did a ban on assault weapons, it had a grandfather clause for people who already have them. And it tried to address the new acquisition of assault weapons in this country. Perhaps raising the age, like they did in Florida is a constructive way to think about diminishing some of the ownership of these weapons, if he thinks that's the way to go. But, you know, it's not well thought out.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And what do you think about registry, a registry for people who have assault weapons?</p><p>GUTFELD: I kind of want to - I think that - you set the big picture and I think Beto has never had to really do anything for himself. People that do things for him. And so, he is making this suggestion knowing he will never have to get his hands dirty. And when you think about like - it's the same idiotic bureaucracy who banned the selling of - the sale of single cigarettes, which led to the horrible death of Eric Garner.</p><p>So, if you didn't have that bureaucratic, stupid law, that person would still be alive. So, what he is doing, as you say, this confiscation fantasy puts people in harm's way and people will die. So, this goes to the bigger picture of how you can become a libertarian. You have to ask yourself; how many conflicts were the result of a decision made by someone who knows his hands will never be dirty? You think about whether it's Syria, whether it's guns, whether it's like the drug war. Do you feel strongly enough to do it yourself? Do you feel strongly enough to confiscate opioids or guns or go to Syria? That turns you into a libertarian extremely fast.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But obviously Australia, they did do a ban. They did a buyback and it worked.</p><p>GUTFELD: Australia, very few guns to buyback.</p><p>COMPAGNGO: In this country, it's treated by symptom, not the problem. He's not addressing the epidemic of young people that are taking their own lives and streaming and doing all of this for the attention, the horrific aspects, the components behind these shootings. He's just talking about the weapon.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, coming up, Dana Perino joins us for a preview of her exclusive interview with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. It's going to be great. Stay here.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. So, the battle over free speech on social media is already having a huge impact on the 2020 election and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is just one of the tech CEOs standing in the center of that storm. And he was just interviewed by Dana for an exclusive interview that will air tomorrow at 2 PM on The Daily Briefing. Here's a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Kamala Harris said that she thinks that Twitter should shut down President Trump's account. Do you think that's a ridiculous idea?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: My belief is that in a democracy, I don't think that we want private companies censoring politicians in the news. Well, I generally believe that as a principle, people should decide what is credible and what they want to believe and who they want to vote for. And I don't think that should be something that we want tech companies or any kind of other company doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Dana joins us live now from Washington. Dana, great to have you.</p><p>PERINO: Thanks. Thanks for filling in.</p><p>MACCALLUM: It's my pleasure. So, tell me what the big takeaway was for you in this interview.</p><p>PERINO: Well, I've sort of been racing around today, racing to get over to Georgetown where he gave a speech. Mark Zuckerberg came to Washington to give a speech about free expression. He thinks it's under attack and he wanted to basically lay down a marker.</p><p>I think that he knows that Washington is planning to try to come at him and basically three different areas. They think that he is too big. Right. They want to - some people want to break up the company altogether. They think he's too nosy, that all of your data and your privacy and how they're dealing with that.</p><p>And they think that basically is irresponsible. And so, Washington is coming after them. He thinks though that free speech is just something that they have to talk about, whether it comes to talking about ads or this idea that it's dangerous to listen to speech. That was something - I also asked him about the ongoing issue that they'd had starting way back in about 2015, 2016, about bias against conservatives or the perception about that and how they've tried to deal with that. And if he thinks that there is a lot of bias just baked into Silicon Valley.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, Dana, I am just dying to see this because I'm very interested in this topic. I think you're right in thinking that it's one of the critical issues for the 2020 election. Already we see, you know, reports from Facebook about China and other countries following the Russian model. So, here's the thing.</p><p>I just saw a comment that came from the Biden camp and they said, basically that Zuckerberg is using the First Amendment free speech issues to shield himself from having to take some responsibility for enabling lies, deceitful political ads to appear and making money from it. So, the question then becomes, why not just don't take any political ads? It wouldn't make that much difference to him, to his bottom-line.</p><p>PERINO: Actually, he did say that, of course, that's on the table, that this is not a really big part of their business. They don't make a lot of money; it gets compared to the size and scope and scale of their business. But he also said though that for people that are wanting to build a grassroots campaign to try to get out there and get some name ID, and maybe they don't have a lot of money.</p><p>It's interesting, Senator Elizabeth Warren, she says she won't take any money from big tech executives. But the only way that she's actually able to get her grassroots fundraising and be able to - be the front runner is because she spends a ton of money, millions dollars in ads on Facebook and outreach on Facebook and trying to figure out a way to get engagement that way. So, shutting that out, shutting that off from people from that might not be rich. I think that he thinks that's a bad idea.</p><p>But he also thinks that the company and that being Silicon Valley, it should not be the ones that are deciding what's true and what's not. And that's really frustrated somebody like Senator Warren or a Joe Biden.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Dana, you just brought up Liz Warren and it's not just the Democrats. Republicans have talked about busting up all these Silicon Valley monopolies like Facebook or other ones. And he said in an internal memo that he's ready to go to war because this is about survival. Did you get a sense from him how aggressively he's gearing up for what would be just kind of an all-out battle in Washington, D.C., if that ever happened?</p><p>PERINO: I think what you'll see in this interview is what you've seen from Mark Zuckerberg before. He's passionate, but his tone is very measured and he's very calm. But they did say - they put a lot of resources into making sure that the protections are better for the 2020 election. In fact, he was talking about the amount of money that they've put towards all of that is bigger than the money that they actually earned or that they were worth on the day that they went public. So, they've put a lot of resources into that.</p><p>When it comes to breaking up Facebook, he just basically said not a monopoly. We're not trying to shut out competition. We're trying to do the best we can in terms of utilizing this new technology. And I think that they will definitely be pushing back on that in particular. But he did say, Jesse, that he is willing to consider some regulation when it comes to content. And there are some libertarians, conservatives who think that's a real slippery slope if you allow the government to start doing that.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, sure is.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Dana, obviously, social media companies are not traditional media companies, and that's partly why we have so many questions and are exploring this together, along with him obviously riding that wave. Did he talk to you at all about the level of responsibility that he feels for - for example, the Salesforce CEO said, it's the new cigarette to kids, everyone is addicted to, even if they wanted to. They can't extricate themselves from the attractive nuisance, essentially that he has created and also that level of data privacy that he has control over.</p><p>PERINO: Yes. We touched on all of those issues. I didn't ask him specifically about his - I don't know if he even call him a peer, but the CEO, the founder of Salesforce.com, Marc Benioff, who was on Maria Bartiromo show the other day, I think that he has said, Marc Benioff has said that he's got a political future ahead of him possibly. So, I think he's jumping on a certain bandwagon and we'll see where that goes.</p><p>GUTFELD: Dana, I heard there was a meltdown, there was a big meltdown.</p><p>PERINO: But you know what, you couldn't foresee. It was like imperceptible.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, he blinked. When he blinked, that was - has he been affected politically? Do you sense that he's kind of no longer like a social justice phony from Silicon Valley, that he's kind of been you know, he's changed in a way, learned from this, that he can't trust the Left?</p><p>PERINO: I think that he is being true to himself now. I don't know if that means that he wasn't before or if he - I think that he is alarmed by the tendency for people to want to shut down free speech. That's why I asked him the question about Kamala Harris, the senator from California wanting to shut down the President's Twitter account. Does he think that's ridiculous?</p><p>Basically, yes, he wants people to be able to speak freely. And also, he believes that free speech and expression is America's best value and it should be protected. And given the last, for example, to which we've just seen that what the NBA has been going through in this ongoing battle online about China. I think he's probably right.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Wow. I mean, still, such an uncharted territory dealing with this. And it's so interesting. I think Greg's question, so interesting about dealing with the Left and the Right. And now he finds himself basically in the middle unsatisfying pretty much everybody, except the millions and millions of people. Jesse also did have a good question.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily's question.</p><p>PERINO: I mean Juan's question was like--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Thank you, Dana.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Very sensitive. All right, guys. Thank you, Dana.</p><p>PERINO: See you tomorrow.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Great to see you. We'll see you back here tomorrow. Coming up next, what is the proper tip for poor service? We will settle that debate once and for all. I was a waitress for like eight years, so I do have some thoughts on that.</p><p>GUTFELD: Me too.</p><p>COMPAGNO: How much do you tip for bad service? A new article says you still have to give 20 percent no matter what. \"Diners should always tip 20 percent. Always.\" If the service is terrific, you should add more to the tip, but never subtract from the 20 percent.</p><p>All right. I waited tables. I know you did, too. I always tip 20 percent. But also, I'm not afraid to communicate what I want or what I need. Right. I'm not passive aggressive like I feel like so many people are there like she was horrible. I'm giving her nothing like say, oh, I actually need water regularly or whatever it is. But if somebody gets my drip coffee, no, I'm not tipping. But they'll get a thank you and good morning, have a great day.</p><p>GUTFELD: What was the question.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm giving my opinion. Martha, how do you feel?</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, in terms of the thing that really tips me off is the iPad thing that they hold up in your face after they give you coffee and say like, do you want to tip me 10, 15 or 20 percent and just like--</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, right in front of them.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I hate that.</p><p>WATTERS: I'm not afraid to go zero.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Zero.</p><p>GUTFELD: Jesse.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, I mean all you're doing is handing me coffee. Do you get a tip for that?</p><p>MACCALLUM: You're supposed to say, how much you want to tip me and they're looking over your shoulder?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I think that's obnoxious.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too aggressive.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I think that's obnoxious. But I think most people tip the way they tip, like you could have, you could really serve a table and do a fantastic job. And if they're 15 percent tippers, they're going to tip you 15 percent. If they're 20 percent tippers, you could like do nothing and ignore them on like they're going to give you 20 percent, which doesn't make any sense.</p><p>WATTERS: Martha, you know the tip jar where there's like a jar at the coffee shop. And then do you ever, like, put a dollar in, but then they don't see you putting the dollar in. So, you just kind of leave your hand over and until they come back. You want credit.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You want a little credit. I get it.</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. A, do you want to know why we're living in a great age? Because this is The Washington Post doing this article. So, they're telling people that they have to tip - a liberal newspaper is telling people to tip 20 percent under the assumption that we're all - we all can afford to pay 20 percent of the bill. You would not see this piece in the Carter era or the Obama era. They're telling people how to tip.</p><p>And the worst thing is the media doesn't understand economics. Right. They're pushing minimum wage in restaurants. In New York right now, they're slashing all their staffs because they can't afford to keep these people on. So, now you have smaller staffs at restaurants, which means poorer service, which means fewer customers and fewer tips. So, as they're lecturing us on 20 percent tips, they're killing an industry where people will get fewer tips. They're idiots. Sorry.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think you're missing the point here, because it's not about tip jars or the computer where it says, give me a tip if it just gave me a cup of coffee. This is about restaurants who are battling, I think, in some ways to transfer their labor costs to you, the diner or the consumer. These are people who are going out to dinner who can afford a good dinner.</p><p>And the question is, if you get bad service and you've gone to a nice tablecloth restaurant, are you obligated to tip 20 percent? And what the paper was saying, there is an interesting argument was, well, if you have a bad day at work, if Jesse and I are arguing and the boss's upstairs, they wanted Jesse, why are you arguing? Did they say, oh, we're not going to pay you what we normally pay you today? No, we get paid.</p><p>GUTFELD: They should.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And so--</p><p>WATTERS: Why more?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's maybe right. But anyway, why should you be taking it out? And what if it's the kitchen that screwed up? Why would you take it out on the person who is waiting at your table? So, it's an interesting question. I tend to feel embarrassed by not giving 20 percent, but I let them know like you suggested, Emily, I didn't like the way I was treated.</p><p>WATTERS: And if you're drunk, you give 30.</p><p>MACCALLUM: OK. One More Thing is up next.</p><p>WATTERS: Time now for One More Thing. Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A heartfelt goodbye to Congressman Elijah Cummings of Baltimore. The 68-year-old had been in declining health for some time, even as he served as Chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee on Capitol Hill. Everyone should know that Republicans and Democrats call this man a friend. He got to know Jason Chaffetz, for example, in the midst of the contentious Benghazi hearings.</p><p>But get this, he once traveled to Utah to visit the congressman's home district. And in exchange, Chaffetz traveled to Baltimore, Maryland, to get to see what Congressman Cummings district was like. He's a historic Baltimore figure. He's served as a speaker pro tem in the Maryland House of Delegates, head of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p><p>Finally, I think GOP congresswoman Liz Cheney said it best today, she said. Cummings used his positions of power to \"bridge divides\", not widen them. Rest in peace, Congressman Cummings?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, congressman will be missed. And it is time for a feeding frenzy. OK, so in time for fall, we have a great comfort food combo. We have grilled cheese combined with tomato soup, great combination into a chip produced by Lay's potato chips. Why doesn't everybody pop some into their mouth? Greg's already had about several dozen.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: They hit the stores October 21st. And here's the deal. Go online. Got to have lays.com, upload a picture of you with the chips and you win a lot of free stuff. So, check that out. Very good, right. Like it. These are great.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I literally had 20.</p><p>WATTERS: Greg,</p><p>GUTFELD: Let's do this thing. Greg's Fox News, a lot of big news at Fox. You want to hear what happened? Check this out. This is a - the winner of the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year award, that is Tibetan thought about to devour a Himalayan marmot as he was hunting to keep its three cubs alive. This was the one winner out of 48,000 entries. Do you know where this picture was taken, Martha?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Where?</p><p>GUTFELD: The Chateau Marmot.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Really?</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>MACCALLUM: He looks terrified by the way. He looks like he knows exactly what's about to happen.</p><p>GUTFELD: The face is like; I'm going to die.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, the face was this is good wine.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. This is big news, actually. The Iwo Jima photographed by Joe Rosenthal. They discovered another person whose identity was not correctly identified. In the beginning, you all remember the movie Flags of Our Fathers and the book about that. So Randy Gannon, who was believed to have been one of the flag raisers, we now know was not, he was there at the top of Mount Suribachi. But when the flag was actually raised, it was Corporal Harold Keller, whose nickname was Pie. And he never told his family his whole life that he was one of the flag raisers.</p><p>He had a photo in the house, and he would say those are those are the guys that lifted the flag. Never wanted to reveal his role because it had been attributed to someone else. And his daughter is going to be on tonight. I've been working on a book for two years about Pearl Harbor, Iwo Jima, it's very personal story for me. And I hope you join me tonight to talk to his daughter because it's a really special story.</p><p>WATTERS: Wow. And you have Marianne Williamson.</p><p>MACCALLUM: And we have Marianne Williamson.</p><p>WATTERS: Very good show. All right, Emily.</p><p>COMPAGNO: OK, everybody hates to wait in line, right? Except this little guy. Check him out. This pelican literally got an orderly line. This is a New South Wales in Australia at a popular fish and chips shop. And what I love about it, too, is that it's kind of doesn't faze anyone except for this kid. I hate parents that don't control their children. I really wish that Pelican had hooked him, by the way--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. What are you talking about?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm not sweet Emily anymore.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Wow. I don't have to talk to her. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE. Special Report is up next. Hey, Bret.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I thought Emily was nice. Thanks, Jesse. Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, President Trump.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019101701cb258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X98-R1M1-JB20-G2K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7134\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Beto O'Rourke</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gun Control</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mark Zuckerberg</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elizabeth Warren</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Freedom of Speech</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elijah Cummings</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

The Company has received the support of a majority (65,77%1) of its lenders under the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility and of Bpifrance Participations, an institutional shareholder. </p><p>This Agreement in Principle, whose terms and conditions are described in more details below, provides a framework for long-term sustainability for the Company's businesses, employees, customers and suppliers, and offers its current shareholders an opportunity to participate in the Company's recovery. Based on the proposed new financing plan, gross debt2 is to decrease from the current position of \u201a\u00ac1,444 million to \u201a\u00ac1,102 million. The net debt to EBITDA target (post IFRS 16 adjustments) is around 3x at end of 2021, decreasing thereafter.</p><p>Furthermore, the Company announces the opening today of an accelerated financial safeguard procedure, in order to facilitate the implementation of the Agreement in Principle, by the Paris commercial Court.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Status of the restructuring process</p><p>In February 2020, Technicolor informed the market of its intention to launch a \u201a\u00ac300 million rights issue by June 30th 2020 at the latest, which was authorized by the general meeting of the Company's shareholders on March 23rd 2020. Since then, the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the business activities of the Group, and the uncertainty in global market conditions, have rendered it difficult to launch the initially contemplated rights issue within the contemplated timeline, and have increased the liquidity needs of the Group, which were originally intended to be covered by the rights issue. </p><p>In May, the Company launched a confidential process aiming at raising a new money facility replacing the rights issue in order to finance the group's operations and to repay the $110 million bridge loan due on July 31st. </p><p>Technicolor has received offers both from third parties and from existing creditors, including notably, as announced in the June 4th press release, an offer from a group of creditors representing 59% at that time of the Term Loan B and the Revolving Credit Facility, in the framework of the conciliation proceedings opened on June 2nd. This proposal addresses both the Group's liquidity requirements and the need to deleverage the Company's balance sheet, through a combination of a rights issue (fully backstopped by the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility lenders by way of set-off of their claims) and a capital increase reserved to the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility lenders (subscribed by way of set-off of their claims). </p><p>Upon the recommendation of the Comit\u00e9 Ad Hoc (appointed by the board in the context of the debt restructuring and composed of a majority of independent directors) and given the potential significant dilution implied by such capital increases, the Board of Directors decided on June 5th to appoint, on a voluntary basis, Finexsi (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:g.windsor@finexsi.com\">g.windsor@finexsi.com</email> / 01 43 18 42 42), as independent appraiser, in accordance with article 261-3 of the AMF General Regulation. Finexsi will, in particular, issue a fairness opinion on the proposed capital increases. </p><p>On June 11th, the Company announced the launching of a waiver consent solicitation of its existing lenders under its Credit Facilities, in order to allow the Company to have the option to request (i) the opening in France of a \"proc\u00e9dure de sauvegarde financi\u00c3\u00a8re acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e\" (which is a form of pre-negotiated safeguard procedure with financial creditors only) (\"SFA\") on Technicolor SA and (ii) the recognition of the SFA in the US, in accordance with applicable regulations (the \"Recognition Procedure\"), without such actions constituting an event of default under the Credit Facilities.</p><p>After having received waiver consents from the requisite majority of its lenders, the Company therefore decided on June 18th to file a request for the opening in France of an SFA, with the Recognition Procedure to be filed shortly after the SFA has been opened. The SFA was effectively opened today.</p><p>The SFA allows for the implementation of the transaction with only a 2/3 majority of impacted lenders under the Credit Facilities. As of today, lenders representing 65,77% of the principal amount of the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility, as well as Bpifrance Participations, an institutional shareholder holding c. 7.5% of the share capital (the \"Ad Hoc Group\"), support the Agreement in Principle, setting out the terms and conditions of the debt restructuring of the Group, as further detailed below.</p><p>Technicolor intends to implement the debt restructuring provided for by the Agreement in Principle in the framework of an SFA plan which remains subject to conditions precedent as further detailed below, in particular to a favorable vote by an extraordinary shareholders' meeting of the Company (the \"EGM\") on certain aspects of the SFA plan, and to French court approval.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Key Transaction Principles</p><p>The Agreement in Principle sets forth the following key principles (the \"Restructuring\"): </p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>New money in an aggregate principal amount, net of Original Issue Discount (\"O.I.D.\") and underwriting fees, equal to \u201a\u00ac 420 million, to be made available, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, to Technicolor's Affiliates by (i) any lenders under the TLB and the RCF who wish to participate, in an amount of \u201a\u00ac400 million (fully underwritten by the Ad Hoc Group excluding Bpifrance Participations) and (ii) by Bpifrance Participations in an amount of \u201a\u00ac20 million (the \"New Money Lenders\"), as follows:\u00a0  <list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>initial new money to be made available around \u00a0mid-July to Technicolor USA, Inc.

The Company has received the support of a majority (65,77%1) of its lenders under the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility and of Bpifrance Participations, an institutional shareholder. This Agreement in Principle, whose terms and conditions are described in more details below, provides a framework for long-term sustainability for the Company's businesses, employees, customers and suppliers, and offers its current shareholders an opportunity to participate in the Company's recovery. Based on the proposed new financing plan, gross debt2 is to decrease from the current position of \u20ac1,444 million to \u20ac1,102 million. </p><p>The net debt to EBITDA target (post IFRS 16 adjustments) is around 3x at end of 2021, decreasing thereafter. Furthermore, the Company announces the opening today of an accelerated financial safeguard procedure, in order to facilitate the implementation of the Agreement in Principle, by the Paris commercial Court. 1. Status of the restructuring process In February 2020, Technicolor informed the market of its intention to launch a \u20ac300 million rights issue by June 30th 2020 at the latest, which was authorized by the general meeting of the Company's shareholders on March 23rd 2020. Since then, the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the business activities of the Group, and the uncertainty in global market conditions, have rendered it difficult to launch the initially contemplated rights issue within the contemplated timeline, and have increased the liquidity needs of the Group, which were originally intended to be covered by the rights issue. In May, the Company launched a confidential process aiming at raising a new money facility replacing the rights issue in order to finance the group's operations and to repay the $110 million bridge loan due on July 31st. Technicolor has received offers both from third parties and from existing creditors, including notably, as announced in the June 4th press release, an offer from a group of creditors representing 59% at that time of the Term Loan B and the Revolving Credit Facility, in the framework of the conciliation proceedings opened on June 2nd. This proposal addresses both the Group's liquidity requirements and the need to deleverage the Company's balance sheet, through a combination of a rights issue (fully backstopped by the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility lenders by way of set-off of their claims) and a capital increase reserved to the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility lenders (subscribed by way of set-off of their claims). Upon the recommendation of the Comit Ad Hoc (appointed by the board in the context of the debt restructuring and composed of a majority of independent directors) and given the potential significant dilution implied by such capital increases, the Board of Directors decided on June 5th to appoint, on a voluntary basis, Finexsi (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:g.windsor@finexsi.com\">g.windsor@finexsi.com</email> [2] / 01 43 18 42 42), as independent appraiser, in accordance with article 261-3 of the AMF General Regulation. Finexsi will, in particular, issue a fairness opinion on the proposed capital increases. On June 11th, the Company announced the launching of a waiver consent solicitation of its existing lenders under its Credit Facilities, in order to allow the Company to have the option to request (i) the opening in France of a 'procdure de sauvegarde financire acclre' (which is a form of pre-negotiated safeguard procedure with financial creditors only) ('SFA') on Technicolor SA and (ii) the recognition of the SFA in the US, in accordance with applicable regulations (the 'Recognition Procedure'), without such actions constituting an event of default under the Credit Facilities. After having received waiver consents from the requisite majority of its lenders, the Company therefore decided on June 18th to file a request for the opening in France of an SFA, with the Recognition Procedure to be filed shortly after the SFA has been opened. The SFA was effectively opened today. The SFA allows for the implementation of the transaction with only a 2/3 majority of impacted lenders under the Credit Facilities. As of today, lenders representing 65,77% of the principal amount of the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility, as well as Bpifrance Participations, an institutional shareholder holding c. 7.5% of the share capital (the 'Ad Hoc Group'), support the Agreement in Principle, setting out the terms and conditions of the debt restructuring of the Group, as further detailed below. Technicolor intends to implement the debt restructuring provided for by the Agreement in Principle in the framework of an SFA plan which remains subject to conditions precedent as further detailed below, in particular to a favorable vote by an extraordinary shareholders' meeting of the Company (the \"EGM\") on certain aspects of the SFA plan, and to French court approval. 2. Key Transaction Principles The Agreement in Principle sets forth the following key principles (the 'Restructuring'): New money in an aggregate principal amount, net of Original Issue Discount ('O.I.D.') and underwriting fees, equal to \u20ac 420 million, to be made available, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, to Technicolor's Affiliates by (i) any lenders under the TLB and the RCF who wish to participate, in an amount of \u20ac400 million (fully underwritten by the Ad Hoc Group excluding Bpifrance Participations) and (ii) by Bpifrance Participations in an amount of \u20ac20 million (the \"New Money Lenders\"), as follows: initial new money to be made available around mid-July to Technicolor USA, Inc.

The New Money shall also be secured by certain other security interests, including by security over the assets currently securing the Bridge Loan (for the US New Money only), the TLB and the RCF. The existing indebtedness of the Group (together, the 'Credit Facilities') will be restructured, as follows: Bridge Loan would be repaid using the proceeds of the injection of the US New Money; $125 million asset-based loan made available to TCH US on November 6th 2017 and certain other US members of the Group (the \"ABL Facility\") to be amended, in particular to extend the final maturity date of the loan to December 2023, and to allow the implementation of all of the transactions contemplated herein in order to achieve the Restructuring;\u20ac725 million plus $290 million term loan facility dated December 6th 2016 (the 'Term Loan B' or \"TLB\") made available to the Company to be partially equitized as described below and, in respect of the reinstated debt, amended as to extend the maturity to December 2024 with a bullet repayment;\u20ac250 million revolving credit facility dated December 21st 2016 (the 'Revolving Credit Facility' or the \"RCF\") made available to the Company (fully drawn to date) to be partially equitized as described below and, in respect of the reinstated debt, amended as to extend the maturity to December 2024 with a bullet repayment. The partial equitization of the debt (up to \u20ac 660 million) will be structured as follows, subject in particular to (i) the positive vote of the EGM on all resolutions relating to the Restructuring (such resolutions being linked to each other, it being specified that Bpifrance Participations committed to vote in favor of such resolutions, subject to legal or regulatory constraints preventing him from voting, as the case may be) and (ii) approval by the AMF of a prospectus relating to: a rights issue of the Company, with shareholders' preferential subscription rights, for a total amount of \u20ac330 million, at a subscription price of \u20ac2.98 per share, fully backstopped by the TLB and RCF lenders by way of set-off of their claims at par under the Credit Facilities; Bpifrance Participations will subscribe to the rights issue in cash pro rata its current shareholding (c. 7.5%) on a non-reductible basis (souscription  titre irrductible) for an aggregate amount up to \u20ac25.5 million; any cash proceeds of the rights issue will be used in full to repay the TLB and RCF lenders, at par value; a reserved capital increase of the Company, for a total amount of \u20ac330 million, at a subscription price of \u20ac3.58 per share, reserved to the TLB and RCF lenders and which will be fully subscribed by way of set-off against their claims at par under the Credit Facilities;free warrants to be allocated to the New Money lenders ('New Money Warrants'), with a 3-month maturity, with an exercise price of \u20ac0.01, equal to the par value of the shares, and giving access to 7.5% of the share capital of the Company (after the rights issue, the reserved capital increase and the exercise of New Money Warrants, but before exercise of the free warrants by the shareholders);free warrants to be allocated to existing shareholders at the time of the launching of the rights issue, with a 4-year maturity and a strike price equal to the reserved capital increase price (i.e. \u20ac3.58 per share); the free warrants will give access to 5% of the share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis (i.e., after the rights issue, the reserved capital increase, the exercise of New Money Warrants and the exercise of the free shareholders' warrants). Each existing share will give right to 1 warrant, which will give right to circa 0.8 new share at a price of 3.58 per share. It should be noted that, should the EGM that will be convened on July 20th 2020 decide to vote against one of the resolutions linked to the Restructuring, the SFA plan cannot be approved by the Court and, in this case, the Company will: petition the court to terminate the SFA proceedings, considering the fact that no SFA plan can be approved; and file for rehabilitation proceedings (redressement judiciaire) in order to implement the debt reorganization as part of a court-approved rehabilitation plan (plan de continuation), failing which quasi all of the Company's assets could be attributed or sold to the New Money Lenders, with the aim to permit continuation of the activities conducted by the Group and trading with clients and suppliers. In this latter case, (i) all employment contracts entered into by the Company will be maintained, (ii) as will the Balance FR New Money and (iii) the liabilities of the Company benefitting from senior legal privileges repaid. The Agreement in Principle has received the support of the Board of Directors of the Company. It remains subject to the finalization of the negotiations of its terms as well as negotiations of the necessary documents and agreements. Implementation of the Agreement in Principle remains subject also to the usual conditions precedent,which include obtaining the favorable support of impacted lenders under the Credit Facilities as well as judicial authorizations and approvals, evidenced at each of the steps of the proceedings. In essence: Concerning the new money made available to the Group: the US New Money and the Initial FR New Money, which shall be made available around mid-July 2020, i.e. during the SFA proceedings, remain notably subject to the authorization of the judge supervising the SFA and to the favorable vote of Technicolor's financial creditors; and the Balance FR New Money shall be funded, among other usual conditions precedent, after the favourable vote of the EGM convened on July 20th2020 and subject to the court's approval of the SFA plan. The Restructuring of the Term Loan B and the RCF remains notably subject to (i) the favorable vote of the EGM on the Restructuring, (ii) the court's approval of the SFA plan and (iii) the approval by the AMF of a prospectus relating to the Restructuring. The reinstatement of a portion of those two credit facilities, and the equitization of the balance, shall occur upon settlement and delivery of the rights issue and the reserved capital increase. The information contained in this press release and its appendices and annexes is designed to re-establish, in all material respects and where necessary, equal access for the various shareholders and investors to the information relating to the Group. 3. Next steps : based on legal timetable (indicative calendar) ; 4. Key business trends 2020-2022 Reforecast Early in the second quarter of 2020, the Group established a 3 step process to develop a new 2020-2022 Business Plan which included: A revised forecast for 2020 including an extension of its Panorama transformation plans;Two scenarios, a Base Case and a High Case Business Plan, to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 crisis recovery. Some contingencies were included in the Base Case to reflect this uncertainty, which mainly related to recovery of the Production Services and DVD services new release activities. The Group also included contingencies relating to the Connected Home business, which is nevertheless anticipated to be able to maintain its initial 2020-2022 plan. These contingencies have been removed in the High Case. The High Case assumes faster reopening of the Production Services businesses and some larger projects, together with higher volumes for Connected Home across all business lines. Regardless of COVID-19 impacts in 2020 and early 2021, revenues under the Base Case are expected to remain flat with growth in Film &amp;#38; Episodic VFX, Animation &amp;#38; Games, and Broadband, and the new DVD Services contract structure offsetting volume declines from DVD and Blu-Ray. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase to \u20ac425 million in 2022 (\u20ac578 million under High Case) mainly driven by the cost saving plans targeting more than \u20ac300 million of costs which include the previously announced \u20ac150 million savings from Panorama 1, and a further \u20ac150 million from additional initiatives by 2022. Operating activities trends Connected Home: Revenues CAGR 19-22 (Base to High case): nil to +3%;Despite early March supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, the Connected Home division is headed for a good year driven by strong demand in the US;The Group expects stable and resilient revenues over the plan mostly driven by growth in gateway / broadband that offsets a video revenues decrease; EBITDA is to grow on the back of cost savings and lower component costs, in line with initial budget expectations. DVD Services: Revenues CAGR 19-22 (Base to. High case): (10%) to (9%);The DVD Services division will be negatively impacted given the delay in new theatre releases, mitigated by catalogue sales in the US and Europe which are showing signs of resilience;Broadly normal market conditions expected thereafter, but still negatively impacted by changed consumer behavior (increased streaming, etc.) and continued structural market decline;EBITDA margin to recover on the back of accelerated cost savings initiatives and contract renewals that include volume-based pricing principles. Production Services: Revenues CAGR 19-22 (Base to High case): +3% to +10%;Film &amp;#38; Episodic VFX revenues largely impacted by the cessation of all live-action shoots, pushed back to third / fourth quarter 2020 and 2021; visual effects cannot be produced until live shoots are completed: Volume of movies under production in 2023 expected to be similar to what was originally planned for in 2022, with more weight toward episodic vs. tentpole movies; Animation &amp;#38; Games not as severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis as it is less dependent on live action;Advertising expects more resilience to the COVID-19 as it is less reliant on large crewed, on-location live shoots, and has a customer base that includes Big Tech companies;Post-Production impacted for similar reasons as Film &amp;#38; Episodic VFX: Still handles a larger number of smaller and quicker turnaround projects and can take on work from clients with whom Film &amp;#38; Episodic VFX does not typically work at the beginning of live shooting. This along with Film &amp;#38; Episodic VFX growth should allow a faster recovery in the second half. 18-month liquidity forecasts to December 2021 The proposed \u20ac420 million new financing has been designed to cover the Group's needs in the short / medium term. This new financing together with cash generation will provide liquidity flexibility for the Group thereafter. By mid-July, the Group is to receive \u20ac240 million of net proceeds from the new financing proposal (subject to the conditions precedent mentioned above): This amount will cover (i) the operational needs over that period and, (ii) the repayment of the $110 million Bridge Facility at the end of July. In early September, to cover additional operational needs, the Group is to receive a further \u20ac180 million injection as part of the financing proposal (subject to conditions precedent mentioned above): Following this new financing, the Group expects to have excess cash of more than \u20ac100 million;Operational needs early in each month are in line with the working capital pattern of the Group, as most key vendors payments are concentrated during the first week of each month. In total the \u20ac420 million net amount new financing proposal will cover the Group's needs over the next 18 months, including additional needs of circa \u20ac100 million in the first halfof 2021: The cash pattern has historically shown a negative FCF in the first half vs. a positive FCF over the second half3;Overall cash injections are to cover the needs arising in H2 2020 as well as first half 2021. As of the end of each semester, for the next four closings, the Group expects the following cash position in the next 18 months (taking into account the \u20ac420 million New Financing).  Based on the proposed new financing plan, gross debt5 is to decrease from current position of \u20ac 1,444 million to \u20ac1,102 million. Net debt to EBITDA target (post IFRS 16 adjustments) is around 3x at end of 2021, decreasing thereafter. ### An analyst conference call hosted by Richard Moat, CEO, and Laurent Carozzi, CFO, will be held today, Monday, 22 June 2020 at 5pm CEST.

The Company has received the support of a majority (65,77%<sup>1</sup>) of its lenders under the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility and of Bpifrance Participations, an institutional shareholder.</p><p>This Agreement in Principle, whose terms and conditions are described in more details below, provides a framework for long-term sustainability for the Company's businesses, employees, customers and suppliers, and offers its current shareholders an opportunity to participate in the Company's recovery. Based on the proposed new financing plan, gross debt<sup>2</sup>is to decrease from the current position of (EURO)1,444 million to (EURO)1,102 million. The net debt to EBITDA target (post IFRS 16 adjustments) is around 3x at end of 2021, decreasing thereafter.</p><p>Furthermore, the Company announces the opening today of an accelerated financial safeguard procedure, in order to facilitate the implementation of the Agreement in Principle, by the Paris commercial Court.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Status of the restructuring process</emphasis></p><p>In February 2020, Technicolor informed the market of its intention to launch a (EURO)300 million rights issue by June 30<sup>th</sup>2020 at the latest, which was authorized by the general meeting of the Company's shareholders on March 23<sup>rd</sup>2020. Since then, the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the business activities of the Group, and the uncertainty in global market conditions, have rendered it difficult to launch the initially contemplated rights issue within the contemplated timeline, and have increased the liquidity needs of the Group, which were originally intended to be covered by the rights issue.</p><p>In May, the Company launched a confidential process aiming at raising a new money facility replacing the rights issue in order to finance the group's operations and to repay the $110 million bridge loan due on July 31<sup>st</sup>.</p><p>Technicolor has received offers both from third parties and from existing creditors, including notably, as announced in the June 4<sup>th</sup>press release, an offer from a group of creditors representing 59% at that time of the Term Loan B and the Revolving Credit Facility, in the framework of the conciliation proceedings opened on June 2<sup>nd</sup>. This proposal addresses both the Group's liquidity requirements and the need to deleverage the Company's balance sheet, through a combination of a rights issue (fully backstopped by the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility lenders by way of set-off of their claims) and a capital increase reserved to the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility lenders (subscribed by way of set-off of their claims).</p><p>Upon the recommendation of the Comit\u00e9 Ad Hoc (appointed by the board in the context of the debt restructuring and composed of a majority of independent directors) and given the potential significant dilution implied by such capital increases, the Board of Directors decided on June 5<sup>th</sup>to appoint, on a voluntary basis, Finexsi (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-GgBZ3l0-ON617PAS2DI9fGwGrTlysqiYU1HRPsTAj5hKqOY8ROmXOYxIu6MBbNEwClVRgcqKVkKUazMofaepwo-Sd19wTdRlxmw_VW36nU=\">g.windsor@finexsi.com</url>/ 01 43 18 42 42), as independent appraiser, in accordance with article 261-3 of the AMF General Regulation. Finexsi will, in particular, issue a fairness opinion on the proposed capital increases.</p><p>On June 11<sup>th</sup>, the Company announced the launching of a waiver consent solicitation of its existing lenders under its Credit Facilities, in order to allow the Company to have the option to request (i) the opening in France of a \"proc\u00e9dure de sauvegarde financi\u00e8re acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e\" (which is a form of pre-negotiated safeguard procedure with financial creditors only) (\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SFA</emphasis>\") on Technicolor SA and (ii) the recognition of the SFA in the US, in accordance with applicable regulations (the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recognition</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Procedure</emphasis>\"), without such actions constituting an event of default under the Credit Facilities.</p><p>After having received waiver consents from the requisite majority of its lenders, the Company therefore decided on June 18<sup>th</sup>to file a request for the opening in France of an SFA, with the Recognition Procedure to be filed shortly after the SFA has been opened. The SFA was effectively opened today.</p><p>The SFA allows for the implementation of the transaction with only a 2/3 majority of impacted lenders under the Credit Facilities. As of today, lenders representing 65,77% of the principal amount of the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility, as well as Bpifrance Participations, an institutional shareholder holding c. 7.5% of the share capital (the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ad Hoc Group</emphasis>\"), support the Agreement in Principle, setting out the terms and conditions of the debt restructuring of the Group, as further detailed below.</p><p>Technicolor intends to implement the debt restructuring provided for by the Agreement in Principle in the framework of an SFA plan which remains subject to conditions precedent as further detailed below, in particular to a favorable vote by an extraordinary shareholders' meeting of the Company (the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EGM</emphasis>\") on certain aspects of the SFA plan, and to French court approval.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key Transaction Principles</emphasis></p><p>The Agreement in Principle sets forth the following key principles (the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Restructuring</emphasis>\"):</p><p>New money in an aggregate principal amount, net of Original Issue Discount (\"O.I.D.\") and underwriting fees, equal to (EURO) 420 million, to be made available, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, to Technicolor's Affiliates by (i) any lenders under the TLB and the RCF who wish to participate, in an amount of (EURO)400 million (fully underwritten by the Ad Hoc Group excluding Bpifrance Participations) and (ii) by Bpifrance Participations in an amount of (EURO)20 million (the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New Money Lenders</emphasis>\"), as follows:initial new money to be made available around \u00a0mid-July to Technicolor USA, Inc.

The New Money shall also be secured by certain other security interests, including by security over the assets currently securing the Bridge Loan (for the US New Money only), the TLB and the RCF.</p><p>The existing indebtedness of the Group (together, the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Credit Facilities</emphasis>\") will be restructured, as follows:</p><p>Bridge Loan would be repaid using the proceeds of the injection of the US New Money; $125 million asset-based loan made available to TCH US on November 6<sup>th</sup>2017 and certain other US members of the Group (the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABL Facility</emphasis>\") to be amended, in particular to extend the final maturity date of the loan to December 2023, and to allow the implementation of all of the transactions contemplated herein in order to achieve the Restructuring;(EURO)725 million plus $290 million term loan facility dated December 6<sup>th</sup>2016 (the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Term Loan</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B\"</emphasis>or \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TLB</emphasis>\") made available to the Company to be partially equitized as described below and, in respect of the reinstated debt, amended as to extend the maturity to December 2024 with a bullet repayment;(EURO)250 million revolving credit facility dated December 21<sup>st</sup>2016 (the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Revolving Credit Facility</emphasis>\" or the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RCF</emphasis>\") made available to the Company (fully drawn to date) to be partially equitized as described below and, in respect of the reinstated debt, amended as to extend the maturity to December 2024 with a bullet repayment.</p><p>The partial equitization of the debt (up to (EURO) 660 million) will be structured as follows, subject in particular to (i) the positive vote of the EGM on all resolutions relating to the Restructuring (such resolutions being linked to each other, it being specified that Bpifrance Participations committed to vote in favor of such resolutions, subject to legal or regulatory constraints preventing him from voting, as the case may be) and (ii) approval by the AMF of a prospectus relating to:</p><p>a rights issue of the Company, with shareholders' preferential subscription rights, for a total amount of (EURO)330 million, at a subscription price of (EURO)2.98 per share, fully backstopped by the TLB and RCF lenders by way of set-off of their claims at par under the Credit Facilities; Bpifrance Participations will subscribe to the rights issue in cash pro rata its current shareholding (c. 7.5%) on a non-reductible basis (souscription \u00e0 titre irr\u00e9ductible) for an aggregate amount up to (EURO)25.5 million; any cash proceeds of the rights issue will be used in full to repay the TLB and RCF lenders, at par value; a reserved capital increase of the Company, for a total amount of (EURO)330 million, at a subscription price of (EURO)3.58 per share, reserved to the TLB and RCF lenders and which will be fully subscribed by way of set-off against their claims at par under the Credit Facilities;free warrants to be allocated to the New Money lenders (\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New Money Warrants</emphasis>\"), with a 3-month maturity, with an exercise price of (EURO)0.01, equal to the par value of the shares, and giving access to 7.5% of the share capital of the Company (after the rights issue, the reserved capital increase and the exercise of New Money Warrants, but before exercise of the free warrants by the shareholders);free warrants to be allocated to existing shareholders at the time of the launching of the rights issue, with a 4-year maturity and a strike price equal to the reserved capital increase price (i.e. (EURO)3.58 per share); the free warrants will give access to 5% of the share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis (i.e., after the rights issue, the reserved capital increase, the exercise of New Money Warrants and the exercise of the free shareholders' warrants). Each existing share will give right to 1 warrant, which will give right to circa 0.8 new share at a price of 3.58 per share.</p><p>It should be noted that, should the EGM that will be convened on July 20th 2020 decide to vote against one of the resolutions linked to the Restructuring, the SFA plan cannot be approved by the Court and, in this case, the Company will: \u00a0</p><p>petition the court to terminate the SFA proceedings, considering the fact that no SFA plan can be approved; and file for rehabilitation proceedings (redressement judiciaire) in order to implement the debt reorganization as part of a court-approved rehabilitation plan (plan de continuation), failing which quasi all of the Company's assets could be attributed or sold to the New Money Lenders, with the aim to permit continuation of the activities conducted by the Group and trading with clients and suppliers.

The Group also included contingencies relating to the Connected Home business, which is nevertheless anticipated to be able to maintain its initial 2020-2022 plan. These contingencies have been removed in the High Case.The High Case assumes faster reopening of the Production Services businesses and some larger projects, together with higher volumes for Connected Home across all business lines.</p><p>Regardless of COVID-19 impacts in 2020 and early 2021, revenues under the Base Case are expected to remain flat with growth in Film &amp; Episodic VFX, Animation &amp; Games, and Broadband, and the new DVD Services contract structure offsetting volume declines from DVD and Blu-Ray.Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase to (EURO)425 million in 2022 ((EURO)578 million under High Case) mainly driven by the cost saving plans targeting more than (EURO)300 million of costs which include the previously announced (EURO)150 million savings from Panorama 1, and a further (EURO)150 million from additional initiatives by 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operating activities trends</emphasis></p><p>Connected Home: Revenues CAGR 19-22 (Base to High case): nil to +3%;Despite early March supply chain disruption due to Covid-19, the Connected Home division is headed for a good year driven by strong demand in the US;The Group expects stable and resilient revenues over the plan mostly driven by growth in gateway / broadband that offsets a video revenues decrease; EBITDA is to grow on the back of cost savings and lower component costs, in line with initial budget expectations.</p><p>DVD Services:</p><p>Revenues CAGR 19-22 (Base to. High case): (10%) to (9%);The DVD Services division will be negatively impacted given the delay in new theatre releases, mitigated by catalogue sales in the US and Europe which are showing signs of resilience;Broadly normal market conditions expected thereafter, but still negatively impacted by changed consumer behavior (increased streaming, etc.) and continued structural market decline;EBITDA margin to recover on the back of accelerated cost savings initiatives and contract renewals that include volume-based pricing principles.</p><p>Production Services:</p><p>Revenues CAGR 19-22 (Base to High case): +3% to +10%;Film &amp; Episodic VFX revenues largely impacted by the cessation of all live-action shoots, pushed back to third / fourth quarter 2020 and 2021; visual effects cannot be produced until live shoots are completed: Volume of movies under production in 2023 expected to be similar to what was originally planned for in 2022, with more weight toward episodic vs. tentpole movies;</p><p>Animation &amp; Games not as severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis as it is less dependent on live action;Advertising expects more resilience to the COVID-19 as it is less reliant on large crewed, on-location live shoots, and has a customer base that includes Big Tech companies;Post-Production impacted for similar reasons as Film &amp; Episodic VFX:</p><p>Still handles a larger number of smaller and quicker turnaround projects and can take on work from clients with whom Film &amp; Episodic VFX does not typically work at the beginning of live shooting. This along with Film &amp; Episodic VFX growth should allow a faster recovery in the second half.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">18-month liquidity forecasts to December 2021</emphasis></p><p>The proposed (EURO)420 million new financing has been designed to cover the Group's needs in the short / medium term.

The Company has received the support of a majority (65,77%1) of its lenders under the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility and of Bpifrance Participations, an institutional shareholder.</p><p>This Agreement in Principle, whose terms and conditions are described in more details below, provides a framework for long-term sustainability for the Company's businesses, employees, customers and suppliers, and offers its current shareholders an opportunity to participate in the Company's recovery. Based on the proposed new financing plan, gross debt2 is to decrease from the current position of EUR1,444 million to EUR1,102 million. The net debt to EBITDA target (post IFRS 16 adjustments) is around 3x at end of 2021, decreasing thereafter.</p><p>Furthermore, the Company announces the opening today of an accelerated financial safeguard procedure, in order to facilitate the implementation of the Agreement in Principle, by the Paris commercial Court.</p><p>1. Status of the restructuring process</p><p>In February 2020, Technicolor informed the market of its intention to launch a EUR300 million rights issue by June 30th 2020 at the latest, which was authorized by the general meeting of the Company's shareholders on March 23rd 2020. Since then, the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the business activities of the Group, and the uncertainty in global market conditions, have rendered it difficult to launch the initially contemplated rights issue within the contemplated timeline, and have increased the liquidity needs of the Group, which were originally intended to be covered by the rights issue.</p><p>In May, the Company launched a confidential process aiming at raising a new money facility replacing the rights issue in order to finance the group's operations and to repay the $110 million bridge loan due on July 31st.</p><p>Technicolor has received offers both from third parties and from existing creditors, including notably, as announced in the June 4th press release, an offer from a group of creditors representing 59% at that time of the Term Loan B and the Revolving Credit Facility, in the framework of the conciliation proceedings opened on June 2nd. This proposal addresses both the Group's liquidity requirements and the need to deleverage the Company's balance sheet, through a combination of a rights issue (fully backstopped by the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility lenders by way of set-off of their claims) and a capital increase reserved to the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility lenders (subscribed by way of set-off of their claims).</p><p>Upon the recommendation of the Comite Ad Hoc (appointed by the board in the context of the debt restructuring and composed of a majority of independent directors) and given the potential significant dilution implied by such capital increases, the Board of Directors decided on June 5th to appoint, on a voluntary basis, Finexsi (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:g.windsor@finexsi.com\">g.windsor@finexsi.com</email> / 01 43 18 42 42), as independent appraiser, in accordance with article 261-3 of the AMF General Regulation. Finexsi will, in particular, issue a fairness opinion on the proposed capital increases.</p><p>On June 11th, the Company announced the launching of a waiver consent solicitation of its existing lenders under its Credit Facilities, in order to allow the Company to have the option to request (i) the opening in France of a \"procedure de sauvegarde financiere acceleree\" (which is a form of pre-negotiated safeguard procedure with financial creditors only) (\"SFA\") on Technicolor SA and (ii) the recognition of the SFA in the US, in accordance with applicable regulations (the \"Recognition Procedure\"), without such actions constituting an event of default under the Credit Facilities.</p><p>After having received waiver consents from the requisite majority of its lenders, the Company therefore decided on June 18th to file a request for the opening in France of an SFA, with the Recognition Procedure to be filed shortly after the SFA has been opened. The SFA was effectively opened today.</p><p>The SFA allows for the implementation of the transaction with only a 2/3 majority of impacted lenders under the Credit Facilities. As of today, lenders representing 65,77% of the principal amount of the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility, as well as Bpifrance Participations, an institutional shareholder holding c. 7.5% of the share capital (the \"Ad Hoc Group\"), support the Agreement in Principle, setting out the terms and conditions of the debt restructuring of the Group, as further detailed below.</p><p>Technicolor intends to implement the debt restructuring provided for by the Agreement in Principle in the framework of an SFA plan which remains subject to conditions precedent as further detailed below, in particular to a favorable vote by an extraordinary shareholders' meeting of the Company (the \"EGM\") on certain aspects of the SFA plan, and to French court approval.</p><p>2. Key Transaction Principles</p><p>The Agreement in Principle sets forth the following key principles (the \"Restructuring\"):</p><p>- New money in an aggregate principal amount, net of Original Issue Discount (\"O.I.D.\") and underwriting fees, equal to EUR 420 million, to be made available, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, to Technicolor's Affiliates by (i) any lenders under the TLB and the RCF who wish to participate, in an amount of EUR400 million (fully underwritten by the Ad Hoc Group excluding Bpifrance Participations) and (ii) by Bpifrance Participations in an amount of EUR20 million (the \"New Money Lenders\"), as follows:</p><p>- initial new money to be made available around mid-July to Technicolor USA, Inc. (\"TCH US\") (the \"US New Money\"), subject to positive vote of the financial creditors committee, approval of the judge and other conditions, by way of a New York law term loan facility in order to repay in full in cash the $110 million bridge loan which was made available to TCH US on March 5th, 2020 and which is due to be repaid on July 31st 2020 (the \"Bridge Loan\");</p><p>- additional initial new money to be made available on the same date as the US New Money to Tech 6, a direct subsidiary of the Company incorporated in France, subject to positive vote of the financial creditors committee, approval of the judge and other conditions, by way of a New York law notes issue (the \"Initial FR New Money\" and, together with the US New Money, the \"Initial New Money\");</p><p>- remaining new money to be made available by the end of August 2020 to Tech 6, subject to among, other conditions, approval of the SFA plan by the Court (the \"Balance FR New Money\" and, together with the Initial New Money, the \"New Money\");</p><p>- New Money to be secured by \"fiducies-suretes\" (equivalent of a trust under French law) in respect of the shares of sub-holding companies, holding quasi all (after some corporate reorganization) of the members of the Group (the \"Fiducies\"), it being specified that the implementation of the Fiducie for the Balance FR New Money will be submitted to a consultative vote of the EGM, in accordance with the AMF recommendation n\u00b02015-05 on transfer of assets. The New Money shall also be secured by certain other security interests, including by security over the assets currently securing the Bridge Loan (for the US New Money only), the TLB and the RCF.</p><p>- The existing indebtedness of the Group (together, the \"Credit Facilities\") will be restructured, as follows:</p><p>- Bridge Loan would be repaid using the proceeds of the injection of the US New Money;</p><p>- $125 million asset-based loan made available to TCH US on November 6th 2017 and certain other US members of the Group (the \"ABL Facility\") to be amended, in particular to extend the final maturity date of the loan to December 2023, and to allow the implementation of all of the transactions contemplated herein in order to achieve the Restructuring;</p><p>- EUR725 million plus $290 million term loan facility dated December 6th 2016 (the \"Term Loan B\" or \"TLB\") made available to the Company to be partially equitized as described below and, in respect of the reinstated debt, amended as to extend the maturity to December 2024 with a bullet repayment;</p><p>- EUR250 million revolving credit facility dated December 21st 2016 (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\" or the \"RCF\") made available to the Company (fully drawn to date) to be partially equitized as described below and, in respect of the reinstated debt, amended as to extend the maturity to December 2024 with a bullet repayment.</p><p>- The partial equitization of the debt (up to EUR 660 million) will be structured as follows, subject in particular to (i) the positive vote of the EGM on all resolutions relating to the Restructuring (such resolutions being linked to each other, it being specified that Bpifrance Participations committed to vote in favor of such resolutions, subject to legal or regulatory constraints preventing him from voting, as the case may be) and (ii) approval by the AMF of a prospectus relating to:</p><p>- a rights issue of the Company, with shareholders' preferential subscription rights, for a total amount of EUR330 million, at a subscription price of EUR2.98 per share, fully backstopped by the TLB and RCF lenders by way of set-off of their claims at par under the Credit Facilities; Bpifrance Participations will subscribe to the rights issue in cash pro rata its current shareholding (c. 7.5%) on a non-reductible basis (souscription a titre irreductible) for an aggregate amount up to EUR25.5 million; any cash proceeds of the rights issue will be used in full to repay the TLB and RCF lenders, at par value;</p><p>- a reserved capital increase of the Company, for a total amount of EUR330 million, at a subscription price of EUR3.58 per share, reserved to the TLB and RCF lenders and which will be fully subscribed by way of set-off against their claims at par under the Credit Facilities;</p><p>- free warrants to be allocated to the New Money lenders (\"New Money Warrants\"), with a 3-month maturity, with an exercise price of EUR0.01, equal to the par value of the shares, and giving access to 7.5% of the share capital of the Company (after the rights issue, the reserved capital increase and the exercise of New Money Warrants, but before exercise of the free warrants by the shareholders);</p><p>- free warrants to be allocated to existing shareholders at the time of the launching of the rights issue, with a 4-year maturity and a strike price equal to the reserved capital increase price (i.e. EUR3.58 per share); the free warrants will give access to 5% of the share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis (i.e., after the rights issue, the reserved capital increase, the exercise of New Money Warrants and the exercise of the free shareholders' warrants). Each existing share will give right to 1 warrant, which will give right to circa 0.8 new share at a price of 3.58 per share.</p><p>- It should be noted that, should the EGM that will be convened on July 20th 2020 decide to vote against one of the resolutions linked to the Restructuring, the SFA plan cannot be approved by the Court and, in this case, the Company will:</p><p>- petition the court to terminate the SFA proceedings, considering the fact that no SFA plan can be approved; and</p><p>- file for rehabilitation proceedings (redressement judiciaire) in order to implement the debt reorganization as part of a court-approved rehabilitation plan (plan de continuation), failing which quasi all of the Company's assets could be attributed or sold to the New Money Lenders, with the aim to permit continuation of the activities conducted by the Group and trading with clients and suppliers. In this latter case, (i) all employment contracts entered into by the Company will be maintained, (ii) as will the Balance FR New Money and (iii) the liabilities of the Company benefitting from senior legal privileges repaid.</p><p>The Agreement in Principle has received the support of the Board of Directors of the Company. It remains subject to the finalization of the negotiations of its terms as well as negotiations of the necessary documents and agreements.</p><p>Implementation of the Agreement in Principle remains subject also to the usual conditions precedent,which include obtaining the favorable support of impacted lenders under the Credit Facilities as well as judicial authorizations and approvals, evidenced at each of the steps of the proceedings. In essence:</p><p>- Concerning the new money made available to the Group:</p><p>- the US New Money and the Initial FR New Money, which shall be made available around mid-July 2020, i.e. during the SFA proceedings, remain notably subject to the authorization of the judge supervising the SFA and to the favorable vote of Technicolor's financial creditors; and</p><p>- the Balance FR New Money shall be funded, among other usual conditions precedent, after the favourable vote of the EGM convened on July 20th 2020 and subject to the court's approval of the SFA plan.</p><p>- The Restructuring of the Term Loan B and the RCF remains notably subject to (i) the favorable vote of the EGM on the Restructuring, (ii) the court's approval of the SFA plan and (iii) the approval by the AMF of a prospectus relating to the Restructuring. The reinstatement of a portion of those two credit facilities, and the equitization of the balance, shall occur upon settlement and delivery of the rights issue and the reserved capital increase.</p><p>The information contained in this press release and its appendices and annexes is designed to re-establish, in all material respects and where necessary, equal access for the various shareholders and investors to the information relating to the Group.</p><p>3.

Key business trends2020-2022 Reforecast- Early in the second quarter of 2020, the Group established a 3 step process to develop a new 2020-2022 Business Plan which included: - A revised forecast for 2020 including an extension of its Panorama transformation plans;- Two scenarios, a Base Case and a High Case Business Plan, to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 crisis recovery.- Some contingencies were included in the Base Case to reflect this uncertainty, which mainly related to recovery of the Production Services and DVD services new release activities. The Group also included contingencies relating to the Connected Home business, which is nevertheless anticipated to be able to maintain its initial 2020-2022 plan.

High case): (10%) to (9%);- The DVD Services division will be negatively impacted given the delay in new theatre releases, mitigated by catalogue sales in the US and Europe which are showing signs of resilience;- Broadly normal market conditions expected thereafter, but still negatively impacted by changed consumer behavior (increased streaming, etc.) and continued structural market decline;- EBITDA margin to recover on the back of accelerated cost savings initiatives and contract renewals that include volume-based pricing principles.- Production Services: - Revenues CAGR 19-22 (Base to High case): +3% to +10%;- Film &amp; Episodic VFX revenues largely impacted by the cessation of all live-action shoots, pushed back to third / fourth quarter 2020 and 2021; visual effects cannot be produced until live shoots are completed: - Volume of movies under production in 2023 expected to be similar to what was originally planned for in 2022, with more weight toward episodic vs. tentpole movies;- Animation &amp; Games not as severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis as it is less dependent on live action;- Advertising expects more resilience to the COVID-19 as it is less reliant on large crewed, on-location live shoots, and has a customer base that includes Big Tech companies;- Post-Production impacted for similar reasons as Film &amp; Episodic VFX: - Still handles a larger number of smaller and quicker turnaround projects and can take on work from clients with whom Film &amp; Episodic VFX does not typically work at the beginning of live shooting. This along with Film &amp; Episodic VFX growth should allow a faster recovery in the second half.18-month liquidity forecasts to December 2021- The proposed EUR420 million new financing has been designed to cover the Group's needs in the short / medium term. This new financing together with cash generation will provide liquidity flexibility for the Group thereafter. - By mid-July, the Group is to receive EUR240 million of net proceeds from the new financing proposal (subject to the conditions precedent mentioned above): - This amount will cover (i) the operational needs over that period and, (ii) the repayment of the $110 million Bridge Facility at the end of July.- In early September, to cover additional operational needs, the Group is to receive a further EUR180 million injection as part of the financing proposal (subject to conditions precedent mentioned above): - Following this new financing, the Group expects to have excess cash of more than EUR100 million;- Operational needs early in each month are in line with the working capital pattern of the Group, as most key vendors payments are concentrated during the first week of each month.- In total the EUR420 million net amount new financing proposal will cover the Group's needs over the next 18 months, including additional needs of circa EUR100 million in the first half of 2021: - The cash pattern has historically shown a negative FCF in the first half vs. a positive FCF over the second half3;- Overall cash injections are to cover the needs arising in H2 2020 as well as first half 2021.As of the end of each semester, for the next four closings, the Group expects the following cash position in the next 18 months (taking into account the EUR420 million New Financing).in mEUR June 30 December 31 2020 June 30 December 31 2021 2020 2021 Group Cash before Credit Lines (CL) (323) (311) (582) (386) Available CL as per current structure4 418 318 318 318 Liquidity after Credit Lines 96 7 (264) (68) (+) New financing, net of O.I.D and underwriting 0 420 420 420 Pro Forma Liquidity 96 427 156 352</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"> Based on the proposed new financing plan, gross debt5 is to decrease from current position of EUR 1,444 million to EUR1,102 million.

As we have previously shared, the FTC is in the midst of a series of hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century, including sessions on Big Data, Privacy, and Competition[1] and the Antitrust Framework for Evaluating Acquisitions of Potential or Nascent Competitors in Digital Marketplaces[2]. Multiple European regulators (the EU[3], Germany[4] and now Austria[5]) recently launched investigations into Amazon. Technology platforms are a priority for many other enforcers as well, from China[6] to Australia[7] to the UK.[8] With different competition authorities weighing in on how to assess tech competition, there is the potential for divergence in intensity of enforcement as well as whether existing competition doctrine suffices. Disparities are borne out by recent statements emanating from U.S., Australian, and UK competition agencies and officials. </p><p>Fresh remarks from the U.S. DOJ Antitrust Division indicate the agency does not support a regulatory approach to platforms and the digital economy. In a speech[9] last week, agency head Makan Delrahim addressed Antitrust Enforcement in the Zero-Price Economy, noting that while zero-price strategies have 'exploded' with the rise of digital platforms, 'the strategy of selling a product or service at zero price is not new, nor is it unique to the digital economy.' Mr. Delrahim acknowledged the divergent views of how antitrust enforcement should treat such products and services, which range from exemption from antitrust scrutiny entirely to the creation of new, specially crafted rules and standards. Rejecting both of these 'extreme views' as 'misplaced,' he emphasized the ability of current antitrust doctrine - including the consumer welfare standard - to tackle the issue, stating: '[W]e do not need a wholesale revision of the antitrust laws to address competitive concerns in these contexts. ... [O]ur antitrust laws and principles are flexible enough to adapt to the challenges of the digital economy.' Mr. Delrahim called for 'careful case-by-case analysis' in enforcement. He touted the innovation and benefits that zero-price strategies have brought to consumers, crediting the country's 'pro-market economic and legal structures' and cautioning against 'distortions of our antitrust standards' to address issues like privacy and data protection if they do not impede the functioning of the free market. His speech echoes a view Mr. Delrahim and others at the Antitrust Division have expressed previously regarding the need (or lack thereof) for new rules to address the antitrust implications of 'big data.' In an October 2018 speech[10] regarding startups, innovation, and antitrust policy, Mr.Delrahim remarked that 'accumulation of data drives innovation and benefits consumers' in many ways (including by enabling zero-price offerings), and that forced sharing risks undermining innovation by reducing incentives for both incumbents and new entrants. Invoking Trinko,[1] he stated that 'free and competitive markets' - not antitrust agencies or courts - are best equipped to determine 'how much data should be shared, with whom, and at what price.' Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bernard Nigro, Jr. has taken a similar position, stating[11] that 'forced sharing of critical assets reduces the incentive to invest in innovation' and that 'where benefits to sharing exist, they can be best captured by the parties negotiating in a free and competitive market, not by government regulation.' By contrast, other jurisdictions and industry observers[12] considering the competitive implications of digital platforms have questioned the status quo. In their view, control of valuable data provides a competitive advantage and raises entry barriers that may entrench a platform's dominant position and lead to competitive or consumer harm. At a higher level, France and Germany just announced[13] an effort to overhaul competition rules to enable European companies to better develop technologies that compete on the global stage. For example, last week the Australian Productivity Commission and the New Zealand Productivity Commission released a joint report[14] that reviews how most effectively to address the challenges and harness the opportunities the digital economy creates (particularly for small- to medium-sized enterprises). In a section titled 'Existing competition regulation may not be adequate for digital markets,' the report addressed the challenges of applying existing laws to the digital economy, including (among others) that zero-price goods and services complicate the analysis of market definition and market power, and that data 'is an increasingly important business input and may be a source of market power' but is not adequately captured in traditional competition policy. Although the report acknowledged that in some cases technological developments might obviate the need for regulation (and in others the mere threat of regulation may be enough), it posited that new regulation might be necessary to maintain competitive markets: '[I]f 'winner-take-most' markets do end up prevailing, competition regulators may need to consider extending tools such as essential service access regimes to digital services.' An essential service (or 'essential facilities') regime would treat a digital platform's data as an input essential to competition and require the platform to provide its competitors with reasonable access to it. In contrast to the Productivity Commissions' suggestion, U.S. competition enforcers to date have been loath to treat digital platforms as essential facilities. The Productivity Commissions' report comes on the heels of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) Digital Platforms Inquiry[15] preliminary findings released in December. The ACCC expressed similar concerns about the rise of digital platforms and the threat they pose to consumers and the competitive process. Addressing what it found to be Google's and Facebook's market power in a number of markets,[2] the report encouraged governments to be 'responsive, and indeed proactive, in reacting to and anticipating challenges and problems' posed by digital platforms. It offered eleven preliminary recommendations to address these concerns, including: amending merger law to expressly consider potential competition and the data at issue in the transaction, requiring advance notice of any acquisition by a large digital platform of a business with activities in Australia, and tasking a regulatory authority with monitoring the conduct of vertically integrated digital platforms. The report also proposed areas for further analysis, such as: a digital platforms ombudsman, the monitoring of intermediary pricing and opt-in targeted advertising. As such, indications from Australia suggest calls for more competition intervention have some teeth. The UK may have a similar appetite, as indicated by a new Parliament publication[16] addressing 'Disinformation and 'fake news.'' The statement calls for increased oversight and greater transparency into 'how the big tech companies work and what happens to our data,' highlighting Facebook's treatment and monetization of user data as an example of why intervention is needed. In addition to recommending a compulsory Code of Ethics overseen by an independent regulator with 'statutory powers to monitor relevant tech companies,' the publication advocated for greater competition law scrutiny of and enforcement against digital platforms, including an investigation of Facebook and a 'comprehensive audit' of the social media advertising market. Invoking existing 'legislative tools' such as privacy laws, data protection legislation, and antitrust and competition law, the report cautioned: 'The big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight.' Operating under an international patchwork of competition approaches can present a challenge to global enterprises. Technology-focused, data-intensive businesses should consider seeking antitrust counsel to monitor developing competition trends and implications across jurisdictions. _________________________________[1] Verizon Communic'ns, Inc. v.

As we have previously shared, the FTC is in the midst of a series of hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century, including sessions on Big Data, Privacy, and Competition[1] and the Antitrust Framework for Evaluating Acquisitions of Potential or Nascent Competitors in Digital Marketplaces[2]. Multiple European regulators (the EU[3], Germany[4] and now Austria[5]) recently launched investigations into Amazon. Technology platforms are a priority for many other enforcers as well, from China[6] to Australia[7] to the UK.[8]With different competition authorities weighing in on how to assess tech competition, there is the potential for divergence in intensity of enforcement as well as whether existing competition doctrine suffices. Disparities are borne out by recent statements emanating from U.S., Australian, and UK competition agencies and officials.Fresh remarks from the U.S. DOJ Antitrust Division indicate the agency does not support a regulatory approach to platforms and the digital economy. </p><p>In a speech[9] last week, agency head Makan Delrahim addressed Antitrust Enforcement in the Zero-Price Economy, noting that while zero-price strategies have \"exploded\" with the rise of digital platforms, \"the strategy of selling a product or service at zero price is not new, nor is it unique to the digital economy.\" Mr. Delrahim acknowledged the divergent views of how antitrust enforcement should treat such products and services, which range from exemption from antitrust scrutiny entirely to the creation of new, specially crafted rules and standards. Rejecting both of these \"extreme views\" as \"misplaced,\" he emphasized the ability of current antitrust doctrine - including the consumer welfare standard - to tackle the issue, stating: \"[W]e do not need a wholesale revision of the antitrust laws to address competitive concerns in these contexts. . . . [O]ur antitrust laws and principles are flexible enough to adapt to the challenges of the digital economy.\" Mr. Delrahim called for \"careful case-by-case analysis\" in enforcement. He touted the innovation and benefits that zero-price strategies have brought to consumers, crediting the country's \"pro-market economic and legal structures\" and cautioning against \"distortions of our antitrust standards\" to address issues like privacy and data protection if they do not impede the functioning of the free market.His speech echoes a view Mr. Delrahim and others at the Antitrust Division have expressed previously regarding the need (or lack thereof) for new rules to address the antitrust implications of \"big data.\" In an October 2018 speech[10] regarding startups, innovation, and antitrust policy, Mr. Delrahim remarked that \"accumulation of data drives innovation and benefits consumers\" in many ways (including by enabling zero-price offerings), and that forced sharing risks undermining innovation by reducing incentives for both incumbents and new entrants. Invoking Trinko,1[11] he stated that \"free and competitive markets\" - not antitrust agencies or courts - are best equipped to determine \"how much data should be shared, with whom, and at what price.\" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bernard Nigro, Jr. has taken a similar position, stating[12] that \"forced sharing of critical assets reduces the incentive to invest in innovation\" and that \"where benefits to sharing exist, they can be best captured by the parties negotiating in a free and competitive market, not by government regulation.\"By contrast, other jurisdictions and industry observers[13] considering the competitive implications of digital platforms have questioned the status quo. In their view, control of valuable data provides a competitive advantage and raises entry barriers that may entrench a platform's dominant position and lead to competitive or consumer harm. At a higher level, France and Germany just announced[14] an effort to overhaul competition rules to enable European companies to better develop technologies that compete on the global stage.For example, last week the Australian Productivity Commission and the New Zealand Productivity Commission released a joint report[15] that reviews how most effectively to address the challenges and harness the opportunities the digital economy creates (particularly for small- to medium-sized enterprises). In a section titled \"Existing competition regulation may not be adequate for digital markets,\" the report addressed the challenges of applying existing laws to the digital economy, including (among others) that zero-price goods and services complicate the analysis of market definition and market power, and that data \"is an increasingly important business input and may be a source of market power\" but is not adequately captured in traditional competition policy. Although the report acknowledged that in some cases technological developments might obviate the need for regulation (and in others the mere threat of regulation may be enough), it posited that new regulation might be necessary to maintain competitive markets: \"[I]f 'winner-take-most' markets do end up prevailing, competition regulators may need to consider extending tools such as essential service access regimes to digital services.\" An essential service (or \"essential facilities\") regime would treat a digital platform's data as an input essential to competition and require the platform to provide its competitors with reasonable access to it. In contrast to the Productivity Commissions' suggestion, U.S. competition enforcers to date have been loath to treat digital platforms as essential facilities.The Productivity Commissions' report comes on the heels of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) Digital Platforms Inquiry[16] preliminary findings released in December. The ACCC expressed similar concerns about the rise of digital platforms and the threat they pose to consumers and the competitive process. Addressing what it found to be Google's and Facebook's market power in a number of markets,2[17] the report encouraged governments to be \"responsive, and indeed proactive, in reacting to and anticipating challenges and problems\" posed by digital platforms. It offered eleven preliminary recommendations to address these concerns, including: amending merger law to expressly consider potential competition and the data at issue in the transaction, requiring advance notice of any acquisition by a large digital platform of a business with activities in Australia, and tasking a regulatory authority with monitoring the conduct of vertically integrated digital platforms. The report also proposed areas for further analysis, such as: a digital platforms ombudsman, the monitoring of intermediary pricing and opt-in targeted advertising. As such, indications from Australia suggest calls for more competition intervention have some teeth.The UK may have a similar appetite, as indicated by a new Parliament publication[18] addressing \"Disinformation and 'fake news.'\" The statement calls for increased oversight and greater transparency into \"how the big tech companies work and what happens to our data,\" highlighting Facebook's treatment and monetization of user data as an example of why intervention is needed. In addition to recommending a compulsory Code of Ethics overseen by an independent regulator with \"statutory powers to monitor relevant tech companies,\" the publication advocated for greater competition law scrutiny of and enforcement against digital platforms, including an investigation of Facebook and a \"comprehensive audit\" of the social media advertising market. Invoking existing \"legislative tools\" such as privacy laws, data protection legislation, and antitrust and competition law, the report cautioned: \"The big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight.\"Operating under an international patchwork of competition approaches can present a challenge to global enterprises. Technology-focused, data-intensive businesses should consider seeking antitrust counsel to monitor developing competition trends and implications across jurisdictions.Footnote1[19] Verizon Communic'ns, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 407-08 (2004).2[20] The preliminary report finds that Google has market power in online search, online search advertising and news media referral services, and that Facebook has market power in social media services, display advertising and news media referral services.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The Commission assesses each  notified transaction on its own merits, employing a wide range of investigative and analytical  tools. To date, the only proposed acquisition involving the entities mentioned by The Honourable  Member that was notified to the Commission is Google\u2019s proposed acquisition of Fitbit. The  transaction was notified last 15 June 2020 and the current deadline for the Commission to  take a decision is 20 July 2020. The takeover of Giphy by Facebook has not been notified to the Commission. The  Commission may only review \u2013 and, if necessary, intervene in \u2013 transactions, which fall  within its jurisdiction under the EU Merger Regulation.

President Donald Trump took to Twitter late last month claiming Google \"rigged\" search results to feature links to \"bad\" news reports and promising the issue \"would be addressed.\"</p><p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who hosted the \"listening session\" along with a team of officials from the DOJ, indicated in public comments ahead of the meeting that bias as it relates to how some tech companies manage political speech would be a focus topic.</p><p>But Reyes told the Deseret News that while bias issues did come up briefly during the meeting Tuesday morning that included a bipartisan group of attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from 14 states, discussions mostly focused on consumer-centric issues.</p><p>\"We were primarily looking at market and competition, privacy and data security issues,\" Reyes said. \"We spent very little time discussing bias.\"</p><p>Reyes said a number of companies came up in the meeting, including Google, Twitter and Facebook, but that the conversations were not limited to those three and that the group's concerns extend to a number of \"big data handlers.\"</p><p>In 2016, Reyes, a Republican, joined Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine, a Democrat, in calling on the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an investigation into Google and potential antitrust violations. The commission concluded an earlier investigation in 2013 that did not result in a complaint against the company. Reyes said the request he and Racine made stemmed from evidence that reflected Google was favoring search returns that featured links advancing their own products, rather than just \"best\" results. Reyes said the FTC declined to investigate.</p><p>Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch revisited the issue this summer in a letter he sent to the commission on Aug. 30 in which he cited, among other things, a May \"60 Minutes\" story that included allegations of unfair search manipulation that also favored Google products. Hatch called on a newly confirmed slate of FTC commissioners to \"consider the competitive effects of Google's conduct in search and advertising.\"</p><p>Google officials did not respond to a Deseret News request for comment on the matter.</p><p>Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder of consumer review website and mobile app Yelp, told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Steve Kroft that Google had evolved away from its founding principal of providing only the best, unbiased results to a user's search query.</p><p>\"The initial promise of Google was to organize the world's information,\" Stoppelman said. \"And ultimately that manifested itself in you expecting that the top links, the things that it shows at the top of that page are the best from around the web. The best that the world has to offer. And I could tell you that is not the case. That is not the case anymore.\"</p><p>Reyes said he continues to agree with that assessment and is also concerned about how Google, and other big data gatherers, are collecting and repurposing data it harvests from its users.</p><p>While he declined to weigh-in on whether or not there was a consensus Tuesday among the gathered state and federal officials on launching an investigation into big data-handling companies, he did note that the process was ongoing and that he'd be working with other state attorneys general, and the Justice Department, in continuing to look at these companies and their processes.</p><p>\"When you have all of these state and federal offices represented, there are a lot of different efforts underway,\" Reyes said. \"Some may be investigating particular aspects already and some may not. What I can say is that we're assessing and examining information that could potentially lead to more formal processes.\"</p><p>Reyes, who worked in the tech industry before making the move to public service, said that he believes the solution to protecting consumers' data and privacy involves a careful balance of rules and enforcement and cautioned against those who might see the solution as simply instituting broader digital privacy regulations, like rules adopted this year by the European Union and a set of California laws set to implement in 2020.</p><p>\"I would not entirely endorse, or condemn what the E.U. or California have done,\" Reyes said. \"I think there are some helpful lessons there, but there are a number of things that give me pause.\"</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p><p>Twitter: DNTechHive</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-35380349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC0-FS81-JBRG-X1XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 27, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The four tech companies sell a diverse range of products, like speakers, tracking devices, software and phone accessories. But they all alleged that Big Tech firms had 'bullied' them into abiding by their rules. \"Big Tech is bent on expanding until it does absolutely everything, Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson said, quipping, \"Help us Congress, you're our only hope.\" </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple were the subjects of scathing criticism by smaller tech companies during a Congressional hearing on Friday.  An assortment of tech firms that sell everything from speakers to phone accessories accused the tech giants of bullying business tactics. \"There's such a dominant power that exists with these companies that when Google or Apple asks for something ... you have no choice but to provide that to those companies,\" Patrick Spence, the CEO of wireless speaker company Sonos, told lawmakers. Sonos, Tile, Basecamp, and PopSockets all appeared Friday at a hearing by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law. Speaking at so-called \"field hearing\" that took place at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder, Colo., the executives called for Congress to implement tougher regulation of Big Tech.  The executives told similar stories about how the larger tech companies had used their dominance in one market to cripple competition in its emerging products and tilt the field in their favors for its other product lines. \"At some point, all companies will be competing against Big Tech simply because Big Tech is bent on expanding until it does absolutely everything,\" Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson added, and quipped, \"Help us Congress, you're our only hope.\"Got a similar story about Apple, Google or Amazon's practices?

Meanwhile, Apple develops and boosts its own alternative products. GettyTile makes stamp-sized Bluetooth trackers that help customers find their keys, wallets or phones. In some ways, the product competes with Apple's built-in Find My iPhone feature. According to Tile General Counsel Kristin Daru, the company has faced a series of stringent and arbitrary regulations from Apple that have drained its resources. \"Apple is acting as a gatekeeper to applications and technologies in a way that favors its own interests,\" Daru said. \"You might be the best soccer team, but you're playing against a team that owns the stadium, the ball, and the league, and can change the rules when it wants.\" Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson added that the company's App Store tax gives Apple a 30% margin advantage over every competitor. \"It is outrageous that that rate has stayed the same,\" Hansson said. Daru went on to list examples of the ways in which Apple had allegedly exploited the App Store in its favor: the Find My iPhone app is embedded into iOS while Tile can be installed - or deleted. Find My iPhone's settings are clear but Tile's are buried, thanks to iOS 13's updates, Daru said. Apple sent a statement to Business Insider after the trial, to say that it was updating its features to allow Tile (and other apps) to automatically enable its full functionality at the time of an app installation. \"We continually work with developers and take their feedback on how to help protect user privacy while also providing the tools developers need to make the best app experiences,\" a spokesperson said. \"We're currently working with developers interested in enabling the \"Always Allow\" functionality to enable that feature at the time of set up in a future software update.\"Google leverages its dominance in search to pressure companies to help boost its other businesses, executives said. REUTERS/Brandon Wade/File PhotoEarlier this month, Sonos sued Google[2], alleging that the tech giant infringed on five of its patents. But Sonos CEO Patrick Spence's testimony against Google went far beyond that. The advantages Google has in marketing its own products \"are like nothing we've ever seen before,\" Spence said. For instance, Spence alleged that Google had pressured Sonos to only allow its speakers to sync up with Google Assistant, rather than also offer it on Amazon's competing voice assistant Alexa. \"Looking at leveraging market dominance to dominate another category has to be thought through. Is that the spirit of the kind of world we want to live in?\" he later added. Threats of retaliation were also of ongoing concern to the testifying companies. \"We could lose our listing in DuckDuckGo and we wouldn't even tell. We lose Google and we lose our business,\" PopSockets CEO David Barnett said. Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson also had concerns on his company's presence on the search engine. Google makes up more than 40% of Basecamp's traffic, per Reuters[3], but it allowed competitors to buy ads on Benchmark's trademark and block consumers from reaching the site, Hansson said. The company could only compete by similarly buying ads on Google search. \"Sonos has made misleading statements about our history of working together. Our technology and devices were designed independently. We deny their claims vigorously, and will be defending against them,\" Google told Business Insider in a statement. \"For trademarked terms like the name of a business, our policy balances the interest of both users and advertisers. Like other platforms, we allow competitors to bid on trademarked terms because it offers users more choice when they are searching. However, if a trademark owner files a complaint, we will block competitors from using their business name in the actual ad text,\" Google said.Amazon hosts counterfeits and 'bullies' its third party sellers, according to PopSockets CEO Barnett Chip Somodevilla / Getty ImagesPopSockets, which makes phone accessories, accused Amazon of failing to remove counterfeit products and pressuring it to lower its prices. If it failed to do so, Amazon said it would source the same accessories from third-party sellers, PopSockets CEO David Barnett alleged. Barnett said Amazon had a host of such tactics to \"bully\" businesses, and described informing Amazon about 1000 fake products every day, with no recourse. At the same time, Barnett said that Amazon was lowering the prices it was charging consumers, and then demanding payment from PopSockets for its lost marginal profits. PopSockets has had a tense relationship with the online marketplace for years. The company eventually stopped selling on Amazon, as a result of counterfeits and aggressive pricing tactics, Barnett said. He ultimately suggested that Congress break up Amazon into two bodies: one that runs the marketplace, and the other that sells on it. \"We sought to continue working with PopSockets as a vendor to ensure that we could provide competitive prices, availability, broad selection and fast delivery for those products to our customers. Like any brand, however, PopSockets is free to choose which retailers it supplies and chose to stop selling directly through Amazon,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. \"Even so, we've continued to work with PopSockets to address our shared concerns about counterfeit, and continue to have a relationship with PopSockets through Merch by Amazon, which enables other sellers to create customized PopSockets for sale,\" Amazon said.See the rest of the story at Business Insider[4] See Also: How to get YouTube famous, according to an ex-Google exec who interviewed 45 YouTubers with

The states may announce their own, but coordinated, investigations as early as next month, the Wall Street Journal reports.[3] Calls for investigations into big tech is one area that both US political parties agree on. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[4]. States including North Carolina, Mississippi, Texas and others have met with top Justice Department officials in Washington last month to discuss a multi-state effort to investigate big tech companies for anti-trust violations, the Wall Street Journal reports[5], citing unnamed sources. The multi-state effort may be announced as soon as next month, the Journal reports, and would represent the third major government investigation underway into some of the largest American tech companies. </p><p>The states involved are run by Attorney's General who are members of both political parties, Democrats and Republicans. Their investigations into companies like Alphabet's Google and Facebook would likely be done in coordination with investigations by the U.S. Justice Department. Representatives from about a dozen states attended the meetings. Enlisting the help of the states in a bipartisan probe could help GOP officials defend against accusations that federal investigations into tech companies are politically motivated. Last month, The Department of Justice said it had launched a broad probe into top \"online platforms\" for search, social media, and e-commerce. It didn't name, names but the wording left no doubt that the subjects included Alphabet[6],Facebook[7],Amazon[8], andApple.[9] The Federal Trade Commission, which recently fined Facebook $5 billion for privacy violations, is carrying out an antitrust probe into Facebook. On Monday, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons, discussed the potential of breaking up Facebook's past acquisitions of companies like Instagram and WhatsApp, according to the Financial Times.[10] Simons told the FT that reversing those mergers could be more difficult because of Facebook's recent efforts to integrate the backend technology of the various products. But he noted that there might be \"additional evidence\" that Facebook used the acquisitions to \"snuff out\" competition. Beyond investigations into big tech by the Trump Administration, Democratic candidates have also been calling for investigations and other regulation of big tech companies and new technologies. Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Amazon, Google, and Facebook. On Monday, Bernie Sanders also called for banning sales of facial recognition technology to law enforcement agencies.

Their investigations into companies like Alphabet's Google and Facebook would likely be done in coordination with investigations by the U.S. Justice Department.</p><p>Representatives from about a dozen states attended the meetings. Enlisting the help of the states in a bipartisan probe could help GOP officials defend against accusations that federal investigations into tech companies are politically motivated.</p><p>Last month, The Department of Justice said it had launched a broad probe into top \"online platforms\" for search, social media, and e-commerce.

The developers, who make parental screen-time control apps, are unhappy after many were removed from the App Store soon after Apple launched its own \"Screen Time\" tool. Apple said the decision was not about competition, but was because the apps were deploying monitoring software known as mobile device management. The developers are now calling on Apple to publish a public API to let them build screen-time apps that comply with the iPhone maker's privacy rules. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1]  Seventeen tiny app makers have teamed up to take on the might of Apple. The developers, who make parental screen-time control apps, are unhappy after many were removed from the App Store soon after Apple launched its own \"Screen Time\" tool. The New York Times first reported[2] on the crackdown in April. Apple responded to the story[3], saying that it had removed the apps, not because they posed a competitive threat, but because they were using a kind of software it deemed overly-intrusive for consumer apps, called mobile device management, or MDM. Read more: Apple has a new website to defend its App Store's business practices from critics[4] MDM is used to let third-parties monitor and access devices remotely, and can even be used to wipe them. It's sometimes used by businesses to keep control of proprietary data on employees' devices. \"Contrary to what The New York Times reported... this isn't a matter of competition. It's a matter of security,\" Apple said in a blog published the day after the Times' report.[5] Now the app makers have launched a website[6] arguing that the solution is for Apple to openly publish an API for screen-time apps that gives developers \"access to the same functionalities that Apple's native 'Screen Time' uses.\" The developers have also written a technical specification for the API[7]. \"Apple's response to the story was that the timing was a coincidence; the reason the apps were removed or blocked was due to their use of MDM,\" they said.[8] \"There's an obvious solution and it's one that developers have been calling for from the start. Apple should release a public API granting developers access to the same functionalities that Apple's native \"Screen Time\" uses.\" The biggest app lobbying for change is Qustodio, which has a million downloads on Google Play Store, and likely had many more on Apple before it was removed. Apple was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider, although a spokeswoman for the app developers said they had not yet had correspondence from Apple following the launch of their campaign. Apple has faced a crop of antitrust allegations recently. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court waved through a lawsuit[9] accusing Apple of abusing its dominance in the App Store, and music-streaming service Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple with the EU in March[10]. In response, Apple launched a website specifically for defending its App Store business practices[11] just this week.NOW WATCH: I tried the $1,980 Samsung Galaxy Fold and it's impressive for a
