These massive corporations can do this because they have built considerable control over all of the information Americans view online. The vast majority of internet searches in the United States, over 88%, begin on Goggle's website. Millions of us wake up and check our social media platforms, like Twitter or Facebook, to see what happened while we were sleeping. One of the reasons these companies have been able to rise to their meteoric heights is because of protections extended through Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The section essentially states that these companies cannot be held responsible for the content of others on their platforms. It was intended to keep the internet free and open, but it is being abused by these companies to limit free speech and control what we do and don't see on the internet.</p><p>Earlier this week, it was reported that Google planned to ban The Federalist, a conservative publication, over readers' comments left on their website. Google said it would no longer run ads on their website. This decision shows not only the sheer power Google wields online, but also the raw hypocrisy that exists in Silicon Valley. Apparently, Google is not okay with websites like The Federalist and their conservative readers sharing their perspectives, but their left-leaning employees have no problem protecting free speech they agree with. Sadly, this selective enforcement is not limited to just Google. Twitter has, on several occasions, hid or flagged tweets made by President Trump for rhetoric they simply don't agree with. However, those regulating free speech at Twitter have made no effort to silence any other world leader on its platform, like Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran. These tech companies are widely inconsistent about how and when they enforce their policies. They must be held accountable for consistently taken disproportionate action to silence conservative voices they disagree with.</p><p> In Missouri, we know that these massive companies cannot continue to violate our Constitutional rights. To ensure they don't, Senator Josh Hawley recently introduced the Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act. This bill prevents the Section 230 protections from being provided to online companies unless they clearly detail their content moderation policies and pledge to enforce them in good faith. Under this legislation, when Americans feel these companies are not living up to their end of the deal, they can sue for $5,000 and attorney's fees. Silencing free speech is illegal in the United States, and it is something the American people will never accept. Google, Twitter, Facebook, and others, must understand that they are not too big to be held accountable.</p><p> The past few weeks have shown just how powerful these massive tech companies have become. Yet, the threat towards the free speech of conservative voices is not only a fight playing out online but also in newsrooms at some of the largest and oldest publications in this country. After having published an op-ed written by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, The New York Times faced a firestorm of liberal criticism. The paper's own staff were not prepared to read a viewpoint with which they did not agree. So, rather than engage in debate on the ideas, they complained that the opinions expressed by Senator Cotton amounted to violence. Words are not violence, and the views expressed by Senator Cotton on the looting and rioting are held by many Americans. Yet after initially supporting the piece's publication, the publisher of the New York Times later bowed down before the mob and fired the Head of the Opinion desk who allowed the opinion piece to be published.</p><p> We are entering a dangerous time in America. We used to believe that the best medicine for bad free speech was more free speech. Yet today, it seems that the liberal mob wants to burn books and silence voices. The day our voices become silenced; is the day we stop being Americans.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMO-d7eaa6c27ebf69a30821b7488942b0db43804</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289CC59FFBDFB8 NWBKMO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606W-74Y1-JBCN-42X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401953</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Daily Journal Online, 1513 St. Joe Drive Park Hills MO<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Some hailed the proposals to reform the EU but others kept their distance or accused Macron of being unrealistic and using Europe for his own political goals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe's East, Macron has certainly sparked discussion about the future of Europe. Despite disagreeing in principle with Macron, some Visegrad countries viewed his intervention as a chance to open the much-awaited debate about Europe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Obviously, according to them, this debate should not lead to more but rather less Europe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Germany, EPP's top candidate for the EU elections, Manfred Weber, welcomed Macron's proposal to change the EU Treaty change by dropping, for instance, the need for unanimity when deciding policy on foreign affairs. Similarly, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/diskussion-ueber-europa-maas-nennt-macrons-appell-wertvoll/24066606.html\">told Tagesspiegel</url>\u00a0that Macron's proposal was timely ahead of the EU vote: \"Macron gives very valuable impetus,\" he said.</p><p>Unlike politicians, the German business sector said 'Nein' to Macron.

Henry Newman, director of the Open Europe think-tank Open Europe, which is close to many Conservative ministers, warned Macron that \"your arrogance risks exacerbating Europe's problems not resolving them, that you are furthering divides not addressing them.\"</p><p>For Eastern European countries, Macron's call is an opportunity to draw clear lines between two opposing camps ahead of the EU elections in May. A <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">bras de fer</emphasis>\u00a0between two European futures.</p><p>Macron proposed, among other things, the creation of a 'European Agency for the Protection of Democracies', a reform of Schengen (both stringent border controls and solidarity) and Treaty changes.</p><p>In Poland, Ryszard Legato an MEP from the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) said Macron's proposals showed that \"the other side\"- meaning liberals or left-wing parties- were \"in panic\" adding that the French President's idea of Agency for the Protection of Democracies \"sounds scary\".</p><p>No Polish opposition politician has addressed this issue until now, but Polish EU Council chief Donald Tusk agreed with the French leader and tweeted, \"all those who care about EU should cooperate during and after the EU elections. The renaissance of Europe must start now\".</p><p>Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, a liberal, said the proposals were \"totally divorced from reality\". \"I have noticed that when France says 'more of Europe', it, in fact, means more of France. But that is not the way. We are all equals in Europe,\" he said.</p><p>In Slovakia, socialist PM Peter Pellegrini <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/PellegriniP_/status/1102833188378943488\">hailed</url> Macron's proposals while the conservative opposition SaS party called Macron a \"detriment\" for Europe. Unsurprisingly, they highlight his push for refugee quotas in that text, something they have staunchly opposed so far, and also see additional bureaucracy in many of his proposals,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.euractiv.sk/\">EURACTIV Slovakia</url>\u00a0reported.</p><p>Surprisingly, Hungary's PM Viktor Orb\u00e1n was more supportive. That could be a move to tone down his anti-EU rhetoric ahead of a crucial EPP meeting on 20 March, when his future membership in the party will be discussed.</p><p>\"This could mark the beginning of a serious European debate [...] in the details, of course, we have differences of views, but far more important than these differing opinions is that this initiative be a good start to a serious and constructive dialogue on the future of Europe,\" he told Reuters.</p><p>In Romania, the leader of the socialist ruling party Liviu Dragnea agreed with Macron, saying the EU should revert to the values on which it was born, but also used it to lash out at his political opponent, President Klaus Iohannis. \"Maybe if President Iohannis reads the message of his French counterpart he will understand that hatred and violence cannot be seen as political opinions\", Dragnea said.</p><p>In Croatia, political parties avoided taking a public position. The socialists and liberals reacted positively while the centre-right was more cautious.</p><p>Liberal MEP Ivan Jakovcic said Macron was \"brave\" to propose radical moves while Miro Kovac, a centre-right politician and head of the parliamentary committee for foreign affairs, told <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.euractiv.hr/\">EURACTIV Croatia</url>: \"The letter comes three months before the EU elections and serves the election campaign in France.\"</p><p>\"Macron is fighting the right in France and wants to send a message about his party's European orientation.

Stay tuned. Laura Ingraham takes it away. She's in the swamp. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington, and boy, do we have a show for you tonight. Texas Senator Ted Cruz will be here in a moment to respond to his opponent, Beto O'Rourke, who spoke out in at a town hall just moments ago. Plus, his reaction to the growing caravan making its way toward our border.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressman Devin Nunes is here, and he has details of a Democratic operative who harassed him and was later arrested for assaulting a GOP campaign worker in Nevada. Wait till you hear what this group is affiliated with and where this person comes from.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And just 18 days out from the midterm elections, Eric Trump is also here, and he's going to tell us why he says it's a good thing his father is the most important factor this election season. But first, the caravan of lies and manipulation. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.</p><p>As we approach election day, here is one thing that has become patently obvious. Democrats are uninterested in the things Americans care about most. Their prosperity and their safety. Instead of policy prescriptions, Democrats poison American discourse with constant demonization and perpetual intimidation.</p><p>In the Kavanaugh saga, we saw that they are masters at producing coordinated choreographed outrage. After that backfired, Democrats began to panic. Although still favored to take the House of Representatives, things began to shift somewhat after the Kavanaugh dust settled.</p><p>Stories suddenly began to pop up that Pelosi, Schumer and company were concerned that Latino voters weren't sufficiently enthusiastic in the midterms, which of course could doom Democrat chances to take the House. Then, like magic, a few days later, a story appeared out of nowhere about another caravan of central Americans headed to the U.S. from Honduras.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (UNTRANSLATED).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (UNTRANSLATED).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: A former Honduran left-wing politician even joined the caravan for a time before he was arrested. So what started as a group of 1,600 soon became 2,000, and then 4,000, and apparently growing.</p><p>Meanwhile, crusading reporters are feeding the narrative that anyone opposed to welcoming these caravaners into our country are cruel, horrible, awful, rotten people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: So what is the GOP strategy? We see it at this point as to push fear and loathing. If you don't vote, the scary people from the south are coming for you. You see that picture? That's what they want you to think all immigrants look like. People laying on the floor splayed out, not as civilized as you, different from you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: The media's over the top slurs against those of us who believe that the system must change and that our border has to be protected, it speaks volumes about their bias and the real motivation. Of course, which is to help Democrats like presidential hopeful Julian Castro.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT: The president continues to fearmonger around the issue of immigration. One of the worst things that has happened in these last 18 months has been basically state-sponsored child abuse of young kids at the border. This example today of what he said was a caravan, you know, he's picking that and he's trying to make an issue of it to gin up his base. I think that the American people can see through that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Do you know what the American people see through? Democrats' phony compassion politically timed in a desperate attempt to turn out Latino voters who themselves are seeing the wonders of the Trump economy, record low unemployment and the best economy in decades.</p><p>Castro was the mayor of San Antonio and his brother, Joaquin, he represents San Antonio in Congress. But I've never seen either of them on television standing for the families of those brutally murdered by illegal aliens, brutally, brutally hurt by rape, spousal abuse, child abuse, and as I said, even murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today's crime scene tape bordered the doors and broken glass are still outside this apartment on Jones Maltsberger Road. It was here just yesterday where firefighters found a badly burned body.</p><p>Police arrested and charged 20-year-old Ernesto Esquivel-Garcia with murder, arson, abuse of a corpse. San Antonio has learned U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now a part of this investigation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: ICE was apparently involved from the very beginning in the story, even before the gruesome murder. Back in 2017, Garcia was arrested for DWI and a misdemeanor criminal mischief after he reportedly rammed his truck into the car of an ex-girlfriend and her family members. He got an immigration judge, though, to give him a voluntary departure order.</p><p>Now, would you be surprised to hear that he did not leave the country voluntarily after that order? A few months later, he was in ICE custody a second time and a second time he was given a voluntary departure order. And now, in just 11 days, he awaits his trial for the murder of Jared Vargas.</p><p>Why aren't any of the Democrats who rail against family separation also railing about stories like this? Fifty-five illegal immigrants found stuffed in a truck ready to be shipped across the United States, undoubtedly many to unscrupulous employers.</p><p>Our open borders, as well as our immigration and asylum loopholes, are enriching the cartels, they are endangering migrants, and they are also making life worse for most Americans beyond the super rich who live in a protective bubble. How can we allow this to continue and still be a country?</p><p>Now, of course, not all illegal immigrants commit violent crime and many are good and hardworking people. But that's not really the point. No American should suffer or be brutalized in order to fulfill the Democrats' fantasy of a borderless society. No American worker should see his or her wages go down because there is an illegal immigrant who just arrived in the U.S. who is willing to work for 40 percent less.</p><p>In Donald Trump, we finally have a president who wants to tackle this problem, not just pass it onto the next president the way Obama did. You don't buy for a moment what the left is selling you. Democrats are the ones using this and stoking false fear among the Latinos to try to flip Congress. Again, no ideas, just more emotional manipulation.</p><p>We welcome and we treasure the Hispanic immigrants in this country who came here the legal way, like Tia from Venezuela, who called in to my radio show today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): I was born in Venezuela. I am a proud American citizen now, but I am terrified of what is happening. My mother would've never thought that Venezuela, 30 years later, was going to be a socialist country, and then five to eight years after that was going to descent into a dictatorship. Because once they get in, they change the Constitution. And now they are not even waiting. They want the Supreme Court because they want to change the Constitution, and there goes our country.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>INGRAHAM: There goes our country. We get a lot of those calls on the radio. Legal immigrants enraged. Now, we all know the negative changes that open borders and catch and release bring to America. Look no further than California's rampant homelessness, filthy streets, ballooning low fare (ph) programs, crashing regulations.</p><p>That's what a Democrat super majority sanctuary state ends up looking like. The president is standing up for you. He wants this to stop. This morning, he tweeted, \"we spend billions enforcing other countries' borders as our own has become a joke. Our laws ignored and our generation and compassion exploited\"</p><p>He said this as well. He said, \"in addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught. And if they are unable to do so, I will call up the U.S. military and close our southern border.\" That's what his tweet said.</p><p>Now, the Democrats talk taking the House, will ensure that this caravan of 4,000 eventually becomes a flow of four million, four million plus before we know it. This cannot happen.</p><p>But as we told you last night, if you are still on the fence about what to do on November 6th in the midterm election, just think for a moment about who is in line to chair the important committees when it comes to these issues, like Homeland Security and the Judiciary Committee if the Democrats do take the house. Bennie Thompson from Mississippi would take Homeland Security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D), MISSISSIPPI: You would think the most important homeland security problem facing the nation is a handful of central Americans moving through Mexico. That does not make it so. Better to distract the American people from the real issues facing the department and perhaps from the president's own problems too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: And meanwhile, Jerry Nadler would oversee judiciary which includes immigration and border security. And we know he's far more interested in investigating Justice Kavanaugh than solving our border problem. Come on. Hispanic Americans are smart enough to spot a con when they see one.</p><p>So I say it's time to walk away from the Democrats' cynical game of identity politics and emotional manipulation and towards candidates whose policies result in higher wages and better security for all Americans. And that's THE ANGLE.</p><p>Here with us now is Cristin Vargas. Her nephew Jared was the man murdered in the story I just talked about in THE ANGLE. Cristin, first of all, I want to thank you so much tonight for being here. I know it's really difficult to do this interview. This is a horrible situation for your family. I just appreciate it so very much. I think Americans need to hear about Jared story and what happened to him.</p><p>Cristin, how does your family react to those who say that raising concerns about illegal immigration and clearly what is de facto amnesty going on are just being used, these stories are being just used to stoke fear?</p><p>CRISTIN VARGAS, AUNT OF MAN ALLEGEDLY KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT: It's completely disgusting and it's outrageous. I just want to thank you, Laura, for the opportunity to come on your show and for paying attention and caring about Jared.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Tell me about him, his life, his family. I know his mother is devastated. Tell me about him.</p><p>VARGAS: Absolutely I could frankly talk about him for hours and I know we don't have that kind of time here today, but Jared, beautiful mind college student here in San Antonio. Hard worker is an understatement. He was always working full time and going to school, sometimes working two jobs. He had an uncanny ability to balance family, friends, work, school. Always smiling. Just an awesome kid.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Ernesto Esquivel-Garcia, I hate to even mention his name. He's up for murder. Trial is in 11 days. Illegally in the United States. He is accused of setting fire to your nephew's apartment and abuse of the corpse, burning your nephew alive. How did your nephew know him, did he know him?</p><p>VARGAS: So, Jared has encountered this individual at his place of employment. He worked at a high end bar/restaurant here in San Antonio. And the individual that killed Jared was working there under an alias name. As a matter of fact, he has about nine alias names that we are aware of. Using fake, fraudulent documents to do so. And so they knew each other for less than three weeks, but they met each other through their employer.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And Jared's grandmother is a dual citizen of Mexico and the United States, I understand, and she is beyond furious, heartbroken, as is so many members of your family. Losing such a beautiful young man working hard in this country only -- this is a death that you wouldn't want to happen to an animal, but this man and this country did this who should never have been in this country, Cristin.</p><p>And I think it's so important for you and your family to speak out about those people who are continuing to welcome in all these illegal immigrants. We don't know what their intentions are. A lot of them are just here to work and indeed Garcia was working. But it's not a victimless crime, is it?</p><p>VARGAS: No, it's not. You called at the fact that he was working, but he's also committing crimes. So it's just really difficult for us to process now from the outside looking into this and just seeing all of the systemic failures as far as coming here illegally, working here illegally, living here illegally, continuing to break laws, commit crimes, and ultimately taking Jared away from us.</p><p>We are very strongly positioned that this was a preventable tragedy, a completely preventable tragedy, and I think that's what is most difficult as we continue to grieve and try to make some sort of sense of this.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Did you hear from any of the politicians in your state? Did you hear from the Castro brothers? Did they call or come visit your family?</p><p>VARGAS: The Castro brothers absolutely did not. We have had a --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Oh, my god.</p><p>VARGAS: -- very, very bright light come into our world. His name is Chip Roy. He is a congressional candidate here in San Antonio. He listened to our story. He cares about our story. We've developed a personal relationship with him. And it's been really helpful to us to have someone that's actually advocating for us, understand the issues.</p><p>And as we explain the fractures that we are seeing as victims, he gets the big picture and we just trust that -- clearly, we need Chip but we need more of Chip too to help not just put pressure on enforcing the existing laws but influencing change so this can stop. Our justice position is to not have one other family go through this complete horror that we are having to go through.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Cristin, I'm going to talk to you off-line because I want to try to help your family as well. So, I will be in touch with you after the show, but thank you for coming on. This is so enraging that a single American loses a life because of these ridiculous policies. Cristin, please give my best to your family and I'm so sorry for the loss of Jared. I wish I got the chance to meet him. I'm so sorry.</p><p>VARGAS: Thank you so much, Laura, again for this opportunity and thank you for caring.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I do care. I care greatly. I'll be in touch with you after the show and thank you again.</p><p>VARGAS: Thank you so much.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Absolutely. For reaction to this story and as response to his opponent, Beto O'Rourke, town hall earlier, we are joined by Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, I went long on that interview and I'm sorry because I took some of your time. But this is a great family from Texas.</p><p>Their lives have been turned upside down and hearts broken. They don't even get a call from the former mayor of San Antonio who was on TV talking about this caravan thing and demonizing Donald Trump and all Republicans, and didn't even get a call from his brother who is a congressman from the area where this kid was burned to death. What is going on in this country, senator?</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: Laura, thank you for having Miss Vargas on and for telling her story and telling Jared's story. It is heartbreaking, it is tragic, and it never should have happened. You are right, the Democratic politicians, they turned a blind eye to the suffering, the violent crimes that are committed.</p><p>I was glad to hear her describe that she's been able to work with Chip Roy. Chip is my former chief of staff and he's the Republican nominee for Congress out of San Antonio. He is going to make a terrific congressman. Miss Vargas should not be suffering.</p><p>This individual, this illegal alien, committed multiple crimes. Our revolving door system lets criminals, drug criminals, violent criminals who are illegal aliens stay here. You've got a voluntary removal order which he ignored.</p><p>It's the reason we need to pass Kate's law, which I've authored in the Senate that says aggravated felon, violent criminal illegal aliens who enter the country illegally repeatedly should face a mandatory minimum prison sentence so that violent criminals are not in our communities, they are not taking lives --</p><p>INGRAHAM: That was a DWI though, senator --</p><p>CRUZ: -- but rather protect --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yeah, this was a DWI.</p><p>CRUZ: You're right but a DWI -- we should have deported him when he had committed DWI. When he was arrested, he should have been put on a plane or put on a bus and sent back to the country he came from. We shouldn't be releasing illegal aliens who commit DWI.</p><p>I have met too many Texans, too many people who lost loved ones to illegal immigrants who are criminals, who commit DWIs, and it's wrong. We need to protect our country and not allow criminals and drug dealers to come into the country illegally.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Senator, you did a fantastic job in your debate the other night with your opponent, Mr. O'Rourke. He is in a town hall earlier tonight and said this, and I will get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D), TEXAS: I decided that he spent the rest of the debate responding to every single dishonest thing that he said or I could make sure everyone understood exactly what he's doing. Look, he's dishonest. It's one of the reasons that he got tagged with this nickname. That nickname resonates because it's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Obviousness, the \"Lyin' Ted\" nickname which is unfortunate for the primary. But now he's quoting the president in order to make his case. It seems like there is no there there. I watched him. He is a good-looking guy. There is no there there. There is no like, where is the beef?</p><p>CRUZ: Well, you can see the desperation in that debate where he was insulting me. He was attacking me. He called me a liar. What's striking is what he was responding to when he screamed liar as I pointed out that he voted in favor of a $10 a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the state of Texas. And his response is not to engage in substance but simply screamed, liar, liar, liar.</p><p>Well, you know, facts matter, and we put up on our website, tedcruz.org, the exact text of the resolution that Congressman O'Rourke voted on. President Obama proposed a $10 a barrel tax on oil. Congress -- the House of Representatives brought up a resolution saying, we don't want a $10 tax on every barrel of oil and O'Rourke voted no. And his response is just to scream liar and then that's not honest (ph).</p><p>INGRAHAM: Senator, we're out of time, but we enjoyed that debate. I wouldn't want to debate you any day of the week, no thanks. Good luck, Beto. It's not going to happen. Great to see you, Senator. Thanks so much.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, Michelle would say that, you know, when they go low, we go high. No, no. When they go low, we kick them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: It seems that some Democrats have been taking suggestions like that from Eric Holder quite literally. A hostile democratic operative with ties to George Soros and a long history of harassing Republicans has been arrested for battery against a female campaign manager of a GOP candidate. For details like this, we're joined by fox news correspondent, Trace Gallagher. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Laura. The main in question is Wilford M. Stark III, known very well on Capitol Hill as Mike Stark. He was arrested in Las Vegas for assaulting Kristin Davison, the campaign manager for Nevada GOP gubernatorial nominee, Adam Laxalt.</p><p>Davison says Mike Stark grabbed her and yanked her arm and refused to let go. She told authorities the attack left her traumatized and horrified. But for Mike Stark, it might have been another day to the office. He is a reporter for the American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal organization founded by David Brock, who also founded the liberal watchdog group, Media Matters, and funded by billionaire, George Soros, famous for giving money to liberal political causes. After Stark was arrested, American Bridge fired him for his bad behavior. But sources said they also hired him for his bad behavior.</p><p>Conn Carroll, the communications director for Utah Republican senator, Mike Lee, told Fox News that during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, Stark followed, filmed and harassed Senator Lee in the basement of the Senate Building. Carroll also tweeted, quote, \"I've known Mike Stark for literally over a decade. This is who he is. American Bridge knows who he is and what he does and they hired him accordingly.\"</p><p>In fact, sources tell Fox News that when Stark was arrested for assault in Vegas, he told police that this was, quote, \"his job,\" and he does this for a living. That prompted Kentucky Senator Rand Paul to question whether American Bridge was propagating this, quoting, \"Soros paid protester arrested, same group operates inside congressional office buildings. Are Democrats paying to incite violence?\"</p><p>And Starks' resume highlights a violent past. He was convicted for disorderly conduct after aggressively approaching Virginia GOP gubernatorial candidate, Ed Gillespie, back in 2017. And earlier, he was arrested for assaulting a female staffer for interior secretary Ryan Zinke. American Bridge has not responded to whether it knew about Stark's criminal past. Laura?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Trace, thanks so much. And California Congressman House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes was also harassed by this man just a few months earlier. Congressman Nunes joins us now. Congressman, how long was this Stark guy bothering you and have there been any others harassing you in a similar manner because this is an attack to the Democrats, get in your face, hope to provoke you, get an inch from your face or a centimeter from your face, and then see what flies?</p><p>SEN. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA: Yeah. They've been doing this to me and many of my colleagues, Laura, for the better part of a year and a half. Anybody who is involved in the Russian investigation and all, we were harassed. This guy in particular actually went to our office numerous times.</p><p>He would follow me in. He'll get in my face. He showed up at committee hearings. He even showed up at place downtown in Washington where I was giving a speech one time. And including -- he actually showed up at the airport one time.</p><p>And so, we had to have the Capitol Police come several times because he would harass me, he'd harassed our staff. And look, this is not the way we should operate here in the United States of America. People should be frightened about this. Nobody is going to want to do these jobs if you have to deal with guys like this, right?</p><p>Like for me, I'm fine. I'll fight back. But look at how many people that maybe you're thinking of becoming a judge or Supreme Court judge or run for office? With these lunatics running around like this, funded by billionaires who should know better, this is not the type of activity we want to see in this country.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, when you say you're going to fight back, that's the point though, right? You really can't unless they touch you. If they touch you, they can just grab your hand, that's an assault. So then -- if you --</p><p>NUNES: Well, what I mean by -- what I mean --</p><p>INGRAHAM: -- if you're in legitimate fear of your life, you can respond. Now, look, I mean if someone ever comes up to my family or touches one of my kids, good luck. I mean I'm -- this mother tiger comes out. You're not - - it's not going to happen. OK?</p><p>NUNES: Yeah.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So, I got -- it doesn't bother -- people like who get in my face, just go ahead. I mean I have plenty of -- even jokes that I can throw back at you. But you are right. This is meant to intimidate people who might not, you know, be like you and I away from politics altogether.</p><p>And George Soros, we cannot underestimate the power of his billions of dollars funneling through these David Brock groups and run by David Brock whether it the Media Matters crew or whether it's American Bridge crew. At some point, is there a time to investigate their 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) status? I mean, is this really -- is this the type of legitimate speech or is this just targeted harassment?</p><p>NUNES: Well, look. This gets to the heart of campaign finance reform. We last had that under George W. Bush at the beginning of his term. And what this has led to is absolute chaos where billionaires can come in and feed these guys. So, is there's something need to be done about this? Yes. But unfortunately, the Republicans, we're not going to get involved in that type of behavior. And I think the Democrats, until they're taught a lesson, they're not going to change. They see this working.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Right.</p><p>NUNES: They see that they're protesting, the harassment, all of this, they see it as working. And I hope it backfires this fall and I think a lot of people are slowly waking up to the fact that this is not the type of behavior we should have in our political system.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You live in a beautiful state. California is a beautiful state. But it basically has a super majority democrat-controlled of the state legislature, obviously all of the senators, governors, at least for now. The rest of the country, what do we need to learn from California? Because people say what happens in California will come to your state eventually. So what shouldn't people want other than the beach and the beautiful agriculture and all that, the mountains, and so forth, but what else don't the American people not want?</p><p>NUNES: What you are seeing happen in California today, Laura, is you're massive homelessness. Because of our weather, because we don't arrest people, because we don't put them in jail, because we let them get away with everything, we have massive homelessness all over the state. And it's really people who are -- it's sad, because they are burned out on drugs, they have got a lot of mental problems.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And a lot of illegal immigrants on the streets, correct? There are a lot of illegal immigrants in a lot of the tent villages as well in L.A. and so forth.</p><p>NUNES: It's tough to know who they are or whether they are legal or not legal, but I will tell -- people think it's just San Francisco and they hear about the feces on the street which is absolutely disgusting, and it's true. But you see it all over California in any city or town that you go to or visit.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Congressman, before we let you go, apparently some of your opponents think it's really funny to put signs around your district written in Russian, OK? Nunes -- means \"Nunes got to go,\" basically. That's what that says. I speak Russian so I can translate the signs for you, but I'm not sure most people in your district are understanding the Russian. So I think the joke -- I not sure the joke is actually going to be very effective there.</p><p>NUNES: Well, I think the point of those signs, people understand, is those are also being put up by the same people that are funding this Stark character. So the billionaires are funding protesters, they are funding movement, they are funding crazy building billboards. The best part about that billboard, though, is I have a 98-year-old grandmother who has our family farm here, lives on it. She has been harassed by reporters and other wackos that have shown up on her house. She lives by herself. And the other day she told me she was driving down the freeway and saw some of those signs. She actually thought they were mine. So I think to some degree, they are benefiting me to some degree.</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's not a bad picture of you, Congressman. I would take all the facetime you can get there on the billboard. All right, Congressman, we got through a whole interview and we didn't even talk about Rod Rosenstein not one time. That's got to be a record with you. But we'll have it next time. Congressman, thanks so much.</p><p>NUNES: Thank you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Despite not being on the ballot, the 2018 midterms are all about President Trump. Eric Trump is here to talk on why he thinks that's the best possible scenario. Don't go away.</p><p>INGRAHAM: As the midterms fast approach, the numbers speak for themselves. Regardless of whether voters say they are supporting Republicans or Democrats, the one common denominator in their decision is President Trump. So is that good news or bad news just 18 days out from the election? Joining me now to discuss is Eric Trump. Eric, good to see you, my friend.</p><p>ERIC TRUMP: How are you?</p><p>INGRAHAM: I'm great. Thanks for being here. Your father on the campaign trail tonight in Montana. Do you think these visits are helping boost the enthusiasm in some of these tighter races?</p><p>ERIC TRUMP, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION: There's no question about it. Look at the audiences he has. It's incredible. He'll got to Montana, he'll have 20,000 people show up. He'll go to Nevada, he'll have 30,000 people show up. People are excited. People want to get out of there. The energy in those rooms is nothing short of incredible.</p><p>And listen, he has a lot to tell, Laura, right? We have the best economy that we've ever had as a country. We have the fastest GDP growth, the lowest unemployment, the stock market is booming, consumer confidence is through the roof. I could go on and on and on. But he has a lot to boast about. He's doing an unbelievable job and our country is back. We haven't seen this in a very long time, but our country is back.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Ade Eric, when you see the hostility, despite all what you just laid out, the hostility out there. I'm going to play you a clip of a total lunatic ripping down Ted Cruz signs. We had Ted Cruz on earlier but we didn't have time to play this for him, so we'll play it for you. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have about 100 of these. I'm about to put more out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I hate Ted Cruz. I hate Ted Cruz. I hate Ted Cruz.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: That kind of sums it up, doesn't it? They are either clawing at the Supreme Court door or I guess ripping other people's posters down and signs.</p><p>ERIC TRUMP: It's unbelievable. The lack of civility I talk about it all the time. It's unbelievable. I saw that earlier today. And listen, that helps. Honestly, those people are so radical no one can relate to them. No one can relate to them. You saw the guy last week who had his pickup truck burned because he had American flag on the bumper and a Trump sticker on the bumper.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, we had him on.</p><p>ERIC TRUMP: You have the person, as you said, clawing at the Supreme Court door. You see Ted Cruz and his great wife Heidi, they are getting yelled that at dinner. I could go on and on. But when does this end?</p><p>Laura, Americans don't want to see the stuff. That's not who we are as a society. That is a rogue faction. But the left has gone so far left, they've become so radicalized that they think its acceptable behavior. When you have Eric Holder going out there and saying, you know what, when they're down, let's kick them in the head. And Hillary coming out and saying the only time we are going to be civil human beings is when we win again? Why didn't you win in the first place? Your message didn't work. You weren't effective. You weren't doing the job, and you had a person much better and who came in and beat handily. And so it's really a shame.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Eric, one of your father's favorite people out there of all time, I think, is Rosie O'Donnell. So she mixed it up today with Nicole Wallace. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He wants to send the military to the border.</p><p>ROSIE O'DONNELL: I want to send the military to the White House to get him.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think I can top that. That's a pretty good idea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's a good idea. They are either blowing the White House up or they want to take the military and take him out of the White House. By any means necessary. I guess it's a joke, but it's not all that funny.</p><p>ERIC TRUMP: No, it's not that funny. When you actually forget about Rosie, she pops back into the scene. It's every two months she seems to cycle through and through and through. It's kind of amazing how that works.</p><p>But this isn't what people care about. I think we're going to do very well in the midterms. People have to get out there and vote, right? It's the most important thing in the world. But the country is back, Laura. We are winning by everything a metric. It doesn't matter if it's our military. It doesn't matter if it's our economy, ISIS, immigration. America is winning. People have jobs again, salaries are going up, 401(k)s are through the roof. That's what people care about.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But the left, the left is -- these people want to so chaos.</p><p>ERIC TRUMP: Because they don't have a message, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They have no message.</p><p>ERIC TRUMP: They stand for high taxes, they stand for banning plastic straws, they stand for going after law enforcement, and total anarchy. That's their message.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Abolish ICE, that's their other big platform.</p><p>And 200 Riverside Boulevard, Trump condominium, beautiful building. The Trump name now taken down from that building. What is that all about? You're in the business of running this company on top of everything else that you have going on in your life, your family, everything else, but that just seems like hate. What is that?</p><p>ERIC TRUMP: It's the nastiness of politics, it's a byproduct of the nastiness of politics. We've been out of that building for a very long time. We sold out. It was a great success. My father literally rebuilt the entire west side of New York City. You probably know the old railway yards, and it was a major success. But this is the byproduct and nastiness of politics. You have one person who doesn't like you who sits on the board, and what they can do is pretty unbelievable. But again, we've been at that building for a very long time. It doesn't hurt us at all. But it is certainly the byproduct of exactly what we've been talking about the entire show, that radical left, that nastiness. And it's going to be defeated. It is absolutely going to be defeated.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Eric, it is almost like the better the country does, the more unhappy and bitter they become.</p><p>ERIC TRUMP: They realize they're losing. They're realize they're lashing out, and they're lashing out. They all got it wrong, Laura. You know this better than any person in the world, they all got it wrong. \"The New York Times\" election morning gave my father a 1.9 percent chance of winning, 1.9 percent. And he won easily, right? And so what do they do? They double down, and they double down. And Laura, I promise you, and you know this, they are going to get it wrong again, and they are going to get it wrong again. My father is going to go down as truly one of the greatest presidents in the history of this country. This country is winning again, we're back, and I could not be more proud of him.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Thank you so much, Eric, for being here tonight. I really appreciate it.</p><p>We have been highlighting the recent spate of attacks on Republican candidates, campaign workers, offices. And up next, we speak to a Minnesota candidate who may be the victim of the worst attack yet. His story when we return.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS, (D) CALIFORNIA: They're not going to be able to go to a restaurant. They are not going to be able to stop at a gas station. They are not going to be able to stop at a department store. The people are going to turn on them. They are going to protest. They are going to absolutely harass them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: That threat from auntie Maxine has now extended to include people who are running as Republicans. There have been at least eight violent attacks on Republicans just this year. Republican politicians, their staffers, and their offices where they work have frankly become a recurring target for political violence. And one of the more recent cases out of Minnesota might be the worst one yet. Local House candidate Shane Mekeland was out at a restaurant when a man approached him, punched him in the face, leaving him concussed. He was knocked out. Mekeland is still recovering from the incident, which he believes was politically motivated. Shane joins us now. Shane, tell us a little bit about your assailant. Did you know him before the assault?</p><p>SHANE MEKELAND, (R) MINNESOTA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: No, I did not know him. And I walked into this place to inquire about renting or using a banquet room that they have for a political function for the Republican ticket in our area. The owner was not there, but somebody said, how's the campaign going? So there was a conversation. Several people throughout the time come and go, but this gentleman did eventually come around. And there was conversation with him. It did not seem bad in the beginning. And then somebody to my right started talking so I looked away. When I heard this out of my left ear, this guy say, you bleeping people don't give a bleep about the middle class, and he literally punched me somewhere right about in here, which I was in a chair, which sent it flying backwards. When my head hit the floor, that was the last thing I remember.</p><p>I was told by one of the witnesses that he then, this was a very big man, six and a half feet tall at least and probably somewhere between 270 to 300 pounds, with very big hands, I might add, that he jumped down on top of me. Apparently, he wasn't done. But luckily the folks nearby were able to pull him off and throw him off.</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, so now he has not been arrested. And you do believe this is politically motivated, targeting you because you are a Republican? Did you know he was following you? How would he know that you're going into this banquet room? I'm not questioning that, I'm just trying to figure this out.</p><p>MEKELAND: When I walked in there was a group of people around. And one gal, she brought up, how's the campaign? So it started with this younger man saying, campaign for what? And then he told me his story. He actually got a yard sign from me that we went and put in in his vehicle. And then he went away. This other person moved and we started talking. He actually took my lip piece and we shook hands prior to all this. and this comment comes out when I'm looking away. I never saw it coming. The doctor said it might've been in my benefit on the one hand because I would've tensed up and he probably would've done a little more damage.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Hold on. Do you feel like the intimidation and the call to get in people's faces, you just heard auntie Maxine Waters, is that fueling this, this violence?</p><p>MEKELAND: I actually put this on Facebook in a response to somebody sending me well wishes when heard about this. Her name, Hillary's name, Eric Holder, and a local paper. It literally tore me apart and said, insinuated how would their comments affect rural Minnesota. So I don't know if they don't think we have TVs or radios out there, but it's obviously very much tied together. They are stirring up the pot with people.</p><p>I personally did not sign up to get sucker punched and knocked out. I don't wish a concussion on anybody. This is one of the most awful things I've ever had happen to me. And I certainly don't want this to be the environment my 12-year-old daughter is brought up in going forward in life. Up here in Minnesota, we have a lot of really close races, and we have a DFL governor who is going on sanctuary state versus our Republican who is completely normal and less taxes and less government.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The idea, Shane, that Minnesota will elect this leftwing Democrat governor? Forget about it. Minnesota, you've got to wake up. This kind of attack on a guy running for district 15-B in a rural area? This is just OK now? This is what the Democrats have come to? This is insanity. I hope you are OK. I know you're not really able to go out campaigning now because of this injury. Shane, please feel better. Take care of yourself, get surrogates out there to campaign for you. But you need to pull out a win.</p><p>MEKELAND: Will do.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We are sorry about what happened to you, and stand strong.</p><p>We have highlighted numerous cases of conservative censorship from big tech on this show, but this could be the worst. A triple amputee Air Force vet is here next. He's going to tell us what Facebook did to him and to his family, next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: No to a particularly egregious case of tech censorship. Facebook reportedly deleted a disabled Air Force vets' conservative news page without warning. This after he says he invested over $300,000 in ads. Earlier this month Facebook announced it was purging more than 800 accounts because of inauthentic behavior, but our next guest never imagined it could happen to him.</p><p>Brian Kolfage's page had a verified checkmark and he says 3.5 million fans, but it was all taken away in an instant. Brian joins us now to tell us about it. Brian, first of all, thank you so much for your heroism and sacrifice for this country. You are amazing. And I have to ask you, has Facebook been in touch with you at all?</p><p>BRIAN KOLFAGE, U.S. AIR FORCE (RET): No. First, thanks for having me on. No, Facebook has not been in touch with us. And I want to start this off and just get it out here. I want you guys know that I sacrificed three limbs for everybody, for your freedom, my family's freedom because that's why I believe in. That's why I joined the military. If I can get everybody to go to Fightforfreespeech.com, we really need everyone to go there and sign up and sign our petition, and we're going to take this fight to Facebook. Go ahead, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: What was the reasoning, you think? You helped raise $300,000 in the Kavanaugh fight, I know that. And then it was after that your Facebook page was, bingo, gone.</p><p>KOLFAGE: There is no real reason. We remained in contact in Facebook for nine months begging them since January when they rolled out the new rule changes. They would not contact us to give us the meeting to go over the rules. We wanted them to remain in contact to go over these rules, but they wouldn't. They didn't want to help us. We were begging them. I sent over 50 emails directly to our Facebook contact Katie Harvin (ph) and she was ignoring it. Any other person or any other company, they would've been helping them. They didn't want to help us. We wanted to understand the rules. We wanted to be the good part of Facebook. We always follow the rules. The Facebook page never had an issue. We were never banned from Facebook. Never had issues with false news, misinformation, or anything. So the whole reasoning is up in the air. We don't understand why.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We reached out as well, Brian. We reached out as well and they didn't get back to us.</p><p>KOLFAGE: The one thing we did do, after nine months we finally did get that meeting two weeks ago. But you know what, on October 3rd, when that meeting was supposed to take place, they didn't give us and they canceled it two days prior. Right when they canceled it, we had raised over $600,000 with John Hopkins who founded rightwing news, and that's when it was pulled. That was in the news. I was raising all that money for Justice Kavanaugh. They pulled it. One week later, our page was gone. And all our pages were gone. I own a coffee company called Military Grade Coffee. That company has nothing to do with politics, and they yanked it. That was my financial support for my family. And they are attacking my family, they're attacking me, and they're attacking my rights.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Brian, we are going to keep on the story and we're going to follow the story. Thank you for your service to this country, your sacrifice to this country. And everyone go to Brian's website. It will be linked on LauraIngraham.com. Brian, thanks so much. Stay there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It is time for the last bite. What are these midterm elections really about? Trump told the Montana crowd this earlier tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That's what it's going to be. It's going to be an election of those things, law and order, Kavanaugh. Remember commonsense. And remember it's going to be an election of the caravan. You know what I'm talking about.

Some policymakers now seem determined to \"take on\" Big Tech-whether by breaking up companies, enforcing divestment, or directly regulating them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet watching the grandstanding lawmakers and parsing the CMA report, an obvious problem becomes clear. Neither has any robust evidence consumers are harmed by tech companies' current actions. Instead, it is assumed that competitors' complaints about tech companies' business practices are synonymous with competition being undermined.</p><p>Given their sheer size and prevalence, \"Big Tech\" firms certainly occupy a \"psychological monopoly\" status in today's landscape. Yet economists know big need not be bad for customers, especially when high user numbers enhance the service or company size reflects developing the best product.</p><p>All these businesses compete with each other across numerous domains, from digital assistants to devices and streaming. What matters from a competition perspective is whether each dominates any relevant product market, restricting competition to consumers' detriment.</p><p>Defining that relevant market is easier said than done. Google began as a user search engine, yet competes for paid custom in digital advertising. Increasingly people don't use Google to search for websites, but to get quick information or see a destination they're looking for, including via maps, flight bookings, videos and more. These are sub-sectors with many competitors.</p><p>Facebook arguably faces more complex strands of competitive pressure. It competes with any website spoiling for users' time-including in messaging, telecoms, newsfeeds, connection apps, review websites, and more. Its paying customers are, again, advertisers, who enjoy a range of options for placing ads, as shown by a recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/mr-bezos-mute-tech-bosses-escape-marathon-washington-grilling/\">Facebook boycott</url> by some advertising companies.</p><p>Amazon and Apple have more obvious \"core\" markets. But even beyond operating in the retail and phone sectors, the pair compete across other products, from e-books to operating systems. Both have developed rich digital ecosystems that allow third parties to sell goods or apps, actively broadening competition in many sectors.</p><p>It's certainly true that Big Tech companies, while providing openings for small businesses, have disrupted many others, from newspapers to high street shops. But that's consumer-led capitalism, as pointed out in Amazon owner Jeff Bezos' opening statement. Government shouldn't use competition policy to protect incumbents from products or services consumers prefer. Its job should be to protect the welfare of customers who benefit from dynamic competition.</p><p>Here, the big picture shows a boon for users and advertisers. Amazon delivers goods to us more efficiently than ever. Apple has trail-blazed with smartphones and apps. Facebook and Google provide us with valuable services free at the point of use. Digital advertising costs overall have fallen by 40pc in the past decade, with better targeting. Instant messaging is free. All this has improved our resilience in the pandemic.</p><p>To say Big Tech engages in harmful anticompetitive conduct then, you have to make the more speculative case that all these benefits we've enjoyed would have been delivered in more fragmented markets. That, if just a few more social media companies, app platforms, search engines, and online retailers existed, we'd have seen lower prices still, lower advertising costs, better privacy, and more innovation.</p><p>Such speculative hypotheticals have proved necessary in the absence of real evidence of consumer harm. The CMA report, for example, used the term \"could be\" 91 times, \"we believe\" 27 times, and \"might\" 76 times. As NetChoice's Christopher Marchese concluded, such speculation might be expected when announcing a competition review, but not in a report justifying huge government interventions in the functioning of the world's biggest companies.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/mr-bezos-mute-tech-bosses-escape-marathon-washington-grilling/\">The US politicians' focus on the impact of Big Tech on competitors</url> highlighted the lack of evidence of harm to consumers. A lot expressed worries about the effects of supposedly aggressive tech mergers and acquisitions on the competitive landscape - including Google's purchase of YouTube and Facebook's of WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>Yet as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg explained, these mergers enhanced real-world competition by strengthening competition to traditional TV and mobile companies. While in hindsight these mergers might look like tech companies snuffing out possible competition to their own services, that presumes acquired companies would have done as well without the investment and expertise of their purchasers. One could hardly claim consumers have suffered worse or fewer services as a result, regardless.</p><p>Confusingly, other times the politicians complained about having more competitors in markets, bemoaning instances where Amazon and Google used data they'd acquired to enter new product lines. Apparently, Big Tech companies competing with existing businesses through lower priced own-brand products is a bad thing.</p><p>The lack of evidence about consumer welfare, however, was probably best exemplified by how many questions attacked the companies for non-economic reasons, such as alleged failures in fighting online harms, or content moderation choices. Yet these have little to do with market structure and competition. There's no reason to think smaller companies would do better policing criminal activity or protecting speech.</p><p>In all then, the Congressional testimony, like the CMA report, served a useful purpose in exposing the paucity of any competition case against these companies. Yes, they are big and hold hard-earned incumbency advantages, whether on user numbers or data. But their success overwhelmingly comes from consumers valuing their services.</p><p>If you think sustained dominance for these companies is just assured, however, without them engaging in continual innovation to stay on top, you should check out how well Myspace, AOL, Instant Messenger and Microsoft Internet Explorer are doing today.</p><p>                       Ryan Bourne holds the R Evan Scharf chair for the public understanding of economics at the Cato Institute.                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-64833004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-2N21-F021-600X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><timeReceived>12:49 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Therefore, the creation of new regulatory oversight bodies and filing requirements to exile politically disfavored opinions on the one hand, and efforts to force the inclusion of conservative content on the other, should both be rejected.</p><p>Much of the Internet's spectacular growth can be attributed to the immunity from liability for user- generated content afforded to social media plat- formsand other Internet-enabled services such as discussion boards, review and auction sites, and commentary sectionsby Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.

It is the case that changes have been made to Section 230, such as with respect to sex trafficking, but deeper, riskier change is in the air today, advocated for by both Republicans and Democrats. It is possible that some content removals may happen in bad faith, or that companies violate their own terms of service, but addressing those on a case-by-case basis would be a more fruitful approach. Section 230 notwithstanding, laws addressing misrepresentation or deceptive business practices already impose legal discipline on companies.</p><p>Regime-changing regulation of dominant tech firms whether via imposing online sales taxes, privacy mandates, or speech codesis likely not to discipline them, but to make them stronger and more impervious to displacement by emerging competitors.</p><p>The vast energy expended on accusing purveyors of information, either on mainstream or social media, of bias or of inadequate removal of harmful content should be redirected toward the development of tools that empower users to better customize the content they choose to access.</p><p>Existing social media firms want rules they can live withwhich translates into rules that future social networks cannot live with. Government cannot create new competitors, but it can prevent their emergence by imposing barriers to market entry.</p><p>At risk, too, is the right of politicalas opposed to commercialanonymity online. Government has a duty to protect dissent, not regulate it, but a casualty of regulation would appear to be future dissident platforms.</p><p>The Section 230 special immunity must remain intact for others, lest Congress turn social media's economic power into genuine coercive political power. Competing biases are preferable to pretended objectivity. Given that reality, Congress should acknowledge the inevitable presence of bias, protect competition in speech, and defend the conditions that would allow future platforms and protocols to emerge in service of the public.</p><p>The priority is not that Facebook or Google or any other platform should remain politically neutral, but that citizens remain free to choose alternatives that might emerge and grow with the same Section 230 exemptions from which the modern online giants have long benefited. Policy makers must avoid creating an environment in which Internet giants benefit from protective regulation that prevents the emergence of new competitors in the decentralized infrastructure of the marketplace of ideas.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>[A]t some level the question of what speech should be acceptable and what is harmful needs to be defined by regulation.1</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark</p><p>Zuckerberg, to reporters after meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, May 10, 2019</p><p>Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.</p><p>U.S. Constitution, Amendment I</p><p>As repeatedly noted by most defenders of free speech, expressing popular opinions never needs protection.

Government regulation of media content seemed unthinkable not so long ago, yet it has recently gained currency among politicians and pundits of both left and right. In March 2019, for example, President Trump issued an executive order directing that colleges receiving federal research or education grants promote free inquiry.2 And in May 2020 he issued another addressing alleged censorship and bias by allegedly \"monopolistic\" social media companies.3</p><p>In this political environment, policy makers, pressure groups, and even some technology sector leaders whose enterprises have benefited greatly from free expressionare pursuing the imposition of online content and speech standards, along with other policies that would seriously burden their emerging competitors.</p><p>Examples of what many wish to regulate include political neutrality, bias, harmful content, bots, advertising practices, privacy standards, election \"meddling,\" and more.4</p><p>The current social media debate boils down to competing interventionist agendas. Conservatives want social media titans regulated to remain neutral, while liberals tend to want them to eradicate harmful content and address other alleged societal ills.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google and Facebook now hold that Internet service should be regulated as a public utility.</p><p>Either blocking or compelling speech in reaction to governmental pressure would not only violate the Constitution's First Amendmentit would require immense expansion of constitutionally dubious administrative agencies.5 These agencies would either enforce government-affirmed social media and service provider deplatformingthe denial to certain speakers of the means to communicate their ideas to the publicor coerce platforms into carrying any message by actively policing that practice. When it comes to protecting free speech, the brouhaha over social media power and bias boils down to one thing: The Internet needs protection from both the bans on speech sought by the left and the forced conservative ride-along speech sought by the right. So do future communications platforms.</p><p>As all-encompassing as today's social media platforms seem, they are only a snapshot in time, prominent parts of a virtually boundless and ever-changing Internet and media landscape. The Internet represents a transformative leap in communications not because of top-down rules and codes governing acceptable expression, but because it has radically expanded broadcast freedom to mankind. More is published in a day than could formerly be produced in months or even years.6</p><p>How Public Policy Has Protected Online Free Speech In the early days of the commercial Internet, different moderating policies of firms like Prodigy and Compuserve raised serious concerns over who could be held liable for defamation, libel, and other harms: Would the responsible party be the host or the person who wrote or uploaded the content?7 This was a question ultimately resolved by Congress rather than the courts.</p><p>Much of the Internet's spectacular growth can be attributed to the immunity from liability for user- generated content afforded to social media platformsand other Internet- enabled services such as discussion boards, review and auction sites, and commentary sectionsby Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.8 Host takedown or retention of undesirable or controversial content by \"interactive computer services,\" in the Act's words, can be contentious, biased, or mistaken. But Section 230 does not require neutrality in the treatment of user-generated content in exchange for immunity. In fact, it explicitly protects non-neutrality, albeit exercised in \"good faith.\" The law reads that providers will not be held liable for:</p><p>[A]ny action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.9</p><p>In other words, you can say it, but no one is obligated to help you do so. Jeff Kosseff, Assistant Professor of Cybersecurity Law at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of The Twenty- Six Words that Created the Internet, maintains that without Section 230 \"the two most likely options for a risk-averse platform would be either to refrain from proactive moderation entirely, and only take down content upon receiving a complaint, or not to allow any user-generated content.\"10 Similarly, Internet Association President Michael Beckerman argues, \"Eliminating the ability of platforms to moderate content would mean a world full of 4chans and highly curated outletsbut nothing in between.\"11 (The online message board 4chan has become infamous for its bare-bones moderation and toleration of bigoted content.) None are required to act in a fair or neutral manner, and government cannot require them to do so.12</p><p>Section 230's \"broad liability shield for online content distributors\" in the words of Mercatus Center scholars Brent Skorup and Jennifer Huddlestonrepresented an acceleration of a decades-long trend in courts narrowing liability for publishers, republishers, and distributors more generally,13 as well as a concept of \"conduit immunity\" imparted to intermediaries.14 It is the case that changes have been made to Section 230, such as with respect to sex trafficking.15 But deeper, riskier change is in the air today, advocated for by both Republicans and Democrats.16 It is possible that some content removals may happen in bad faith, or that companies violate their own terms of service, but addressing those on a case-by-case basis would be a more fruitful approach. Section 230 notwithstanding, laws addressing misrepresentation or deceptive business practices already expose companies to legal discipline. Still, some officials have called for using laws barring deceptive business practices to charge social media platforms with making false statements about viewpoint neutrality.17</p><p>Regime-changing regulation of dominant tech firmswhether via imposing online sales taxes,18 privacy mandates,19 or speech codesis likely not to discipline them, but to make them stronger and more impervious to displacement by emerging competitors.20 Given the proliferation of media competition across platforms and online infrastructure, none can be considered essential, much less monopolistic, as some critics claim.</p><p>However, regulation can backfire and turn them into such. For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged, in testimony to Congress in 2018, that privacy regulation would benefit Facebook.21 That sentiment was reiterated by Facebook policy head Richard Allan, who favors a \"regulatory framework\" to address disinformation and fake news.22</p><p>From a given corporation's perspective, such concessions are strategically more favorable alternatives to the threatened corporate breakups, large fines, or even personal liability for management.23 While LinkedIn and Reddit leaders have cautioned against social media regulation,24 several leading tech corporate chiefsincluding Apple's Tim Cook, Twitter's Jack Dorsey, Snap, Inc.'s Evan Spiegel, Y Combinator's Sam Altman, and former Instagram CEO Kevin Systromhave expressed support for regulating elements of big tech, in social media and elsewhere.25 None has been as prominent and unambiguous in support for top-down regulation as Facebook's Zuckerberg, who in a March Washington Post op-ed called for governments to bar certain kinds of \"harmful\" speech and require detailed official reporting obligations for tech firms. This proposal is in direct conflict with the protections of Section 230.26</p><p>Conservatives fixated on social media bias are reluctant to appreciate the immeasurable benefit they receive from Section 230.27 It has never acted as a subsidy to anyone, applying equally to allpublishers, like newspapers, have websites, too. Even if biases by some platforms were a valid concern, there is no precedent for the reach conservatives enjoy now.28 Those who complain of bias or censorship on YouTubesuch as Prager University, for examplepay nothing for the hosting that can reach millions and stand to benefit from similar freedom. Just this year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that, \"[D]espite YouTube's ubiquity and its role as a public-facing platform, it remains a private forum, not a public forum subject to judicial scrutiny under the First Amendment.\"29 This disintermediationthe rapid erosion of the influence of major media gatekeepershas enabled the growth of a more diverse of the media landscape, thanks in large part to the collapse of barriers to entry, including cost.</p><p>Most ominously, conservatives fail to appreciate the dangers of common cause with advocates of content or operational regulation on the left.</p><p>Given the ideologically liberal near-monoculture at publicly funded universities, major newspapers, and networks, the vast preexisting administrative apparatus in the federal governmentand in management and corporate culture for most of Silicon Valley, for that matterit is the left that has more to lose from not regulating the Internet as the sole cultural medium not largely dominated by liberal perspectives.</p><p>Nothing is more fully open to independent or dissenting voices than then Internet; regulation would change that. For that reason alone, tomorrow's conservatives need to rely upon Section 230 immunities more than ever to preserve their voices. Any expansion of federal agency oversight of Internet content standards stand ultimately to be repurposed to the aims of the left in the long run.</p><p>Yet, the threat of online speech regulation now comes in bipartisan clothing. The Deceptive Experiences to Online Users Reduction (DETOUR) Act (S. 1084), cosponsored by Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA) and Deb Fischer (R-NE), seeks to address \"dark patterns\" and the alleged tricking of users into handing over data.30 Warner seeks still broader regulation of tech firms including changes to Section 230,31 but probably will not agree with conservatives on what constitutes disinformation or valid exercise of the civil right of anonymous communication.32</p><p>At bottom, neither left nor right now defends the right to platform bias. Both sides must hit pause, in order to protect the right to express controversial viewpoints enshrined in the First Amendment and affirm the property rights of \"interactive computer services\" of today and tomorrow. The opponents, superficially in conflict, agree in principle that government should have the final say. In the wake of any bipartisan tech regulation \"victory,\" entrenched unelected bureaucrats at Washington regulatory agencies will have free rein to define \"objectivity\" as they see fithighly likely to the detriment of conservatives and classical liberals.</p><p>Countering the Tech Regulatory Campaign of the Right</p><p>Unlike the left and its emphasis on culling \"harmful content,\" conservatives seek forced carriage in service of political neutrality; they want content included, not removed. Many on the right insist bias prevails and that monopolistic social media routinely censor search results and user-generated content. To supposedly remedy that situation, they would alter Section 230's immunities and require objectivity and even official certifications of non-biasto be determined by tomorrow's bureau- crats. On Twitter, President Donald Trump thundered at \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies. We will not let them get away with it much longer.\"33 He has also expressed a desire to sue social media firms.34</p><p>Then in July 2019, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) wrote to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) seeking investigation into how major tech companies curate content, while echoing progressive calls for regulationaccusing social media of being \"powerful enough toat the very leastsway elections.\" \"They control the ads we see, the news we read, and the information we digest,\" they complain. \"And they actively censor some content and amplify other content based on algorithms and intentional decisions that are completely nontransparent.\"35 Meanwhile, many on the left hold the same elitist opinion of people's faculties. Sen. Hawley has now introduced several pieces of nanny- state legislation that should be of concern in today's environment.36</p><p>Lost in all this are the simple facts that social media cannot censor and a that non-depletable Internet cannot be monopolized unless government circumscribes it. Control, amplification, or content removal by private actors are not coercion or censorship, but elemental to free speech. Manipulating an algorithm is likewise an exercise of free speech, even if the July 2019 White House Social Media Summit maintained otherwise.37 Censorship requires government force to either block or compel speech, and there can be no private media monopoly so long as there is no government censorship.38 One has a right to speak, but no one exercising that right has a right to force others to supply them with a Web platform, newspaper, venue, or microphone.39</p><p>The Constitution places limits on state actors, yet Hawley asserts social media must \"abide by principles of free speech and First Amendment.\"40 These vital principles apply to government, not to the population generally or to communications enabled by private companies.</p><p>Hawley's own legislation, the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act (S. 1914), would limit Section 230 immunities, deny property rights, compel transmission of speech, and create a large administrative bureaucracy by requiring that a \"covered company\" obtain an \"immunity certification\" from the Federal Trade Commission, assuring a majority of the unelected commissioners every two years that it does not moderate content provided by others in a politically biased way.41 In similar spirit, the Stop the Censorship Act (H.R. 4027), sponsored by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), would limit moderation of \"objectionable\" content.42 These legislative proposals are highly problematic. One cannot prove a negative. The premise is inoperable, susceptible to partisanship, and hostile to free speech.</p><p>Discrimination and bias are the essence of healthy debate, and mandating neutrality by altering Section 230or via any other meanswould remove the right of conservatives to \"discriminate\" on potentially dominant alternative platforms that could emerge in coming years or decades (just as Google and Facebook emerged to displace prior leaders).</p><p>But that is not all. Sen. Hawley also has set his sights on many tech companies' business model. Hawley has complained: \"These companies and others exploit this harvested data to build massive profiles on users and then rake in hundreds of billions of dollars monetizing that data.\"43 Indeed, big tech firms use data in extraordinarily sophisticated ways, but so do popular conservative media sites. The Drudge Report looks like 1990s vintage, but it sports a sophisticated architecture underneath the hood.44 Perhaps \"information wants to be free,\" but it also wants to be monetized.45 Another Hawley- sponsored bill, the Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology (SMART) Act (S. 2314), would mean future conservative platforms could not monetize and survive as easily.46 Specifically, it would require online content providers to tread carefully over how they write headlines. The bill stipulates:</p><p>Not less frequently than once every 3 years, the [Federal Trade] Commission shall submit to Congress a report on the issue of internet addiction and the processes through which social media companies and other internet companies, by exploiting human psychology and brain physiology, interfere with free choices of individuals on the internet (including with respect to the amount of time individuals spend online).47</p><p>The current antitrust debate is inextricably bound with the online speech controversy. Yet, concepts like \"common carrier\" and \"essential facility,\" which have been used to rationalize regulation, are not applicable either to a virtually limitless Internet or to its future capabilities.48 Like the expanding universe, the healthy Internet, with all its potential, remains unbounded and not monopolizable.</p><p>Legislation would change that.</p><p>In today's environment, big tech firms should defend the principle of and right to bias both for themselves and for others, even as they articulate that they strive toward some measure of objectivity, which can be a selling feature.</p><p>Competing Biases Are Preferable to Pretended Objectivity</p><p>Social media firms deny they are biased. Google Vice President Karan Bhatia, for example, denies bias in content display or search results.49 He testified as such in July 2019 to the Senate Judiciary Committee, pointing to external validating studies.50 Bhatia reasonably asserts: \"Our users over- whelmingly trust us to deliver the most helpful and reliable information out there. Distorting results for political purposes would be antithetical to our mission and contrary to our business interests.\"51 To an unappreciated degree, people's own online behavior, not externally imposed bias, will influence algorithm functionality and what they see.52</p><p>Twitter has likewise proclaimed itself an \"open communications platform.\" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey similarly claimed, in testimony to Congress in 2018, that it does not base decisions on political ideology.53 In April 2019 testimony, Twitter Public Policy and Philanthropy Director Carlos Monje told the Senate Judiciary Committee: \"We welcome perspectives and insights from diverse sources and embrace being a platform where the open and free exchange of ideas can occur.\"54</p><p>Google's 2018 report \"The Good Censor,\" described in the Senate Judiciary hearing as an internal assessment and marketing exercise, defended \"balance,\" and \"well ordered spaces for safety and civility.\" These are worthy goals, but, as we have seen, \"censoring\" can only be a term of art as Google used it in the report (and for which it drew avoidable criticism).55 In any event, many policy makers will never be convinced of non-bias. A negative cannot be proven, nor can total neutrality be achieved given the inevitability of bias in human communication.56 Unknown, undiscovered, or unrealized emergence of bias will likely increase as human knowledge increases. Algorithms understandably boost content that generates likes, shares, and other interactions.57 They also undertake the error-prone and thankless task of looking for and rooting out \"toxicity.\"58</p><p>The upshot is that Google results can never be objective in a way that can satisfy everybody, and there is nothing wrong with that. Policies will always be in flux and there can be vagueness and lack of transparency ripe for misunderstanding.59 The sole remedy, \"All search results must appear first,\" is an absurdity.60 In a fluid environment, it is not reasonable to say bias is not reflected in decisions made or in algorithmic results, but revealed or overt bias can be more honest than an insincere, pretended objectivity.</p><p>Besides, search has evolved into swiping and talking as means of interface, which do not always involve Google and typing text.61</p><p>In the July Senate hearing, the promise extracted from Google to grant access to its records on advertisements and videos pulled sets a terrible precedent. While moves like Facebook's response of appointing Sen. Jon Kyl to lead a bias audit62 may yield some helpful transparency proposals, they will resolve nothing as far as competing complaints of bias are concerned.63 But if conservatives, liberals, or some alliance of them triumph in the quest for content regulation, that would impose control and censorship on everyone.64 That is why competing biases and algorithms are paramount as a matter of principle, whether or not bias exists in select circumstances.</p><p>The Danger of Progressive Regulation of \"Harmful Content\"</p><p>\"I think a lot of regimes around the world would welcome the call to shut down political opposition on the grounds that it's harmful speech,\"</p><p>Federal Communications</p><p>Commissioner Brendan Carr65</p><p>Some politicians, dominant social media firms, and activists propose to expunge what they see as objectionable content online. They point to hate speech, disinformation, misinformation, and objectionable, harmful, or dehumanizing content.66 Since \"misinformation\" can translate into \"things we disagree with,\" this inventory can be expected to grow.</p><p>Disagreeable or hateful speech is nonetheless constitutionally protected.67</p><p>The leading edge of social media regulation consists of a March 2019 proposal from Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and a white paper from Sen. Mark Warner entitled, \"Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms.\" 68</p><p>Zuckerberg asserts, \"I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators.\" He endorses alliances with governments around the world to police harmful online speech, a move that would erect impenetrable global barriers to future social media alternatives to Facebook. In his March 2018 Washington Post op-ed, \"The Internet Needs New Rules,\" Zuckerberg said:</p><p>Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree. I've come to believe that we shouldn't make so many important decisions about speech on our own. So we're creating an independent body so people can appeal our decisions. We're also working with governments, including French officials, on ensuring the effectiveness of content review systems. ...</p><p>One idea is for third-party bodies to set standards governing the distribution of harmful content and measure companies against those standards. Regulation could set baselines for what's prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum.69</p><p>To date only Facebook has publicly called for this degree of engagement from governments, but Facebook's influence alone could be enough to give it momentum. In any event, such government enforcement of \"community standards\" gives politicians and bureaucrats veto power over critical political speech. While Google, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and their brethren cannot \"censor\" as private media and social media plat- forms, in the Zuckerberg formulation, deplatforming will be preordained, baked into the ecosystem and constraining emergent networks to the regulatory vision of \"baselines for what's prohibited.\"70 Once this path is chosen, would a reasonable person expect for the forbidden content list to shrink or expand over time? And while in the U.S. such requirements may be ultimately struck down on First Amendment grounds, it could take years of litigationand much damage to free speech in the meantimeto reach that result.</p><p>Zuckerberg's proposals also would inflict painful compliance burdens that would severely hobble Facebook's smaller competitors:</p><p>Facebook already publishes transparency reports on how effectively we're removing harmful content. I believe every major internet service should do this quarterly, because it's just as important as financial reporting. Once we understand the prevalence of harmful content, we can see which companies are improving and where we should set the baselines.71</p><p>Facebook's efforts to secure global input on content review decisions can be admirable so long as the company is describing policies it intends to adopt for itself.72 But the more ambitious campaign to transcend self- policing is troubling. Having benefited from Section 230 immunities in the U.S. that boosted it to global stature (other firms enjoyed this immunity, too), Facebook now is urging speech standards and reporting burdens imposed on the online companies of the future. Such a government partnership scheme would go a long way toward making the dominance of today's largest social media firms permanent.</p><p>It matters not if Facebook were to partner with \"thoughtful governments that have a robust democratic process.\"73 Free speech in the U.S. is not subject to limitation by majority vote. Speech is routinely criminalized throughout the world, however, by these same \"robust\" democracies.74 The Brennan Center for Justice has noted how political pressure from governments has influenced what information the public seesand surely will do so again. There is no way to know the nature of the internal decision process and no judicial review of it.75 Removing content at the behest of political leaders, subject to jail or fine, is a scenario playing out worldwide,76 while real voices against tyranny get silenced.77 George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley deemed France one of the greatest global threats to free speech.78 Yet, rather than defend free expression on principle, Facebook has pledged a partnership with French courts against online hate speech and to hand over information about its users.79 A similar circumstance that garnered some criticism has been Google's alleged cooperation with Chinese authorities on a censored search engine.80</p><p>Social media firms' yielding to authoritarian governments will have grave repercussions for expression. While Americans' free speech rights are protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution, social media giants that cooperate with foreign governments' censorship efforts threaten free expression even in the U.S. In essence, it enables censorious governments to export their Internet laws globally.81 Ominously, all this gives politicians more weapons to help them work around the First Amendment.</p><p>Similarly, the administrative apparatus that some Republicans favor expanding to monitor political objectivity circumvents constitutional speech protections. Private entities are incapable of censorship, but reconfiguring them as semi- governmental oversight bodies with ability to suppress would change that. Such a move would revoke big tech companies' status as market entities and convert them into the \"essential\" facilities they otherwise could never be. The pertinent risk, then, may not be ill-considered reform of Section 230 immunities. Rather, regulation or laws that \"set baselines\" could perform an end run around Section 230, leading to a reformulation of indemnification perhaps more powerful for Facebook's new incarnation, but that effectively moots much of Section 230 for other social platforms.</p><p>Securing compromises and adoption of industry standards certified by governmental bodies would prevent alternative platformsexisting or emergingfrom being able to facilitate the unfettered free expression that powered Facebook's growth. This would help Facebook avoid breakup and fines and help it maintain its dominant position, lest it become the next MySpace. The result would be a new business model for the biggest of big tech, one based on central oversight of speech in an environment in which Section 230 would be less critical to their success. As Vox's Peter Kafka observed:</p><p>[M]aybe the giant platforms are now so enormous that they don't need to distribute an infinite amount of content anymore maybe they could survive by bringing in enormous but man- ageable amounts of content, which they could ac- tually review before publishingkind of like a media company. This used to be an unthinkable thought, and still seems to be if you talk to the people who run the platforms.</p><p>But maybe that's where we are headed, like it or not.82</p><p>In July 2018, nearly a year before Zuckerberg's declaration, the Columbia Journalism Review reported on a leaked draft white paper from Sen. Mark Warner containing a wide- ranging slate of proposals to regulate content, speech, and anonymity under the justification of combating trolls, misinformation, and election interference.83 The paper, titled \"Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms,\" expressed alarm that \"bots, trolls, click-farms, fake pages and groups, ads and algorithm- gaming can be used to propagate political disinformation.\"84 Its proposed solutions included labeling of automated \"bot\" accounts; limiting certain elements of anonymity; placing limitations on Section 230 immunity for re-uploaded content; liability for defamation, false light, and deep fakes; and defining certain services to be essential facilities.85</p><p>Warner's proposals, which, as Axios' David McCabe notes, had been \"circu- lated in tech policy circles,\"86 did not recommend corporate breakup.87 Sen. Warner later reacted favorably to Zuckerberg's new-rules-for-the- Internet manifesto, declaring:</p><p>I'm glad to see that Mr. Zuckerberg is finally acknowledging what I've been saying for past two years: The era of the social media Wild West is over. ... Facebook needs to work with Congress to pass effective legislative guardrails, recognizing that the largest platforms, like Facebook, are going to need to be subject to a higher level of regulation in keeping with their enormous power.88</p><p>Social media companies have guardrails now, and competition for authentication and anonymity and other competitive disciplines can add more of them. It is legislation and regulation, not their absence, that threaten to remove them and undermine one of America's bedrock principles.</p><p>Whether search results or the presentation of content by big tech are biased or not, suspicion prevails because left-of-center perspectives prevails at major mainstream institutions like print and broadcast media editorial management, college campuses, and even big tech workforces. For example, The Washington Post has not endorsed a Republican since it began endorsing presidential candidates in 1976 (sitting out 1988).89 The New York Times has not endorsed one since Dwight D. Eisenhower.90 So, biases? Yes, but bias becomes a public policy issue only when government joins efforts to regulate content and speech.</p><p>The Vulnerability of Dissent to the \"Harmful Content\" Sledgehammer</p><p>Freedom of expression is paramount. There is no political right not to be offended. Congress needs to preserve the right to express both popular and unpopular opinions.91 That requires continuing to allow curation that protects alternative viewpoints with the same immunities Facebook and other social media have enjoyed to date. That means no compulsory participation in Facebook's \"baselines for what's prohibited,\" Warner's \"the Wild West is over\" claim, Hawley's government affirmations of objectivity, or whatever other speech control schemes emerge in the future.</p><p>This section will mention some controversial issues not to take positions but to illustrate why people must retain rights of expression protected from government administrators. Positions that were unremarkable among liberals a generation ago can now lead to career loss, even for CEOs.92 These include the opposition to illegal immigration of former President Barack Obama and Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY),93 the opposition to birthright citizenship of former Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV),94 or Obama's former opposition to gay marriage.95</p><p>Political correctness can have grave implications when moving from voluntary settings to a legally enforced regime. Such a regime could come about in unexpected ways. For instance, the Change the Terms Coalitiona grouping of mostly progressive organizations that includes the Center for American Progress, Southern Poverty Law Center, and othersdeclares:</p><p>While some companies are taking steps in the right direction to reduce hateful activities online, anti-hate provisions in most companies' terms of service are not enough. To ensure that companies are doing their part to help combat hateful conduct on their platforms, organizations in this campaign will track the progress of major tech companiesespecially social media platformsto adopt and implement these model corporate policies.96</p><p>To be fair, the petition itself expresses concern over government involvement in speech that historically \"disproportionately silenced activists and minorities\" and acknowledges that hate crimes are already illegal.97 However, the coalition holds that, while the First Amendment protects even hate speech,</p><p>[O]utside the United States, speech laws vary wildly from one country to another. It is preferable to develop a set of policies that major tech companies can apply globally so that hateful actors cannot launder their activity by routing their traffic through a different jurisdiction.98</p><p>The concern here is that the laundering will wash out in the opposite direction, cleansing even non-hate speech. Like Facebook's own \"baseline\" principles and other promises regarding harmful content, which Change the Terms argues do not go far enough,99 the policies can be admirable, but they can also be myopic and beholden to one viewpoint.100 \"Hateful activities\" defined by liberals are far from the only objectionable phenomena online.101</p><p>This is why Congress has to be uncompromising in protecting clashing viewpoints from \"cancel culture.\" Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) stressed in a 2018 exchange with Zuckerberg that \"[a]dults need to engage in vigorous debates\"102 over controversial issues like late-term abortion without being flagged as haters. Yet even in April 2019, Twitter and Facebook officials could not assure senators that certain remarks by Mother Teresa on abortion did not constitute hate speech.103 The freedom to engage such matters does not have to be supported by corporations such as Facebook or Twitter, of course, but somewhere. In the 2018 hearing, Zuckerberg himself struggled to define hate speech clearly.104 In 2019, Facebook's own new Civil Rights Audit took up the task. Among other declarations, hate speech is defined there:</p><p>... as a direct attack on people based on \"protected characteris- tics\"race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability. Facebook also provides some, but not all,</p><p>of the same protections for immigration status. An \"attack\" for hate speech purposes is defined as violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt or disgust, or calls for exclusion or segregation.105</p><p>Again, such anti-harmful-speech principles may be unimpeachable as internal corporate policy, but that changes when a firm like Facebook cooperates with governments, including in turning over user information. The \"speech laws\" that the Change the Terms Coalition notes \"vary wildly from one country to another\" include those of China, Russia, and myriad other illiberal regimes.</p><p>A report commissioned by Google and conducted by a team led by former Arizona Republican Sen. John Kyl, intended to address conservative criticisms of bias by the company, appeared to highlight concerns with how motives would be ascribed to some and not others by Facebook's hate speech policy.</p><p>[I]nterviewees' concerns stemmed both from the notion of having a \"hate speech\" policy in the first place and from unfair labeling of certain speech as \"hate speech.\" ... The term \"hate speech\" is itself controversial, insofar as it may incorrectly ascribe motive in many cases.106</p><p>The arbiters ascribing hate to others are themselves agenda-driven and can have credibility problems of their own.107 For example, the Kyl report noted that, \"Many conservatives view the SPLC [Southern Poverty Law Center, a member of the Change the Terms Coalition] as an extreme organization intent on defaming conservatives.\"108 Should today's expanding inventory of \"protected characteristics\" policies become incorporated into compulsory \"baselines for what's prohibited and ... systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum,\" much can deemed off-limits that deserves debate.</p><p>Conservatives have their view of what counts as extremism and liberals have theirs. Therefore, especially in so tense an environment, there need to be fora to talk about the most polarizing of issues. David Thunder, a professor at the Institute for Culture and Society at the University of Navarra in Pamplona, Spain, wrote of the need for leeway in discussion:</p><p>[M]any forms of offensive speech are not black and white. For instance, speech that contests dominant narratives about political and social authority, law, marriage, gender, religion or national identity may be deeply unpopular and offensive to many, yet offer intelligent critiques of conventional wisdom and not constitute any genuine incitement to hatred or violence.109</p><p>For instance, calls for slavery reparationsredistributing assets from one group to another based on raceare unlikely to draw ire from establishment press outlets, while opposing them could well be deemed \"harmful.\"110 Again the intent here is not to defend or excoriate particular speech, harmful or otherwise. Rather, it is to demonstrate that the tenor of today's \"harmful content\" campaigns tend toward affirmation of progressive ideologies.111 Those assuming they are not in the left's crosshairs as spewing \"harmful content\" might note that some progressive commentators have even denounced classical liberalism as an authoritarian and racist doctrine.112 The above reservations are meant to illustrate why administrative agencies should not be allowed anywhere near the Internet's volume knob, much less its off button.</p><p>A Thought Experiment: Socialist Advocacy as \"Harmful\" Speech The media often refer to \"incitement\" as a phenomenon largely of the political right. Yet, the violence committed by actual socialist regimes to coerce human beings into participating in utopian schemes has been plain sight for decades, but concern about socialist advocacy is absent in the appeals from Warner, Zuckerberg, or Change the Terms. 113</p><p>To illustrate, consider the following thought experiment. As the noted Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises noted, in his classic 1944 work, Bureaucracy:</p><p>The champions of socialism call themselves progressives, but they recommend a system which is characterized by rigid observance of routine and by a resistance to every kind of improvement.</p><p>They call themselves liberals, but they are intent upon abolishing liberty. They call themselves democrats, but they yearn for dictatorship. They call themselves revolutionaries, but they want to make the government omnipotent. They promise the blessings of the Garden of Eden, but they plan to transform the world into a gigantic post office. Every man but one a subordinate clerk in a bureau.114</p><p>Given socialism's grim historical record, it would not be too far-fetched for a content regulation authority to flag socialist advocacy as \"misinformation\" or \"harmful.\"</p><p>For example, take the Green New Deal. If fully implemented, it would cause untold hardship for millions and bring much of the economy under Washington's control.115 A chief architect of the proposal, Saikat Chakrabarti, chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), acknowldedged that the Green New Deal \"wasn't originally a climate thing at all.\" Rather, he added, \"we really think of it as a how-do-you-change- the-entire-economy thing.\"116 The costs for such a transformation would be enormous. Yet, no one is calling to shut down debate on the Green New Deal.</p><p>Imagine if Zuckerberg were specifically referencing socialism when he proclaimed at Facebook's 2019 F8 Developer Conference:</p><p>We're taking a more proactive role in making sure that all of our partners and developers use our services for good. We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery services aren't highlighting groups or people who are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content and we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.\" [Emphasis added]117</p><p>Obviously, we do not advocate removal of harmful socialist content. We merely observe the glaring contradiction that socialism, even with its dismal track record, is not targeted for removal in any content moderation formulation.</p><p>The Right's Misguided Call to Compel \"Unbiased\" Speech Both the left's banned speech and the right's compelled speech agendas would require a substantial government apparatus to oversee them. The right's concern is the left's dominance of discourse, but as the preceding section makes clear, treating Facebook, Google, Twitter and the like as monopolies or common carriers in need of FTC regulation and reporting duties would make the problem worse. Efforts to certify \"objectivity\" will neither protect the public nor safeguard conservative speech. Instead, it will deliver the Internet into the administrative state's clutches. If today's upset conservatives prevail in their quest for social media regulation, they will have helped erect a permanent machinery to police online speech that they are in no foreseeable circumstance likely to control (not that anyone should).</p><p>Arbitrary thresholds at which regulation kicks into effect and becomes binding are also troubling. A company eligible for Hawley's FTC objectivity certification is one with more than 30 million active monthly users in the U.S. or 300 million worldwide, or with more than $500 million in global annual revenue. Other elements of Hawley's legislative agenda, such as the SMART Act's burdensome reporting requirements, would also balloon the federal bureaucracy.</p><p>The damage is compounded by the bipartisan Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight and Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act (S.1951), sponsored by Sens. Warner and Hawley. It would require a \"commercial data operator\"defined as an entity that \"(A) generates a material amount of revenue from the use, collection, processing, sale, or sharing of the user data; and (B) has more than 100,000,000 unique monthly visitors or users in the United States for a majority of months during the previous 1-year period\"to:</p><p>At least every 90 days, \"provide each user of the commercial data operator with an assessment of the economic value that the commercial data operator places on the data of that user;\"</p><p>Describe the types of data collected and any tangential uses of it; and</p><p>Observe newly imposed limits on data retention and the ability to delete it.118</p><p>These invasive requirements represent a major potential incursion into online speech. The Competitive Enterprise Institute's Patrick Hedger observes that the bill is \"vague, arbitrary, picks winners and losers, delegates too much power to agencies, and inserts government into an area where markets are working just fine.119</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission would enforce that, while the Securities and Exchange Commission would oversee annual or quarterly filings (parallel to financial filings) related to the value of aggregate data, as well as develop the accounting schemes to facilitate said filing. With so much \"administering\" being sought by Republicans, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will seek a piece of the action, once the tenure of deregulatory- minded chairman Ajit Pai ends. And sure enough, a proposed Trump social media executive order obtained by CNN affirmed that FCC would have a role.120 At that point, the Department of Justice would become involved in social media regulation. Perhaps more agencies will, too, as many of them have civil rights offices.</p><p>Despite superficial differences, the common denominator of the ostensibly opposing demands from left and right on social media is their calls to concentrate more power in federal administrative agencies. Each bit of technology regulation that conservatives support expands the arbitrary administrative state they claim to oppose. They may wish to abolish the Consumer Financial protection Bureau, but they will open a Consumer Data Protection Bureau, perhaps in the same luxurious offices. Over time, the window of what counts as \"political unbiased content moderation by covered companies\" good enough for an \"immunity certification from the Federal Trade Commission\" will lead to real suppression of conservative ideas. No coordination, collusion, or conspiracy is needed for this result to emerge. As the Hoover Institution's John Cochrane notes:</p><p>When vast majorities of the bureaucracy belong to one political party, when government employee unions funnel unwitting contributions to candidates of that party, and when strong ideological currents link decisions across agencies, explicit cooperation is less necessary.121</p><p>Whether a Zuckerberg, Warner, or Hawley lights the fuse, an administrative apparatus to oversee speech will increase the size of government and thereby undermine individual liberty, free speech, private property rights, and other institutions of liberty.</p><p>Property Rights and Non- Depletable Cyberspace: \"Media,\" Including Social Media, Is Plural In February 2007, The Guardian ran the headline, \"Will MySpace Ever Lose Its Monopoly?\"122 Years later, younger folks have abandoned Facebook, while growth continues among older users.123 Big tech cannot stop anyone from reaching anyone else and sharing ideas.</p><p>Facebook as an entity is a singular social medium. Twitter is also a social medium. Displaced transitory giants like MySpace and America Online were singular. Social media, though, is a plural concept. Social media trends fluctuate; communications media options are potentially boundless. In the frenzy of the content moderation debate, we often forget that Facebook and Google are the gauzy film atop the deeper actual Internet. One can be a \"never Googler\"as the rapid growth of the privacy-protecting search engine DuckDuckGo124 indicatesand presumably a \"never YouTuber.\"125 We are likely to witness the emergence of larger, decentralized online companies not envisioned today.126</p><p>Still further, media need not be \"social\" to be mass; alternative non-social media on the right, like the Drudge Report, Daily Caller, Breitbart, and other right-leaning reporting and talk radio remain formidable as sources of information. Semi-social conduits such as comment sections in news articles may exceed some social media platforms in reach.127</p><p>With respect to its very limited role in Internet governance, the core public policy duty for Congress is to foster the creation and expansion of private property rights and communications wealth on existing and future platforms and in the coding that enables them.128 Conservatives who turn their backs on private property rights in social media disputes over bias will render themselves defenseless against leftist resistance to property rights in more complicated policy settings.</p><p>Conservatives committed the same error by endorsing net neutrality legislation to ban \"blocking\" and \"throttling.\"129 Such yielding on core principles on relatively \"easy\" matters makes the expansion of the institutions of liberty far more difficult.</p><p>Government Regulation Can Absolve Social Media Companies of Responsibility and Preempt Consumer Self-Help</p><p>Consumers possess the power, wherewithal, and user tools to protect themselves from harmful content as well as to create it. Users customize and filter what they see, deliberately or by habit, and can use tools like Google's SafeSearch or Twitter's Quality Filter. They are the innovators on gaming platforms. The ultimate user tool is the ability to not listen or participate.</p><p>Regulation, by contrast, can worsen outcomes by passing the buck of seemingly intractable content moderation problems, while entrenching the dominant positions of big tech's current major players.130 That is, some leading social media would love to be relieved of the grief it gets from both left and right. As Mark Jamison of the American Enterprise Institute notes:</p><p>Facebook headaches would become somebody else's problem. By effectively handing the policing of \"harmful content\" over to an independent oversight group and governments, the plan would rid Facebook of responsibility for user-provided content.131</p><p>Regulation will preempt private efforts to develop sophisiticated user tools and databases. Mistakes will be made, but much will be learned from them.132 Policy makers should remain at arms' length. One-size-fits-all \"solutions\" for the supposed problems bedeviling big tech will prevent the evolution and competition that need to happen among platforms. Options for degrees of openness, insularity, authentication, and third-party moderation can emerge and benefit the public. The potentialities are boundless, and too little recognized in today's debate.</p><p>Again, the emphasis here is media, not medium. The social media giants are not the Internet, but a proprietary sliver of it that happens to have been gathered into a pile in the early 21st century. Neither censorship, handholding, nor administratively determined \"objectivity\" are sound policy as consumers decide whether to continue to embrace traditional social media, warts and all, or to move instead toward as-yet-unknown options and resolutions on a limitless medium. It makes the most sense for policy makers and the public to assume biases of one sort or another, for those to be dealt with accordingly by critically thinking adults on both the service and user sides, and to revel in the new forms of wealth and customer welfare afforded by them.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In the social media debate, the problem is not that big tech's power is unchecked. Rather, the problem is that social media regulation by either the left or right would make it that way.</p><p>Zuckerberg's speech controls and Hawley's ostensibly opposite compelled speech both lead to bigger government lording over Internet platforms, complete with onerous filings to agencies and other burdens. Like banks, social media giants are not too big to fail, but regulation would make them that way.</p><p>American values strongly favor a marketplace of ideas where debate and civil controversy can thrive. By contrast, attempts by tech companies uniting with the government to create new regulatory oversight bodies and filing requirements to exile politically disfavored opinions on the one hand, and force the inclusion of conservative content on the other, should both be rejected.</p><p>The vast energy expended on accusing purveyors of information, either on mainstream or social media, of bias or of inadequate removal of harmful content should be redirected toward protecting the right for future platforms to be biased in any direction, and toward fostering the development of tools that can empower users to better customize the content they choose to access.</p><p>Existing social media firms want rules they can live withwhich translates into rules that future social networks cannot live with. Government cannot create new competitors, but it can prevent their emergence by imposing barriers to market entry.</p><p>At risk, too, is the right of political as opposed to commercialanonymity online.133 Government has a duty to protect dissent, not regulate it, but a casualty of regulation would appear to be future conservative-leaning platforms.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg remarked about content decisions, \"[I]f we were starting from scratch, we wouldn't ask companies to make these judgments alone.\"134 That is exactly what both tech firms and policy makers should do. Operating as a free platform for expression is what made Facebook the giant it is today. Facebook is a large presence in commercial and political speech in a major medium where it remains free.</p><p>The Section 230 special immunity must remain intact for others, lest Congress turn social media's mere economic power into genuine coercive political power. Were Congress to impose social media content, tomorrow's threat to expression will be government's biases and policy \"algorithms.\"</p><p>Competing biases are preferable to pretended objectivity. Congress should reject policies such as those such as those proposed by Zuckerberg, Hawley, and Warnerwho may be not such strange bedfellows after all.135 Instead, lawmakers should acknowledge the inevitable presence of bias, protect competition in speech, and defend the conditions that would allow future platforms and protocols to emerge in service of the public.</p><p>The priority is not that Facebook or Google or any other platform should remain politically neutral, but that citizens remain free to choose alternatives that might emerge and grow with the same Section 230 exemptions from which the modern online giants have long benefited.</p><p>Policy makers must avoid creating an environment in which Internet giants benefit from protective regulation, reporting requirements, and thresholds that prevent the emergence of new competitors in the decentralized infrastructure of the marketplace of ideas.</p><p>NOTES</p><p>Angela Charlton, \"New French Rules for Facebook?

INTRODUCTION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You join a dating app in hopes of meeting a new fling or love interest, or maybe in hopes of entering into a serious relationship. You swipe a lot. Then you swipe some more. You finally match with someone, and after a few months of talking and dating, you decide to be exclusive. So, you deactivate your dating profile, as it has successfully fulfilled its purpose. Unfortunately, some love stories are not destined to last forever, and your new relationship ends the following year. Right around that time, your ex begins impersonating you on the very app you met on. He creates profiles bearing your actual name with real photos--but lying about almost everything else.</p><p>Your new profile now says that you are \"interested in 'serious kink and many fantasy scenes []' [and] hardcore and unprotected group sex\" among other things. (1) In the span of six months, about 1,100 people respond to this profile. (2) You try and report it to the dating app, but the only response you receive is an \"automated, form response,\" (3) lacking a recommended remedy--and, more importantly, lacking a promise to delete all the fake profiles. So, what can you do? After the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling on March 27, 2019 in Herrick v. Grindr (4)--nothing.</p><p>This hypothetical situation reflects some of the facts from Herrick v. Grindr. (5) Last year, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision in this case that created yet another way in which interactive computer services are broadly protected by the Communications Decency Act's Section 230 (hereinafter CDA 230) (6) and leaves future defrauded individuals with almost no useful remedies. (7)</p><p>CDA 230 immunizes interactive computer services from liability by protecting them from being \"treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" (8) While legislative history, as well as the additional effects of CDA 230, will be covered in more detail in Sections III, IV, and V of this Note, a brief overview will be useful before reading the facts of Herrick v. Grindr below. (9)</p><p>CDA 230 creates protections for providers of \"interactive computer service[s]\" (10) by not treating them as the original publisher or speaker of content posted by users on their platform. (11) The Act also imposes no liability if they chose not to monitor or restrict access to content considered to be \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable,\" (12) or, alternatively, if they take any action that \"enable[s] and make[s] available to information content providers (13) or others the technical means to restrict access to\" (14) such content.</p><p>Most courts have interpreted the Act's requirement of \"impos[ing] no liability\" to mean that in claims against an interactive computer service, injunctive relief cannot be sought. (15) However, this Note will argue that there should be an exception to this immunity for cases of fraud and impersonation. This exception would allow for CDA 230 immunity to be available in these circumstances only if certain requirements are met and a reasonableness requirement is satisfied. If the plaintiff is successful in this showing, then injunctive relief can be a viable option, as one factor that injunctive relief is dependent on is the likelihood of success on the merits of the case. (16) By amending CDA 230 to add this exception, Congress will be changing the requirements of CDA 230 immunity for cases of fraud and impersonation, thus altering the availability of CDA 230 immunity for these types of cases. This Note will advance this exception by using the facts of Herrick v. Grindr (11) as a framework for a situation where the proposed exception would have readily applied and could have been a helpful remedy for the plaintiff.</p><p>Section II will provide an overview of the facts of Herrick v. Grindr. (18) Section III will introduce CDA 230 and provide background information for the context of the statute's promulgation and its effects. Section IV will discuss cases concerning fake profiles, CDA 230 immunity, and how the courts have resolved those cases. Section V will provide an overview of the viability and inconsistency of grants of injunctive relief when CDA 230 is being used to immunize an interactive computer service. Additionally, it analyzes whether fraud and impersonation are covered by CDA 230 by looking at congressional intent, legislative history, and differentiating fraud and impersonation from defamation claims. Section VI will introduce the proposed exception for cases of false impersonation when CDA 230 should not apply and thus injunctive relief can be granted.</p><p>II. FACTS OF HERRICK V. GRINDR</p><p>Around May 2011, Matthew Herrick (19) joined Grindr (20) and used the app for several years until he and a man named JC began talking and dating around June 2015. (21) In November 2015, Herrick removed his profile off Grindr, as he and JC were becoming more serious. (22) Soon after, JC began impersonating Herrick on Grindr--using a fake profile to talk with other users. (23) However, in June 2016, Herrick found out and successfully convinced JC to stop impersonating him. (24) In August 2016, Herrick began using his personal Grindr account again, and subsequently broke off his relationship with JC around October 2016 due to \"JC's abuse and control.\" (25)</p><p>Once more, JC created a fake Grindr profile impersonating Herrick and this time scheduled \"appointments for sexual encounters\" between Herrick and other strangers. (26) JC would \"manipulate the geo-physical settings\" (27) to correspond with Herrick's home and work location and talk to men on the app in order to set up \"sex dates\" between them and Herrick. (28) JC would tell people that he (acting as Herrick) wanted to have sex and told them where to find him. (29) JC would also tell men on Grindr to \"expect [Herrick's] resistance as part of an agreed upon rape fantasy or role play\" which added even more danger to Herrick's life. (30) Herrick didn't feel safe inside his own home, had men bang on his window demanding to see him, and had some men refuse to leave \"until they were physically escorted off the premises.\" (31)</p><p>Dozens of men have shown up at Herrick's work and apartment \"expecting to have sex\" with him and even refusing to leave when Herrick told them his profile is not him but merely an impersonation. (32) Once, when a stranger showed up at Herrick's apartment and was asked to leave by Herrick's roommate, the stranger refused and lunged and wrestled with the roommate. (33) On another occasion, a man showed up at Herrick's place of work expecting to have sex, and upon hearing that Herrick's profile was an impersonation, began screaming various vulgarities and obscenities at Herrick in front of \"all the staff, management, and guests....\" (34)</p><p>Between November 2016 and January 2017, Herrick reported the fake accounts to Grindr around 50 times. (35) Between January 27, 2017 through March 2017, the fake accounts were reported another 50 times by Herrick, his counsel, or visitors on the site. (36) Grindr has not directly responded to Herrick's reports and have only sent automated replies that say \"[t]hank you for your report.\" (37) Additionally, due to Grindr's silence on the matter, Herrick also filed \"approximately 14 police reports and petitioned in Family Court for an order of protection [against JC] to stop the impersonation.\" (38) In November 2016, he received an Order of Protection against JC, which JC repeatedly violated. (39) Additionally, despite Herrick's multiple reports to the authorities, JC still did not stop. (40)</p><p>Herrick v. Grindr was originally filed in New York State Supreme Court, (41) where Justice Kathryn E. Freed issued an ex parte preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against Grindr, compelling them to \"immediately disable all impersonating profiles created under [Herrick's] name or with identifying information related to [Herrick, Herrick's] photograph, address, phone number, email account or place of work, including but not limited to all impersonating accounts under the control [of JC].\" (42) This TRO expired as a matter of law on February 22, 2017, due to the case's removal to federal court. (43)</p><p>On that date, Judge Valerie E. Caproni, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, heard arguments for extending the TRO but ultimately denied the extension. (44) Judge Caproni found that Herrick had not adequately shown that '\"extreme or very serious damage' will flow from denial of [the] injunction.\" (45) Additionally, Judge Caproni's order stated that previous cases \"suggest strongly\" that Herrick's attempt to separate Grindr's actions from the protections of CDA 230 was a \"losing proposition,\" and thus Herrick's likelihood of success on the merits was low. (46)</p><p>Specifically, the type of injunctive relief sought was a TRO to impose an affirmative duty on Grindr to monitor and delete the fake profiles bearing Herrick's name. (47) In the Second Circuit, the standard for granting a TRO resembles that of granting a preliminary injunction. (48) Those standards require that the party seeking a TRO \"demonstrate '(1) irreparable harm in the absence of the [TRO] and (2) either (a) a likelihood of success on the merits or (b) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair grounds for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the movant's favor.'\" (49)</p><p>In denying the extension of the TRO, the court stated that Herrick had not shown the presence of \"sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make the 'fair grounds' for litigation\" and did not want to enter into a situation where the court would possibly be engaging in the \"day-to-day supervision of Grindr's compliance.\" (50) Had the courtnot denied the extension of the TRO, Grindr would have been given a duty that currently does not exist under CDA 230. (51) This responsibility would take the form of an interactive computer service, specifically an edge provider (52) (in this case, Grindr) being legally required to affirmatively monitor content on their app--which is in direct opposition to the immunity that CDA 230 provides. (53) However, this Note will assert that although the granting of a TRO currently conflicts with CDA 230, introducing an exception that CDA 230 immunity is not available in matters of fake dating profiles would allow courts to issue TROs, as the underlying requirements of the claim would change and make it possible that a claimant could prevail. Under this new exception, Herrick would have been able to prevail at the hearing for an extension of the TRO, would have been granted injunctive relief against Grindr, and ultimately would most likely have won his entire case. Instead, the Second Circuit affirmed the ruling of the trial court and, in doing so, made clear that CDA 230's protections extend to cell phone applications (\"apps\"), thus leaving Herrick without any remedies available to him. (54)</p><p>III. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE COMMUNICATIONS</p><p>DECENCY ACT</p><p>In 1996, Congress enacted CDA 230 to help foster the expansion of the Internet as a platform for diverse viewpoints and to expand the interconnectivity of news and information. (55) CDA 230 was promulgated in response to two cases that ruled in inconsistent manners with regard to interactive computer services hosting defamatory content on their site. (56) The first case, Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc., involved CompuServe, an \"online general information service\" that, for a membership fee, allowed users to access thousands of sources available on the platform or subscribe to \"special interest 'forums'\" that host \"bulletin boards, interactive online conferences, and topical databases.\" (57) At issue in this case was the \"Journalism Forum\" (\"Forum\") which was an entity independent of CompuServe hired to \"manage, review, create, delete, edit and otherwise control the contents\" of the Forum. (58) Rumorville USA (\"Rumorville\") was a publication available as a part of the Forum, and plaintiffs claimed that Rumorville published defamatory content as related to their company. (59) CompuServe did not dispute that the statements were defamatory, but instead argued that, because they were only the distributor and not the original publisher of the content, they couldn't be held liable for the statements. (60)</p><p>In ruling that CompuServe was not liable for the defamatory statements, the court analogized CompuServe to a public library, bookstore, or newsstand and stated that, as such, they have \"no more editorial control over such a publication\" than those entities do over the material they distribute. (61) Further, the court emphasized that the same standard that applies to \"more traditional news vendor[s]\" needs to apply to a \"computerized database\" as well, as anything different would thwart the \"free flow of information.\" (62) Finally, the court stated that CompuServe could not be held liable for the defamatory statements if it did not know or had no reason to know of the alleged defamatory statements that were being published. (63) As such, summary judgement in favor of CompuServe was granted. (64)</p><p>A few years later, a case with a similar factual background was decided in a different way. In Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Company, the plaintiff successfully won their defamation case against Prodigy computer network. (65) Prodigy, an online computer service, provided online computer bulletin boards where users could post and leave comments. (66) At the time of the case, Prodigy's network had \"at least two million subscribers\" who used the bulletin boards to talk and communicate. (67) The bulletin board at issue in this case, \"Money Talk,\" was \"allegedly the leading and most widely read financial computer bulletin board in the United States.\" (68) Plaintiffs alleged that, on Money Talk, an \"unidentified bulletin board user\" posted defamatory statements about their securities investment banking firm, Stratton Oakmont, saying the firm committed \"criminal and fraudulent acts\" and that they were \"a cult of brokers who either lie for a living or get fired.\" (69) Stratton Oakmont sued Prodigy for defamation based on the comments posted on the bulletin board, stating that Prodigy was a publisher of the statements and should be held liable. (70)</p><p>A significant divergence in the facts of these two cases was that Prodigy expressly held itself out as exercising editorial control over the content of the messages posted on the bulletin boards. (71) The plaintiffs used Prodigy's \"software screening program,\" (72) \"emergency delete function,\" (73) and promulgation of \"content guidelines\" (74) as evidence that Prodigy was in fact a publisher and could therefore be subject to liability in the defamation claim. (75)</p><p>The court distinguished a \"distributor, or deliverer of defamatory material\" from a newspaper, stating that the latter was \"more than a passive receptacle or conduit for news, comment and advertising,\" and said the pertinent question was whether Prodigy \"exercised sufficient editorial control over its computer bulletin boards to render it a publisher\" that essentially made it more akin to a newspaper than merely a distributor. (76) The court ruled that because Prodigy made decisions as to the content posted on their boards, this constituted \"editorial control\" rendering them a publisher. (77) Stratton Oakmont won their case against Prodigy and the court's decision turned on Prodigy's active role in moderating the content on their boards--as that made them a publisher. (78) These two conflicting cases became the impetus for the original passing of CD A 230 in 1996. (79)</p><p>When CDA 230 was passed, the courts interpreted the \"no liability\" component as creating a bar against claims for injunctive relief. (80) The court in Medytox Solutions, Inc. v. Investorshub.com, Inc. determined CDA 230 was clear about its constraints based on the text of the statute and that the immunity clearly includes \"claims for declaratory and injunctive relief sought.\" (81) Recently, in Hassell v. Bird, the court reaffirmed this position, pointing out that for \"almost two decades\" courts have been using CDA 230 to preclude injunctive relief when plaintiffs are seeking to hold an interactive content provider as the original publisher of third party content. (82)</p><p>Most cases that are successfully dismissed by using CDA 230 as a defense are related to defamation claims. (83) For example, in Craft Beer Stellar, LLC, v. Glassdoor, Inc., the court found that Glassdoor was not liable for the defamatory statements posted on their website, citing CDA 230 as barring Craft Beer Stellar's claim. (84) The court held that although Glassdoor monitored comments in accordance with their community guidelines standards, they didn't \"create [] or develop [] the offending information\" and thus could not be responsible for them, as they were held to be an interactive content provider. (85)</p><p>Similarly, in Igbonwa v. Facebook, Inc., Igbonwa filed a claim against Facebook for defamation based on comments posted on the social media platform. (86) The plaintiff was attempting to hold Facebook liable for information posted by an \"information content provider,\" and the complaint argued that Facebook was liable as the \"publisher or speaker\" of that information--clearly falling within CDA 230's scope. (87) However, Facebook contended, and the court agreed, that they were immune from liability because they were an interactive computer service. (88)</p><p>IV. CDA 230's APPLICATION IN CASES REGARDING FAKE PROFILES</p><p>CDA 230 protects interactive computer services against other claims, in addition to libel and defamation claims. (89) Specifically, interactive computer services have recently and successfully claimed immunity against plaintiffs seeking to hold them liable for fake profiles hosted on their sites (90)--for example, via a breach of contract for violations of terms of service theory. (91)</p><p>In Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc., Barnes' ex-boyfriend created profiles of her on a website run by Yahoo!. (92) Barnes got calls, emails, and personal visits by individuals expecting sex based on the profile posting. (93) Per Yahoo! 's policy, Barnes sent a copy of her photo ID and \"a signed statement denying her involvement with the profiles and requesting their removal,\" but no response or action came of it. (94) During this time, a \"local news program was preparing to broadcast a report on the incident[,]\" and one day before this broadcast, Yahoo!'s Director of Communications told Barnes she would directly hand Barnes' statement to the correct division and that it would be handled. (95) However, when two months passed and nothing had changed, Barnes filed suit in Oregon state court, and shortly after, the profiles disappeared and never returned. (96) The court dismissed Barnes' claims, stating that CDA 230 immunized Yahoo!, (97) but allowed the promissory estoppel claims to move forward, as CDA 230 doesn't bar breach of contract suits. (98)</p><p>Similarly, in Dehen v. DOES 1-100, Dehen sued Twitter in response to fake accounts that were opened in her name in an effort to impersonate and defame her. (99) Twitter was successfully immunized under CDA 230 as they met the requirements to be classified as an interactive computer service; they were being treated as a \"publisher\" or \"speaker\" of the content and the content was in fact \"provided by another information content provider.\" (100) Thus, Twitter was shielded from liability by the statute and immunized from the claims against them. (101)</p><p>With these cases, courts have been clear that CDA 230 covers interactive content providers against suits relating to fake profiles on their sites. (102) However, some courts have been less consistent when it comes to the possibility of obtaining injunctive relief when CDA 230 is invoked to immunize an interactive content provider. (103)</p><p>V. INCONSISTENCY IN THE AVAILABILITY OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER CDA 230</p><p>Courts have differed on how to rule on the viability of injunctive relief when CDA 230 provides immunity to a defendant from damages. (104) In some instances, courts have ruled that CDA 230 does not immunize a defendant against a claim that is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. (105) The courts in these cases reasoned that if Congress wanted the statute to immunize providers against \"both liability and declaratory and injunctive relief,\" it would have written it into the statute. (106)</p><p>However, other courts have determined that CDA 230's immunity clearly encompasses injunctive relief, and that the statute's \"no liability\" provision bars other types of relief in addition to damages. (107) Courts have concluded that sometimes injunctive relief is \"at least as burdensome\" as damages and \"typically more intrusive\"--reasoning that if the stated purpose of CDA 230 is to immunize interactive computer services for statements made by third parties, then making them legally responsible for the content also defeats that purpose. (108)</p><p>The cases in which courts have explicitly expressed a view on the availability of injunctive relief--one way or another--have not been cases regarding fake profiles, fraud, or impersonation. (109) With courts split on the matter, (110) there is an opening in CDA 230 and injunctive relief jurisprudence to allow for an exception that would introduce a new standard of proof in order to be able to successfully claim CDA 230 immunity in cases of fraud and impersonation online. (111) This would likely increase the likelihood of a plaintiff's ability to succeed on the merits of their claim--thus increasing the likelihood of the availability of being granted injunctive relief. This proposal has some basis in modern legal decisions, seeing that in 2017 the New York State Supreme Court granted Herrick injunctive relief against Grindr, deeming that it was a viable option in the face of CDA 230 immunity. (112)</p><p>The availability of injunctive relief in cases pertaining to fake profiles and impersonation should be viewed inherently differently than when injunctive relief is sought in matters concerning defamatory comments and libelous statements. Impersonation and fake profiles are actions commonly done by abusive partners in an effort to \"exploit, harass, threaten, and stalk their victims.\" (113) This type of abuse comes in the form of \"nonconsensual disclosure\" when images, videos, and personal information are published online for other users to use in order to \"stalk, harass, or assault\" the victim. (114) The abuse Herrick experienced \"is among the most accessible forms of abuse available,\" as all that is needed to employ this harassment and abuse is the Internet. (115) This leaves victims helpless, and without the ability to receive relief from the courts against the platforms that are hosting these fake profiles, or the dating apps that are perpetuating their use, they are left suffering from this cyber harassment--just as Herrick is, years later. (116) This Note's proposal has two sources of justification that lend support to an exception within CDA 230: Congress' original intent is not at odds with this proposed exception and the underlying tenants of another exception, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (117) and Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, (118) would lend support.</p><p>A. Congress Did Not Enact CDA 230 with Fraud or Impersonation in Mind</p><p>When Congress passed CDA 230, it was in response to two defamation cases, (119) and as such, was often viewed as providing protection for interactive computer services against libel claims. (120) In fact, from the statute's enactment in 1996 to 2009, 50.5% of the legal claims that utilized a CDA 230 defense were for \"defamation, libel, slander, and disparagement....\" (121) Congress' stated intent with passing CDA 230 was to \"promote the free exchange of information and ideas over the Internet and to encourage voluntary monitoring for offensive or obscene material.\" (122) This intent, paired with the vast number of defamation claims in which CDA 230 immunity is invoked, (123) goes to show that this Note's proposed exception would likely not be at odds with the vast amount of the litigation pleadings--as it would be creating a carve out exception that doesn't affect defamation claims.</p><p>Fake news, profiles, and impersonation accounts online are not seen as aiding in the spread of valuable information in the marketplace of ideas, or even as a beneficial addition to the exchange of information online. (124) Thus, one could argue that allowing fake profiles and impersonation accounts to remain online, with no relief for victims, would be directly against Congress' intent and thus does not fit within CDA 230's rationale. The contours of the specific requirements will be covered further in Section VI, but it is important to note that the proposed exception contains a malicious intent requirement as well as an inducement requirement--thus harmless parody accounts would not be within its purview. These harmless parody accounts, as they are a protected type of speech under the First Amendment, (125) would be a category of speech that this proposed exception would work to avoid removing.</p><p>B. The Reasoning Behind the Exception Would Be Akin to the Reasons that FOSTA-SESTA Was Passed</p><p>When FOSTA-SESTA was signed into law by President Tramp in 2018, (126) the bill created a significant exception to CDA 230 immunity by clarifying that the statute does not protect interactive computer services from laws relating to \"sexual exploitation of children or sex trafficking.\" (127) These bills also hold these services liable and responsible if third parties are posting information relating to sex-trafficking or prostitution on their site. (128) Most notably, these bills place an affirmative duty on providers to monitor content on their website and completely place the \"onus on website owners to self-police,\" (129) as FOSTA can be used as the basis for civil action against a website found to be \"knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating a sex trafficking violation\" (130) or \"advertisements for sex work.\" (131)</p><p>The bottom-line effect of FOSTA and SESTA--punishing and holding publishers liable for hosting information about sex trafficking and prostitution (132)--can be readily applied here. When passed, FOSTA-SESTA was said to \"ensure that victims and survivors of sex trafficking can seek justice against websites that knowingly facilitated the crimes against them.\" (133) Senators in support of the bill recognized that it would strike a balance between holding sex traffickers accountable and \"allowing free speech and innovation to continue to thrive.\" (134) Importantly, the bills are meant to protect vulnerable groups and communities from the bad actors that exploit them. (135) The bills give these groups the \"legal tools needed to seek and receive justice from all those involved\" by no longer allowing these providers to have the blanket protection that CDA 230 can provide. (136)</p><p>However, these bills have endured extreme criticism--perhaps rightfully so--about the detrimental effects they have in practice for sex workers and prostitutes. (137) Opponents of the bill cite studies purporting to show that online communications make \"sex work safer\"--for example, a 2017 study showed a \"17 percent decrease in homicide of female victims after Craigslist erotic services were introduced in various cities.\" (138) They also point to the direct impact these laws have had on sex workers' ability to research and screen clients, report dangerous situations to other workers, and share important and possibly dangerous health information about clients to the community at large. (139) Without access to these forums, sex workers are forced to go on the streets without being equipped with crucial information, and are more susceptible to \"violence, STIs, and exploitation\"--putting their health and safety directly at risk. (140)</p><p>FOSTA and SESTA hold providers accountable for \"knowingly assisting, supporting or facilitating a violation,\" (141) and do not take a provider's intent or motives into account. Further, it may not be evident if the content is for consensual sex work or sex trafficking--thus many websites take \"action to censor or ban parts of their platforms\" because discerning which ads are promoting consensual versus nonconsensual sex is too difficult. (142) This Note's proposed exception would require both a showing of malicious intent and a showing of inducement by the individual that created the fake profiles. These requirements, which FOSTA-SESTA lacks, will likely not overly burden speech by sweeping too broadly. For example, they won't affect parody accounts that aren't aimed to harm anyone. Further, these requirements would make sure the speech being removed from these platforms is not serving a justifiable purpose and would thus limit any unintended consequences that can occur from flat bans that stem from the strict liability seen in FOSTA-SESTA cases. (143) This distinction is important because currently in FOSTA-SESTA, advertisements can be taken down regardless of whether the intent or goal of the person who posted it is for illegal sex trafficking or consensual sex work. (144) In this Note's proposal, the intent requirement ensures that the motivations behind the fake accounts are taken into account.</p><p>Comparable to the balance between accountability and free speech ideals that a majority of Congress found was met in FOSTA-SESTA, creating an exception by changing the underlying provisions of CDA 230 for fraud and impersonation cases and in effect allowing injunctive relief for victims of these cases could do the same thing. As will be discussed in Section VI, apps and interactive computer services (specifically, edge providers) can implement identity verification steps to make sure the profiles taken down are in fact fake ones.</p><p>Finally, cyber abuse and harassment is a troubling issue in American society, with about four-in-ten Americans personally experiencing a form of online harassment. (145) Even more troubling is that \"certain groups are more likely than others\" to experience trait-based harassment, creating vulnerable communities and groups of people that are in desperate need of recourses. (146) The availability of injunctive relief would hold these providers responsible for answering and addressing victim concerns and impose an affirmative duty (should a court issue the injunctive relief), that a majority of the population (147) believes they should be responsible for. These statistics reflect the pervasiveness of cyber harassment and abuse that justifies imposing liability on providers in the same way that a majority of Congress believed that passing FOSTA-SESTA was justified in order to hold providers responsible for hosting content facilitating sex trafficking.</p><p>VI. INTRODUCING AN EXCEPTION TO CDA 230</p><p>Introducing injunctive relief as an option in cases where a provider is no longer technically immune (after this Note's proposed congressional amendment to CDA 230 is passed), would still require the plaintiff to adhere to a specific process and a different standard of proof in order to get relief. The provider--be it a dating app or dating website--would still not have to actively monitor for fake profiles, as CDA 230 imposes no affirmative duty to monitor, and this proposal does not suggest that such a duty should be imposed. Specifically, this proposed exception is explicitly intended to address impersonation dating app accounts. The harms posed by such accounts are uniquely pervasive, as seen in Herrick v. Grindr, and necessitate different requirements and their own exception to combat the problem.</p><p>Accordingly, a procedure similar to the one henceforth mentioned may be what is necessary to provide recourse for plaintiffs and victims affected by fraud and impersonation on dating apps and to enable them to re-establish the normalcy in their life that has been stripped away.</p><p>Successfully prevailing under this specific contort of CDA 230 pertaining to fake profiles and online impersonations would require the following: first, the plaintiff must follow all the adequate procedures set in place (if any exist) with the dating app or website to alert them to the presence of the fake profile. (148) Taking part in this process does not need to be successful or even yield a response from the provider (149)--the plaintiff would only be required to show their good faith attempt to alert the provider to the impersonation before legal recourse is available. Further, a set waiting period would be imposed in order to give the provider time to answer the complaint and possibly resolve the issue before it goes to the courts. One suggestion is a maximum period of two to three weeks. (150)</p><p>Second, after the requisite waiting period has passed, and if the fake profile is still live, the plaintiff needs to then satisfy a reasonableness requirement. For this, the burden is on the plaintiff to affirmatively show that their request is a reasonable one. This is a multi-factor test and no factor alone is dispositive--however, when taken into account and based on the totality of the circumstances, a combination of these various factors can help to prove reasonableness on the part of the plaintiff. A showing that the individual seeking recourse is a private figure and not a public one will factor in, as private figures have significantly less means of recourse to clarify and disseminate the truth about them in the face of lies. (151) Additionally, the content being posted can be of importance when looking at the take down request in its totality. For example, in Herrick v. Grindr, the content at issue would have been very clearly viewed under this new exception as low value speech, as JC had spread lies about Herrick's very personal sexual life, published Herrick's address and in doing so, placed him in direct harm. (152)</p><p>The intent of the individual who is creating the content must also be analyzed and classified. The malicious intent prong would require the plaintiff to prove the individual impersonating him or her was doing it with an intent to harm the plaintiff and created the fake profile to cause that harm. (153) This requirement would ensure that parody accounts, for example, that are created with the goal of comedic relief are not swept up in this exception. The malicious intent in these cases could be aided by a showing of what the content actually is. For example, in Herrick's case, a reasonable person would most likely concur that JC's intent and motivations were malicious, based on the content of the lies he was spreading. (154)</p><p>Additionally, realistic intent can also work its way into this analysis. If the matter is between two private citizens and one is mocking the other, more likely than not the intent is malicious and not pure. What further supports this theory is that, if the mocking was lighthearted and with the consent of the one mocked, it most likely wouldn't have found its way into the court system at all.</p><p>Further, the plaintiff would be aided in their showing of reasonableness by proving that the fake profile spread false information and induced individuals by reaching out to them and engaging in conversations under the guise of being the plaintiff. Inducing individuals to believe the profile is real and holding the profile out as a real profile, is a very different situation than a fake profile that merely exists but neither seeks to convince others it is something it is not nor actively tries to spread misinformation about someone.</p><p>Because these factors are holistic and not determinative, there may be other factors that aid in the formulation of reasonableness. However, by weighing these factors in light of the totality of the circumstances, courts could be better equipped to determine when a dating app can claim that CDA 230 makes them immune and when a plaintiff has successfully shown that his situation should fall under the new exception to CDA 230.</p><p>As for the logistics of tangible proof that the profile is in fact fake, a plaintiff could submit copies of their driver's license or other verified forms of identification to prove their identity, as well as copies of the profiles that are impersonating them, a signed affidavit that these profiles were not created with their consent or approval, and, finally, the name of the profiles they want removed if they are successful in their plea for injunctive relief.</p><p>Third, if the reasonableness standard is met, and the court believes that the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits and thus grants injunctive relief, it would be the plaintiff's responsibility to show the provider exactly which profile(s) are fake and which ones they want taken down, and to give the provider the plaintiff's accurate contact information so the provider can have it on file. This accurate contact information would include the plaintiff's email address, phone number, physical address, and a picture. This could help to streamline the process if other fake profiles continue to pop up with the plaintiff's photo, but with different contact information.</p><p>Fourth, a successful grant of injunctive relief would place the onus on the plaintiff, rather than the provider, to search the dating apps for any new or additional fake profiles, in order to request subsequent removals. This approach benefits both the plaintiffs and the providers. The plaintiffs, while undertaking the duty to find the fake profiles, can feel comfortable that the exact profiles they are concerned about are getting deleted. The providers can feel secure that their rights and lack of affirmative duty to monitor under CDA 230 (155) are not being thwarted, and that little to no economic burden is being imposed on them as they do not have to hire individuals to take on an affirmative role to search and locate fake profiles. (156)</p><p>A. Pros, Cons, and Effects of the Proposed Exception</p><p>A clear benefit of this exception would be providing individuals with the autonomy to protect and control their online presence. As seen in Herrick v. Grindr, an individual currently has no legal recourse when fake dating profiles are created and used to spread false information about him or her and to induce others to believe and rely on those falsities. (157) This was apparent in Herrick's case, for example, as individuals that relied on their conversation with the fake profiles on Grindr showed up to his home and work and engaged in extremely harassing behavior. (158)</p><p>A disadvantage of this exception is that it would lead to a degree of judicial interference currently not seen anywhere besides matters falling under FOSTA-SESTA's umbrella. This could create opposition for the same reason those laws did, as the exception would also have the possibility of thwarting free speech rights while also taking away the autonomy that dating apps currently have in deciding how to address issues of impersonation. Additionally, it is unclear if this exception would be successful in limiting the access of individuals who impersonate others online. This limitation would most likely have to be addressed in a dating app company's internal policies and guidelines, giving them discretion as to whether an individual who has impersonated individuals in the past could legitimately create a profile for themselves on the app in the future.</p><p>However, the high bar that is required of the plaintiff works to ensure that only those accounts that are actually causing or will cause harm are being taken down, and thus will not likely result in the over removal of dating app profiles. As with all new proposals and changes of law, there is a possibility that this exception may affect some individuals outside of the intended group at the outset of its application. Because of this, the courts may rightfully modify the factors in the reasonableness test and perhaps place a higher burden on the plaintiff to ensure that no protected speech is being removed. Additionally, lawmakers may choose to embed additional safeguards to the exception in order to prevent it from becoming an overly vague and motive-independent law--to avoid the pitfalls in the way that FOSTA-SESTA was drafted. (159)</p><p>As for the punishment for the individuals that create fake dating profiles, courts would need to look at state fraud and impersonation laws to determine the correct civil remedy. (160) That being said, this exception does not encompass or pertain to a joint suit against the dating app and the individual responsible.</p><p>VII. CONCLUSION</p><p>Under this proposed amendment to CDA 230 allowing for an exception for matters of online fraud and impersonation, a plaintiff is more likely to obtain injunctive relief because they are more likely to be successful on the merits of their underlying claim. Under this proposal, Herrick's injuries and traumas could have ended almost as quickly as they began because he was already equipped with the knowledge that JC was responsible. (161) JC spread false information about Herrick, inducing individuals to show up at Herrick's home and work, which presumably proves JC's malicious intent. (162) With that information and evidence, Herrick would have successfully sought relief from a court adopting this Note's proposed exception and would have gotten the fake dating profiles removed. This would have ended Herrick's emotional and physical suffering at the hands of JC and prevented countless random men from showing up and taunting and harassing him. This exception could have allowed Herrick to get his life back and feel safe again.</p><p>This proposal would arm victims with the power they need to take control of fake online personas that paint an inaccurate picture of an individual, at best, and help to perpetuate sexual assault, harassment, and rape at worst. It would create a way for victims of fraud and impersonation via fake dating app profiles to finally seek help within the confines of established CDA 230 immunity and interactive computer services' current lack of affirmative duty to monitor.</p><p>Camille Bachrach (*)</p><p>(*) This Note was written before President Trump's Executive Order issued on May 28, 2020--\"Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship\"--and does not contemplate, analyze, or incorporate any suggestions or proposals made in the Executive Order.

Under CDA 230, courts have taken the phrase \"no liability\" to bar injured plaintiff's from seeking injunctive relief. See Medytox Solutions, Inc. v.

Thus, by not allowing injunctive relief for plaintiff's suing interactive computer services that are immune under CDA 230, when the claim relates to fake profiles, the plaintiff is currently left with no viable recourse, for if the interactive computer service does not voluntarily remove the profile, a court cannot require them to.

Congress needs to amend this statute.\").</p><p>(148.) This may very well be the end of the fake profiles and impersonations for the plaintiff. For example, for Herrick, when another \"lesser-known gay dating app, Scrufff,]\" had Herrick's fake profiles on them, he filed a complaint with them and the company deleted and banned the account within 24 hours. Andy Greenberg, Spoofed Grindr Accounts Turned One Man's Life Into A \"Living Hell,\" WIRED (Jan. 31, 2017 02:57 PM), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/01/grinder-lawsuit-spoofed-accounts/\">https://www.wired.com/2017/01/grinder-lawsuit-spoofed-accounts/</url> [<url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/E3WX-CLF6\">https://perma.cc/E3WX-CLF6</url>]. Scruff also \"prevented the same device or IP address from creating any new accounts,\" taking Herrick's claims seriously and working to help him quickly. See id.; see also Carafano v. Metrosplash.com Inc., 339 F. 3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2003) (explaining that, after alerting Matchmaker to the fake profiles, the company, upon request, deleted the fake profile before a complaint was filed in California state court).</p><p>(149.) The plaintiff would, however, need to show evidence of successfully adhering to all the procedures that are in place.</p><p>(150.) While this is a relatively short waiting period, any longer might risk significant harm to the plaintiff at the hands of the fake profiles. Thus, to balance the plaintiff's interest in not prolonging cyber abuse and harassment with the provider's interest and realistic capabilities to respond to requests, a period of 2-3 weeks should be a fair middle ground for both parties.</p><p>(151.)

Carrie Goldberg said that providers such as Grindr don't respond to complaints or actively do anything because \"[i]t's cheaper for them not to staff a department that addressees complaints and abuses of the product.\" Greenberg, supra note 148. This proposal takes into account Goldberg's statement when it recommends placing the responsibility on the plaintiff to find and flag the fake profiles instead of the provider. See id.</p><p>(157.)

If Zuckerberg was forced to spin off Instagram, it would be very good for investors and users.Warren isn't attacking Facebook; she's attacking Zuckerberg's control of a bloated, inefficient and badly run monopoly. What would happen if a big tech company were broken up? I often get the question about whether doing so would increase the stock price of the company. The stock market is an instrument for valuing our enterprises, and there's something disconcerting about policy that would reduce the value of our businesses. </p><p>Big tech \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 are the largest and most liquid names in the stock market, sometimes known as 'hedge fund hotels.' Taking other peoples' money and investing it is based on groupthink: It's fine to lose money, but only as long as everyone else is losing it, and vice versa. Most analysts want to make sure they aren't out of step with the crowd, and the crowd right now is concerned about antitrust and big tech. I have three examples suggesting they shouldn't be so concerned, or should even seek a break-up. Also Read: Mark Zuckerberg 'Would Bet' Facebook Beats Elizabeth Warren in Legal Battle[1] Getty Images From Kerosene to Gasoline The granddaddy of all monopolies and break-ups is Standard Oil, John D. Rockefeller's oil monopoly at the turn of the 20th century that structured the most important business of the era. In 1911, the Supreme Court broke his company into 34 components, many of which went on to become of the most powerful companies in the world, such as Exxon, MobilPennzoil, Conoco, Chevron, and so forth. Shareholders did fantastically well in the break-up, with Rockefeller quintupling his wealth. Why did Standard Oil's component parts do so well? And was the break-up responsible for higher stock prices? The answer is that the older monopolistic business structure was inefficient, and breaking up the company helped unleash technological innovation in the industry by enabling the use of a relatively unimportant part of Standard's portfolio: gasoline. In 1909, a Standard-employed chemist named William Burton invented 'thermal cracking,' which was a way to vastly improve the process of turning oil into gasoline. The Indiana branch applied to headquarters[2] to put $1 million into developing the process, but HQ said no. The company primarily sold kerosene, and while cars were increasing demand for gasoline - what was then seen as a relatively useless byproduct of oil refining - such an investment was simply too risky to what had become a lazy, slothful monopoly. After the break-up, Standard Oil of Indiana simply went ahead and began using thermal cracking, and eventually the whole industry was licensing patents from the company. While stockholders did well, Indiana shareholders did even better. The era of cheap gas came, or at least was accelerated dramatically, by the break-up. You might think Google or Amazon are innovative. But at the time, most people thought Standard Oil was innovative. In fact, all are financial holding companies that capture the innovation of others, and hold it back. Stock prices reflect that. Electric Utilities In the 1930s, Congress passed a law called the Public Utility Holding Act, which broke up the complex financial holding structures that had captured control of electric utilities across the country. This law was one of the most controversial fights of the entire New Deal. What it ultimately did was force utilities to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and then dissolve themselves if they stretched across state lines unless the SEC gave them a waiver. The rationale for the law were the financial games and trickery played by utility barons, most famously, Samuel Insull, who temporarily left the country in the early 1930s to avoid capture by the authorities. Utility financiers of the time used holding companies to disguise assets, manipulate stock prices and regulators, and hand back assets among subsidiaries to avoid income taxes. Will Rogers described holding companies as 'something where you hand an accomplice the goods while the policeman searches you.' Also Read: The Slow Death of Hollywood | PRO Insight[3] At their height in the 1920s, holding companies were blue-chip stocks that everyone held. Of course, it all eventually collapsed in the stock market crash. Ten shares of one of the utility holding companies of the day - Middle West Utilities - worth $500 in 1929, dropped[4] to $1.25 in 1933. So what happened when the split-ups happened? I'll let Congressman Emanuel Celler explain. Here's what he wrote in 1950: The big utility holding companies have now been pretty well split up and the results look good. When Commonwealth and Southern started to take the treatments in 1938, the total value of its securities was only $135,000,000. By 1949, investors had received, in the breakup, cash and securities worth $415,000,000. At the same time, the consumers are getting electricity at lower rates. If this is ruining an industry, we might try to see if there are any more than that need the same kind of ruin. It turns out that when financiers control businesses within opaque structures, no one benefits but the financier. AT...s. IBM For much of the 1970s, both AT...nd IBM were subjected to antitrust suits for their monopolistic market positions and use of anti-competitive tactics. The suits were so serious, IBM prepared a break-up plan by reorganizing its divisions. For a variety of reasons, Reagan's antitrust chief, William Baxter, announced the resolution of the AT...nd IBM antitrust cases on the same day in 1982. Baxter dropped the IBM case because he felt IBM was being held back by government overreach, but chose to break up AT...ecause he disliked cross-subsidies between the regulated subsidiaries and unregulated long-distance and equipment manufacturing subsidiaries. The government was giving an unfair advantage, he felt, to the unregulated AT...ubs. In addition, AT...ained an important benefit in the break-up, which was an end to the 1956 decree prohibiting the company from entering the computer business. By letting AT...nto the computer business, Baxter thought IBM would finally face competition. Also Read: Elizabeth Warren Intentionally Lied in New Facebook Ad to See If Platform Would Approve It[5] So what happened, at least for investors? Well, IBM did not do well, while the many component pieces of AT...id well. Here's Fortune magazine[6] in 1992: The market value of AT... common stock just before the settlements were announced in January 1982 was $47.5 billion. In late June of this year, the market value of the eight successor companies together \u2014 the stripped-down AT...plus Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Nynex, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern Bell, and US West \u2014 came to no less than $180 billion. AT...old for less than book value in 1982, and its components sold for twice book value ten years later. Meanwhile, IBM increased its stock price above book value by just 30% in that time. IBM throughout the 1980s had better technology, more capacity and a better reputation than Microsoft. But like Standard Oil in the 1900s, headquarters overruled the engineers. Had IBM simply been split up, history would have been very different, and IBM stockholders, many of whom had handed down the stock through their family for decades, would have made out much better than they did.Breaking Up Big Tech Today? Years ago, I used to use an RSS reader called Bloglines. Google bought the product, and ultimately shut it down. This isn't because it was a bad business, but because it didn't move the revenue needle for a company as big as Google. Bloglines could have been a great mid-size business for someone, but it was a distraction for Google executives. How many technologies like that are locked within Google, Amazon or Facebook? How many business people and engineers are waiting to be liberated? I suspect there are many. Liberating business from monopoly would help our society; it would help the marketplace; it would help consumers; and it would probably help investors. After all, if you break up Google, a shareholder of Google would also become shareholders of YouTube, DoubleClick, Android, Maps and all of the component parts. And each of those businesses would be able to innovate and develop new industries. That said, broadly speaking, those who believe in the philosophy of populism bringing back antitrust do not particularly respect stock prices or investors. And Wall Street is driven by ego and power as much as money, so even if break-ups made sense, bankers would probably despise governments seeking to force them. Fundamentally, merger law or structural separations are simply mergers and acquisitions \u2014 but they are done by democratic institutions in the form of antitrust agencies.

Dan O'Malley went against that theory by joining a bank and may soon have proof of concept.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">O'Malley heads Eastern Labs, an initiative he co-founded in April 2014 at Eastern Bank in Boston. Eastern Labs is expecting to release its first development by yearend. O'Malley declined to say what it is specifically, but refers to it as a platform and says it should contribute to the bottom line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The planned rollout underscores how banks of all sizes are looking to transform their cultures to embrace a much faster tech pace amid a digital era.</p><p>\"We are getting to the iTunes moment,\" said O'Malley, referring to the fate of the mall music stores.</p><p>Many banks recognize that they need to see digital changes as something that can happen inside the bank if they want to stay relevant in an environment filled with companies trying to cut them out of the financial equation.</p><p>\"There are a lot of advantages to being a bank,\" said O'Malley, who previously was chief executive of PerkStreet Financial, a cards reward startup that shuttered.</p><p>A bank comes with assets startups don't have, like access to data and customers.</p><p>Of course, banks also come with decades-old technologies, expensive branches and fierce regulation.</p><p>But O'Malley, along with the PerkStreet team members who joined him at Eastern last year, believed they could build things more quickly if they incubated ideas within a bank.</p><p>\"Speed is key,\" O'Malley said.</p><p>Eastern Labs is an example of the way banks are trying to step out of their conservative comfort zone and embrace Silicon Valley techniques. Institutions are: hosting hackathons; launching innovation labs; sending their employees to the Valley; creating mobile-first divisions; and working with and acquiring startups.</p><p>But such efforts alone won't guarantee success of a goal that's daunting if not elusive, said Hayagreeva Rao, a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business.</p><p>\"The real challenge is how to create the soul of a startup inside of an organization,\" said Rao, who co-authored \"Scaling Up Excellence: Getting to More Without Settling for Less.\"</p><p>That is going to be perhaps more difficult for banks. All companies face the potential of disruption, but banks have an added difficulty because avoiding risk is often a part of their fabric.</p><p>\"Banks are, by nature, conservative,\" Rao said. \"The really innovative ideas involve controversy.\"</p><p>Eastern Labs is run by former entrepreneurs, but they understand that they work for a bank and their mission is to build technologies that can be used there and potentially be sold to other institutions.</p><p>As a result, they know and care about what other banks might want. O'Malley, who oversees 115 employees, says his talks with banks are going well; he is able to answer their bank-specific questions because he is already living it at Eastern.</p><p>\"It's been really powerful,\" he said.</p><p>The unit also has something O'Malley says any bank lab would need: funds earmarked specifically for experimenting. Eastern, for example, has committed 1% of revenues to research and development. In 2015, its budget was $4 million.</p><p>But in-bank labs have their challenges. Banks root themselves in stability and time-tested consistency. Startups often embrace the concept of fail fast. Balancing the two can be difficult, especially in today's earning environment where banks are laser focused on expenses.</p><p>\"There are good reasons why bank culture is the way it is and there are good reasons why startup culture is the way it is,\" said O'Malley.</p><p>Some banks CEOs, like Richard Davis at U.S. Bancorp, have said that despite their focus on expenses, they are continuing to invest in innovation to avoid being left behind.</p><p>But those striking differences are why acquiring is often banks' paths to innovation, rather than building it.</p><p>However, getting startups to care about the company is tough, according to a paper Capgemini published in July on the growing mandate to innovate regardless of industry.</p><p>\"You need to avoid becoming an innovation theater where all you are doing is interacting with a bunch of startups that don't really care about your company,\" a large bank respondent told the consulting firm.</p><p>While Eastern Bank and others are focused on bringing innovation and entrepreneurs inside, sometimes bankers need to get out of the bank, too.</p><p>O'Malley, for instance, worked at Capital One before starting PerkStreet.</p><p>There is also Dave Kucera, who scouted for fintech innovations on behalf of BBVACompass, a bank that acquired Simple and works with Dwolla and Kasisto. He is now the chief executive of Innosect, a software company that aims to help companies innovate.</p><p>Kucera is among the ex-bankers who decided to leave the bank to create a company - an idea that crystallized for him when his daily agenda required formal attire, but he was often in meetings with a startup execs in shorts and flip flops.</p><p>\"Honestly, life is too short to wear a suit every single day,\" he said.</p><p>Others say bankers can benefit from decidedly shorter stays away.</p><p>Standford's Rao advocates for employees to get distance from their \"motherships\" by visiting incubators and accelerators.</p><p>Mach49, a Silicon Valley company Rao advises, is one such resource. Through the Mach49 12-week program, banks and others send small teams - usually four to six people - to visit with venture capital firms, startups and others and to develop and test hypotheses the way a startup might.</p><p>\"It's not just about going to Silicon Valley,\" said Linda Yates, founder and chief executive of Mach49, the incubator and accelerator.</p><p>The program's intent is to improve a practice banks may already do: send employees to visit big tech companies in the hope \"the innovation fairy dust\" hits them, said Yates.</p><p>\"The only way to disrupt and to innovate is if they really get down and dirty.\"</p><p>Like Eastern's O'Malley, Yates believes innovation can come from inside the large corporations.</p><p>\"It's amazing what these guys have as their disposal,\" she said. \"The startups may want to eat your lunch, but you can steal their dinner.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0001077539</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H7X-XV41-JCRW-53M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1017\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Across the world, political actors - from state agencies to shadow proxies to individuals and armies of bots - are logging on to launch sophisticated disinformation campaigns to steal elections, manipulate public opinion on policy, and simply sow discord.</p><p> Using everything from false news stories to phony memes, they're tactically inundating micro-targeted demographics with specially tailored content, feeding unsuspecting groups with often objectively false information.</p><p>  Meanwhile, big tech, apparently aghast at their platforms' unforeseen hijacking, still won't hand over the troves of proprietary data they've ceaselessly collected on how disinformation is shared, and on how ads track and target specific audiences.</p><p> It's time we accepted the obvious - that the war against disinformation shouldn't be led by the tech companies raking in billions from the political ads at issue.</p><p> With the 2020 US presidential election upon us, the case of the United States offers a useful starting point for a discussion on what a prudent regulatory framework for combating misinformation might look like, one that attempts to strike a balance between needed regulation and the protection of free speech.</p><p> To be sure, disinformation campaigns are at least as old as democracy itself. But to think we've been here before would be a mistake.</p><p>           The speed, reach and low cost of disseminating disinformation over social media have made it a tool for politically motivated manipulation of unprecedented efficiency.</p><p> Furthermore, its capacity to shape political opinion is uniquely insidious.</p><p> Consider, first, how the nature of these platforms facilitates anonymity for those purchasing ads. Anonymity, and thus impunity, in turn incentivises ever more radical and false messaging.</p><p> Anonymity also cloaks the political affiliations of the purchaser, making it easier to pitch false information and manipulate those who click on the ads.</p><p> If voters around the world understood the ways in which algorithms use their data to sort them into categories characterised by certain predispositions, and how political ads leverage this data to target certain demographics with tailored disinformation, they'd think twice about the hours they spend scrolling and sharing. They might even quit the platform altogether.</p><p> Unfortunately, even when long-time users become privy to a platform's tolerance of manipulative ads, the natural monopolies enjoyed by tech giants make it unlikely that the user will flee the platform.</p><p> This lack of competition almost ensures that any attempt by Facebook, Twitter and Google to unilaterally combat disinformation will inevitably be half-hearted. They have no real financial incentive to prove their integrity.</p><p> If democracy is under threat, then democratic institutions must lead the war against that threat.</p><p> It's time, in other words, for more radical solutions, and for a regulatory agency that can compel Big Tech to fall in line.</p><p>  Float the idea of US government regulation of social media, and the minds behind these platforms often scoff at the idea of inexpert bureaucrats policing their highly sophisticated platforms.</p><p> They're less likely to point out that it's the platforms' policies on proprietary data that have in large part kept these bureaucrats unfit for the task.</p><p>           By blocking impartial outsiders' access to their data, the companies are also denying researchers a fighting chance to understand social media's impact on political outcomes.</p><p> But surely the public has the right to be protected from threats posed by technologies that automate control over mass-information markets? If conventional industries are subject to health and safety inspections, why are big tech firms exempt from government audits of their platforms' data'</p><p> A new regulatory commission tasked with fighting politically motivated disinformation on social platforms could insist on data disclosure for the sake of public safety, and as part of a much-needed broader reform of data rights.</p><p> Opening its own research office, and in possession of the information needed to evaluate the threat, this new agency could conduct independent research.</p><p> It should target, at first, the most blatant and straightforward abuses, attempting to curtail objectively false stories and to prevent political parties and organisations from using proxies to publish content and ads.</p><p> This new agency should set about developing action plans and anti-disinformation software, and it should involve inputs from both third-party non-governmental organisations and the social media platforms themselves.</p><p> Users have a right to know who's trying to influence their political views, and how.</p><p> Government oversight should therefore start by requiring disclaimers for all ads deemed political in nature. These disclaimers should identify the ad's source, those behind its funding, and the targeting criteria that put it in the user's feed.</p><p> In the days before the 2016 US election, messages circulated that Mrs Hillary Clinton had died, and that the date of the election had changed.</p><p> To curb the tide of such false stories, the regulatory agency should create and refine fact-checking algorithms with the help of the social media companies.</p><p> Users can, for instance, be offered channels for flagging suspicious stories; there could be a veracity score attached to stories pending investigation.</p><p> Lest the social platforms' dedication to the task be doubted, it will clearly be in these companies' interests to co-create the standards and policing software they'll be subsequently obliged to implement.</p><p>  Still, thorny questions about how we hold these platforms accountable remain.</p><p> First, many will oppose platform liability as a potentially dangerous departure from the oft-cited CDA 230, a legal provision in the US shielding platforms from accountability for user-generated content.</p><p> But even though tech companies have long enjoyed the same exemptions afforded telecommunications companies and other \"neutral\" venues, they no longer deserve the protections that come with that designation. Far from being neutral content hosts, these sites now curate what their users see.</p><p> Second, how do we give this new regulatory office teeth, while not making it a monster'</p><p>           Many fear that revoking liability protection would pose a risk to free expression - and indeed, making platforms answerable to a government for \"incorrectly\" determining what is \"true and legitimate\" speech would force them into a precarious situation.</p><p> Platforms might be persuaded to police over-aggressively, even prompting users to self-censor legitimate content.</p><p> Even worse, some predict, an authoritarian administration might exploit the networks' new responsibilities by transforming the tech companies into their own government-controlled proxy censors.</p><p> The answer, nevertheless, is to hold platforms liable, but to do so in a very limited sense. In order to protect free expression on these platforms, the new oversight agency must regulate in such a way that does not cast social platforms - or any one entity - as the lonely, potentially capricious, arbiters of legitimate expression.</p><p> We could imagine, for example, a legal framework according to which social platforms are punished when, and only when, they fail to implement the specific requirements and software they co-developed alongside regulators and non-governmental organisations.</p><p> The social media platforms, in other words, are held accountable for not requiring ad purchasers to identify affiliations, or for neglecting to deploy the fact-checking and attribution algorithms they co-wrote.</p><p> They are not held accountable for the actual content that suddenly appears online, but only for failing to observe the best practices they co-designed.</p><p> Similarly, the burden (or privilege) of determining what constitutes \"true, legitimate\" content is shifted to the action plans as well as the algorithms and all their underlying criteria - all of which are made open to both user and judicial review.</p><p> The responsibility for defining legitimate expression is entrusted to the new regulatory body, itself answerable to the people.</p><p> In tackling this incredibly intractable issue, we should be bold enough to hold social platforms accountable, while treading very carefully to protect free speech. In the US and elsewhere, new government agencies must be entrusted to help spearhead this effort.</p><p> Ultimately, the more disinformation seeks to undermine democratic processes, and to obscure our vision of the wolf at the door, our best defence will be found through fortifying democratic institutions themselves.</p><p> Our best hope lies in democratically accountable public oversight.</p><p>Frank-Jurgen Richter is founder and chairman of Horasis, a global visions community.

Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don't have a clue (or do they?)!\" - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2018.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court (which is entirely independent of Trump, yet currently dominated by conservative leaning judges) is considering whether to hear a case that could see state sales taxes imposed on Amazon and other e-commerce companies.</p><p>Facebook has incurred the wrath of legislators (CEO Mark Zuckerberg was recently hauled before Congress) after it emerged that data of millions of users had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked for the Trump campaign in 2016.</p><p>The social media behemoth is also being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, a key competition agency, over this episode.</p><p>Google's YouTube business last year was hit by an advertiser backlash after it failed to deal with hate speech and extremist content. Even Apple has not been immune from the backlash after some of its own investors called on it to do more to stop smartphone addiction.</p><p>As I have written previously, the tech sector, which not long ago enjoyed broad bipartisan support in its home market, is suddenly looking politically isolated in the US.</p><p>Republicans don't trust it - most people who work in tech are ultra-progressive on social issues, and Democrats have been turned off by the industry's growing stranglehold over vast swaths of the economy, and the questionable practices of some of its participants.</p><p>Despite this changing political climate, Congress is still plagued by paralysis - it's doubtful whether it can get anything done. As a result, it may fall to institutions removed from the short-term political process, such as the FTC or the Supreme Court, to act.</p><p>In Europe, the climate for big American tech companies is even frostier. Competition laws in Europe are different to America's - they are less narrowly focused on impacts to prices paid by consumers, and unlike the US don't assume that markets ultimately work.</p><p>Google last year was hit with a record (EURO)2.4 billion fine by European competition regulators for (trivial sounding) breaches of rules relating to online shopping ads. The stakes are much higher now.</p><p>Europe is also being much more aggressive on regulating privacy issues. The EU's GDPR (General Data Production Regulation) regime comes into effect next month. It will affect any industry that collects data on its customers.</p><p>For the the likes of Google and Facebook it will require users to \"opt-in\" to allow their data be used for various purposes. Under a worst case scenario, Goldman estimates that Google's advertising revenue could be hit by 2 per cent, and Facebook's by as much as 7 per cent, due to GDPR.</p><p>Notably, other analysts have argued that GDPR could actually benefit the tech giants, as complying with it will prove burdensome for many smaller companies.</p><p>For instance, Credit Suisse has described GDPR as an \"unambiguous positive for operators such as Facebook\", arguing it has a higher likelihood of receiving approval from users than other internet firms that might interact with customers less frequently.</p><p>Anyone with a rudimentary grasp of recent business history will recognise the significance of Wall Street firms increasingly fixating on the question of regulating big tech.</p><p>Goldman, famously described by Rolling Stone as a \"great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity\", was itself the centre of consumer anger, and regulatory scrutiny, only a short while ago.</p><p>It's barely a decade since Wall Street plunged the world's biggest economy (and the world economy) into the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1920s.</p><p>Australia, through a combination of luck and skill, dodged the worst of that crisis.

Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don't have a clue (or do they?)!\" - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2018.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court (which is entirely independent of Trump, yet currently dominated by conservative leaning judges) is considering whether to hear a case that could see state sales taxes imposed on Amazon and other e-commerce companies.</p><p>Facebook has incurred the wrath of legislators (CEO Mark Zuckerberg was recently hauled before Congress) after it emerged that data of millions of users had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked for the Trump campaign in 2016.</p><p>The social media behemoth is also being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, a key competition agency, over this episode.</p><p>Google's YouTube business last year was hit by an advertiser backlash after it failed to deal with hate speech and extremist content. Even Apple has not been immune from the backlash after some of its own investors called on it to do more to stop smartphone addiction.</p><p>As I have written previously, the tech sector, which not long ago enjoyed broad bipartisan support in its home market, is suddenly looking politically isolated in the US.</p><p>Republicans don't trust it - most people who work in tech are ultra-progressive on social issues, and Democrats have been turned off by the industry's growing stranglehold over vast swaths of the economy, and the questionable practices of some of its participants.</p><p>Despite this changing political climate, Congress is still plagued by paralysis - it's doubtful whether it can get anything done. As a result, it may fall to institutions removed from the short-term political process, such as the FTC or the Supreme Court, to act.</p><p>In Europe, the climate for big American tech companies is even frostier. Competition laws in Europe are different to America's - they are less narrowly focused on impacts to prices paid by consumers, and unlike the US don't assume that markets ultimately work.</p><p>Google last year was hit with a record (EURO)2.4 billion fine by European competition regulators for (trivial sounding) breaches of rules relating to online shopping ads. The stakes are much higher now.</p><p>Europe is also being much more aggressive on regulating privacy issues. The EU's GDPR (General Data Production Regulation) regime comes into effect next month. It will affect any industry that collects data on its customers.</p><p>For the the likes of Google and Facebook it will require users to \"opt-in\" to allow their data be used for various purposes. Under a worst case scenario, Goldman estimates that Google's advertising revenue could be hit by 2 per cent, and Facebook's by as much as 7 per cent, due to GDPR.</p><p>Notably, other analysts have argued that GDPR could actually benefit the tech giants, as complying with it will prove burdensome for many smaller companies.</p><p>For instance, Credit Suisse has described GDPR as an \"unambiguous positive for operators such as Facebook\", arguing it has a higher likelihood of receiving approval from users than other internet firms that might interact with customers less frequently.</p><p>Anyone with a rudimentary grasp of recent business history will recognise the significance of Wall Street firms increasingly fixating on the question of regulating big tech.</p><p>Goldman, famously described by Rolling Stone as a \"great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity\", was itself the centre of consumer anger, and regulatory scrutiny, only a short while ago.</p><p>It's barely a decade since Wall Street plunged the world's biggest economy (and the world economy) into the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1920s.</p><p>Australia, through a combination of luck and skill, dodged the worst of that crisis. As a result, our financial institutions didn't suffer the kind of backlash they are only just beginning to witness now as a result of the scandals exposed by the royal commission.</p><p>America's biggest financial firms, Goldman included, know all too well what a populist backlash, and ensuing regulation, looks and feels like.

The RBA should get in first to establish its own digital dollar.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the more intriguing ideas of 2019 was Facebook's proposal for <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>a digital currency called \"Libra\"</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook didn't have a great public relations year in 2019. And there is enough concern about Mark Zuckerberg's existing influence that plenty of people have rung alarm bells at the idea of putting him in charge of a global currency to rival the US dollar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But make no mistake, in the (early) 2020s there will be a global digital currency. It could be launched by Facebook, or one of the other leading platform companies like Amazon, Google, or Apple.</p><p>And while the US dollar may remain intact as the global reserve currency, in non-digital form, countries like Australia will be forced to consider moving to a fully digital currency sooner rather than later.</p><p>As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/reserve-bank-dismisses-facebook-s-cryptocurrency-plans-20200109-p53q41\">The Australian Financial Review earlier reported</url> the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), in a submission to the Senate Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology, expressed scepticism about both the likelihood of a global stable coin like Libra and even its usefulness given existing payment technologies in Australia.</p><p>That's the sort of thing they need to say. But it's wrong - and fundamentally misunderstand the power of what economist call \"network externalities\".</p><p>The idea behind Libra is to establish a digital currency backed by real assets. When up and running you would transfer, say, Australian dollars and receive \"Libra\" at a given exchange rate into your digital wallet called \"Calibra\". With this you could buy and sell goods and services by tapping your phone or watch, just like using Apple Pay or Google Pay.</p><p>It would run on <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>decentralised blockchain technology</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> which would provide effectively impenetrable security, extremely low operating costs, and the ability to scale and adapt to new technological developments.</p><p>A crucial difference between Libra and a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is that Libra would be backed by <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>a reserve of real assets</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. Every dollar - not just a portion, but every dollar - converted into Libra would be used to purchase government securities in a basket of different currencies.</p><p>The intrinsic value of the reserve is designed to create stable expectations of the future value of Libra. If people believe that Libra will be a stable store of value, then there is no reason to speculate on it. The Libra reserve would operate much like deposit insurance or government backing of banks - there's no point trying to trigger a bank run if other people rationally believe that there is not going to be a bank run.</p><p>Importantly, the Libra Association that governs the reserve and the currency more generally would not be controlled by Facebook, but by a group of non-profits (e.g. Kiva, Women's World Banking), technology and marketplace companies (e.g. Uber, Lyft), venture capitalists, blockchain firms, and telecommunications companies.</p><p>Why, you might ask, would anyone move from their existing mode of payment to a new digital currency?</p><p>For starters, there are an estimated 1.7 billion adults around the world who are unbanked, even <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>though 1 billion of those have a mobile phone</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> and therefore could use Libra. Others pay high fees to transfer money internationally. Still others are fed up with their existing financial institution.</p><p>But most of all, a digital currency backed by a platform like Facebook, Google, Amazon, or Apple will be easy to use and instantly have hundreds of millions of users. If it's easy and cheap to use a digital currency on Amazon and you already purchase frequently on the platform why not use it? If it's easy to transfer $20 from splitting a restaurant bill using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp then why use existing bank transfers?</p><p>This is the power of what economists call \"network externalities\" - when more people use a product or platform, it increases the value to other consumers. It's the central force which underpins the digital economy. And it's the key advantage which the big tech companies have in what will likely become the \"currency wars\" of the 2020s.</p><p>If this plays out, and one of the big tech companies establishes a global currency that is adopted by a meaningful number of Australians, then the RBA will essentially lose control of monetary policy. The supply of money used in Australia would be determined not by the RBA through setting the cash rate, but by the Libra Association, or the equivalent if another tech company wins the battle for digital currency supremacy.</p><p>The US Federal Reserve may be able to withstand this threat - some global fiat currency will surely survive. Indeed, some will be needed to provide the asset backing for the digital currency.</p><p>But the current, fiat, Australian dollar might not survive - despite being a highly-traded currency.</p><p>A digital Australian dollar, by contrast, could survive. It would provide some of the benefits of Libra to an already financially sophisticated and digitally-literate Australian public.</p><p>That prospect would be boosted by Australia pre-emptively adopting a digital Australian dollar. Doing so would lend support to the inevitable march toward digital currencies, but be more on the RBA's terms than completely losing control of monetary policy.</p><p>A digital Aussie dollar would be controlled by the RBA, useful in the basket of currencies used by Libra, and have many of the day-to-day benefits of a cashless society.</p><p>Like it or not, a global digital currency is coming. Like globalisation and automation we cannot resist the irrepressible tide of technology.</p><p>But we can pre-empt it to a degree, and do so on our own terms.</p><p>Richard Holden is professor of economics at UNSW Business School.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520227080</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYM-YW91-JBJ7-N229-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"934\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> () --  Big Tech is behaving badly. And I'm not talking about Facebook handing over your personal data to the highest bidder or Amazon playing puppeteer in its HQ2 charade. Big Tech is violating the Sherman Act of 1890. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you think an antitrust law passed over a century ago couldn't possibly address the problems of the digital era, you're wrong. Much like our Constitution, the Sherman Act was written broadly enough to handle whatever the future might hold. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Sherman Act was created to combat juggernauts that ruled entire industries like oil and railroads. It was made precisely for the highly concentrated power we see today in Big Tech. When passing the law, Senator John Sherman declared, \"If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade...\" </p><p>Why, then, isn't anything being done about Big Tech violating the Sherman Act? In recent decades, corporate defendants have persuaded judges to narrow the law, by requiring, for instance, evidence of price increases to prove a case. But consumers pay for tech platforms' services with data, not dollars. The Sherman Act makes no mention of prices, and low prices should not be the only goal. Competition should be the goal. Competition maximizes consumer choice, innovation and quality, and combats the concentration of economic and political power.</p><p>Being big on its own does not violate the Sherman Act. To do so, a company must also have acquired or maintained its monopoly power using exclusionary conduct. Monopoly power is the ability to control prices or exclude competition for a particular product or service. </p><p>Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) have monopoly power in their respective markets. A market for antitrust purposes includes only those options that consumers would switch to when prices went up or quality went down a small amount. </p><p>Each tech company maintains that it does not have monopoly power, despite the examples below of their power to exclude competition. The platforms define the markets they operate in broadly, as in \"all e-commerce,\" \"all social media,\" or \"all mobile operating systems,\" rather than limiting the markets to substitutes that consumers would easily switch to. Switching is important because only if consumers can readily vote with their feet do other companies competitively constrain the tech platforms.</p><p>Facebook, for example, doesn't need to have a monopoly over a market as broad as \"all social media.\" All social media platforms are not substitutes for Facebook. You can't see baby pictures on LinkedIn, and you can't keep in touch with Grandma on Twitter. The closest substitute to Facebook is Instagram, which isn't much of a choice since Facebook owns it.</p><p>So how do the tech platforms use exclusionary conduct to acquire and maintain monopoly power? Let me count the ways. </p><p>The nearly 20-year-old case of US v. Microsoft illustrates how today's tech giants are breaking the law. The court held that Microsoft used its monopoly power in \"Intel-compatible desktop PC operating systems\" to squash the Netscape browser by requiring computer makers to instead install Microsoft's own Internet Explorer browser. Rather than competing on the merits, Microsoft used its monopoly power to try to take over the internet browser market. Ironically, if the Department of Justice had not sued Microsoft to stop its anticompetitive behavior, Google might not exist! After taking over the internet browser market, Microsoft could have required computer makers to use its own search engine, too. </p><p>Google, Amazon and Facebook are following the same playbook. The tech giants have \"platform privilege\" --- the incentive and ability to prioritize their own goods and services over those of competitors that depend on their platforms. By doing so, they contend they are improving their products and benefiting customers. An entrepreneur can create a superior product or service and still get crushed because Big Tech is controlling the game and playing it, too. </p><p>This distorted playing field strikes at the heart of the American Dream. And it deprives consumers of the choice, innovation and quality that comes from competition on the merits.</p><p>Just as Microsoft used its monopoly in PC operating systems to exclude competition in internet browsers, Google used its monopoly in mobile operating systems to exclude competition in mobile apps. The European Commission fined Google $5 billion in July for requiring phone makers using Android to pre-install Google's apps and not competitors' apps. The Commission said 80% of smart phones in Europe and worldwide run on the system. By closing the gates of competition, Google cemented its monopoly in mobile search. The Commission ordered Google to stop its anticompetitive conduct, but many question whether it's too little too late. Google has appealed. </p><p>The Android case followed the European Commission's Google Shopping case from a year prior, when it fined Google $2.7 billion for burying its comparison shopping competitors on page four, on average, of Google search results. The Commission found that Google used its monopoly on internet search to take over the comparison shopping market without competing on the merits. It ordered Google to give equal treatment to competing comparison shopping services and its own service. Google has made changes but some competitors say it's not complying with the decision. Google has also been accused of prioritizing its own reviews, maps, images and travel booking services in its search results, excluding competition in those markets. Google has rejected claims that it tries to hurt competitors, and has appealed this decision as well.</p><p>Amazon, too, is following the monopolist's playbook, picking and choosing which products consumers discover and determining who gets to compete on its platform, which accounts for nearly one out of every two dollars spent online. Amazon often excludes marketplace sellers from selling products it wants to sell and prohibits brands from selling their own products, taking the retail margin for itself. This exclusionary conduct, combined with Amazon's ability to use its competitors' data to create Amazon versions of popular products, giving them priority placement on Amazon.com, destroys competition on the merits. </p><p>Facebook, in turn, uses its platform privilege to pick and choose what content we see. Facebook competes against news publishers and content creators for consumers' time and data, the fuel for its advertising model. Profit-maximizing algorithms prioritize content that keeps you on the platform, including Facebook's own Instant Articles and content that makes you fearful and angry (or as Facebook calls it, \"engaged\"). </p><p>Facebook's exclusionary conduct goes beyond its algorithm: Internal company documents recently made public by the UK Parliament reveal how Mark Zuckerberg moved to exclude a rival app from using Facebook integrations available to others. </p><p>On top of using their monopoly power to exclude competition and take over new markets, the tech giants have also grown through hundreds of acquisitions. Many of these deals violate the Clayton Act, Section 7, which prohibits mergers and acquisitions where the effect \"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\"</p><p>Think Google's acquisitions of Android, YouTube, AdMob and DoubleClick, and Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Like the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act's intent has been subverted by misguided case law.</p><p>Even though antitrust doctrine has gone off the rails, regulators cannot give up. They should bring the strongest cases possible, as court victories can help correct antitrust precedent. Losses can only do so much damage to already-crippled statutes. And Congress should also step in and fix bad court decisions so that the antitrust laws can work for all of us again. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

And I'm not talking about Facebook handing over your personal data to the highest bidder or Amazon playing puppeteer in its HQ2 charade. Big Tech is violating the Sherman Act of 1890.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you think an antitrust law passed over a century ago couldn't possibly address the problems of the digital era, you're wrong. Much like our Constitution, the Sherman Act was written broadly enough to handle whatever the future might hold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Sherman Act was created to combat juggernauts that ruled entire industries like oil and railroads. It was made precisely for the highly concentrated power we see today in Big Tech. When passing the law, Senator John Sherman declared, \"If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade...\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p>Why, then, isn't anything being done about Big Tech violating the Sherman Act? In recent decades, corporate defendants have persuaded judges to narrow the law, by requiring, for instance, evidence of price increases to prove a case. But consumers pay for tech platforms' services with data, not dollars. The Sherman Act makes no mention of prices, and low prices should not be the only goal. Competition should be the goal. Competition maximizes consumer choice, innovation and quality, and combats the concentration of economic and political power.</p><p>Being big on its own does not violate the Sherman Act. To do so, a company must also have acquired or maintained its monopoly power using exclusionary conduct. Monopoly power is the ability to control prices or exclude competition for a particular product or service.</p><p>Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) have monopoly power in their respective markets. A market for antitrust purposes includes only those options that consumers would switch to when prices went up or quality went down a small amount.</p><p>Each tech company maintains that it does not have monopoly power, despite the examples below of their power to exclude competition. The platforms define the markets they operate in broadly, as in \"all e-commerce,\" \"all social media,\" or \"all mobile operating systems,\" rather than limiting the markets to substitutes that consumers would easily switch to. Switching is important because only if consumers can readily vote with their feet do other companies competitively constrain the tech platforms.</p><p>Facebook, for example, doesn't need to have a monopoly over a market as broad as \"all social media.\" All social media platforms are not substitutes for Facebook. You can't see baby pictures on LinkedIn, and you can't keep in touch with Grandma on Twitter. The closest substitute to Facebook is Instagram, which isn't much of a choice since Facebook owns it.</p><p>So how do the tech platforms use exclusionary conduct to acquire and maintain monopoly power? Let me count the ways.</p><p/><p>The nearly 20-year-old case of US v. Microsoft illustrates how today's tech giants are breaking the law. The court held that Microsoft used its monopoly power in \"Intel-compatible desktop PC operating systems\" to squash the Netscape browser by requiring computer makers to instead install Microsoft's own Internet Explorer browser. Rather than competing on the merits, Microsoft used its monopoly power to try to take over the internet browser market. Ironically, if the Department of Justice had not sued Microsoft to stop its anticompetitive behavior, Google might not exist! After taking over the internet browser market, Microsoft could have required computer makers to use its own search engine, too.</p><p>Google, Amazon and Facebook are following the same playbook. The tech giants have \"platform privilege\" ? the incentive and ability to prioritize their own goods and services over those of competitors that depend on their platforms. By doing so, they contend they are improving their products and benefiting customers. An entrepreneur can create a superior product or service and still get crushed because Big Tech is controlling the game and playing it, too.</p><p>This distorted playing field strikes at the heart of the American Dream. And it deprives consumers of the choice, innovation and quality that comes from competition on the merits.</p><p>Just as Microsoft used its monopoly in PC operating systems to exclude competition in internet browsers, Google used its monopoly in mobile operating systems to exclude competition in mobile apps. The European Commission fined Google $5 billion in July for requiring phone makers using Android to pre-install Google's apps and not competitors' apps. The Commission said 80% of smart phones in Europe and worldwide run on the system. By closing the gates of competition, Google cemented its monopoly in mobile search. The Commission ordered Google to stop its anticompetitive conduct, but many question whether it's too little too late. Google has appealed.</p><p>The Android case followed the European Commission's Google Shopping case from a year prior, when it fined Google $2.7 billion for burying its comparison shopping competitors on page four, on average, of Google search results. The Commission found that Google used its monopoly on internet search to take over the comparison shopping market without competing on the merits. It ordered Google to give equal treatment to competing comparison shopping services and its own service. Google has made changes but some competitors say it's not complying with the decision. Google has also been accused of prioritizing its own reviews, maps, images and travel booking services in its search results, excluding competition in those markets. Google has rejected claims that it tries to hurt competitors, and has appealed this decision as well.</p><p>Amazon, too, is following the monopolist's playbook, picking and choosing which products consumers discover and determining who gets to compete on its platform, which accounts for nearly one out of every two dollars spent online. Amazon often excludes marketplace sellers from selling products it wants to sell and prohibits brands from selling their own products, taking the retail margin for itself. This exclusionary conduct, combined with Amazon's ability to use its competitors' data to create Amazon versions of popular products, giving them priority placement on Amazon.com, destroys competition on the merits.</p><p>Facebook, in turn, uses its platform privilege to pick and choose what content we see. Facebook competes against news publishers and content creators for consumers' time and data, the fuel for its advertising model. Profit-maximizing algorithms prioritize content that keeps you on the platform, including Facebook's own Instant Articles and content that makes you fearful and angry (or as Facebook calls it, \"engaged\").</p><p/><p>Facebook's exclusionary conduct goes beyond its algorithm: Internal company documents recently made public by the UK Parliament reveal how Mark Zuckerberg moved to exclude a rival app from using Facebook integrations available to others.</p><p>On top of using their monopoly power to exclude competition and take over new markets, the tech giants have also grown through hundreds of acquisitions. Many of these deals violate the Clayton Act, Section 7, which prohibits mergers and acquisitions where the effect \"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\"</p><p>Think Google's acquisitions of Android, YouTube, AdMob and DoubleClick, and Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Like the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act's intent has been subverted by misguided case law.</p><p>Even though antitrust doctrine has gone off the rails, regulators cannot give up. They should bring the strongest cases possible, as court victories can help correct antitrust precedent. Losses can only do so much damage to already-crippled statutes. And Congress should also step in and fix bad court decisions so that the antitrust laws can work for all of us again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20181221big-tech-facebook-google-amazon-microsoft-antitrust1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3V-FM01-JBPX-X0CY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1307\"/><timeReceived>10:34 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 21, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And a small but vocal coalition of parents and activists from across the political spectrum deride the term \"personalized learning\" as an Orwellian misnomer for replacing teachers with digital devices and data-mining software.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such resistance is probably not surprising.</p><p>When any new educational strategy receives money and attention, questions arise. Like other efforts to improve U.S. schools, personalized learning is getting swept up in decades-long disagreements over how children learn, the proper role of teachers, and who gets to decide how public education is organized.</p><p>But personalized learning also faces some unique challenges. The biggest is <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/10/22/09pl-overview.h34.html\">lack of clarity</url> around what the term actually means.</p><p>In general, personalized-learning models seek to adapt the pace of learning and the instructional strategies being used to best fit each individual child's strengths, weaknesses, and interests. In the digital age, realizing these goals is often seen as dependent on technology&amp;#x2014;to help measure in real-time what each student knows; to develop \"learner profiles\"; and to help match each child with customized learning experiences and \"playlists.\"</p><p>In practice, though, \"personalized learning\" is used to describe everything from supplemental software programs to whole-school redesigns.</p><p>As a result, the term has become a blank slate on to which supporters and skeptics alike project their own hopes, fears, and beliefs.</p><p>To help K-12 educators and policymakers consider personalized learning from every angle, Education Week is taking a close look at the perspectives of critics like Tiffany Dunn, a veteran teacher in Kentucky's 101,000-student Jefferson County school system whose strongly held concerns broadly reflect the worries of other opponents.</p><p>\"This whole thing is coming from the tech industry, which doesn't understand that what kids need is someone to love them and get excited about them,\" Dunn said. \"I'm not aware of any research that says sticking a child in front of a computer for hours on end does them any good.\"</p><p>Do such arguments hold weight? How do proponents respond? What do third-party experts say?</p><p>What follows is a breakdown of the three main critiques leveled against personalized learning.</p><h>Argument#1: The Hype Outweighs the Research</h><p/><p>No one has studied personalized learning more closely than the RAND Corporation.</p><p>And RAND is unambiguous about <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2017/07/personalized_learning_research_implementation_RAND.html\">what its research shows</url>.</p><p>\"The evidence base is very weak at this point,\" said John F. Pane, a senior scientist and the group's distinguished chair in education innovation.</p><p>Still, the hype around personalized learning has continued to grow. Take, for example, Facebook's <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg. </nameText></person>Along with his wife, pediatrician Priscilla Chan, the founder of the giant social-networking company plans to use his <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/06/29/chan-zuckerberg-to-push-ambitious-new-vision-for.html\">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to invest billions of dollars</url> into personalized-learning efforts. Zuckerberg regularly articulates his goal of \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104055333186581\">personalizing education for every student.</url>\"</p><p>Such lofty ambition is common throughout the ed-tech industry. Dozens of companies now tout a wide range of software, platforms, and apps as transformative tools for personalizing student learning.</p><p>Schools are buying in: <url normalizedValue=\"https://marketbrief.edweek.org/exclusive-data/breaking-down-k-12-leaders-personalized-learning-priorities/\">97 percent of district leaders</url> surveyed by the Education Week Research Center last year indicated that their districts had invested in some form of personalized learning.</p><p>Proponents say it would be a mistake to dismiss all those efforts as misguided, or not based on any evidence at all.</p><p>For one thing, RAND has found <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/10/19/personalized-learning-what-does-the-research-say.html\">early signs</url> that some comprehensive, whole-school personalized learning models yield modest student achievement gains.</p><p>And at its heart, said Richard Culatta, the CEO of the International Society for Technology in Education, personalized learning is about giving students control over their own learning; differentiating instruction for each child; and providing real-time feedback. <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.summitlearning.org/2017/09/science-of-summit-student-outcomes/\">Plenty of research</url> supports each of those strategies.</p><p>What's new about contemporary versions of personalized learning, Culatta maintained, is the use of technology to bring those individual approaches together into a coherent whole. What's happening now should be understood as research-and-development, with many experiments taking place at once, Culatta said.</p><p>How can K-12 educators and policymakers make sense of such a confusing, evolving landscape?</p><p>Louis Gomez has some ideas.</p><p>An education professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, Gomez studies the ways technology initiatives play out inside school systems.</p><p>The reality, he said, is that many schools purchase off-the-shelf software and call it \"personalized learning,\" without being able to say what is supposed to change in the classroom. And even when schools do take a broader view, they often fail to recognize that success depends largely on decisions that educators and administrators make on the ground.</p><p>That's in part because many versions of personalized learning seek to change or replace fundamental processes that shape the day-to-day life of schools&amp;#x2014;everything from how teachers prepare lessons to how students are graded.</p><p>Inevitably, Gomez said, that causes tension.</p><p>RAND's research, for example, has consistently found that even in the best-supported personalized-learning schools, teachers frequently say there's not enough time to truly tailor the learning experience to each child.</p><p>Does that mean that schools should ditch the personalized-learning experiments?</p><p>No, Gomez, Culatta, and the RAND researchers agree. There's real reason to be excited.</p><p>But it's OK to wait for more and better evidence, they said. If you do plunge in, be sure the initial stakes for failure are low, and build in opportunities to learn.</p><p>\"I would not advise schools to dump massive resources into going fully into personalized learning,\" said Laura S. Hamilton, the associate director of RAND Education. \"Experiment with some new approaches that might be a good fit for your particular school or district, but monitor it very closely.\"</p><h>Argument #2: Personalized Learning is Bad for Teachers and Students</h><p/><p>Every student is a unique combination of individual skills, abilities, and preferences, writes Todd Rose in <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.toddrose.com/endofaverage/\">The End of Average</url>, which has become a kind of bible for the personalized-learning movement. Therefore, trying to peg each child's learning experiences to some notion of what is typical for most children is both misguided and harmful.</p><p>Instead, many personalized-learning proponents suggest, schools should leverage technology to expand the benefits of good one-to-one human tutoring. By pursuing that vision, personalized learning can help children develop the skills, purpose, and passion to not only learn content and skills, but to think critically and build relationships, said Diane Tavenner, the CEO of California's Summit Public Schools charter network.</p><p>\"Here's what I consistently hear,\" said Tavenner, describing her interactions with the thousands of educators across the country receiving training on Summit's technology platform and instructional model (which were developed with support from <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2016/03/facebook_summit_PLP_software.html\">Facebook</url> and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.) \"They say, 'This lets me be the teacher I've always wanted to be.'\"</p><p>But many experts, from across the political and pedagogical spectrum, aren't sure they buy it.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/blogs/personalized/\">sharpest critiques</url> have come from progressives like Alfie Kohn, the author of Schooling Beyond Measure.</p><p>\"It's behaviorism on a screen,\" Kohn said of personalized learning.</p><p>Here's what he means:</p><p>First, many critics believe that personalized learning boils down to kids working alone on software, an approach they say ignores the crucial social aspects of learning and reduces teachers to the role of \"facilitators.\"</p><p>Because so many different approaches get labeled as \"personalized learning,\" it's hard to say how often that really happens. In the schools RAND is studying, the researchers describe such practices as relatively rare.</p><p>But in August, the Silicon Schools Fund, which provides millions of dollars to leading personalized-learning networks, released a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siliconschools.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/All-That-Weve-Learned-Silicon-Schools-Fund-1.pdf\">report describing lessons</url> learned during five years supporting the field. Among the concerns were \"schools that were often very quiet,\" because \"students were head-down, working on their computers at their exact level.\" Now, the fund says, most of the groups it supports are trying to reduce the time students spend alone on computers to 20 to 40 percent of the school day.</p><p>On a deeper level, Kohn and some other progressive educators believe that real learning happens when students are driven by their intrinsic curiosity to pursue answers to their own questions about the world. By contrast, Kohn said, much of what's marketed as \"personalized learning\" amounts to little more than breaking knowledge and ideas down into \"itty-bitty parts,\" then using extrinsic rewards to \"march kids through a series of decontextualized skills they had no meaningful role in choosing.\"</p><p>Some conservative education-policy experts raise similar concerns.</p><p>Michael Petrilli, for example, is the head of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute. Like Kohn, he worries that some versions of personalized learning encourage a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://edexcellence.net/articles/dont-let-personalized-learning-become-the-processed-food-of-education\">reductionist type of education</url>\" that \"breaks learning into little bits and scraps and bytes of disparate skills, disconnected from an inspiring, coherent whole.\" That tendency is particularly troublesome in the early grades and in subjects other than math, he said.</p><p>But while Kohn worries that personalized learning doesn't give students enough control over their learning, Petrilli fears the opposite.</p><p>It's already hard enough to ensure that all students are held to challenging standards and offered rigorous curriculum, he said. Personalized learning's emphasis on offering different content and paths to each student could open the door for watered-down expectations, greater inequities, and more difficulty holding schools accountable.</p><p>Tavenner, of Summit Public Schools, described both critiques as \"legitimate\"&amp;#x2014;but only in those cases where personalized learning is solely about helping students efficiently master discrete information and skills.</p><p>That's not the case at Summit, Tavenner maintained. She said the strongest personalized-learning models offer the best of what both conservatives and progressives want: high-quality standards and content for students, with opportunities to apply that knowledge via self-directed projects, all supplemented by human mentors and technology tools that help students keep track of their own learning.</p><p>Do such claims hold up to outside scrutiny?</p><p>There's not yet any definitive answer. But Stanford University professor Larry Cuban, a long-time ed-tech skeptic, recently <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/02/08/ed-tech-skeptic-larry-cuban-finds-new-perspective.html\">spent a year observing</url> classrooms at Summit and other personalized-learning schools in Silicon Valley. Cuban said he was surprised to find \"meaningful, incremental improvements in how teachers organize and teach a lesson\"&amp;#x2014;but not the kind of revolutionary new model of education that Tavenner describes.</p><p>Overall, the personalized-learning field is still marked by significant unresolved pedagogical tensions, said Benjamin Riley, the executive director of the nonprofit Deans for Impact, which seeks to improve teacher preparation. Among the biggest: the appropriate role for software in the classroom, how much autonomy is best for student learning, and the challenge of maintaining high standards and social interaction when every student is pursuing his or her own path.</p><p>Too often, Riley said, proponents gloss over such concerns.</p><p>\"There are tradeoffs here, and we at least need to acknowledge them,\" he said.</p><h>Argument #3: Big Tech + Big Data= Big Problems</h><p/><p>Finally, many critics are worried that \"personalized learning\" is cover for an aggressive push by the tech industry to turn K-12 education into a giant data-mining enterprise.</p><p>For parents and activists like Karen Effrem, that belief provokes intense fear and anger. \"We're sacrificing our children's privacy, and we're allowing corporations to make potentially life-changing decisions about our kids, all for technology that doesn't actually help them,\" said Effrem, the president of Education Liberty Watch, an advocacy organization that supports parents' right to control their children's education.</p><p>Evaluating such critiques can be difficult. The proprietary technical engines that drive the personalized-learning movement are largely black boxes, inaccessible to public inspection.</p><p>What is clear, though, is student data are the fuel that makes many of those systems go.</p><p>Just listen to Bharat Mediratta, a former Google engineer who helped launch personalized-learning pioneer AltSchool, which aims to harvest information about students via everything from classroom cameras to computer keystrokes.</p><p>\"First, we need to generate the big data,\" Mediratta <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/01/13/the-future-of-big-data-and-analytics.html\">told Education Week last year</url>. \"Then, we start figuring out how to use it to transform education.\"</p><p>Writ large, that philosophy has prompted worry about the sheer volume of information collected from children in school, especially amid the recent push to better understand students' behaviors, feelings, and mindsets.</p><p>Security and privacy are also front-of-mind: Just this spring, for example, popular digital-learning platform <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2017/05/ed-tech_platform_edmodo_hacked_ad_tracking.html\">Edmodo was hacked</url>, resulting in the personal information of an estimated 77 million users being put up for sale on an unregulated part of the internet.</p><p>And many <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/04/19/algorithmic-bias-a-rising-concern-for-k-12.html\">critics worry that algorithms</url> are increasingly being used to make key decisions shaping children's futures, without any real way for students and parents to understand how those choices are made, or challenge them for possible errors or biases.</p><p>Personalized-learning proponents generally acknowledge such fears as legitimate, suggesting they can be solved through dialogue and better regulation.</p><p>\"As we in the tech world get closer to having a better picture of each student at any given point in time, all of these discussions about data and privacy need to continue,\" said Kristen DiCerbo, the vice president of education research at global publishing giant Pearson. \"It's not too late.\"</p><p>But some critics say that stance presumes that more data-driven personalization in education is both desirable and inevitable, so long as the wrinkles can be ironed out.</p><p>K-12 educators and policymakers should question the forces driving that narrative, said Audrey Watters, an independent researcher who maintains the popular Hack Education blog.</p><p>The push for more personalized learning isn't happening in a vacuum, Watters maintained. The movement is emerging from the values and technologies that already define Silicon Valley. And it's clear how the companies behind those systems operate.</p><p>\"When Facebook promises personalization,\" Watters said, \"it's really about massive data collection.\"</p><p>In the consumer sector, critics say, the downsides of that approach are only now becoming evident, after the technologies have already been deployed at enormous scale.</p><p>Facebook, for example, has recently come under fire for its role in creating \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble\">filter bubbles</url>,\" in which users only see information determined by algorithms to fit with their existing preferences. Critics also decry the ways the company has reportedly sought to identify and manipulate users' emotions, including a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/01/facebook-advertising-data-insecure-teens\">report last May</url> that it had told some advertisers it could identify when teenagers feel \"insecure\" and \"worthless.\"</p><p>And Facebook is one of several tech giants currently in hot water over the way its platform was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/us/politics/facebook-twitter-google-hearings-congress.html?_r=0\">apparently misused</url> in the run-up to the recent presidential election. Mounting evidence suggests foreign actors targeted unwitting Americans with personalized ads and misinformation designed to influence their voting behavior&amp;#x2014;a problem made possible by the extensive data that Facebook collects from users, and by the lack of public visibility into the customized information that each user receives. In late September, Zuckerberg, the company's CEO,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/10/01/mark-zuckerberg-apologizes-for-the-ways-my-work-was-used-to-divide-people/?utm_term=.0ec41889ce9a\">apologized</url> for \"the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together.\"</p><p>Is it crazy to worry there could be similar unintended, unanticipated outcomes if personalized learning systems spread rapidly throughout K-12?</p><p>There are key differences between the consumer side of Silicon Valley and the work happening in education, according to Jim Shelton, the president of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's education division. Most groups trying to bring personalized-learning technologies to public schools aren't seeking exponential annual growth, Shelton said.</p><p>While CZI has given millions of dollars to AltSchool and its big-data-driven approach, the initiative is also supporting models like Summit, which says it avoids algorithmic recommendations and targeting in its platform. And as leaders like Zuckerberg bring their technologies, skills, and experiences into the K-12 arena, Shelton said, they face the burden of demonstrating that the products and approaches they support actually help children learn and grow.</p><p>Facebook and CZI \"may be related, but they are not the same,\" Shelton said. \"Being deliberate, being humble, and taking a posture of learning are all ways we're trying to be responsible as we do this work.\"</p><p>Still, educators and the public would be foolish to not carefully consider the tech sector's influence in public schools, especially given its recent stumbles, said Ben Williamson, a lecturer at the University of Stirling in the United Kingdom who studies big data in education.</p><p>Billions of public dollars are at stake, he said. So are big questions about the fundamental nature of schooling: How do we believe children learn? Who should decide what students need to know and get to experience? How will we determine what they've learned?</p><p>\"We need to open up a bigger debate about whether we really want Silicon Valley establishing this new model of data-driven schooling,\" Williamson said. \"These are people whose vision for reforming public education puts their own industry in charge.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDWEEK-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDWEEK2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R0P-6411-F09T-N2D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313401</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3088\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Editorial Projects in Education, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Education Week</publicationName><volume>Vol. 37</volume><issueNumber>No. 12</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 8, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0005O62</classCode><className>RAND CORP</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>articles</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>collections/personalized-learning</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>topics/curriculumandinstruction</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>print/37/12</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>topics/business_tech_innovation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>topics/achievementgap</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>special-report</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>topics/technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>topics/assessment-accountability-achievement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Carnegie Foundation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EWgraphical</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ewphoto</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ewspecial report</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Personal Data</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>personalized learning</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Personalized Learning: Vision vs. Reality Series</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>privacy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

States from Florida to Vermont have adopted supportive laws and policies. And school districts across the country are embracing this emerging education trend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as \"personalized learning\" takes root, it's also coming under greater scrutiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leading researchers say their work does not support the most enthusiastic claims being made by personalized-learning supporters. Education experts are raising questions about implications for teaching and learning. Tech-industry critics are sounding alarms about Silicon Valley's growing influence over public schools. And a small but vocal coalition of parents and activists from across the political spectrum deride the term \"personalized learning\" as an Orwellian misnomer for replacing teachers with digital devices and data-mining software.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such resistance is probably not surprising.</p><p>When any new educational strategy receives money and attention, questions arise. Like other efforts to improve U.S. schools, personalized learning is getting swept up in decades-long disagreements over how children learn, the proper role of teachers, and who gets to decide how public education is organized.</p><p>But personalized learning also faces some unique challenges. The biggest is lack of clarity around what the term actually means.</p><p>In general, personalized-learning models seek to adapt the pace of learning and the instructional strategies being used to best fit each individual child's strengths, weaknesses, and interests. In the digital age, realizing these goals is often seen as dependent on technology--to help measure in real-time what each student knows; to develop \"learner profiles\"; and to help match each child with customized learning experiences and \"playlists.\"</p><p>In practice, though, \"personalized learning\" is used to describe everything from supplemental software programs to whole-school redesigns.</p><p>As a result, the term has become a blank slate on to which supporters and skeptics alike project their own hopes, fears, and beliefs.</p><p>To help K-12 educators and policymakers consider personalized learning from every angle, Education Week is taking a close look at the perspectives of critics like Tiffany Dunn, a veteran teacher in Kentucky's 101,000-student Jefferson County school system whose strongly held concerns broadly reflect the worries of other opponents.</p><p>\"This whole thing is coming from the tech industry, which doesn't understand that what kids need is someone to love them and get excited about them,\" Dunn said. \"I'm not aware of any research that says sticking a child in front of a computer for hours on end does them any good.\"</p><p>Do such arguments hold weight? How do proponents respond? What do third-party experts say?</p><p>What follows is a breakdown of the three main critiques leveled against personalized learning.</p><p>Argument#1: The Hype Outweighs the Research</p><p>No one has studied personalized learning more closely than the RAND Corporation.</p><p>And RAND is unambiguous about what its research shows.</p><p>\"The evidence base is very weak at this point,\" said John F. Pane, a senior scientist and the group's distinguished chair in education innovation.</p><p>Still, the hype around personalized learning has continued to grow. Take, for example, Facebook's <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg. </nameText></person>Along with his wife, pediatrician Priscilla Chan, the founder of the giant social-networking company plans to use his Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to invest billions of dollars into personalized-learning efforts. Zuckerberg regularly articulates his goal of \"personalizing education for every student.\"</p><p>Such lofty ambition is common throughout the ed-tech industry. Dozens of companies now tout a wide range of software, platforms, and apps as transformative tools for personalizing student learning.</p><p>Schools are buying in: 97 percent of district leaders surveyed by the Education Week Research Center last year indicated that their districts had invested in some form of personalized learning.</p><p>Proponents say it would be a mistake to dismiss all those efforts as misguided, or not based on any evidence at all.</p><p>For one thing, RAND has found early signs that some comprehensive, whole-school personalized learning models yield modest student achievement gains.</p><p>And at its heart, said Richard Culatta, the CEO of the International Society for Technology in Education, personalized learning is about giving students control over their own learning; differentiating instruction for each child; and providing real-time feedback. Plenty of research supports each of those strategies.</p><p>What's new about contemporary versions of personalized learning, Culatta maintained, is the use of technology to bring those individual approaches together into a coherent whole. What's happening now should be understood as research-and-development, with many experiments taking place at once, Culatta said.</p><p>How can K-12 educators and policymakers make sense of such a confusing, evolving landscape?</p><p>Louis Gomez has some ideas.</p><p>An education professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, Gomez studies the ways technology initiatives play out inside school systems.</p><p>The reality, he said, is that many schools purchase off-the-shelf software and call it \"personalized learning,\" without being able to say what is supposed to change in the classroom. And even when schools do take a broader view, they often fail to recognize that success depends largely on decisions that educators and administrators make on the ground.</p><p>That's in part because many versions of personalized learning seek to change or replace fundamental processes that shape the day-to-day life of schools--everything from how teachers prepare lessons to how students are graded.</p><p>Inevitably, Gomez said, that causes tension.</p><p>RAND's research, for example, has consistently found that even in the best-supported personalized-learning schools, teachers frequently say there's not enough time to truly tailor the learning experience to each child.</p><p>Does that mean that schools should ditch the personalized-learning experiments?</p><p>No, Gomez, Culatta, and the RAND researchers agree. There's real reason to be excited.</p><p>But it's OK to wait for more and better evidence, they said. If you do plunge in, be sure the initial stakes for failure are low, and build in opportunities to learn.</p><p>\"I would not advise schools to dump massive resources into going fully into personalized learning,\" said Laura S. Hamilton, the associate director of RAND Education. \"Experiment with some new approaches that might be a good fit for your particular school or district, but monitor it very closely.\"</p><p>Argument #2: Personalized Learning is Bad for Teachers and Students</p><p>Every student is a unique combination of individual skills, abilities, and preferences, writes Todd Rose in The End of Average, which has become a kind of bible for the personalized-learning movement. Therefore, trying to peg each child's learning experiences to some notion of what is typical for most children is both misguided and harmful.</p><p>Instead, many personalized-learning proponents suggest, schools should leverage technology to expand the benefits of good one-to-one human tutoring. By pursuing that vision, personalized learning can help children develop the skills, purpose, and passion to not only learn content and skills, but to think critically and build relationships, said Diane Tavenner, the CEO of California's Summit Public Schools charter network.</p><p>\"Here's what I consistently hear,\" said Tavenner, describing her interactions with the thousands of educators across the country receiving training on Summit's technology platform and instructional model (which were developed with support from Facebook and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.) \"They say, 'This lets me be the teacher I've always wanted to be.'\"</p><p>But many experts, from across the political and pedagogical spectrum, aren't sure they buy it.</p><p>The sharpest critiques have come from progressives like Alfie Kohn, the author of Schooling Beyond Measure.</p><p>\"It's behaviorism on a screen,\" Kohn said of personalized learning.</p><p>Here's what he means:</p><p>First, many critics believe that personalized learning boils down to kids working alone on software, an approach they say ignores the crucial social aspects of learning and reduces teachers to the role of \"facilitators.\"</p><p>Because so many different approaches get labeled as \"personalized learning,\" it's hard to say how often that really happens. In the schools RAND is studying, the researchers describe such practices as relatively rare.</p><p>But in August, the Silicon Schools Fund, which provides millions of dollars to leading personalized-learning networks, released a report describing lessons learned during five years supporting the field. Among the concerns were \"schools that were often very quiet,\" because \"students were head-down, working on their computers at their exact level.\" Now, the fund says, most of the groups it supports are trying to reduce the time students spend alone on computers to 20 to 40 percent of the school day.</p><p>On a deeper level, Kohn and some other progressive educators believe that real learning happens when students are driven by their intrinsic curiosity to pursue answers to their own questions about the world. By contrast, Kohn said, much of what's marketed as \"personalized learning\" amounts to little more than breaking knowledge and ideas down into \"itty-bitty parts,\" then using extrinsic rewards to \"march kids through a series of decontextualized skills they had no meaningful role in choosing.\"</p><p>Some conservative education-policy experts raise similar concerns.</p><p>Michael Petrilli, for example, is the head of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute. Like Kohn, he worries that some versions of personalized learning encourage a \"reductionist type of education\" that \"breaks learning into little bits and scraps and bytes of disparate skills, disconnected from an inspiring, coherent whole.\" That tendency is particularly troublesome in the early grades and in subjects other than math, he said.</p><p>But while Kohn worries that personalized learning doesn't give students enough control over their learning, Petrilli fears the opposite.</p><p>It's already hard enough to ensure that all students are held to challenging standards and offered rigorous curriculum, he said. Personalized learning's emphasis on offering different content and paths to each student could open the door for watered-down expectations, greater inequities, and more difficulty holding schools accountable.</p><p>Tavenner, of Summit Public Schools, described both critiques as \"legitimate\"--but only in those cases where personalized learning is solely about helping students efficiently master discrete information and skills.</p><p>That's not the case at Summit, Tavenner maintained. She said the strongest personalized-learning models offer the best of what both conservatives and progressives want: high-quality standards and content for students, with opportunities to apply that knowledge via self-directed projects, all supplemented by human mentors and technology tools that help students keep track of their own learning.</p><p>Do such claims hold up to outside scrutiny?</p><p>There's not yet any definitive answer. But Stanford University professor Larry Cuban, a long-time ed-tech skeptic, recently spent a year observing classrooms at Summit and other personalized-learning schools in Silicon Valley. Cuban said he was surprised to find \"meaningful, incremental improvements in how teachers organize and teach a lesson\"--but not the kind of revolutionary new model of education that Tavenner describes.</p><p>Overall, the personalized-learning field is still marked by significant unresolved pedagogical tensions, said Benjamin Riley, the executive director of the nonprofit Deans for Impact, which seeks to improve teacher preparation. Among the biggest: the appropriate role for software in the classroom, how much autonomy is best for student learning, and the challenge of maintaining high standards and social interaction when every student is pursuing his or her own path.</p><p>Too often, Riley said, proponents gloss over such concerns.</p><p>\"There are tradeoffs here, and we at least need to acknowledge them,\" he said.</p><p>Argument #3: Big Tech + Big Data= Big Problems</p><p>Finally, many critics are worried that \"personalized learning\" is cover for an aggressive push by the tech industry to turn K-12 education into a giant data-mining enterprise.</p><p>For parents and activists like Karen Effrem, that belief provokes intense fear and anger. \"We're sacrificing our children's privacy, and we're allowing corporations to make potentially life-changing decisions about our kids, all for technology that doesn't actually help them,\" said Effrem, the president of Education Liberty Watch, an advocacy organization that supports parents' right to control their children's education.</p><p>Evaluating such critiques can be difficult. The proprietary technical engines that drive the personalized-learning movement are largely black boxes, inaccessible to public inspection.</p><p>What is clear, though, is student data are the fuel that makes many of those systems go.</p><p>Just listen to Bharat Mediratta, a former Google engineer who helped launch personalized-learning pioneer AltSchool, which aims to harvest information about students via everything from classroom cameras to computer keystrokes.</p><p>\"First, we need to generate the big data,\" Mediratta told Education Week last year. \"Then, we start figuring out how to use it to transform education.\"</p><p>Writ large, that philosophy has prompted worry about the sheer volume of information collected from children in school, especially amid the recent push to better understand students' behaviors, feelings, and mindsets.</p><p>Security and privacy are also front-of-mind: Just this spring, for example, popular digital-learning platform Edmodo was hacked, resulting in the personal information of an estimated 77 million users being put up for sale on an unregulated part of the internet.</p><p>And many critics worry that algorithms are increasingly being used to make key decisions shaping children's futures, without any real way for students and parents to understand how those choices are made, or challenge them for possible errors or biases.</p><p>Personalized-learning proponents generally acknowledge such fears as legitimate, suggesting they can be solved through dialogue and better regulation.</p><p>\"As we in the tech world get closer to having a better picture of each student at any given point in time, all of these discussions about data and privacy need to continue,\" said Kristen DiCerbo, the vice president of education research at global publishing giant Pearson. \"It's not too late.\"</p><p>But some critics say that stance presumes that more data-driven personalization in education is both desirable and inevitable, so long as the wrinkles can be ironed out.</p><p>K-12 educators and policymakers should question the forces driving that narrative, said Audrey Watters, an independent researcher who maintains the popular Hack Education blog.</p><p>The push for more personalized learning isn't happening in a vacuum, Watters maintained. The movement is emerging from the values and technologies that already define Silicon Valley. And it's clear how the companies behind those systems operate.</p><p>\"When Facebook promises personalization,\" Watters said, \"it's really about massive data collection.\"</p><p>In the consumer sector, critics say, the downsides of that approach are only now becoming evident, after the technologies have already been deployed at enormous scale.</p><p>Facebook, for example, has recently come under fire for its role in creating \"filter bubbles,\" in which users only see information determined by algorithms to fit with their existing preferences. Critics also decry the ways the company has reportedly sought to identify and manipulate users' emotions, including a report last May that it had told some advertisers it could identify when teenagers feel \"insecure\" and \"worthless.\"</p><p>And Facebook is one of several tech giants currently in hot water over the way its platform was apparently misused in the run-up to the recent presidential election. Mounting evidence suggests foreign actors targeted unwitting Americans with personalized ads and misinformation designed to influence their voting behavior--a problem made possible by the extensive data that Facebook collects from users, and by the lack of public visibility into the customized information that each user receives. In late September, Zuckerberg, the company's CEO, apologized for \"the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together.\"</p><p>Is it crazy to worry there could be similar unintended, unanticipated outcomes if personalized learning systems spread rapidly throughout K-12?</p><p>There are key differences between the consumer side of Silicon Valley and the work happening in education, according to Jim Shelton, the president of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's education division. Most groups trying to bring personalized-learning technologies to public schools aren't seeking exponential annual growth, Shelton said.</p><p>While CZI has given millions of dollars to AltSchool and its big-data-driven approach, the initiative is also supporting models like Summit, which says it avoids algorithmic recommendations and targeting in its platform. And as leaders like Zuckerberg bring their technologies, skills, and experiences into the K-12 arena, Shelton said, they face the burden of demonstrating that the products and approaches they support actually help children learn and grow.</p><p>Facebook and CZI \"may be related, but they are not the same,\" Shelton said. \"Being deliberate, being humble, and taking a posture of learning are all ways we're trying to be responsible as we do this work.\"</p><p>Still, educators and the public would be foolish to not carefully consider the tech sector's influence in public schools, especially given its recent stumbles, said Ben Williamson, a lecturer at the University of Stirling in the United Kingdom who studies big data in education.</p><p>Billions of public dollars are at stake, he said. So are big questions about the fundamental nature of schooling: How do we believe children learn? Who should decide what students need to know and get to experience? How will we determine what they've learned?</p><p>\"We need to open up a bigger debate about whether we really want Silicon Valley establishing this new model of data-driven schooling,\" Williamson said. \"These are people whose vision for reforming public education puts their own industry in charge.\"</p><p>Coverage of trends in K-12 innovation and efforts to put these new ideas and approaches into practice in schools, districts, and classrooms is supported in part by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.carnegie.org\">www.carnegie.org</url>.

ISPs.\u00a0 Not for Big Tech companies \u2013 Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net Neutrality mandates ISPs deliver every bit of data they handle \u2013 neutrally.\u00a0 They can show no preference for any data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Tech companies \u2013 are nigh all Leftist.\u00a0 So of course, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and more \u2013 have all long publicly professed their desire to see government regulate ISPs in Net Neutrality\u2019s heavy-handed fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because why not?\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh: And Big Tech wants Net Neutrality for ISPs \u2013 because it is a HUGE government crony gift to Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net Neutrality outlaws ISPs from charging Big Tech for the MASSIVE amounts of bandwidth they use.\u00a0 So you and I would pay dramatically more for Internet access \u2013 as a giant subsidy to Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, by the way, is what Big Tech is trying to get away with \u2013 with privacy legislation.\u00a0 They are pushing for law \u2013 that &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; regulates ISPs\u2019 very minimal use of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, many Big Tech companies\u2019 entire business model is collecting our data \u2013 and selling access to it.\u00a0 Google (Market Cap: $979 billion) and Facebook (Market Cap: $653 billion) got that incredibly huge \u2013 just with our data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the privacy law Big Tech seeks \u2013 and is in some cases is getting \u2013 doesn\u2019t apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are these Big Tech companies any less hypocritical when it comes to neutrally delivering our data?</p><p>\u00a0 Heavens no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Tech constantly warps what we see.\u00a0 And they do so for commercial \u2013 and political \u2013 reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week we were mass-fed by Big Media:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;T; Violates Net Neutrality Principles With HBO Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;T; Ignores Net Neutrality: HBO Max Won\u2019t Hit Data Caps but Competing Streamers Will&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senators Criticize AT&amp;T; for Not Counting HBO Max Toward Data Caps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;T; owns HBO Max.\u00a0 So AT&amp;T; is offering its customers a break on HBO Max \u2013 to hopefully get more customers for HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;T; is honest and forthright about their preference for their other service.\u00a0 It\u2019s right there in their data cap exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh: And of course \u2013 this is something companies in every economic sector on Earth do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would anyone be shocked to discover Virgin Airlines \u2013 offering discounts on Virgin Hotels?\u00a0 Should we be angry?\u00a0 Should the government ban them from doing it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net Neutrality-pushing Google \u2013 does exactly what AT&amp;T; is doing.\u00a0 Only MUCH less honestly and forthrightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google DOMINATES Web searches in the United States.\u00a0 91.54% of US Web searches \u2013 are Google searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Google secretly, surreptitiously warps your Search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you get \u2013 is not a pristine, unfiltered look at what\u2019s happening on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you get \u2013 is what Google wants you to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How very non-Net Neutral of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google warps your Search results \u2013 for commercial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Manipulates Search Results, According to Study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe study presents evidence that the search giant sets out to hamper competitors and limit consumers\u2019 options\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2018The main surprising and shocking realization is that Google is not presenting its best product. In fact, it\u2019s presenting a version of the product that\u2019s degraded and intentionally worse for consumers.\u2019\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And oh-sweet-irony\u2026:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe paper was authored by Tim Wu.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Wu \u2013 is the guy who created the concept of Net Neutrality.\u00a0 And was \u2013 with Google \u2013 amongst the leading pushers of it upon ISPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Google warps your Search results \u2013 for political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have many allegedly center-right defenders of Big Tech \u2013 claiming Big Tech bias against conservatives has not yet been proven.\u00a0 They are either really unintelligent \u2013 or profoundly corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Execs Panic! Go Into Hiding \u2013 Delete Social Media Accounts After James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Latest Expos\u00e9:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOne aspect of the report features undercover footage of longtime Google employee and Head of Responsible Innovation,\u00a0Jen Gennai, saying Google has been working diligently to \u2018prevent\u2019 the results of the 2016 election from repeating in 2020, meaning they are actively engaging in election meddling and working to elect someone from the Democratic Party\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cJen Gennai, the Google executive caught on video bragging that \u2018Congress can pressure us but we\u2019re not changing,\u2019 panicked, deleted her Twitter account and made her Instagram \u2018private.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cGaurav Gite, the Google engineer revealing the tech giant\u2019s actions to manipulate its algorithms based on its own definition of \u2018fairness,\u2019 has deleted his Facebook page\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe expos\u00e9 was so damaging that Google-YouTube deleted Project Veritas\u2019 video exposing the tech giant\u2019s electioneering.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing says \u201cWe\u2019re not censoring\u201d \u2013 like Big Tech censoring.\u00a0 Their exposers \u2013 and even themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And speaking of a complete lack of self-awareness\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter Rejects Ad Campaign for Net Neutrality Tweet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cRandolph May said Twitter rejected his effort to promote a tweet (below) associated with his FSF Perspective: \u2018Don\u2019t Regulate the Internet as a Public Utility.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2018I decided to spend $50 to promote the tweet further \u2014something I\u2019ve only done 2-3 times in 10 years\u2026.[T]o my surprise, Twitter rejected it as \u201cpolitical.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2018This is the same Twitter\u2026which proclaims vociferously it favors \u201cnet neutrality.\u201d I guess the neutrality doesn\u2019t apply to tweets opposing its net neutrality position!\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAccording to Twitter\u2019s ad policy, it \u2018prohibits the promotion of political content,\u2019\u00a0 which includes ads that contain \u2018advocacy for or against regulation.\u2019\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never mind the fact Twitter has spent more than a dozen years \u2013 shoving Net Neutrality down our throats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter Joins Pro-Net Neutrality \u2018Day of Action\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And from their own mouths:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Twitter Faves #NetNeutrality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Twitter will continue to do this\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2018Shadow Banning\u2019: How Twitter Secretly Censors Conservatives Without Them Even Knowing It:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThrough shadow banning, \u2018you have ultimate control,\u2019 said Abhinav Vadrevu, former Twitter software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2018The idea of a shadow ban is that you ban someone but they don\u2019t know they\u2019ve been banned, because they keep posting but no one sees their content. \u00a0So, they just think that no one is engaging with their content, when, in reality, no one is seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2018At the end of the day, no one else interacts,\u201d continues Vadrevu. \u00a0\u201cNo one else sees what you\u2019re doing. \u00a0So, all that data is just thrown away.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cConrado Miranda, a former Twitter engineer, says shadow banning is happening at Twitter, acknowledging that the procedure is often used to silence conservatives or Trump supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cVadrevu said, \u2018It\u2019s risky though.\u2019 \u00a0Why? \u2018Because people will figure that sh*t out, and be like \u2026 you know, it\u2019s a lot of bad press if, like, people figure out like you\u2019re shadow banning them. \u00a0It\u2019s like, unethical in some way.\u2019\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unethical \u2013 in SOME way?\u00a0 How about \u2013 it is unethical in every conceivable way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s bad enough when Twitter actually bans conservatives.\u00a0 They don\u2019t make an announcement they\u2019ve banned another conservative \u2013 you just one day realize you haven\u2019t see X or Y Tweeting in a while.\u00a0 But at least Twitter is not completely hiding their bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter shadow banning conservatives let\u2019s Twitter PRETEND to be Net Neutral \u2013 but not ACTUALLY be Net Neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s called lying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2018Twitter Is Part of the Problem\u2019: FCC Chairman Lambastes Company as Net-Neutrality Debate Draws Heat:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAjit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, blasted Twitter on\u00a0Tuesday for what he said was a push to \u2018discriminate\u2019 against conservatives, during an aggressive defense of his agency\u2019s plan to repeal net neutrality rules\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2018When it comes to a free and open Internet, Twitter is part of the problem,\u2019 Pai said. \u2018The company has a viewpoint and uses that viewpoint to discriminate.\u2019\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So of course: What Big Tech is doing \u2013 is a profound corruption of our political process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember all the crap we\u2019ve been fed about how important it is to prevent Russia from again interfering in our elections?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When in reality\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia Influenced 2016 U.S. Election With $100,000 Worth of Ads, According to Facebook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow \u2013 $100,000.\u00a0 In an election where $2 BILLION was spent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ain\u2019t nothing.\u00a0 Because math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Web-Search-dominating Google is \u201cworking diligently to \u2018prevent\u2019 the results of the 2016 election from repeating in 2020.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Twitter is shadow banning conservative speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a HUGE election interference problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it ain\u2019t Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Originally posted at RedState]&lt;/p&gt;

Not for Big Tech companies - Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, etc.Net Neutrality mandates ISPs deliver every bit of data they handle - neutrally. They can show no preference for any data.Big Tech companies - are nigh all Leftist. So of course, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and more - have all long publicly professed their desire to see government regulate ISPs in Net Neutrality's heavy-handed fashion.Because why not? It doesn't apply to them.Oh: And Big Tech wants Net Neutrality for ISPs - because it is a HUGE government crony gift to Big Tech.Net Neutrality outlaws ISPs from charging Big Tech for the MASSIVE amounts of bandwidth they use. </p><p>So you and I would pay dramatically more for Internet access - as a giant subsidy to Big Tech.This, by the way, is what Big Tech is trying to get away with - with privacy legislation. They are pushing for law - that only regulates ISPs' very minimal use of data.Meanwhile, many Big Tech companies' entire business model is collecting our data - and selling access to it. Google (Market Cap: $979 billion[2]) and Facebook (Market Cap: $653 billion[3]) got that incredibly huge - just with our data.And the privacy law Big Tech seeks - and is in some cases is getting - doesn't apply to them.Are these Big Tech companies any less hypocritical when it comes to neutrally delivering our data? Heavens no.Big Tech constantly warps what we see. And they do so for commercial - and political - reasons.Last week we were mass-fed by Big Media:AT&amp;#38;T Violates Net Neutrality Principles With HBO Max[4]AT&amp;#38;T Ignores Net Neutrality: HBO Max Won't Hit Data Caps but Competing Streamers Will[5]Senators Criticize AT&amp;#38;T for Not Counting HBO Max Toward Data Caps[6]AT&amp;#38;T owns HBO Max. So AT&amp;#38;T is offering its customers a break on HBO Max - to hopefully get more customers for HBO Max.AT&amp;#38;T is honest and forthright about their preference for their other service. It's right there in their data cap exemption.Oh: And of course - this is something companies in every economic sector on Earth do.Would anyone be shocked to discover Virgin Airlines[7] - offering discounts on Virgin Hotels[8]? Should we be angry? Should the government ban them from doing it?Of course not.Net Neutrality-pushing Google - does exactly what AT&amp;#38;T is doing. Only MUCH less honestly and forthrightly.Google DOMINATES Web searches in the United States. 91.54%[9] of US Web searches - are Google searches.And Google secretly, surreptitiously warps your Search results.What you get - is not a pristine, unfiltered look at what's happening on the Internet.What you get - is what Google wants you to see.How very non-Net Neutral of them.Google warps your Search results - for commercial reasons.Google Manipulates Search Results, According to Study[10]:'The study presents evidence that the search giant sets out to hamper competitors and limit consumers' options.'#8216;The main surprising and shocking realization is that Google is not presenting its best product. In fact, it's presenting a version of the product that's degraded and intentionally worse for consumers.''And oh-sweet-irony[11]:'The paper was authored by Tim Wu.'Tim Wu - is the guy who created the concept of Net Neutrality[12]. And was - with Google - amongst the leading pushers of it upon ISPs.And Google warps your Search results - for political reasons.We have many allegedly center-right defenders of Big Tech - claiming Big Tech bias against conservatives has not yet been proven. They are either really unintelligent - or profoundly corrupt.Google Execs Panic! Go Into Hiding - Delete Social Media Accounts After James O'Keefe's Latest Expos[13]:'One aspect of the report features undercover footage of longtime Google employee and Head of Responsible Innovation,Jen Gennai, saying Google has been working diligently to 'prevent' the results of the 2016 election from repeating in 2020, meaning they are actively engaging in election meddling and working to elect someone from the Democratic Party.'Jen Gennai, the Google executive caught on video bragging that 'Congress can pressure us but we're not changing,' panicked, deleted her Twitter account and made her Instagram 'private.''Gaurav Gite, the Google engineer revealing the tech giant's actions to manipulate its algorithms based on its own definition of 'fairness,' has deleted his Facebook page.'The expos was so damaging that Google-YouTube deleted Project Veritas' video exposing the tech giant's electioneering.'Nothing says 'We're not censoring' - like Big Tech censoring. Their exposers - and even themselves.And speaking of a complete lack of self-awareness.Twitter Rejects Ad Campaign for Net Neutrality Tweet[14]:'Randolph May said Twitter rejected his effort to promote a tweet (below) associated with his FSF Perspective: 'Don't Regulate the Internet as a Public Utility.''#8216;I decided to spend $50 to promote the tweet further \u2014something I've only done 2-3 times in 10 years.[T]o my surprise, Twitter rejected it as 'political.''#8216;This is the same Twitterwhich proclaims vociferously it favors 'net neutrality.' I guess the neutrality doesn't apply to tweets opposing its net neutrality position!''According to Twitter's ad policy, it 'prohibits the promotion of political content,' which includes ads that contain 'advocacy for or against regulation.''Never mind the fact Twitter has spent more than a dozen years - shoving Net Neutrality down our throats.Twitter Joins Pro-Net Neutrality 'Day of Action'[15]And from their own mouths:Why Twitter Faves #NetNeutrality[16]Of course, Twitter will continue to do this.'Shadow Banning': How Twitter Secretly Censors Conservatives Without Them Even Knowing It[17]:'Through shadow banning, 'you have ultimate control,' said Abhinav Vadrevu, former Twitter software engineer.'#8216;The idea of a shadow ban is that you ban someone but they don't know they've been banned, because they keep posting but no one sees their content. So, they just think that no one is engaging with their content, when, in reality, no one is seeing it.'#8216;At the end of the day, no one else interacts,' continues Vadrevu. 'No one else sees what you're doing. So, all that data is just thrown away.''Conrado Miranda, a former Twitter engineer, says shadow banning is happening at Twitter, acknowledging that the procedure is often used to silence conservatives or Trump supporters.'Vadrevu said, 'It's risky though.' Why? 'Because people will figure that sh*t out, and be like you know, it's a lot of bad press if, like, people figure out like you're shadow banning them. It's like, unethical in some way.''Unethical - in SOME way? How about - it is unethical in every conceivable way.It's bad enough when Twitter actually bans conservatives. They don't make an announcement they've banned another conservative - you just one day realize you haven't see X or Y Tweeting in a while. But at least Twitter is not completely hiding their bias.Twitter shadow banning conservatives let's Twitter PRETEND to be Net Neutral - but not ACTUALLY be Net Neutral.That's called lying.'Twitter Is Part of the Problem': FCC Chairman Lambastes Company as Net-Neutrality Debate Draws Heat[18]:'Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, blasted Twitter onTuesday for what he said was a push to 'discriminate' against conservatives, during an aggressive defense of his agency's plan to repeal net neutrality rules.'#8216;When it comes to a free and open Internet, Twitter is part of the problem,' Pai said. 'The company has a viewpoint and uses that viewpoint to discriminate.''So of course: What Big Tech is doing - is a profound corruption of our political process.Remember all the crap we've been fed about how important it is to prevent Russia from again interfering in our elections?When in reality.Russia Influenced 2016 U.S. Election With $100,000 Worth of Ads, According to Facebook[19]Wow - $100,000. In an election where $2 BILLION was spent.That ain't nothing. Because math.Meanwhile, Web-Search-dominating Google is 'working diligently to 'prevent' the results of the 2016 election from repeating in 2020.'And Twitter is shadow banning conservative speakers.We have a HUGE election interference problem.But it ain't Russia.It's Big Tech.[Originally posted at RedState][20] [ 1]: <url

At the same time, the digital revolution has upended how banks interact with and get to know their customers. But information remains crucial for banks, not least as it allows them to identify the best borrowers.</p><p>\"The value of Santander is data,\" she says. \"If you're my customer, I know you. It's the same as when you go to the local caf\u00e9 and they know if you want a latte or a macchiato.\"</p><p>However, while some parts of Santander's business struggle with net interest margins in the low single digits, she points out how net operating margins at big tech firms can be closer to triple digits. Part of the reason, according to Bot\u00c3\u00adn, is \"an uneven playing field\", especially on data.</p><p>People's lives have changed quickly and fundamentally \"\" try leaving home without your mobile phone \"\" in a situation analogous to the industrial revolution. Fair competition</p><p>\"Society has a problem as it is regulated in a way appropriate for the analogue era,\" she says. \"The bigger issue for everyone, including banks, is how we evolve the rules for a market economy that's digital \"\" and the answer should be based on one principle: fair competition. We do not have fair competition on regulation, on taxes, on competition rules.\"</p><p>Above all, transparency is vital.</p><p>\"In a market economy, you need competition and competition needs transparency,\" she says.</p><p>Banks have learnt the hard way that it is not enough to put the real economics of a commercial transaction in the small print.</p><p>This is partly why Bot\u00c3\u00adn thinks Silicon Valley, for all its success, can learn a lot from the struggles of banks about the dangers of pursuing profit without a deeper purpose. Like banks in the previous decade, big tech firms already face questions over how much tax they pay and where; the concentrations of wealth in particular cities; and the importance of sustaining trust.</p><p>The EU's open banking framework is an example of how banks suffer more onerous rules than big tech, as they are now obliged to share client data with third parties (if the customer agrees). However, the big social media platforms are under no obligation to make their data available to other companies, including banks, which might be able to use it to improve their products.</p><p>Payments companies owned by big tech firms can also get away with being less open than banks, according to Bot\u00c3\u00adn, and they are relatively free of the profit-depleting capital requirements that come with taking deposits and making loans.</p><p>\"Open banking is great as long as it's fair,\" she says. \"If you really want to do open banking, you need open data.\"</p><p>Bank-owned payment companies are relatively cheap for consumers, she argues, not just due to the fees but also because of what the big tech firms do with their payment clients' data. If banks are forced out of this business, competition would go down and prices will go up even further for the end user. Regulation</p><p>Bot\u00c3\u00adn accepts the regulation on capital, loans and deposits, although she is more hostile to the requirement for such high capital buffers for the most systemic banks.</p><p>\"We are not perfect; we make mistakes,\" she admits. \"But this is not an industry that's uncompetitive or has high barriers to entry, except in loans and taking deposits, which is not very profitable in Europe.\"</p><p>Technology, on the other hand, is increasingly uncompetitive, as the big firms swallow up-and-coming rivals or block them from their platforms, according to Bot\u00c3\u00adn.</p><p>\"Innovation is coming down,\" she complains.</p><p>The big tech firms' gaming of fiscal competition in Europe further riles Bot\u00c3\u00adn.</p><p>\"They pay too little tax and in the wrong place.\"</p><p>According to her, Santander's effective tax rate in Spain rose from 34% to 36% as the Spanish government shifted the burden of paying mortgage taxes onto the banks last year.</p><p>She speaks favourably of a destination tax-based framework, which would make it harder for firms to exploit tax havens, but says it is hard to realize as geopolitics gets entangled with the most powerful industry lobbies in the US and Europe to the detriment of Europe's banks.</p><p>\"Either they deregulate us, or they regulate them,\" she urges.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1fqs9qsn8x2dp</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHH-FJK1-F0GS-H177-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

He said he sees four main drivers over change over the next few years: customer expectations, tech, competition, and regulation. If banks don't pay attention to these trends, they risk becoming the next Blockbuster or Kodak, he said. </p><p>LONDON \u2014 The CEO of one of Britain's largest retail banks sees four big factors driving change across the financial services industry over the next few years: changing customers expectation, technological innovations, competition, and regulation. Lloyds CEO Antonio Horta Osorio gave a keynote speech entitled \"The Bank of the Future\" at Imperial University Business School's Future of Finance conference in London on Thursday. Lloyds is one of the so-called \"Big Four\" in the UK, with 30 million customers in the UK. The bank has a market cap of 47 billion ($67 billion). \"I see four main factors driving change for financial services over the next few years,\" Horta Osorio said. Here are the big change drivers he sees on the horizon: \"First, is customers' legitimate demand for a more personalised, efficient and frictionless service.\" Horta Osorio said the rise of digital services are changing customer expectations when it comes to banking. \"Today's customers have same-day delivery of books to their front door, box sets that download in seconds to their tablets, and a smartphone that offers near instantaneous updates on news that breaks on the other side of the planet,\" he said. \"So they increasingly want the same experience for their finances.\" If banks don't keep up, they risk becoming the next Blockbuster or Kodak, Horta Osorio warned. \"Secondly, technological innovations are making it increasingly possible for those demands to be met in a cost-effective way.\" Horta Osorio name-checked advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, and new innovations such as blockchain as holding immense promise for financial services. He predicted that financial innovation will see more technological innovation in the next 10 years than it has in the previous 100. \"Thirdly, these technological innovations are themselves opening the door for new and varied sources of competition.\" Fintech startups are now well-established in Britain and Horta Osorio reiterated his call for banks to work in partnership[1] with these startups rather than compete against them. However, Horta Osorio also highlighted the danger of \"Big Tech\" getting into banking, highlighting Apple's recent push into payments. \"Finally, regulators are demanding that banks take the action that will allow competition to flourish so that the door is not arbitrarily closed.\" Regulators in the UK have recently introduced new 'Open Banking' reforms that require banks to share customer information with third party companies if the customer agrees. The aim is to allow startups to built slick new apps on top of the existing banking infrastructure. Horta Osorio said Lloyds is working hard to make sure its customers can access the full benefits of Open Banking, playing into his push to get banks to work with startups, not against them.NOW WATCH:

The CEOs, who will likely appear remotely over video, will have to defend the growing power of their tech companies to skeptical lawmakers.Here's why each CEO has been asked to appear, the types of questions they will likely be asked, and how the day might play out.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. The CEOs of four tech giants will appear before Congress next week[3], where they'll have to defend their companies' growing power to skeptical lawmakers.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, will testify as part of an ongoing investigation by the House Judiciary's Antitrust subcommittee into the dominance of digital platforms.Since June, the subcommittee has held hearings with smaller competitors, which have testified over the alleged monopolistic practices of these giants. Now, all four tech titans will appear together to answer questions based on the committee's findings.The hearing is scheduled for Wednesday at noon ET, sources tell Axios[4], after it was postponed[5] from Monday due to a memorial for the late Rep. </p><p>John Lewis.Due to the ongoing global pandemic, the CEOs are expected to appear remotely via video call software. Lawmakers are hoping to get the hearings done in a day, and considering the expanse of issues on the table, that will be no easy task.Here's why each CEO has been asked to appear, the types of questions they're likely to get, and what's at stake for each company. GoogleGoogle is currently the subject of multiple antitrust investigations[6] from numerous state attorneys general, but Wednesday will be the first time since 2018 that we will see CEO Sundar Pichai go before Congress.Lawmakers will likely be focused on Google's dominance in the search and advertising market, so expect them to quiz Pichai on whether and how the company has kept a fair playing field.Bloomberg[7] recently reported that Google's changes to search have made it more expensive for online businesses to reach customers - expect the committee to probe Google on these sorts of topics as it tries to unpack a vastly complex digital business.Lawmakers may also interrogate how Google's digital advertising business has profited from toxic content online. Similarly, they may also ask about hate speech on YouTube, although some of these topics could draw away the focus from antitrust issues.Finally, it's possible Google could get asked about China. In fact, it was Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island who grilled Pichai on China during the 2018 hearing, and the topic has come up again recently with reports[8] that the company is still trying to find ways into the market.Congress could also question Google about the antitrust investigations it currently faces from several different states. Earlier this month, Politico reported that California was preparing to launch its own investigation into the company, making it the 49th state to do so.[9] Apple To date, Apple has managed to avoid more of the antitrust backlash than some other members on this list, but there's a growing concern among lawmakers that the company's App Store \u2014 and broader app ecosystem \u2014 is hurting developers.Apple has restrictive rules for App Store developers, including a 15-30% tax on in-app purchases that third parties have long argued is unfair, though Apple says it's in line with competitors' rates[10]. Spotify has been one of the most vocal about the subject, and last month Basecamp, developer of the Hey email app, also took its grievances public[11].The App Store is Apple's second-biggest revenue maker after the iPhone, but Apple's own apps aren't subject to the same rules as third parties, and it's long been argued that this gives Apple another unfair advantage over competition.One particularly murky area is Apple's approval process for new apps, so expect lawmakers to try to probe some of the secretive behind-the-scenes mechanisms.How do we know Apple is taking this seriously? It recently commissioned a study[12] defending the 30% cut, which it says is similar to those charged by Google, Amazon, and other. That may be true, but the committee is likely less interested in the comparable size of the revenue share, and more interested in the other ways Apple might be hurting developers. FacebookFacebook is likely to face scrutiny over its past acquisitions, which critics say Facebook has used as a tactic to neutralize competition threats.The company acquired Giphy[13] earlier this year for $400 million, which set off antitrust alarm bells \u2014 critics said Giphy's reach across the web could help expand Facebook's already-massive ad tracking operation.Facebook has bought a slew of companies large and small in the 16 years since its founding. Its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014, respectively, cemented Facebook as a global tech giant. In 2013, Facebook purchased Onavo Mobile, an app that uses AI to identify other companies that could make for good purchases. (Facebook later shut down[14] the app after controversy.)The Federal Trade Commission is already investigating[15] Facebook over its recent acquisitions.Lawmakers are also likely to question Facebook's measures to stop the spread of misinformation and hate speech on its platform, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic and run-up to the 2020 election. Those questions dominated[16] Zuckerberg's last congressional testimony, which had been framed as a hearing on Facebook's cryptocurrency venture.Facebook has faced prolonged backlash from Democrats[17] for its refusal to fact-check posts and campaign ads from President Donald Trump. Scientists and public health authorities have also decried[18] the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the platform. AmazonAmazon has already garnered heavy scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the past year over its treatment of third-party companies that sell products through its website.A Wall Street Journal investigation[19] in April found that Amazon frequently used data gleaned from third-party sellers on its site to shape plans to develop its own private label products \u2014that revelation kicked off a sweeping antitrust investigation[20] into the company in the EU.More recently, dozens of investors and entrepreneurs told The Wall Street Journal[21] that Amazon invested in their companies, gaining access to proprietary information, before launching competitors. Many of the startups were crushed in the process[22], and said they were unable to compete with Amazon once it launched its own service. Amazon denied the allegations that it used confidential information. \"Any legitimate disputes about intellectual property ownership are rightly resolved in the courts,\" a spokesperson told Business Insider.Amazon could also face more topical questions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused an unexpected surge in online orders and strained Amazon's fulfillment centers.The safety of workers at Amazon warehouses has been a point of contention. Several workers went on strike earlier this year to protest working conditions[23], and multiple Amazon warehouse workers have since died from the coronavirus. Amazon insists that it has provided ample protective equipment and cleaned its warehouses regularly to reduce transmission.Wednesday's hearings will also mark the first time CEO Jeff Bezos has ever testified before Congress in the company's history. His history of feuding[24] with President Trump and ownership of The Washington Post may also be a topic of questioning.

Twitter said in a tweet[1] Friday that Dorsey had \"voluntarily agreed to testify,\" while calling for \"reasoned and productive debate\" over \"reactionary and politicized attempts to erode #Section230.\" The Washington Post reporter Tony Romm[2] earlier reported that Zuckerberg and Pichai had agreed to appear as well, while a Facebook spokesperson confirmed Zuckerberg's appearance with Business Insider. The Senate's Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee is holding the hearing[3], where lawmakers will question the executives over Section 230, a legal protection for internet companies[4] that has come under fire from both sides of the aisle. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[5].The heads of Facebook, Google, and Twitter have all agreed to testify before Congress about social media regulation on October 28, just days before the US presidential election.Twitter announced CEO Jack Dorsey's appearance in a tweet Friday[6], while The Washington Post reporter Tony Romm tweeted Friday[7] that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google parent company Alphabet, had agreed to testify as well. </p><p>A Facebook spokesperson confirmed Zuckerberg's appearance to Business Insider.Their decisions to testify voluntarily avoids a subpoena process that lawmakers had voted on Thursday[8] to invoke to compel them to appear. Sources told Romm that \"subpoenas did not have to be sent.\"The Senate's Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee is holding the hearing, where lawmakers plan to question the executives about concerns over Section 230, a legal provision that shields social media companies[9] from being held liable for the content of users' posts and gives them authority to develop their own content moderation rules.Its advocates have called it \"the most important law protecting internet speech[10],\" but the law has increasingly come under fire from both sides of the political aisle \u2014 albeit for very different reasons.Some Democrats want Section 230 to be amended to force social media companies to take a firmer stance to moderate hate speech and misinformation on their platforms. Some Republicans \u2014 including President Donald Trump \u2014 have alleged anti-conservative bias by big tech companies and want to curb Section 230's protections to make them conditional on how tech companies moderate political speech.Trump issued a controversial and legally dubious executive order[11] targeting Section 230 this summer, explicitly airing grievances about decisions by Twitter and Facebook to apply fact-check and warning labels to his posts containing misinformation about mail-in voting and encouraging violence.Republicans claim that incidents like Twitter and Facebook's labels are evidence of anti-conservative bias. The tech companies have denied that political bias influences their decisions about how to moderate content, and data shows[12]that conservative sites and pundits regularly generate content that garner the most interactions of any outlets online.Twitter, in its tweets announcing Dorsey's decision to testify, explicitly referenced these claims as well as Trump's order, criticizing what it called \"reactionary and politicized attempts to erode #Section230\" and urging \"reasoned and productive debate.\"\"Alleged 'political bias' remains an unsubstantiated allegation that we have refuted on many occasions to Congress. It has also been widely disproven by independent research,\" Twitter's public policy team said.Twitter said it was focused on \"joint efforts to protect our shared democratic conversation from harm \u2014 from both foreign and domestic threats\" and called for the hearing to be \"constructive &amp;#38; focused on what matters most to the American people: how we work together to protect elections.\" Read the original article on Business Insider[13] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/policy/status/1312164521293705218?s=21\">https://twitter.com/policy/status/1312164521293705218?s=21</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/tonyromm/status/1312167099360374784?s=21\">https://twitter.com/tonyromm/status/1312167099360374784?s=21</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/senators-subpoena-google-twitter-facebook-ceos-to-testify-2020-10\">https://www.businessinsider.com/senators-subpoena-google-twitter-facebook-ceos-to-testify-2020-10</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-section-230-internet-law-communications-decency-act-explained-2020-5\">https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-section-230-internet-law-communications-decency-act-explained-2020-5</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/policy/status/1312164521293705218?s=21\">https://twitter.com/policy/status/1312164521293705218?s=21</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/tonyromm/status/1312167099360374784?s=21\">https://twitter.com/tonyromm/status/1312167099360374784?s=21</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/senators-subpoena-google-twitter-facebook-ceos-to-testify-2020-10\">https://www.businessinsider.com/senators-subpoena-google-twitter-facebook-ceos-to-testify-2020-10</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-section-230-internet-law-communications-decency-act-explained-2020-5\">https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-section-230-internet-law-communications-decency-act-explained-2020-5</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230\">https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/all-the-latest-news-about-trump-executive-order-social-media-2020-5\">https://www.businessinsider.com/all-the-latest-news-about-trump-executive-order-social-media-2020-5</url> [ 12]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-crowdtangle-data-top-posts-conservative-outlets-2020-7\">https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-crowdtangle-data-top-posts-conservative-outlets-2020-7</url> [ 13]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-google-twitter-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey-testify-congress-section-230-2020-10\">https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-google-twitter-zuckerberg-pichai-dorsey-testify-congress-section-230-2020-10</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BZIN105645160168385091675776100013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BZIN-5352</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6103-M0C1-JCMN-Y0GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"868\"/><timeReceived>12:10 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Business Insider</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 3, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Vernon Hill, the challenger bank's colourful American founder and Sir Duffield II's master, likes to make his red, white and blue \"stores\" friendly to dogs as well as \"fans\" (customers).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Metro claims to be the plucky underdog of British banking. It belongs to a pack of challengers, including TSB, Monzo, Starling and Revolut, that promised to rattle the big four - Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far, however, many have failed to live up to their hype. Despite the brightly coloured branches and shiny apps, challenger banks have clawed barely any market share from the big four, which still control about three-quarters of the current account market.</p><p>The upstarts' future is now under the microscope. A string of debacles, including a serious accounting error at Metro and the botched IT upgrade at TSB as well as claims of a \"toxic\" work environment at Revolut, have raised serious questions about their governance and culture. Having grown at breakneck speed during their toddler years, many are struggling to reach maturity.</p><p>Challengers are still dwarfed by their big-name rivals, and some are being forced into mergers to grow and to survive. CYBG, owner of Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank, gobbled up Virgin Money for \u00a31.7bn last year. Last week, OneSavings Bank and Charter Court Financial Services agreed a \u00a31.6bn merger. Fintech start-ups such as Monzo and Starling, which have eschewed branches in favour of digital apps, are battling to win customers and backing from investors while sitting on heavy losses.</p><p>The looming question is whether some will see off these growing pains and pose genuine problems for the high street clearing banks, and how many will succumb to gravity instead.</p><p>Challengers rose from the ashes of the financial crisis and the clamour for more competition after Lloyds rescued HBOS, making the business dominant in the mortgage market. City watchdogs made it easier to launch a bank, paving the way for Metro in 2010.</p><p>Fintech start-ups followed, riding the smartphone wave to evolve from money transfer apps into regulated banks. By tapping into the zeitgeist - mistrust of large banks and dislike of their high charges - the likes of Revolut and Monzo have won legions of zealous fans.</p><p>Customer numbers have rocketed during their short existence: Revolut has amassed more than 4m since 2015, while 1.7m have downloaded the Monzo app over the same period. Customers came out in force to defend Monzo when it endured a storm over allowing them to use overdrafts to buy its shares.</p><p>\"Culture is something we've thought about from the early days,\" said Tom Blomfield, 33, Monzo's co-founder and chief executive. \"It's not perfect, but I would say it's very strong. We care about human empathy, and hiring people who care. It translates through to treating customers as well as we can.\"</p><p>Yet cracks are beginning to show for some challengers. They all face the same problem: being too small to fight the big banks. With less financial firepower and costly operations, the upstart lenders struggled to achieve commercial scale.</p><p>\"There's a substantial number of niche players now, and some have made an impact,\" said Phillip Monks, chief executive of Aldermore, which he set up with private equity backing in 2009 to serve small businesses. \"But have they taken massive market share from the banks? No, not really.\"</p><p>Because they have fewer customers and deposits, it is tougher for the challenger banks to lend and make a profit. They have to hold more capital as a safety buffer than their large rivals, which also reduces their lending capability. Also, they face the same vast amounts of regu-yet have far less cash to pay for compliance teams.</p><p>\"It's very difficult to be successful if you don't have scale - it's an expensive game,\" said the chairman of a large bank.</p><p>Some City grandees blame politicians for the challengers' struggles. \"They have got it completely wrong,\" said one. \"Their fixation has been on barriers to entry rather than barriers to growth. There have been nearly 20 banking licences granted but virtually no change in market share.\"</p><p>Pressure to grow and turn a profit for investors has weighed heavily on some of the new entrants, which are also struggling to cope with the reams of regulation that comes with the territory.</p><p>At Revolut, which last April became one of the first fintech \"unicorns\" in the UK - companies valued at more than $1bn - co-founder and chief executive Nikolay Storonsky's determination to win customers appears to have come at a high price. The app-based current account and money transfer service attempted to upgrade its customer vetting system last year, but flaws in the process meant that some customers had their money transfers delayed.</p><p>The debacle came shortly after Revolut reported suspected money laundering on its platform, bringing it to the attention of regulators.</p><p>Industry sources said that Storonsky, 34, was obsessively focused on growth at the expense of governance and staff. Workers allegedly worked punitively long hours, sometimes unpaid. \"When you treat people like shit, you have hundreds of disgruntled employees,\" said one source. \"Revolut has grown incredibly fast. It recently took them seven days to reply to my online chat.\"</p><p>While Storonsky has admitted to making mistakes, investors are wondering whether such issues are just teething problems or something deeper.</p><p>Metro Bank is under scrutiny from investors and watchdogs after a string of errors. Hill, 73, was put under the spotlight after it emerged that the bank had paid millions of pounds to a company called InterArch for branch design and branding services. InterArch, which is owned by his wife, Shirley, continues to receive work from Metro.</p><p>The bank's chief executive, Craig Donaldson, 47, is facing the heat after Metro claimed to have uncovered an accounting error in relation to its capital reserves, then later admitted that the problem had been found by the City watchdog. \"It's a huge issue that speaks to the bigger question of competence,\" said a City veteran.</p><p>The discovery prompted other challengers to scour their accounts. \"The Prudential Regulation Authority doesn't tell you if they [your accounts] are right, they just tell you if they are wrong,\" said one chief executive. \"We've had a full comb through all our accounts.\"</p><p>Metro's market value has crashed from \u00a34bn at the start of 2018 to \u00a3850m. The share price remains under pressure due to the prospect of a \u00a3350m rights issue.</p><p>\"Institutional-investor enthusiasm [for challengers] has waned,\" said one bank executive. \"For investors to get under the skin, they have to do a lot of work on each bank, so that's a lot of research.\"</p><p>Investors are realising that growth is still a long way off. Jamie Clark, a fund manager at the investment house Liontrust, said: \"We used to have a challenger bank. The idea was they would take market share from incumbents stricken by the effects of the financial crisis. They've been a disappointment.\"</p><p>The struggle to grow has forced some of the new names to merge.</p><p>ILLUSTRATION: MATTHEW CORNICK The cost of running a traditional bank - the staff, the branches, technology and compliance costs - is huge. Without gathering enough customer deposits and making loans, profits come under threat. Competition from the high street banks, especially HSBC, which has piled back into the mortgage market, is turning the screw even tighter.</p><p>OneSavings Bank and Charter Court Financial Services said their tie-up would give them \"greater scale and resources to deploy on growth opportunities\".</p><p>Mergers come with risks, though. TSB was acquired by Sabadell in 2015, and three years later, plunged into crisis when it attempted to move customers on to the Spanish lender's IT system, locking out about 2m customers from their online accounts. CYBG will no doubt keep the \u00a3176m TSB fiasco in mind as it combines with Virgin Money.</p><p>At the same time, the big banks are beginning to fight back with slick digital services of their own.

I'll update on that shortly but I was also involved in a study the organisers - The European House Ambrosetti[1], a leading economics think tank based in Italy - conducted before the conference. The study looked at the bank of tomorrow. How would it look like?</p><p> How would it operate? What changes would a bank need to make? and more. The European House Ambrosetti conducted interviews with many leading Italian bankers, as well as experts such as myself, and produced a 150 page report[2] in Italian, outlining the future. They also produced a shorter English language summary[3]. Here is that summary: Reference context: the main trends impacting on the banking sector The context in which banks are operating is undergoing major changes due to both technological evolution and evolution in clientele (private individuals and businesses), which require new modes of dialogue and interaction. In fact, the survey carried out by The European House - Ambrosetti and Openjobmetis involving a significant sampling of companies based in Italy, shows that the determinant characteristics for preferring one specific bank among those available are, above all, cost considerations, the quality of interpersonal relations, and 'process factors' such as speed, flexibility and simplicity. In general:a gradual reduction in customer loyalty emerges (more than half of those responding to the survey stated that they do not have one bank they prefer over the others); interaction between companies and banks on a professional level is increasingly less-exclusive and -frequent (36% of survey respondents stated they had not had contact with a bank manager in the last month) and increasingly digital (over one-third of the companies interviewed declared they had dealt with banks using virtual channels\u2014smartphones, tablets and PCs\u2014more than 30 times in the last month).Therefore, it is not surprising, in terms of the factors that could cause a company to change bank, that at the top of the list are economic conditions, the presence of a personal manager, an omnichannel strategy and the availability of new services. These are also aspects identified with the business model typical of Fintech companies already active in a range of banking industry sectors. In fact, part of this new scenario are 'non-traditional' players, such as Fintech and Big Tech companies, whose key business model features are a focus on the client and the use of technology. These companies prosper thanks to the intelligent use of data, which constitutes their main asset: knowledge\u2014a patrimony typically intangible that is their true profit generator. This intangibility is part of the current trend known as the intangible-rich economy, an economy in which intangible investments outnumber tangible ones, which profoundly changes the financial scenario both because of the difficulty in evaluating the value of these investments (which, by their very nature, can only be guaranteed by their ability to generate profits and are therefore difficult to finance), and because of a number of their specific characteristics such as scalability (the fact that, once the initial cost has been paid, the investment can be extended rapidly to the entire organization at virtually zero cost). This characteristic tends to favor large organizations rather than small- and medium-sized ones, which helps to explain:on one hand, the tendency, already in progress, towards concentration in the banking sector, with the further strengthening of 'universal banks' (horizontal); on the other, the competitive challenge that this represents for European and Italian banks (in fact, the United States and Chinese banking operators are significantly larger than the major European groups and among the world's top banks for capitalization there is no true 'pan-European' bank).The passage to an economy in which investment in intangible assets surpasses that in tangible assets is of primary importance for the banking system because it entails a major change in both the supply and demand of financial services, which could potentially include new 'value added' services that historically lie outside the normal perimeter of banking institutions, but which are validated by a broader search and valorization of customer data.The competitive scenario for the banking sector and the three key players in the new ways of 'doing banking' New trends are redefining the economic space and in every sector, including banking, new and unimaginable opportunities are opening up. In particular, three major forces are profoundly transforming the entire global scenario:globalization; regulation; digitalization.The new competitive arena polarizes the business models of players; major 'universal' banks will tend to become even larger in response to competition from Big Tech companies and 'specialty banks' will focus on specific business segments surrounded by a growing number of Fintechs that will find themselves competing or collaborating with the banks. In this scenario, the players most at-risk are the 'medium' banks in terms of size and business focus and, therefore, nearly the entire Italian banking system. Incumbent banks Italian banks are, largely, still generalist and small compared with the extent of the global challenge. In addition, the tangible assets which, until a short time ago were a point of strength and an entry barrier for new competitors (IT legacy infrastructure and the network of bank branches) have been transformed into exit barriers due to the technological revolution currently underway, becoming a formidable obstacle on the road to innovation and putting at-risk the economic return of incumbent operators. The true asset on which banks can still rely on is customer loyalty. Even if the scenario changes, customers still want certainty regarding where their money is physically held. Fintech companies Fintech companies are created to satisfy a specific need of a specific segment of customers and they grow rapidly on a global scale, limited only, occasionally, by the regulatory framework. These companies provide services with quantifiable benefits for customers (customer centricity), enabled by the intelligent use of data (technology). By their very nature, Fintechs often cover a range of financial services and almost always include value added services (VAS). For them, customers include the banking world itself, as shown by the number of Fintechs operating in banking support services. The European House - Ambrosetti has carried out an in-depth analysis of the value propositions and business models adopted by the top 250 Fintech companies on a global level (assessed each year by CB Insights, the most complete international database in this field), from which it emerges that:most Fintechs deal with collection and payment services and banking processes (both 25% of the sample). It is hypothesized that, above all in the area of banking processes, it will be possible to experiment with new approaches and introduce innovative methodologies; the concentration of companies in the retail area is high (42% of the sample) since these companies come from B2C to facilitate the customer-bank interface, and the technologies enabled by smartphones and apps were initially aimed specifically at the B2C segment; there is a significant focus on commercial customers (30% of the sample), especially regarding collection and payment of B2B and VAS (21 companies), in which Fintechs provide SMEs with even complex services, relieving them of a number of management responsibilities and aiding them in developing their business; on the other hand, the concentration of institutional customers (including banks) in the customer facing macro-category is low and it accounts for 3% of the sample; these customers are mainly targeted by the 63 Fintech companies in the B2B support area (core banking and infrastructure), which account for 25% of the sample.Big Tech companies 'GAFA' (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple) as global players and 'BAT' (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - at the moment concentrated primarily on the Chinese market) generate profits thanks to an extended knowledge of their customers and are, therefore, in a position to easily extend their activity into the financial services area. Suggesting that Big Tech companies would not enter en masse in the financial services sector because of the lower profitability - compared to that to which they are accustomed to, - is not a convincing argument. In fact, there are Big Tech companies that are already providing financial services and not only in the payment area, but for example, financing the working capital of the companies present in their marketplaces. In addition, another factor which could impact on the future development of non-traditional banking operators and the technological 'oligopolists' is the effect of over-regulation: the potential increase in the complexity (and, therefore, costs) of the regulatory and legal system, which banks must currently adhere to and which could also be applied to these players on the national/supranational market.The challenge of transforming into 'Banks of the Future' Whatever the shape of the future financial ecosystem and the type of relationship - competitive, cooperative or mixed - between the different actors (banks, Big Tech and Fintech companies), it is certain that banks will have to take the challenge of self-transformation very seriously, in two respects:On one side, the transformation of customer relations, with the bank becoming truly customer-centric. For example, smartphones have become a privileged channel for accessing financial services. In 2017, the share of users who utilized the Internet or mobile banking in Italy was 62% of the entire clientele, compared with 43% in 2012, while visits to physical bank branches fell from 1.5 to 1.05 times per month between 2012 and 2016. On the other, digital transformation, with its implications of new technology and open IT architecture. In fact, the advent of new digital technologies\u2014such as Artificial Intelligence, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Blockchain, Cloud Computing, 5G and the Internet of Things\u2014will accelerate the change in the provision of financial services in terms of simplicity, availability, security, reduction in the cost of services offered and ability to gather more precise feedback, more quickly.Both these aspects will have a strong impact on human resources, both in recruiting the new digital talents required for the transformation, and in the transformation of in-house personnel, without which it will be impossible to attain the number of people required for the change, as well as defining new organizational models. Given this scenario, what is the possibility that Italian banks can survive and prosper? What mechanisms can be activated? What specific features of the Italian banking market can be used as a driver for growth? And, finally, what 'policy package' could help to safeguard the future of Italian banks (education policies, policies for professional training and concrete employment-related policies)?Recommendations for managing the transition and policy implications In light of the analysis performed and the information gathered by the Steering Committee that guided the Ambrosetti Club research as well as from major business leaders and financial sector experts interviewed in Italy and around the world, The European House - Ambrosetti developed 10 recommendations for policy makers and the banking sector leadership:Eliminate the forms of (regulatory) 'penalization' which make it less profitable for banks to invest in intangible assets. Stimulate a package of services in support of small- and medium-sized companies looking to invest in intangible assets. Draw up a homogeneous regulatory structure (level playing field) on a European level for financial and other operators. Define new collaborative models to guide the sector's digital transformation. Provide mechanisms to facilitate the spread of Open Innovation in the banking sector. Monitor the risks to governance and security within the new competitive context. Reinforce the attractiveness of incumbent banks towards 'digital talent' by rethinking the 'job pact'. Promote the evolution of the national educational system to improve its ability to provide individuals with the right competitive skill levels. Spread the 'culture of permanent professional training' as a driver for individual professional development. Provide for financial incentives to limit the qualitative/ quantitative effects of the competitive transformation.

In which current global table does Norway come out on top and North Korea find itself in bottom place? Most of us hazarding a guess at the answer would likely say it had something to do with human rights, and that assertion wouldn't be far off the mark.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The answer is, in fact, the 2020 World Press Freedom Index, compiled by the media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, better known by its French acronym RSF.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As someone who has spent the past four decades of his life working in journalism, every year I examine the data compiled in the index with a degree of trepidation. Its main purpose is to evaluate the situation for journalists in 180 countries and territories across the globe.</p><p>In this regard there's no doubt the index has become an extremely useful advocacy tool in helping promote free, independent and pluralistic journalism and in defending media workers' rights.</p><p>But vital as such a role is, this serves as little consolation to the fact that the conclusions drawn by the index these past few years have been far from heartening. The current index is no exception, or then again perhaps it is, for rarely in recent times has it portrayed a bleaker picture of the threats facing media freedom worldwide.</p><p>Those threats, of course, have inevitably been amplified by the coronavirus pandemic, as existing and aspiring autocrats around the world crack down on journalists' ability to do their jobs at a time when transparency is more vital than ever.</p><p>In fact so pressing are those threats that RSF has warned that the next 10 years will pretty much determine the fate of journalism as we know it.</p><p>\"We are entering a decisive decade for journalism linked to crises that affect its future,\" says RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire.</p><p>\"The coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor,\" Deloire added in his recent summation of the current index ratings.</p><p>Questioning what all this means for freedom of information, pluralism and reliability by 2030, Deloire maintains the answer to that is already being determined and as we move through this \"decisive decade\", five converging crises are having a malign influence and potentially devastating impact on international journalism.</p><p>The first of these is what RSF says is a \"geopolitical crisis\" due to aggressiveness of authoritarian regimes, which the coronavirus has already starkly highlighted.</p><p>The second is a \"technological crisis\", resulting from the lack of appropriate regulation of digitalised communication, creating a kind of \"information chaos\" blurring the lines between fact, fiction, propaganda and advertising, often putting them in direct competition with mainstream bona fide journalism.</p><p>The third crisis in this perfect storm facing journalism highlighted by RSF is a growing physical hostility towards journalists globally.</p><p>Much of this hostility, it concludes, is an offshoot of the hatred towards the press fomented by some political leaders such as US President Donald Trump and his counterpart Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.</p><p>\"Hostility toward journalists and news outlets in the US deepened and intensified, and few attacks were as vitriolic as those that came from the president,\" RSF concluded.</p><p>\"The abuse is only getting worse amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, as journalists covering the Trump administration's response to the crisis are subjected to the president's attacks during his press briefings,\" the media watchdog added.</p><p>According to the index ratings, the US now ranks 45th out of 180 countries. A \"dangerous anti-press sentiment\" as well as the arrest, physical assault, public denigration and harassment of journalists had trickled down to the local level in America, the report determined.</p><p>Related to this open hostility and another of the five elements in this crisis press freedom faces is one of trust, says RSF. Or put another way, the public suspects broadcast and print news to have been contaminated by unreliable information.</p><p>In making its case for this, the media watchdog cites a recent Edelman Trust Barometer conducted by the US-based public relations group that studies public trust in institutions.</p><p>According to those polled in Edelman's latest international survey, 57% of people believed the media they used were contaminated with information they thought untrustworthy. That in itself most would admit is cause for serious concern, but combined with the other threats outlined, all five converge into one enormous challenge to the worldwide press of the future.</p><p>It's a sobering thought, not least today as we mark World Press Freedom Day along with its theme this year of \"journalism without fear or favour\".</p><p>In order to understand in real terms just what these threats mean to journalism's future, it's worth drilling down a little deeper into their implications.</p><p>The obvious place to start is with the impact of the pandemic itself. Having said that, long before the emergence of the coronavirus, world press freedoms were recognised as being in decline.</p><p>For many years journalists have weathered authoritarian regimes and threats to their safety. But where most observers are now in near total agreement is that the pandemic has brought a new dynamic to the media landscape exposing the long-term risks of suppressed press freedoms</p><p>As Robert Mahoney, deputy executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), points out, those countries that stifle independent news and jail journalists in \"normal\" times have already been hard at work.</p><p>In what some journalists have called the global \"Covid crackdown\", China and Iran - 177th and 173rd respectively in the Press Freedom Index - tried to quarantine the truth. In Iran's case the leadership there censored news of its spread with devastating consequences for public health.</p><p>MANY media monitoring groups are now concerned that for the most part, govern-ments have been getting away with their efforts to impede independent journalism without being called out by other countries, all of which are also preoccupied in dealing with the pandemic.</p><p>\"Governments in Thailand, through Hungary and Egypt to Honduras are using the cloud cover of the disease to introduce emergency measures that could roll back basic freedoms, clamp down on the press or restrict foreign correspondents,\" warned Mahoney recently on Al Jazeera.</p><p>At its worst this manifests itself in arrests, detention, intimidation, physical threats and sometimes murder.</p><p>In terms of Covid-19 related reporting, human rights group Amnesty International last week highlighted a handful of cases where reporters have been prosecuted or threatened. Among them was that of</p><p>Russian journalist Elena Milashina, whose newspaper Novaya Gazeta on April 12 published an article in which she criticised the Chechen authorities' response to the pandemic.</p><p>Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov in turn posted an Instagram video in which he threatened Milashina, appealing to the Russian government and Federal Security Service (FSB) to \"stop those non-humans who are writing and provoking our people\".</p><p>In Egypt, meanwhile, security forces arrested Atef Hasballah, the editor-in-chief of AlkararPress newspaper, on March 18 and subjected him to enforced disappearance for nearly a month, following a post on his Facebook page in which he challenging the official statistics on Covid-19 cases.</p><p>In Venezuela, journalist Darvinson Rojas spent 12 days in detention after reporting on the spread of the virus in the country and was pushed by authorities to reveal his sources.</p><p>These are only three of many instances globally where reporting on the pandemic brought journalists under threat, but it's not only during the current crisis that such measures have been documented</p><p>Last year, 142 serious threats to press freedom were recorded, including 33 physical attacks on journalists. A total of 43 cases of intimidation and direct threat have been listed in a report compiled by several media organisations, among them RSF, the Association of European Journalists and the International Press Institute.</p><p>Late last year, too, 105 journalists were imprisoned for their work, primarily in Turkey, Russia and Azerbaijan.</p><p>As Otmar Lahodynsky, President of the Association of European Journalists (AEJ), wrote recently in the EU affairs newspaper New Europe, the takeover of media by oligarchs and governments in Hungary, Poland and Serbia were also noted and criticised in the report. \"Many public service broadcasters have been turned into uncritical propaganda channels for the government. Abuses of media freedom are also increasing in Western Europe,\" says Lahodynsky, adding that political influence on the media is increasing in many of the 47 countries that count themselves as members of the Council of Europe.</p><p>But beyond these obvious threats to journalism and its future lie others, many economic, with job cuts gutting newsrooms. As RSF makes clear, the digital transformation has brought the media to their knees in many countries.</p><p>Falling sales, the collapse in advertising revenue and the increase in production and distribution costs have in turn forced news organisations to restructure and lay off journalists.</p><p>\"The economic crisis has also accentuated the phenomena of ownership concentration and, even more, conflicts of interest, which threaten journalistic pluralism and independence,\" warns the watchdog.</p><p>The bottom line here is that global journalism currently faces both old threats and new, raising the inevitable question of how best to protect and nurture its existence in the \"decisive decade\" that lies ahead.</p><p>According to Farhana Haque Rahman, senior vice-president of the global news agency Inter Press Service, ultimately, just as in a pandemic, the freedom of the press can only be guaranteed by a co-ordinated global effort and a focus on highlighting the long-term advantages of a more critical world.</p><p>\"This means pressure to reinforce legal frameworks, including prosecuting harassers and killers, perhaps just as the international community would persecute war criminals, while offering a global protection for journalists,\" says Rahman.</p><p>\"Finding and promoting innovative ways of subsidising independent media, as well as getting big tech companies to pay for the content they share, is also crucial to help a free press to thrive,\" she says.</p><p>Just as the response to the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a marathon not a sprint, so must the long-term future of journalism be viewed in the same terms.</p><p>Ever since the United Nations proclaimed World Press Freedom Day on this date back in 1993, the obstacles facing independent reporting have consistently been immense.</p><p>Censorship, smear campaigns, harassment, intimidation, arrest and detention, threats of physical assault and murder are the challenges journalists across many parts of the world have had to contend with.</p><p>Right now these are unprecedented times, and, as one colleague recently observed, no working journalist alive has ever covered anything like this story of the pandemic. Even veterans of war reporting or Ebola coverage have had to re-evaluate risk and learn new skills. As we mark World Press Freedom Day, it's obvious that many challenges beyond the current one lie in wait. Most likely these will put the very heart of journalistic practice and the ability to carry it out without fear or favour to an unprecedented test.</p><p>To say we need journalism now more than ever is true. But it also masks a reality worth reiterating, one that makes clear the importance of having a free press each and every day, whether the story is of global or local concern.</p><p>In either instance, holding power to account and performing a public interest role is fundamental to this.</p><p>But just as the press holds the powers that be to account, so too do we need reasoned critical consumers of the media, those similarly capable of holding the media to task for any misrepresentations of the truth.</p><p>It was the great French author and journalist Albert Camus who once observed that: \"A free press can, of course, be good or bad, but, most certainly without freedom, the press will never be anything but bad.\"</p><p>If, as the World Press Freedom report suggests, the next 10 years prove to be an unprecedented test for the media, then good journalism will need all the allies it can muster.</p><p>As Deloire rightly pointed out: \"For this decisive decade to not be a disastrous one, people of goodwill, whoever they are, must campaign for journalists to be able to fulfil their role as society's trusted third parties, which means they must have the capacity to do so.\"</p><p>Speaking as someone with a vested interest in that happening, I can only say how welcome that trust would be. But equally, however, those within my chosen profession must realise that in order for that to take place, we too must prove ourselves worthy of that same trust.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THENTL-18422943</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THENTL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTH-FR81-JD39-X06M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437379</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2160\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The National (Scotland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51662\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 3, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDk1NjM1M0M1QUYxNDlEMDgxNjI1Qzk3NkRDNDhCRjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwRjUxMDRFN0JBNEMxMEI3MDhDNzhBMjA4NzU2MzM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000760</classCode><className>FREEDOM OF PRESS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwRjUxMDRFN0JBNEMxMEI3MDhDNzhBMjA4NzU2MzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode><className>Free Press</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOZB</classCode><className>SOCIAL DISTANCING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009J49</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS &amp;

The Company Now Has a U.S. National Probe</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kenzie Wilkinson, a freshman studying Multi-Disciplinary Design\u00a0at the University of Utah, has a theory on why the mobile application TikTok appeals to a younger demographic. \"They're adapted to online challenges and who can make the best videos,\" she said. Though TikTok has exploded in popularity, Wilkinson believes many her peers initially downloading the app as \"a joke.\" \"Mainly e-boys and e-girls are on it,\" she said, a descriptor for young people who employ a reconfigured emo aesthetic with a substantial presence online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The application has drawn a\u00a0massive audience of teens and young users. Tiktok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that runs other social apps on mobile devices. Last month, the federal government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States launched a national security probe into TikTok to evaluate risks for the country.</p><p>Zachary Stickney, a PhD student in the U's political science department who is interested in the ethics of emerging technology, tech and activism, says this concern by the U.S. isn't new.\u00a0</p><p>\"In 2012, under the Obama administration, bipartisan members of the House Intelligence Committee released a report expressing concerns over Chinese telecom giant Huawei,\" he said. The government worried \"that the company might be used as an intelligence-gathering tool by the Chinese communist party.\"\u00a0</p><p>Critics of TikTok highlight the risks of censorship and propaganda. TikTok has been accused of taking videos down mentioning certain aspects of Chinese history, like Tiananmen Square, and the Islamic State has used the app to share recruiting videos that have since been taken down.</p><p>So far, there have been 1.5 billion worldwide downloads\u00a0of TikTok through Apple's App Store and Google Play, surpassing Facebook and Instagram. Since its launch last year in November, users in the U.S. have generated $62.4 million for the company.</p><p>\"The questions the U.S. government has are what data is being gathered and how,\" said Stickney. \"How is it being stored, and who has access? Does the company have any ties to the Chinese government which may be cause for concern?\"</p><p>Introducing legislation on Monday, Nov. 25 to combat big tech companies storing data within servers hosted in China, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri contended that TikTok's attempt to assuage users and officials that their company doesn't operate in China was insufficient. \"All it takes is one knock on the door of their parent company based in China from a Communist Party official for that data to be transferred to the Chinese government's hands whenever they need it,\" he said.</p><p>Hawley also criticized Apple for its ties with China. These concerns may be especially prominent in lawmakers' minds as many fear potential interference from foreign governments in the 2020 election.</p><p>In 2017, China passed an intelligence law, and Stickney says the contents of\u00a0Article Seven are\u00a0unambiguous to interpretation. \" The law states, \"any organization or citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work according to law,\" possibly leaving room for the country to require tech companies to comply with their intelligence efforts.\u00a0</p><p>However, Stickney says these attempts carried by the U.S. government and Hawley may not be enough to squelch the vulnerabilities affecting national security matters. In fact, many significant problems originate not in China or Russia, but in the U.S.</p><p>\"We've already seen that U.S. law and regulation in this space probably isn't sufficient, even in regards to American companies,\" Stickney said. \"Election interference [and] surveillance capitalism have shown us that protections around data and privacy in the U.S. are not sufficient, even for U.S. companies.\"\u00a0</p><p>These issues are associated consistently with Facebook, a giant tech company under fire with several scandals involving political firm Cambridge Analytica in 2018 for accessing over 50 million users' data to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election. The Federal Trade Commission fined the company\u00a0$5 billion over privacy ordeals.</p><p>A study group of other women familiar with the app nodded their heads in agreement with\u00a0Wilkinson, not persuaded by the potential online culture shift mobilized by TikTok. \"We all laugh at the memes but it's just a false portrayal of reality,\" she said. \"At the end of the day, it's just an app.\"</p><p>Stickney said that even if the U.S. ends up clearing TikTok of any wrongdoing, it's still valuable for the public to understand their participation in the limelight of data privacy. \"I want to emphasize that these are absolutely the right questions to be asking - not only of companies with foreign ties, but domestically as well,\" he said. \"The value of the data these organizations are able to gather, and the type of influence which can be exerted on a variety of levels, cannot be understated.\"</p><p>[email protected]\u00a0</p><p>@MiacelSelk</p><p>About the Contributors</p><p>Miacel Spotted Elk, News WriterMiacel Spotted Elk is a news writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4436263</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XT6-0131-DY7P-T37H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Utah Chronicle: University of Utah</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 22, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF UTAH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

This process of evolution through innovation is now accelerating at an unprecedented pace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Information technology is permeating every corner of financial services, whether through the entry of so-called \"big tech\" firms or the use of mobile payment applications, disrupting existing business models and challenging traditional financial infrastructures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These game-changing developments require central banks to step up and play a more significant part in improving payment security and efficiency. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is taking a leading role in driving these efforts, spearheaded by the establishment of the BIS Innovation Hub across three international locations with a mandate to develop insights into critical financial technology trends, to engineer public goods to enhance the global financial system and to act as a focal point on change for central banks.</p><p>Singapore is part of the first wave of this project. The Singapore Hub Centre - launched on Tuesday - follows inaugurations in Hong Kong and Switzerland, and completes the initial phase of the rollout of the BIS Innovation Hub. The Singapore Hub Centre will play a key role in the Hub's mission through its focus on regtech and suptech practices. It will also develop foundational public digital infrastructures - the \"global stack\" - that will bring together people's accounts in different financial institutions onto a single platform, deepen inclusion by making financial services more accessible to all and enable faster and cheaper payments than ever before.</p><p>The Innovation Hub will also confront many other challenges. The Swiss Hub Centre will examine the potential benefits from transforming financial assets and currencies into digital tokens to allow securities settlement with central bank money on a single platform. The Hong Kong Hub Centre will explore the use of distributed ledger technology to streamline the complex processes and logistical challenges involved in trade finance.</p><p>A key question informing the Hub's work is whether money itself needs to be re-invented for a changing environment, or whether the emphasis should be on improving the way it is provided and used. At the BIS, we believe the latter is the more promising way to serve the public interest. And we believe that the public sector needs to play a leading role in this process given that the monetary system is a public good that serves as a foundation for the entire global financial system.</p><p>The most secure basis for a sustainable digital economy is trusted sovereign currency that allows the public and private sectors to focus on their respective strengths. Central banks are at their best when they provide a foundational infrastructure - the \"backbone\" - for the monetary system. The private sector shines when it can give full expression to its innovative spirit in serving customers. Central banks should leave the last mile for the private sector.</p><p>EFFICIENT AND SEAMLESS</p><p>Many central banks already oversee efficient and seamless fast payment systems at the national level, but progress has been uneven across jurisdictions. And, as consumer demand for services such as instant, 24/7 and costless money transfers intensifies amid a growing focus on financial inclusion, there remains considerable scope to upgrade domestic payment systems.</p><p>Most of all, there is an urgent need to improve the current system of cross-border payments that has lagged behind the progress in domestic systems. This is not only a matter of technology, but also of coordinating standards and practices across jurisdictions. Central banks and public authorities should respond to users' justified demands for a more efficient financial system.</p><p>A guiding star on this road is the notion of digital financial infrastructure as a public good, encouraging innovation by providing open access to this system and creating a level playing field for all potential entrants through the regulatory framework. The private sector could focus on customer-facing services and products using the public sector foundation as a base.</p><p>Of course, private firms must follow regulatory standards and supervision, including rules designed to combat money laundering, prevent the financing of terrorism and protect consumers.</p><p>Upgrading the payment system along these lines - and covering all types of transactions within and across borders - would enable 24/7 operation with instant settlement in sovereign money within the banking system. It would also serve to promote financial stability.</p><p>The question arises though, of whether Big Tech firms should be trusted to manage global cross-border payments, potentially via global stablecoins. While stablecoins have yet to convincingly show how they would improve cross-border payments, they reinforce the need for the public sector to address problems with the existing system.</p><p>And, amid the hype around cryptocurrencies and calls for central banks to issue digital currencies aimed at consumers, it is crucial to bear in mind the distinction between the architecture and the technology - that is, between reinventing money and improving its functioning in the financial system. Central bank digital currencies are a technological leap forward and may have a role in improving the operation of the financial system, but they are not a reinvention of money.</p><p>These and other questions will be the focus of the Hub's activities. The Hub is a place where the public and private sectors can come together to share ideas and mobilise technology to improve efficiency and promote inclusion, while ensuring the stability of the global financial and monetary system.</p><p> The writer is general manager of the Bank for International Settlements</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A key question informing the BIS Innovation Hub's work is whether money itself needs to be re-invented for a changing environment, or whether the emphasis should be on improving the way it is provided and used.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-271281</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGP-F601-DYX4-018X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"977\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC6099 FUNCTIONS RELATED TO DEPOSITORY BANKING, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000436</classCode><className>CURRENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001207</classCode><className>NEW ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DF5V</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while Joe Biden released the names of the wealthy and well-connected volunteers who are fundraising for his campaign.These fundraisers, otherwise known as bundlers, have all brought in at least $25,000[1] for the campaign, although many have likely brought in sums an order of magnitude larger, or at least plan to throughout the course of the campaign.While it might be an exaggeration\u2014or, if you like, a bit of poetic license\u2014to say that no one was working at 11:00pm on the Friday after America's biggest holiday, it is hard to imagine another moment in the year when people are less hooked in to the steady drip of the 24-hour news cycle. The Biden campaign's motivation for this stealth release is no mystery. With names from private equity, Big Tech, and many other disfavored industries scattered throughout the list, they surely wanted to tiptoe around negative press coverage. </p><p>And they picked the perfect spot to ensure that.The fact that the media, for the most part, fell for this evasive maneuver has higher stakes than the Biden campaign simply avoiding a bad news cycle. This list tells you more than perhaps any other campaign document about what a Biden presidency would look like\u2014and, let's just say, it does not paint a flattering picture. These names seem to suggest that the bold actions proposed in the Day One Agenda[2] would not be borne out in reality under a President Joe Biden, instead remaining trapped on the Prospect's pages.Consider how exactly presidents are powerful. Although campaign trail rhetoric tends to focus on candidates' legislative agendas, in reality, presidents have limited influence over legislation. But they still have the power to enact major reforms. As the Day One Agenda illustrates, presidents can make bold changes in all policy realms using the tools of the executive branch, including regulation, enforcement, federal contracting, and yes, even executive orders. But the efficacy of these tools depends on the personnel a president taps to carry out their mandate.One might hope that the individuals chosen to fill these positions of prestige would be picked for their qualifications and, above all, unassailable commitment to the public good. Unfortunately, positions in the executive branch are often treated as rewards, doled out to prolific fundraisers and their allies. Even when bundlers don't take a job themselves, their work uncovering money for the candidate wins them a receptive ear when it comes time to choosing who does, and does not.Since bundlers are inevitably from the wealthiest ranks of society\u2014executives in the private equity, real estate, BigLaw, and technology industries\u2014their perspective is hardly that of the average person. And indeed, their influence has routinely tipped the scales against the public interest, including dissuading administrations from taking the sorts of actions that the Day One Agenda encourages, and instead towards the maintenance and expansion of private profit.More fromEleanor Eagan[3]Biden's list of bundlers gives ample reason to believe that his administration would fall short of the Day One Agenda's bold proposals. Consider, for example, the numerous ways the next president could 'Overhaul the Business of Wall Street[4],' from breaking up too-big-to-fail banks to forcing divestiture from carbon (and much, much more). But, look at Biden's biggest fundraisers, and these proposals start to seem less attainable. People like Erskine Bowles[5], who served as Bill Clinton's chief of staff but now sits on the board of Morgan Stanley, are unlikely to support any effort to have the Federal Reserve use its authority to divide up the nation's largest banks[6]. Worse still, they'll likely have the opportunity to discourage the President's team from appointing hard-charging Fed governors in favor of more business-friendly picks. Other Wall Streeters bundling for Biden include Andy Cohen of the hedge fund Greenoaks Capital, Wells Fargo's former chair of 'corporate responsibility[7]' Federico Pe\u00f1a (who was Bill Clinton's energy secretary) and Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers alumnus Mark Gilbert (who was made ambassador to New Zealand under Obama).[Yes, you read right\u2014Wells Fargo[8] had a 'chair of corporate responsibility.' Next we'll learn Fox News has a fact checker!]Bank consolidation is not the only thing Biden's list suggests we will be stuck with. It would seem unlikely that financial regulators would take advantage of the tools at their disposal to get the country divested from carbon[9] with people like Michael Collier, Biden fundraiser and fossil fuel financier[10], in the next administration (or exerting influence over it). As an aside, Biden signed a pledge[11] vowing to reject donations from the fossil fuel industry, though he's likely to sidestep that the same way Pete Buttigieg has[12], arguing that Collier is merely an investor in fossil fuels, not a producer of them. This may not pass our laugh test, but so far it's been good enough for the bundler-heavy candidates in this primary.Presidents have tremendous power to enact transformative change, and high-powered bundlers are well-positioned to threaten such an agenda. Aside from breaking up big banks, the next administration could stop, or even reverse, consolidation in other sectors as well. The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice still employs merger review guidelines[13] from 1982, the validity of which has been thoroughly debunked. The next administration could issue new ones that recognize the threat that rampant consolidation poses to our economic and political systems. This would, however, be unlikely to occur if some of Biden's bundlers were to land spots in his administration. Take for example Mark Angelson, who brags in his Biden foundation bio that he was 'a leader[14] of the transformation and consolidation of the printing industry.' Or there's Jon Fisher, a Silicon Valley investor known to counsel start-ups to try to be acquired[15], rather than grow into stand-alone companies.Consider also the support Biden is receiving from private-equity bigwigs like Alan Patricof, Sanjeev Mehra, and Anthony Gardner (who was made ambassador to the EU under Obama). The next president would have the power to unilaterally curb some of the industry's abuses and undercut its profitability. For example, under existing authority, the IRS and the SEC may be able to close the carried-interest loophole, from which the industry profits handsomely[16]. If bundlers like Patricof have anything to say about it, however, it's unlikely to happen.The next president could also make it easier for hundreds of thousands of workers to join a union by reversing a Trump-era rule[17] that prevents home healthcare workers from having union dues automatically deducted from their Medicaid-funded wages. But, here too there is reason to doubt that Biden would follow through. A look at Biden's list of bundlers reveals that he received early, enthusiastic support from Stephen Cozen[18], founder and chairman of the union-busting[19] law firm Cozen O'Connor.With over 200 individuals and couples[20] on Biden's list, this exploration could go on for many more pages. I could talk, for instance, about how support from Bart Friedman[21], a lawyer who has represented numerous pharmaceutical companies and sits on the board of the biotechnology company Ovid, casts doubt on a Biden administration's willingness to use 'march in' rights[22] to claim pharmaceutical patents and lower drug prices. Or I could enumerate the many ways[23] in which the private equity industry could protect or expand its markets by exerting influence over the next administration. I could even point out Biden's excessively narrow vision of his promise not to take money from lobbyists\u2014his bundler Joseph Falk openly brags about his lobbying experience[24], but since the money he has raised was technically donated by other people, Biden can still claim that he's free of lobbyist influence. Without going into all of that, however, two things should by now be clear: Presidents have tremendous power to enact transformative change, and high-powered bundlers are well-positioned to threaten such an agenda.None of this is preordained. Should Biden win the nomination, it is not a given that he will appoint people from among the ranks of his bundlers, nor even that he will consult with fundraisers in making his choices. Public pressure to disavow such figures could ensure that the next administration is instead staffed with qualified, steadfast fighters for the public interest.For that to happen, however, media outlets need to pay attention to the realities of presidential power, and ask questions that elucidate how candidates would wield it. When the media obsesses over a candidate's position on legislation they can't pass\u2014or worse, on the zingers[25] that campaign speechwriters pen in part to deliberately distract\u2014it ignores the substantive issues that will take up the vast majority of a president's time.Each president must fill thousands of positions throughout the executive branch, set enforcement priorities, institute new regulations, and much more. Voters need information about how candidates think about those topics to choose a president who will work in their interest. Researching a campaign's most influential fundraisers would be a good place to start.

Price supports for farmers, regulatory interventions and outright state funding for innovation through the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency among others have all helped shape what consumer goods are profitable to produce and popular with the American public.</p><p>This was particularly true for tobacco products in the 20th century, as Sarah Milov expertly demonstrates in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Cigarette</emphasis>. The rising popularity of smoking and the economic livelihoods of southern tobacco farmers in the first part of the century owed their success to government support, while the rapid decline in smoking owed much to public interest groups who fought for regulatory and legal intervention. Tobacco had helped shape the American south from the colonial era on, and the region\u2019s political class used their clout to protect and preserve it.</p><p>The early part of the book focuses on the struggles of tobacco farmers to get a good price for their crop in the face of an oligopoly of buyers for cigarette companies. Tobacco was a key part of the New Deal plan to revitalise agriculture, as one of only a few farm products that could profitably be grown by small farmers, unlike corn and wheat. It also got a boost from both world wars by being included in soldiers\u2019 rations, and from the Marshall Plan to reconstruct Europe after the defeat of the Nazis.</p><p>Milov carefully traces how industry lobbyists helped ensure that US loans to recovering countries could be used to purchase American tobacco. The industry also benefited from the later Food for Peace programme that sought to inoculate Latin America and south-east Asia against the lure of communism by demonstrating the abundance that capitalism could bring. For many consumers, the Marlboro Man came to symbolise not just Philip Morris\u2019s brand of cigarettes but also the American dream.</p><p>\u201cCigarettes were a product par excellence of the postwar consumers\u2019 republic [and] the reorientation of American political and economic life around consumption,\u201d Milov writes.</p><p>The best part of the book comes when the tide turns and Milov introduces the anti-smoking activists who lead the fight against tobacco, changing the image of smoking from that of a cool, luxurious reward to a filthy habit that sapped productivity and damaged lives.</p><p>The battle is joined in the 1960s and 1970s, when John Banzhaf, a young lawyer, takes on the tobacco companies by trying to force television broadcasters to provide \u201cequal time\u201d for anti-smoking messages to counter cigarette advertisements. From there, his Action on Smoking and Health project sought to use the courts and regulation to limit smoking on aeroplanes and other public spaces.</p><p>Maryland housewife and mother Clara Gouin opted for a grassroots approach. Milov describes how Gouin grew tired of encountering smoke everywhere she went and lay awake at night thinking \u201cwhat doormats non-smokers were\u201d. So she used $50 saved from her grocery money to print buttons with an anti-smoking message and founded the Group Against Smoking Pollution in 1971. \u201cGasp\u201d chapters sprang up around the country to lobby for non-smokers\u2019 rights.</p><p>And then there is Donna Shrimp, the New Jersey customer service representative, who fought in court for her right to a smoke-free workplace and became a consultant to businesses who wanted help managing the issue in their offices.</p><p>Portraits like these help show how the anti-smoking movement was able to put America in the forefront of the developed world\u2019s effort to restricting smoking. Given the vivid descriptions of the activists and some of the government officials who helped them, it is a pity that Milov spends so little time on the cigarette makers themselves. They are the bad guys, who exploit the farmers, deny the harm their product causes and fight any restrictions. But we never really get to know most of them.</p><p>Despite this omission, Milov offers insights into the way tobacco companies and their lobbyists exploited America\u2019s federal system to slow down and weaken efforts to cut cigarette use despite growing evidence of the harm it causes. When cities enacted tough bans on smoking in workplaces and restaurants, the companies went to the state capitals and lobbied for weaker statewide restrictions that pre-empted the local rules. Other public interest groups that are seeking to use state and local rules to rein in opioid makers and Big Tech should take note.</p><p>If you are looking for a case study in how regulation and politics shape the US consumer market, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Cigarette</emphasis> more than meets the bill.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0674241215?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0674241215\"> The Cigarette: A Political History</url></emphasis>, by Sarah Milov, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Harvard, RRP$28.95, 395 pages</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Join our online book group on Facebook at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"> FT Books Cafe</url>.

On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones indices both dropped by about four per cent by the market close. The catalyst for this significant market correction is concern over rising inflation, as western economies experience a \"synchronised upturn\" and their labour markets have less slack to absorb additional demand without needing to increase prices.</p><p>This triggers market fear that a decade of cheap money - characterised by near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing programmes - is ending once and for all. The expectations of interest rate rises pushes up bond yields, triggering a repricing of equity prices as an investment substitute. Higher interest rates also mean that a higher discount rates will be used when making equity valuations.</p><p>Even though it is widely expected that western central banks will embark on monetary policy normalisation in a gradual, well-announced manner, an eight-year bull run in stock markets is probably ripe for any trigger to spur a market correction.</p><p>Indeed, the fact that the S&amp;P 500 had reached new highs earlier this year while the VIX index, a measure of market volatility, remained at historic lows last month, even as the US federal government shut down, was an example of the decoupling between risks to market and the market's response to risks.</p><p>But the symptoms of the hangover from a prolonged era of ultra-loose monetary policy continue. The abundance of cheap money has also led to a misallocation of resources, as forbearance has allowed zombie companies to be kept alive, while low rates have lowered the price of borrowing and contributed to an increase in debt.</p><p>Several regulators, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, called out repricing of risk premia and debt sustainability as some of the key risks to financial stability in the year ahead. The European Banking Authority further assumed the most adverse conditions yet in its 2018 stress testing scenario based on the materialisation of these risks.</p><p>Cyber risk is another systemic threat to financial stability identified by multiple regulators.</p><p>Mass data breaches and intentional manipulation of online platforms challenged the digital economy in 2017. In 2018, cyber security will become the undercurrent across technology, business and political concerns.</p><p>The financial industry is particularly vulnerable. Professional cyber criminals are after high-value targets such as banks, while state-sponsored activities are now adding to the growing array of cyber crimes. The banking system is ill-prepared to cope with these new threats and cyber crimes.</p><p>So while Brexit grabs the headlines, keep a close eye on the global issues currently playing out that will shape the financial industry's risk agenda in the years to come.</p><p>\u00a3 Kuangyi Wei is head of research at Parker Fitzgerald.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-134344570</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RKG-8W31-JBVM-Y256-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"702\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 City A.M.

They ran Google's new campus out of Berlin. Now, in Toronto, #BlockSidewalk wants to send Google--and their new \"smart city\" packing. As the techlash is slowly becoming organized, the battle against Big Tech has emerged as the new front in the fight for the right to the city.</p><p>It was the most unusual town hall Toronto had seen in years. Even after the venue was moved to a 498-seat theatre to accommodate demand, registration filled up almost a week in advance and the rush lineup stretched around the corner. Yes, a rush lineup. For a community town hall. At the first Sidewalk Toronto Community Town Hall on November 1, 2017, the municipal was sexy again.</p><p>Inside, a veritable who's who of Toronto's urbanist, policy wonk, political, innovation, tech, and start-up scenes milled about. There was a hum of excitement as everyone prepared to hear about Sidewalk Labs' vision for \"the neighbourhood of the future.\" And outside the glass walls of the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, activists from Toronto ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, a national organization of low- and moderate-income families) chanted slogans in support of affordable housing.</p><p>From the very beginning, Sidewalk Labs' venture has been marked by protest. The project to build a so-called \"smart city\" on Toronto's eastern waterfront has attracted considerable controversy and criticism since it was announced during a 2017 press conference featuring the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Sidewalk's parent company, Alphabet. The project to be built at Quayside, a 12-acre slice of mostly undeveloped land, is unprecedented in its vision. Never before have so many elements of urban techno-utopia been assembled together in quite this fashion, at least in North America: self-driving vehicles, underground waste-disposal robots, \"dynamic streets\" with road markings that change depending on the time of the day, digital electricity systems. Given that Sidewalk Labs is a sister company to Google, the first set of concerns centred around data, privacy, and surveillance. Over the last year and a half, as the process has unfolded, a far more familiar yet even more complex set of concerns has emerged: governance, privatization, and gentrification.</p><p>The primary innovation in this project hasn't been a smart device that improves the quality of urban life; it's been the private-public-private partnership between Sidewalk Labs and Waterfront Toronto, itself a quasi-public corporation with limited accountability. The agreement, first signed in October 2017 and updated in July 2018, converts the role of Sidewalk from vendor to partner, with a wide-ranging mandate for issues such as economic development, housing affordability, environmental sustainability, and--perhaps most dangerously - privacy and data governance. In effect, this means that Sidewalk is helping develop the policies to which it is itself subject. This goes beyond a mere conflict of interest to a case of regulatory capture, where a private actor amasses considerable influence in directing the nature and function of regulations that should only be established through a public and democratically accountable process.</p><p>Sidewalk is also investing $50 million into this process, helping pay for Waterfront staff working on the file. This murky relationship between Sidewalk and Waterfront means that Sidewalk has a share in the intellectual property that will be developed through this project, and it is able to use Toronto as a testing ground for products and services that it will eventually market around the world. It means that Sidewalk has been able to drive the narrative about this project from the beginning. It means that Toronto's residents get to see a new chapter of urban entrepreneurialism unfolding as the stewards of its waterfront welcome corporate capital under the guise of innovation.</p><p>This sleight of hand has not been missed by Torontonians who pay attention to such issues--it has been subject to vociferous critique and questioning by a slew of local residents and community groups who have pushed politicians and journalists to pay attention. In February, this resistance, led by open government advocate Bianca Wylie, materialized in the form of #BlockSidewalk, a group calling for a shutdown of the Quayside development project (I have been supporting the campaign from its inception). The project has also received significant international attention from urbanists, policy-makers, and academics around the world, becoming a crucible for concerns about smart cities and the potential for technology to become a Trojan Horse for privatization.</p><p>Indeed, the story of Quayside is only the latest chapter in a series of struggles between communities and Big Tech that are emerging in cities around the world. At the turn of the year, community groups in New York City, particularly Queens, rallied to fight against Amazon's much-vaunted new corporate headquarters, HO2, that was to be built in Long Island City, emerging victorious. In Berlin, locals successfully protested a new Google Campus start-up hub in the Kreuzberg district, forcing the company to give the space to two non-profits. This is to say nothing of the past five years of regulators', tenants', and workers' struggles against the deeply pernicious effects of ride-sharing, short-term rentals, and the so-called gig economy. The battle against Big Tech has now decisively emerged as a new front in the fight for the right to the city.</p><p>Communities and corporations have been battling for generations, but this new round is remarkable because of both the nature of the corporate actors and their ambitions. Whereas urban activists have previously mostly contended with well-established actors like real estate developers or big-box supermarkets, now they face relatively young Silicon Valley technology giants: Google, Amazon, Airbnb, Uber, and more. These are companies defined more by their valuations than by their actual wealth; they are notable more for their intangible than tangible assets; and they are dominant in digital arenas first, physical arenas second. Their most loyal clients tend to be liberal-leaning urbanites under 35 who grew up with technology seamlessly stitched into their everyday lives.</p><p>These tech giants are now encroaching on the streets in very tangible, but fairly diverse, ways. Uber and Lyft have undercut taxi industry regulations and driven people away from public transit; Airbnb has advanced gentrification by crowding out long-term rentals in squeezed housing markets; Amazon upended the economic development paradigm when it launched an auction for cities to compete to host its next headquarters; Sidewalk Labs wants to disrupt the neighbourhood itself.</p><p>This disruption looks like a deeper form of quantified technocratic governance, enabled by Big Data. By installing sensors across the urban environment, as well as by tapping into existing unprotected sources such as mobile phones, both public and private entities are able to collect and analyze unprecedented amounts of data. Beyond the privacy issues that this opens up, there is a broader concern about governments making decisions solely on the basis of statistics. As Lorraine Chuen writes in CUTS Magazine, data and statistics have long been used in urban planning for policing and surveillance of racialized people in Canada. Indeed, the Toronto police have already been using facial recognition technology for surveillance and profiling for over a year. And in 2018, Toronto police proposed the \"ShotSpotter\" system, which would install microphones around the city to detect the locations of gunshots. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association responded that \"if placed in poor or diverse neighbourhoods, the new technology may be an unconstitutional sucker punch to racialized communities of Toronto.\" The technology was eventually scrapped over concerns that it may violate Charter rights, as well as the simple fact that it doesn't work.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs has already produced and implemented its own surveillance mechanisms, in the form of free Wi-Fi kiosks in New York City and London that feature cameras and microphones. Its current efforts in Toronto seem to be even more expansive, carrying out research and development so that it can become the market leader for managing information flows and deploying technologies, if not outright controlling the \"digital layer\" for cities.</p><p>Residents have been concerned about Sidewalk's plans ever since the partnership with Waterfront Toronto was announced. They asked about the kind of data that Google expected to collect, the technologies it would use, and the privacy policies that residents could expect. They asked about the governance of the project and the business model, worried about the extraction and monetization of personal data.</p><p>Sidewalk initially promised openness, releasing a public engagement plan in February 2018 touting collaboration and co-creation to \"imagine this new neighbourhood together.\" Despite an impressive array of activities that included public roundtables, design jams, neighbourhood meetings, and a physical showcase for urban living technologies at its headquarters on 307 Lake Shore Boulevard East, however, it provided only carefully crafted messages and vague responses to questions. The company repeatedly told residents that the details were being worked out and that they should wait for the plan. As housing activist and #BlockSidewalk member Melissa Goldstein explains, \"Sidewalk hasn't presented anything concrete. How do you oppose that?\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Sidewalk pushed forward its own agenda; instead of addressing data governance, it talked about parks and public spaces. When it did share proposals, it preferred to present already-fleshed-out ideas with little room for debate, leaving conversations with residents to be a largely performative exercise. A former Sidewalk Toronto employee, who asked that their name remain private, tells me this was intentional, and explains that facilitators at the 307 offices had expressed their frustration to senior management but were told to stonewall questioners.</p><p>As a result, Sidewalk's \"engagement\" has felt one-sided and inauthentic to many residents, ranging somewhere between placation to outright manipulation in Sherry Arnstein's classic ladder formulation of citizen engagement. In addition, and contrary to what was agreed upon, Sidewalk Labs has led most of the public engagement so far, with Waterfront Toronto often anonymous or muted.</p><p>Take the example of CommonSpace. In October 2018, Sidewalk proposed the creation of a \"civic data trust,\" an independent entity charged with data stewardship. When it presented this proposal to Waterfront (featuring a Freudian slip about the role of the private sector in developing public policy), Sidewalk insisted that this was only a proposal and it wouldn't actually carry out any data collection or test any technologies on Torontonians without sharing those plans in advance. Yet less than two months later, it was revealed that Sidewalk had in fact both developed as well as prototyped an app called CommonSpace, which collected data on people who visited R.V. Burgess Park in the Thorncliffe Park neighbourhood, where most residents tend to be Black and brown new immigrants. Sidewalk had worked with two local non-profits and had collected and analyzed data on Torontonians in violation of its own proposed protocols.</p><p>This dance has played out over and over since October 2017; as a result, an increasing number of actors have lost their patience with Sidewalk and, more significantly, Waterfront Toronto, ostensibly the protector of the public interest in this project. Julie Di Lorenzo, a real estate developer, resigned from Waterfront's board due to concerns about Waterfront Toronto's independence in July 2018, the day before the new \"Plan Development Agreement\" was signed; Saadia Muzaffar, of Waterfront's Digital Strategy Advisory Panel, quit in October when she felt the organization was not taking concerns seriously, and joined #BlockSidewalk. Ann Cavoukian, Ontario's former Information and Privacy Commissioner who had been working as an advisor to Sidewalk Labs, also quit in October when Sidewalk Labs refused to follow her recommendations to protect privacy. In December, Ontario's Auditor General released a scathing report on Waterfront Toronto's process of awarding the contract to Sidewalk and the mandate of the project, after which the Ontario government fired three board members from Waterfront, including the chair and the interim CEO. More recently, in April, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association launched a lawsuit against Waterfront and all levels of government, challenging the agreement between Waterfront and Sidewalk.</p><p>While governing bodies try to get their bearings in a regulatory environment where data, technology, privacy, and intellectual property policies are still open questions, and while residents are distracted by shiny demos, Sidewalk has been moving forward with its own plans. It has been engaging in a whirlwind of lobbying, with dozens of lobbyists registered at all levels of government--in April it was named the most active lobbyist in Toronto by a distance. Sidewalk's delay in presenting the plan for Quayside has worked to its advantage, buying the corporation time to increase its influence. In an especially naked move, Sidewalk hired former city councillor Mary-Margaret McMahon as its \"director of community,\" presumably also putting up a \"conflict of interest\" sign on April Fool's Day.</p><p>These events reveal a pattern of Sidewalk weaponizing ambiguity, playing divide-and-conquer, and co-opting critique, mirroring the strategies used by other tech giants such as Uber and Airbnb. Their strategic foundation places a heavy emphasis on marketing and direct-to-consumer public relations, relying on the halo of innovation and progress that the tech industry has long worn. As scholar Molly Sauter has described, Sidewalk's charming, playful images of the future, released on a regular basis and republished with nary a critical eye by news editors across the country, function as \"materials of persuasion, not collaboration.\"</p><p>These images have been accompanied by progressive language borrowed from revered urbanists like Jane Jacobs and Jan Gehl at every turn: \"streets for people,\" \"human-centred design,\" \"public realm,\" \"neighbourhood well-being,\" \"social infrastructure,\" \"inclusive economic development.\" Early on, Sidewalk emphasized its plan to build with \"tall timber\" making load-bearing structures out of wood, not steel--while minimizing Replica, its tool to harvest location data from cellphones. This reflects a conscious effort by the company to shift the focus away from technology and bolster its credentials as a city-building force, not the sister company to Silicon Valley giant Google. To urban geographer Thorben Wieditz, who is part of the #BlockSidewalk campaign, this is deeply ironic. \"Jane Jacobs was a critic of modern rational comprehensive planning techniques. If you think about what [Sidewalk Labs] is proposing, using big data, it is putting those people Jacobs was critiquing on steroids. We're not engaging people anymore, we're sitting on a computer and calculating sidewalk use.\"</p><p>Relationships have been key. Since arriving in October 2017, Sidewalk has courted every imaginable demographic, using all of the earmarked $11.2 million budgeted for communications and a further $2.5 million budgeted for pilots \"to familiarize Torontonians\"--that is, press flesh across the city. There was the Sidewalk Toronto Fellows Program that took a dozen millennials on urbanist tours of cities like Amsterdam and Boston; the Residents Reference Panel with 36 participants engaging in regular meetings over nine months; six advisory working groups, each with about a dozen members; ten small grants to university faculty and graduate students in Ontario; and even a summer kids' camp for children between the ages of 9 and 12.</p><p>Many of the Torontonians selected were not random; most members of the advisory working groups, for instance, represent celebrated urbanists and community builders from all walks of life, many of whom have remained silent as criticism of Sidewalk has grown across the city.</p><p>Wieditz also talks about how the financial clout of Alphabet has proven handy. \"You're not dealing with a rational opponent --they can lose millions of dollars if they want to.\" By offering something to everyone, from construction jobs to affordable housing, \"they can co-opt [dissent] in a way that traditional actors cannot,\" he adds. \"It takes a while for progressives to get a handle on these actors.\"</p><p>It's hard to shake the feeling that Toronto's residents and institutions have been played. In return for engaging, Torontonians got their voices erased and literally minimized, with dissenting views dismissed as \"minority reports\" and placed in smaller font sizes in the report of the Resident Reference Panel. Waterfront Toronto, already struggling to fulfill its mandate, took a risk and has since found itself increasingly marginalized in its own smart city project as it struggles to be equal partners with the global technology juggernaut that is Alphabet.</p><p>All of this came to a head in February, when it was leaked that Sidewalk intended to develop a much larger chunk of land than the 12 acres of Quayside, and that it planned to recoup its investment in part by claiming a portion of the city's property taxes. Not only did this galvanize a new round of community outrage and spark the interest of most Toronto city council members for the first time, but it also initiated the formation of #BlockSidewalk. With Toronto on a crash course with what the city manager called a \"fiscal iceberg,\" Sidewalk's proposal to receive a cut of the city's dwindling revenues in exchange for building a light rail transit line along the waterfront was a clear move toward privatization. \"At the same time the city budget keeps shrinking, we're inviting a trillion-dollar corporation to take over our land,\" notes Wieditz.</p><p>Over the past year, there have been a number of efforts to build public awareness of the project and coordinate the fragmented opposition that exists. Wylie has been tirelessly writing about the unfolding fiasco and helped launch groups like Tech Reset Canada and the Toronto Open Smart Cities Forum; a discussion on alternative urban futures organized by Nasma Ahmed of the Digital Justice Lab brought together community groups and academics to strategize about how Toronto could respond to smart city visions. While these efforts attracted limited attention from local media, they have mobilized dissatisfied Torontonians and paved the way for the creation of the #BlockSidewalk campaign, which provides a platform for residents to organize around, and has stated a clear goal: to shut down the project altogether.</p><p># BlockSidewalk represents a break from traditional activism in the city. Its lead organizers, members, and supporters do not come from the left with a common language or a consensus on tactics. This isn't a group of seasoned advocates with experience in political campaigns; this is a motley crew drawn from ordinary residents, technology workers, scholars, and policy analysts who are keenly aware of the threat of a wholly digitized public sphere. For a newly politicized group, questions of leadership and internal communication are as unresolved as grander questions of strategy and tactics. A few weeks after the campaign launched, Goldstein talked about the difficulties: \"Everything was spur of the moment; we had no time to prepare before launching.\"</p><p>The scope and issues at play also differ. The most successful urban campaigns tend to be local, grounded in neighbourhood-level issues like affordable housing and transit. In the case of Quayside, which doesn't have any existing residents, organizers are confronted both with a new opponent and the lack of a natural constituency. \"Nobody considers the Port Lands their neighbourhood. People aren't personally invested in the outcome,\" says Goldstein. Unsurprisingly, convincing existing organizations to join has been a significant challenge. As Ontario's new Conservative government has battered the province with a series of cuts to social services and other government functions, most activists have been focused on protecting existing infrastructure.</p><p>While all organizing entails political education, #BlockSidewalk has the unenviable task of introducing and translating concepts such as public technology infrastructure and surveillance capitalism, and describing the dangers of handing private companies control over the \"operating system\" of the city. It has to focus the attention of Torontonians on the key issues, avoiding obfuscation and pushing back against the narrative that technology is inherently progressive. \"It's been difficult to convey how Sidewalk Labs may impact Torontonians and progressive space,\" says Wieditz. Goldstein agrees: \"It's hard for people--unless they're following the nitty-gritty--to understand what's upsetting about this. To explain this is hard.\"</p><p>Yet at the same time, #BlockSidewalk may point toward future directions for organizing, as the need to respond to Big Tech opens up both new questions and possibilities for progressive activists. There is the challenge of engaging existing communities on new issues, but also the opportunity of engaging new communities on some very old issues. For example, the question of how to challenge widely used service providers like Uber or Airbnb is the flip side of the question of how to build broad support for public transportation and residential housing stock while protecting the livelihoods of taxi drivers and hotel workers. The struggle over Quayside has also revealed fissures in the urbanist community in Toronto, a city that has experienced deepening exclusion, segregation and inequity in recent years. Presentations by prominent urbanists to the Toronto City Council in early June demonstrate strong differences in opinion regarding the Quayside project.</p><p>This is where unions, still the largest membership-based organizations in major North American cities, should play a more central role, says Wieditz. While local media focuses on data and privacy, Sidewalk Labs also creates issues that organized labour has traditionally pushed back against, like the privatization of future revenue sources, municipal services, and public land. These issues have powerful implications for workers and communities. As large collective actors, unions can help us to build the organizing capacity needed to deal with Big Tech and the questions it presents. There is huge potential in urban politics and community organizing for unions to matter outside of workplaces, for the labour movement to build density, and to renew itself.</p><p>In the case of Quayside, stopping Sidewalk's smart city project could be the precursor to a larger conversation about the future of Toronto's waterfront. Bringing together different groups that were formerly narrowly focused on their own issues --housing, transit, employment--to challenge a corporate utopia can lead to an exciting debate around what alternative urban futures look like.</p><p>For now, #BlockSidewalk is focused on lobbying Waterfront Toronto to cancel the project. \"We're not here to negotiate,\" Wieditz tells me. \"We have an uncompromising position against an irrational player: we want to send Google packing.\"</p><p>ART BY MICHAEL DEFORGE</p><p>NABEEL AHMED is a researcher and consultant on smart cities and social enterprise, and is a member of the Toronto Open Smart Cities Forum and Jamhoor.

Malone</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">08-10-2020</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">University of Miami business experts examine the implicationstransactional, ethical, and legalof the pending sale of the social networking site that shares short videos.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Microsoft is negotiating a possible purchase of TikTok, the wildly popular, short-form video app, in an unusual scenario in which the United States government intervenedfirst threatening a ban of the newest darling of the social media world and then inviting the U.S.-based tech giant to buy it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government set a deadline of Sept. 15 for the transaction to take place. Media reports indicated that TikTok plans to sue the Trump administrationas soon as this weekchallenging his executive order banning the service from the U.S.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This could be a good deal for Microsoft, depending on the price that they pay and what they intend to do with it, said Tarek Sayed, a University of Miami alumnus and a business technology lecturer in the Miami Herbert Business School.</p><p>The names of other buyers have been circulated, but Microsoft is the leading contender for a host of reasons, not the least of which is that it appears to be the government's hand-picked favorite. Yet the saleand its potentially colossal price tagcarries an abundance of risk.</p><p>I am not convinced that just because TikTok went viral, that any company should spend $50 billion on it. Why hand them the money? asked Sayed, who is also associate director of software architecture at the School of Law. It will be like many other apps that are forgotten after a time. But again, Microsoft has been looking for something sexy in the consumer space. This might be a way to attract youngsters and compete with Apple, Google, and Facebook, but at $50 billion?</p><p>The announcement of a possible ban of the app in the United States prompted an uproar amid the TikTok faithfulthe company claims 30 million monthly active U.S. users who spend an average 46 minutes a day on the app. Forty-two percent are ages 18 to 24, and 27 percent are ages 13 to 17.</p><p>The U.S. government alleges that ByteDance shares information with the Chinese governmenta allegation it has deniedand charged in early July that the company had violated its agreement to protect children's privacy. Media reports suggested that a ban of the immensely popular app could have repercussions politically.</p><p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an interagency body chaired by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, confirmed that it launched an investigation of ByteDance in November 2019 for possible violations. The agency, which includes representatives of 16 agenciesincluding Defense, State, and Homeland Securityreviews transactions for national security risk.</p><p>Established in 1975 amid fears that wealthy Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries companies would buy U.S. firms, CFIUS has seen its powers expanded over time. Legislation spurred by the current administration, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, further broadened the agency's powers and those of the president to address security concerns, especially relating to Chinese firms investing in U.S. high-tech companies, as reported by the Congressional Research Service.</p><p>According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a U.S.-based think tank, CFIUS reviewed 552 transactions between 2015 and 2017 and more than 25 percent were China-basedthe most by far of any country.</p><p>Joan Martinez-Evora, a lecturer in the Business Law Department, emphasized the ethical considerations of the unfolding scenario and drew attention to the two executive orders issued in early August that threaten to ban TikTok based on national security concerns relating to the International Emergency Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act.</p><p>On one hand, arguments have been made that TikTok data collection practices are standard in the industry and that it is really a security and privacy concern for the few in the greater pool of TikTok clients, such as U.S. government officials, political dissidents, and U.S. military personnel, but not so much for ordinary U.S. citizens and youth, Martinez-Evora pointed out.</p><p>Both in business and in law, Martinez-Evora has studied ethical considerations. He addressed the fact that business transactionsespecially global ones of massive scaleoften transcend the economic into the political arena.</p><p>We have to be careful with those greater good analysis in international business ethics' because then we are forgetting the justice element, he cautioned.</p><p>It's true that we are talking about millions of users of TikTok, and the monetary gains may be rewarding. But at what cost? Martinez-Evora asked. He referred specifically to the Chinese government's suppression of political dissidents in China and Hong Kong, the ethnic oppression of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, and the spreading of disinformation.</p><p>The ends do not justify the means, he noted.</p><p>Some principles are just universalhumans and businesses have virtues, values, and freedoms, said Martinez-Evora. When state-owned businesses like TikTok and Huawei [also accused by the U.S. of aiding Chinese government spying efforts] are used as means to achieve the wrong goalsto become the next global economic superpowerother businesses, the country, and the world is certainly not better off.</p><p>Sayed suggested that the threatened ban appears more a tactic than a potential reality.</p><p>The ban or executive order doesn't add much. It steps up the pressure on the company to finish the transaction, but there are consequential legal and constitutional issues that may arise, he said. The more likely scenario if negotiations fail is to add the company to the Commerce Department's Entity List and prevent U.S. companies from doing business with them, including Apple and Google.</p><p>The other major issue in the scenario pertains to data protection, Sayed stated.</p><p>If we're going to start down the road of data privacy, we will have to look at all the social media apps then, he said You can say that any device or app that is connected to the Internet is a national security threat. And, you can even extend that argument to some U.S. companies if they happen to share data access with employees who are foreign nationals working in an International subsidiary.</p><p>By and large, data privacy has been left to the consumerat least up until now.</p><p>The U.S. doesn't have an overarching privacy framework, Sayed pointed out. We put responsibility on the consumer instead of restricting or regulating businesses, with the exception of a few sectorshealth, banking, and education. The idea is, let's not overregulate, so we don't choke industries and innovations.</p><p>He also referred to the recent hearings where the big tech companiesAmazon, Apple, Facebook, and Googlewere grilled by members of both parties of the House antitrust subcommittee regarding their market powers.</p><p>Competition practices is one of the issues that Microsoft is going to have to worry about in this acquisition, he said. But they have stayed clear of any of those issues in recent times. They are probably the only company who could get in and make an offer on TikTok nicely and cleanly.''</p><p>ByteDance spent $1 billion in November 2017 to acquire the Chinese-headquartered and U.S.-based social video app Musical.ly. The company merged the platform with TikTok in August 2018 to create the world's largest short-video app.</p><p>TikTok stands to be a big winner if the sale progresses, Sayed suggested.</p><p>This is a great opportunity for TikTok, Sayed remarked. Who gets a price like this and says no? Unless the Chinese government has other views, and we don't know that yet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123882768</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KH-FJ21-JCBF-S026-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1282\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But shared computing has its own risks</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the annual Sibos conference in London in September, alongside the usual exhibitors-global banks, fintechs and financial-software providers-attendees also encountered representatives from Big Tech companies such as Amazon and Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While these giants are relative newcomers to global banking and financial services, the large global banks have long feared that Big Tech might one day eat their lunch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indeed, Google and Amazon have launched their own payment solutions, but they weren't touting these at Sibos. Instead, they were eagerly talking up their web services and cloud computing divisions, which provide shared computing and hosting services.</p><p>Along with Microsoft's Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google are positioned as leaders in worldwide cloud infrastructure as a service, according to research consultantcy Gartner. In financial services, digital-first challenger banks like the UK's Monzo and Starling, and the US's Capital One, are case studies for AWS, which pioneered infrastructure as a service back in 2006.</p><p>Increasingly, financial-services firms are shutting down their data centers and moving computing to shared space. Goldman Sachs, which reportedly was buying computing as a service as early as 2016, uses AWS to manage risk and meet internal demand for computing power.</p><p>HSBC noted the benefits of moving to the cloud amid \"capacity challenges\" in its data centers and, in 2018, HSBC expanded its use of Google Cloud services. This year, the bank was an early customer of Google Cloud's new Anthos service, which enables a hybrid approach by managing services onpremises or in the cloud or as workloads running on third-party cloud services like Microsoft and AWS.</p><p>\"High-performance computing is a popular use case for cloud computing,\" says Ian Massingham, director of Developer Technology and Evangelism at AWS. \"These supercomputing clusters can be expensive for banks to run on their own, especially if they are underutilized.\"</p><p>Most challenger banks' technology stack is run entirely in the cloud. But until now, mainstream banks have typically shied away from \"public cloud\" providers such as AWS, citing data privacy and security concerns. Some banks have opted instead for privatecloud solutions using dedicated infrastructure on- or off-premises, or hybrid solutions that combine public and private cloud solutions.</p><p>NEW RISKS FOR OLD</p><p>Are mainstream banks wise to be skeptical of public cloud solutions? The cloud provides flexibility, but the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says it can also introduce risks that need to be identified, monitored and mitigated. \"These risks primarily affect the degree of control exercised by the firm and specific issues such as data security,\" the regulator states in its guidance for financial-services firms looking to outsource IT. Cloud customers have less control of the degree to which they can tailor the service and less control of the data, such as where it's stored, the FCA cautions.</p><p>Earlier this year, in what was billed as one of the largest-ever banking data breaches, the account information of Capital One's US and Canadian customers was hacked by a software engineer who previously worked at AWS, which provided cloud infrastructure to the bank.</p><p>The Capital One data breach prompted members of the US House Committee on Financial Services to call for cloud services to be placed under \"an appropriate and enforced regulatory regime.\" Other technology providers have voiced concerns about current data-protection methods in the cloud, such as anonymization.</p><p>The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) also recently published a list of recommendations to help public cloud computing realize its full potential across the capital markets. It outlined several barriers to adoption, including legacy IT complexity, security implications, regulatory concerns, a lack of standardization among cloud providers and long-term considerations such as concentration risk.</p><p>Even providers caution that companies can't sidestep their own responsibilities by shifting applications and IT resources to the cloud. \"We are only responsible for certain aspects of the [IT] stack,\" says Massingham of AWS. \"We're quite explicit about the responsibilities of financial-services providers who are regulated entities.\"</p><p>One of those responsibilities is to ensure their cloud provider has a high level of resiliency, adds Adrian Poole, head of Financial Services in the UK and Ireland for Google Cloud. \"They should also have an exit strategy if something goes wrong,\" he says.</p><p>Despite the risks, the cost savings, agility and flexibility have made it almost too compelling for traditional banks to resist the call of the cloud. Cloud computing is definitely here to stay, but as the larger banks move both critical and noncritical applications to the cloud, they shouldn't expect a magic bullet. Cloud services providers are likely to come under increased regulatory scrutiny, and at the least, their customers will need to monitor these developments closely.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GFMAG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GFMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y02-YGN1-JC8V-40XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297150</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Global Finance Media, Inc.

It's like Alec Baldwin saying he's going to leave America every time a Republican's elected president. It just doesn't happen based on experience.\"</p><p>In the course of a couple of terms of government, Australia's burgeoning tech scene has gone from being lauded by a PM keen to hitch his wagon to an \"ideas boom\", to being swatted aside like an over-opinionated teenager who should shut up while the grown-ups are talking. Unsurprisingly the tech entrepreneurs don't like it one bit - neither should the broader population.</p><p>It is not in dispute that something needed to be done from a regulatory perspective to force the big technology platforms to up their game and enforce community standards. But, just as was the case with the encryption laws being rushed through on the last day before the Christmas parliamentary recess, these latest laws have been bundled together in a ridiculously short period, with scant consideration for unintended consequences.</p><p>The legislation is written in such an ambiguous way that it is unclear which individuals could face prosecution if offending content is not taken down quickly enough, or even what constitutes \"quickly enough\".</p><p>While it targets Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, there is nothing in the new laws that mean they couldn't be targeted at any company that has a website allowing the public to post content. Quite frankly, just as with the encryption laws, the new social media laws look more like political posturing than a well-thought-out plan to tackle a genuine problem.</p><p>Labor has again shown its lack of spine in standing up against under-cooked legislation, for fear of appearing weak, and the tech sector is left wondering what just happened.</p><p>However rather than simply Tweeting their dismay, this last few months should show the local tech and start-up scenes that they have a lot of work to do to make their voices heard louder in the corridors of power.</p><p>The Atlassian founders are doing the right thing in becoming more vocal on public interest issues, but they are too busy to do it on their own for the sector.</p><p>Those looking to get in on the act need to also get out from behind their keyboards and the start-up events bubble and think about how they can show their relevance to the broader population. Getting themselves on TV and in the mainstream media is one obvious step, but thinking about presence in the real world communities they serve is another.</p><p>It is undeniable the broader tech industry is suffering an image problem, brought about by the bad behaviour of giants such as Facebook. But they need to fight to remind the world they offer more hope for future prosperity than any other sector.</p><p>Tech scene is being swatted aside like an over-opinionated teenager</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc74twv63azme1mu84d5bi</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV5-8401-F0J6-J3GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

MADRIGAL</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In October 2016, then-President Barack Obama hosted a miniature version of the blowout tech conference South by Southwest, which the White House called\u00a0South by South Lawn. Obama, as\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0put it at the time, \"brought Silicon Valley to Washington.\" He even hinted that if he hadn't been president, he might have\u00a0become a venture capitalist. \"The conversations I have with Silicon Valley and with venture capital pull together my interests in science and organization in a way I find really satisfying,\" he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My, how times change! Most American politicians would not be caught consorting so openly with the technology industry these days. And now that big tech lacks top cover, government agencies are moving in. According to\u00a0new reports, Google and Apple face deeper investigation by the Department of Justice while the FTC takes on Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>At a broad ideological level, two things have happened. First, the idea of cyberspace, a\u00a0transnational, individualistic, largely unregulated, and freeplace that was not exactly located in any governmental domain, completely collapsed. Second, the\u00a0mythology of tech as the carrier of progress has imploded, just as it did for the robber barons of the late 19th century to usher in the trustbusting era. While big tech companies try to establish a new reason for their privileged treatment and existence (hint: screaming \"CHINA!\"), they are vulnerable to attacks on their business practices that suddenly make sense.</p><p>But these changes did not occur in the ether among particles of discourse. Over the last three years, an ecosystem of tech opponents has emerged and gained strength. Here's a catalog of the coalition that has pulled tech from the South Lawn into the trenches.</p><p>Angry Conservatives:\u00a0The biggest change, of course, came with the 2016 campaign and ultimate election of Donald Trump. Though Trump played the social-media game\u00a0with tremendous success, conservatives criticized the platforms during the campaign and have continued to do so\u00a0throughout the last two-and-a-half years. Most recently, the president announced that he was\u00a0collecting reports of social-media grievances. There has been a steady drumbeat over the same timeframe of stories about tech companies' left-leaning workforces, which conservatives have spun into a fable about how they are being suppressed. The\u00a0evidence is thin, but it seems plausible to most people, who believe the platforms\u00a0censor political viewpoints.</p><p>Disillusioned Liberal Tech Luminaries:\u00a0Alongside the conservative outrage machine, the biggest body blows that the tech industry has taken have come from disillusioned liberals who worked for those companies. While their specific critiques vary, most of them feel that the platforms aided and abetted the election of President Trump\u2014that is to say, roughly the opposite of the conservative critique above. Many have come to expand their criticisms to the basic mechanisms of the technology industry, from the former Googler Tristan Harris, who works on \"Time Well Spent,\" to the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, who has\u00a0called for the government to break the company up.</p><p>Antitrust Theoreticians:\u00a0The version of antitrust regulations that emerged in the 20th century held that consumer prices had to rise in order for monopolistic conditions to cause harm. That framing protected big tech companies like Google and Facebook, which give away their products to users. How can there be consumer harm if consumers are paying $0.00? But a new wave of antitrust scholars, now centered at the\u00a0Open Markets Institute, have\u00a0argued that this view is outdated\u00a0because free services can still be harmful to societies. They've opened the door to new attacks on the market power of big tech, and they've already gained adherents.</p><p>Democratic Presidential Candidates:\u00a0Headlined by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democratic presidential contenders have proven ready to tussle with big tech. Drawing on the new antitrust doctrine, Warren has\u00a0argued for breaking up the big tech firms\u00a0\"to restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last.\"</p><p>Rank-and-File Tech Workers:\u00a0For years and years, tech companies very rarely leaked. Workers were generally pretty happy, and corporate cultures discouraged talking with outsiders. That's changed. Now, all kinds of tech workers with different agendas\u2014from\u00a0James Damore types\u00a0to\u00a0anti\u2013sexual harassment campaigners\u00a0to\u00a0union organizers\u2014have begun to talk to the press, public or privately. The pressure has led to\u00a0important internal reforms, but also opened the companies up to new political attacks from a range of directions. All the leaks have\u00a0eroded the sense of impenetrability\u00a0that used to surround operations like Google.</p><p>Traditional Democratic Corporate Reformers:\u00a0Reining in corporate power has long been part of most Democratic politicians' agendas. But now, that zeal is often directed not just at Wall Street or automakers, but also tech companies. From his position as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Congressman Frank Pallone of New Jersey has repeatedly battled tech-company executives who have testified before him. He's a traditional Democratic establishment force, an ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and clearly sees the tech industry as the kind of corporate power that needs to be reined in, starting perhaps with new privacy regulations. \"We've been talking about it for years, yet nothing has been done to address the problem,\"\u00a0Pallone said at a February hearing. \"It's time that we move past the old model that protects the companies using our data and not the people.\"</p><p>Privacy Advocates:\u00a0It would be hard to argue that privacy advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have had too big of an impact on tech companies, even after\u00a0the Snowden revelations\u00a0gave them far more ammunition than they'd had in years past. Just look around at the data every person on Earth seems to be leaking. But the activists remain there in the background, pushing for reforms and calling out\u00a0tech industry lobbying. Their political alignments might\u00a0prove difficult to pin down, however, as more muscular government involvement runs counter to the foundational principles of most\u00a0early internet privacy proponents.</p><p>European Regulators:\u00a0Nobody has been harder on big tech than European regulators, who caused\u00a0quite a ruckus\u00a0with their\u00a0General Data Protection Regulation\u00a0(GDPR). However, the jury is still out on what the ultimate impact of the GDPR might be on tech firms and everyday users. Europeans have more control, but\u00a0big tech companies might be the real winners\u00a0(something tech companies have been whispering about many regulations). That said, it's hard to imagine that the Europeans are done battling American tech companies' dominance in European lives.</p><p>The Media Industry:\u00a0Having had its lunch eaten, its lunch money taken, and its person shoved into a toilet and a locker by big tech, the media industry\u00a0has begun to fight back. Across the board, the long-time frenemy relationship that most publishers tried to maintain with the big tech companies has soured. One thing to watch: With the Facebook wave receding and Google\u00a0solidifying its control over traffic, the media industry might start to find some love in their hearts for Google, while maintaining their open season on Facebook.</p><p>The Telecom Industry:\u00a0Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T might not be the most popular companies in the world, but the old-line telecoms know that big tech is their most important competitor. After years of\u00a0losing regulatory battles, they've begun to claw their way back. With the banner of mobile innovation now passing to 5G, it wouldn't be shocking to see them ramp up their efforts against the platform companies that use their networks.</p><p>Scholarly Tech Critics:\u00a0The technology industry has long had skeptics in the academy, but over the last five years, those researchers have landed many more blows, from many different angles. They've\u00a0exploded myths,\u00a0coined new language for problems, and\u00a0created rallying cries\u00a0for those inside and outside the industry. It would be impossible to catalog them all, but this sample gets at the breadth of the critiques: Shoshana Zuboff's\u00a0The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Evgeny Morozov's\u00a0To Save Everything Click Here, Zeynep Tufekci\u00a0in\u00a0The New York Times, Tim Wu's\u00a0The Attention Merchants, Cathy O'Neil's\u00a0Weapons of Math Destruction, Siva Vaidhyanathan's anti-paeans to\u00a0Google\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook, Frank Pasquale's\u00a0The Black Box Society, Safiya Umoja Noble's\u00a0Algorithms of Oppression, Sherry Turkle's\u00a0Reclaiming Conversation, Malkia Cyril's\u00a0powerful essays, and Jean Twenge's\u00a0alarming work on youth\u00a0and their relationship to technology.</p><p>Apple:\u00a0Of the big tech companies, Apple is the one that has the most at stake in the regulatory battles. On the one hand, they need the other giants to produce the apps that make an iPhone worth buying. On the other hand, anything that reduces their perceived value\u2014like, perhaps, corporate or government surveillance\u2014is bad. Apple can take the moral high ground in some ways because it doesn't use data in the same way as surveillance-capitalism companies like Google and Facebook, as Zuboff points out. And they have now taken to\u00a0highlighting their more privacy-protective approachesand\u00a0building new ones, which calls attention to the mountains of data their rivals use more intensively.</p><p>Oracle and Other Business Software Companies:\u00a0Oracle has long been a Google enemy, in part because Google gives away the kinds of products that Oracle sells to big companies and governments. (They're also locked in\u00a0an ugly lawsuit\u00a0over software </p><p>Yelp and Other Consumer Protection Organizations:\u00a0Google has also drawn the ire of other competitors, who are mad at Google because of its presentation of search results. That group is headlined by Yelp, which created a new lobbying campaign to criticize Google on antitrust matters called\u00a0Focus on the User. Their partner in the effort is\u00a0Fight for the Future, an organization that shares some ancestry with MoveOn and other liberal, internet-interested activists.</p><p>The Chinese Internet Industry:\u00a0For years, American internet companies were dominant around the world. That's no longer as true. The Chinese internet is enormous\u2014and with ByteDance's TikTok, it's begun to make inroads into Western markets. As Korean and Japanese internet companies have discovered, it's hard to beat Western companies on their home turf, but China has cultivated a plausible alternative ecosystem for messaging, social media, and other apps. It's not What's App or nothing, as long as\u00a0there's WeChat.</p><p>Big tech may survive this scuffle with only a couple of lumps, a la Microsoft in the 1990s. Or something much bigger may be in the offing. But one thing is for sure: After disrupting so many industries and having created so many enemies in consolidating control of the internet, it's going to be difficult for tech companies to find friends.</p><p>The Atlantic</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-146090754</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8H-9JC1-F11P-X1KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1855\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yerepouni Daily News.

According to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html\">new reports</url>, Google and Apple face deeper investigation by the Department of Justice while the FTC takes on Amazon and Facebook.<br/>At a broad ideological level, two things have happened. First, the idea of cyberspace, a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/the-end-of-cyberspace/588340/?utm_source=feed\">transnational, individualistic, largely unregulated, and free</url> place that was not exactly located in any governmental domain, completely collapsed. Second, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/11/facebook-google-amazon-and-collapse-tech-mythology/575989/?utm_source=feed\">mythology of tech as the carrier of progress has imploded</url>, just as it did for the robber barons of the late 19th century to usher in the trustbusting era. While big tech companies try to establish a new reason for their privileged treatment and existence (hint: screaming \"CHINA!\"), they are vulnerable to attacks on their business practices that suddenly make sense.<br/>But these changes did not occur in the ether among particles of discourse. Over the last three years, an ecosystem of tech opponents has emerged and gained strength. Here's a catalog of the coalition that has pulled tech from the South Lawn into the trenches.<br/>Angry Conservatives: The biggest change, of course, came with the 2016 campaign and ultimate election of Donald Trump. Though Trump played the social-media game       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/08/trump-digital-director-brad-parscale-facebook-advertising\">with tremendous success</url>, conservatives criticized the platforms during the campaign and have continued to do so       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/06/27/inside-facebook-twitters-secret-meetings-with-trump-aides-conservative-leaders-who-say-tech-is-biased/?utm_term=.e9fc46c982ff\">throughout the last two-and-a-half years</url>. Most recently, the president announced that he was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/president-trump-collecting-social-media-grievances/589564/?utm_source=feed\">collecting reports of social-media grievances</url>. There has been a steady drumbeat over the same timeframe of stories about tech companies' left-leaning workforces, which conservatives have spun into a fable about how they are being suppressed. The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/\">evidence is thin</url>, but it seems plausible to most people, who believe the platforms       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewinternet.org/2018/06/28/public-attitudes-toward-technology-companies/?utm_source=adaptivemailer&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=18-06-28%20views%20of%20tech%20companies&amp;amp;org=982&amp;amp;lvl=100&amp;amp;ite=2793&amp;amp;lea=618395&amp;amp;ctr=0&amp;amp;par=1&amp;amp;trk=\">censor political viewpoints</url>.<br/>Disillusioned Liberal Tech Luminaries: Alongside the conservative outrage machine, the biggest body blows that the tech industry has taken have come from disillusioned liberals who worked for those companies. While their specific critiques vary, most of them feel that the platforms aided and abetted the election of President Trump-that is to say, roughly the opposite of the conservative critique above. Many have come to expand their criticisms to the basic mechanisms of the technology industry, from the former Googler Tristan Harris, who works on \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/17/16903844/time-well-spent-facebook-tristan-harris-mark-zuckerberg\">Time Well Spent</url>,\" to the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, who has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html\">called for the government to break the company up</url>.<br/>Antitrust Theoreticians: The version of antitrust regulations that emerged in the 20th century held that consumer prices had to rise in order for monopolistic conditions to cause harm. That framing protected big tech companies like Google and Facebook, which give away their products to users. How can there be consumer harm if consumers are paying $0.00? But a new wave of antitrust scholars, now centered at the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://openmarketsinstitute.org/\">Open Markets Institute</url>, have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/lina-khan-antitrust/561743/?utm_source=feed\">argued that this view is outdated</url> because free services can still be harmful to societies. They've opened the door to new attacks on the market power of big tech, and they've already gained adherents.<br/>Democratic Presidential Candidates: Headlined by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democratic presidential contenders have proven ready to tussle with big tech. Drawing on the new antitrust doctrine, Warren has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">argued for breaking up the big tech firms</url> \"to restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last.\"<br/>Rank-and-File Tech Workers: For years and years, tech companies very rarely leaked. Workers were generally pretty happy, and corporate cultures discouraged talking with outsiders. That's changed. Now, all kinds of tech workers with different agendas-from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pjmedia.com/trending/reddit-user-claiming-to-be-a-google-insider-describes-how-the-tech-giant-screwed-over-james-damore/\">James Damore types</url> to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/01/google-walkout-global-protests-employees-sexual-harassment-scandals\">anti-sexual harassment campaigners</url> to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://techworkerscoalition.org/\">union organizers</url>-have begun to talk to the press, public or privately. The pressure has led to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075780/google-sexual-assault-harassment-policy-sundar-pichai-walkout-changes\">important internal reforms</url>, but also opened the companies up to new political attacks from a range of directions. All the leaks have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-insiders-press-leaks-at-meeting-backfired-gave-sergey-brin-moral-high-ground-china-2018-8\">eroded the sense of impenetrability</url> that used to surround operations like Google.<br/>Traditional Democratic Corporate Reformers: Reining in corporate power has long been part of most Democratic politicians' agendas. But now, that zeal is often directed not just at Wall Street or automakers, but also tech companies. From his position as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Congressman Frank Pallone of New Jersey has repeatedly battled tech-company executives who have testified before him. He's a traditional Democratic establishment force, an ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and clearly sees the tech industry as the kind of corporate power that needs to be reined in, starting perhaps with new privacy regulations. \"We've been talking about it for years, yet nothing has been done to address the problem,\"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/26/democrats-vow-congress-will-assert-itself-against-tech-starting-with-silicon-valleys-privacy-practices/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.e961aefe84c9\">Pallone said at a February hearing</url>. \"It's time that we move past the old model that protects the companies using our data and not the people.\"<br/>Privacy Advocates: It would be hard to argue that privacy advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have had too big of an impact on tech companies, even after       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/the-snowden-legacy-part-one-whats-changed-really/\">the Snowden revelations</url> gave them far more ammunition than they'd had in years past. Just look around at the data every person on Earth seems to be leaking. But the activists remain there in the background, pushing for reforms and calling out       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/big-tech-went-big-on-lobbying-spending-and-privacy-advocates-are-concerned/\">tech industry lobbying</url>. Their political alignments might       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-protection/big-techs-hidden-agenda-for-privacy-regulations/\">prove difficult to pin down</url>, however, as more muscular government involvement runs counter to the foundational principles of most       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/the-end-of-cyberspace/588340/?utm_source=feed\">early internet privacy proponents</url>.<br/>European Regulators: Nobody has been harder on big tech than European regulators, who caused       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/25/17395210/gdpr-spam-funny-memes\">quite a ruckus</url> with their       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-an-executive-guide-to-what-you-need-to-know/\">General Data Protection Regulation</url> (GDPR). However, the jury is still out on what the ultimate impact of the GDPR might be on tech firms and everyday users. Europeans have more control, but       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/technology/privacy-regulation-facebook-google.html\">big tech companies might be the real winners</url> (something tech companies have been whispering about many regulations). That said, it's hard to imagine that the Europeans are done battling American tech companies' dominance in European lives.<br/>The Media Industry: Having had its lunch eaten, its lunch money taken, and its person shoved into a toilet and a locker by big tech, the media industry       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/media-industry-flocks-to-trade-group-lobbying-8187252c-1ead-487a-934a-04fceceb9399.html\">has begun to fight back</url>. Across the board, the long-time frenemy relationship that most publishers tried to maintain with the big tech companies has soured. One thing to watch: With the Facebook wave receding and Google       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.poynter.org/tech-tools/2018/as-google-shifts-to-mobile-its-referrals-to-news-sites-keep-growing/\">solidifying its control over traffic</url>, the media industry might start to find some love in their hearts for Google, while maintaining their open season on Facebook.<br/>The Telecom Industry: Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T might not be the most popular companies in the world, but the old-line telecoms know that big tech is their most important competitor. After years of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42c95ce6-e0ff-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce\">losing regulatory battles</url>, they've begun to claw their way back. With the banner of mobile innovation now passing to 5G, it wouldn't be shocking to see them ramp up their efforts against the platform companies that use their networks.<br/>Scholarly Tech Critics: The technology industry has long had skeptics in the academy, but over the last five years, those researchers have landed many more blows, from many different angles. They've       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/understanding-facebooks-failure-to-deal-with-hate-speech\">exploded myths</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/shoshana-zuboff-q-and-a-the-age-of-surveillance-capital.html\">coined new language for problems</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/09/evgeny-morozov-technology-solutionism-interview\">created rallying cries</url> for those inside and outside the industry. It would be impossible to catalog them all, but this sample gets at the breadth of the critiques: Shoshana Zuboff's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781478947271/\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</url>, Evgeny Morozov's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/evgeny-morozov/to-save-everything-click-here/9781610393706/\">To Save Everything Click Here</url>, Zeynep Tufekci       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/zeynep-tufekci\">in The New York Times</url>, Tim Wu's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/234876/the-attention-merchants-by-tim-wu/9780804170048/\">The Attention Merchants</url>, Cathy O'Neil's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/\">Weapons of Math Destruction</url>, Siva Vaidhyanathan's anti-paeans to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520258822/the-googlization-of-everything\">Google</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/antisocial-media-9780190841164?cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;\">Facebook</url>, Frank Pasquale's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674368279\">The Black Box Society</url>, Safiya Umoja Noble's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/\">Algorithms of Oppression</url>, Sherry Turkle's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reclaimingconversationbook.com/\">Reclaiming Conversation</url>, Malkia Cyril's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/the-antidote-to-authoritarianism/525438/?utm_source=feed\">powerful essays</url>, and Jean Twenge's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/?utm_source=feed\">alarming work on youth</url> and their relationship to technology.<br/>Apple: Of the big tech companies, Apple is the one that has the most at stake in the regulatory battles. On the one hand, they need the other giants to produce the apps that make an iPhone worth buying. On the other hand, anything that reduces their perceived value-like, perhaps, corporate or government surveillance-is bad. Apple can take the moral high ground in some ways because it doesn't use data in the same way as surveillance-capitalism companies like Google and Facebook, as Zuboff points out. And they have now taken to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/03/apple-took-swipes-at-google-and-facebook-at-wwdc.html\">highlighting their more privacy-protective approaches</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/apple-is-now-the-privacy-as-a-service-company/\">building new ones</url>, which calls attention to the mountains of data their rivals use more intensively.<br/>Oracle and Other Business Software Companies: Oracle has long been a Google enemy, in part because Google gives away the kinds of products that Oracle sells to big companies and governments. (They're also locked in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+google+battle&amp;amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS738US738&amp;amp;oq=oracle+google+battle&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.1724j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8\">an ugly lawsuit</url> over software copyrights.) The company has run a particularly hard-hitting and effective operation called       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.googletransparencyproject.org/\">the Google Transparency Project</url> out of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://campaignforaccountability.org/\">Campaign for Accountability</url>, which has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://capitalresearch.org/article/who-holds-the-campaign-for-accountability-accountable/\">traditionally gone after Republicans</url> for ethical violations. The Transparency Project, which is funded by Oracle and other Google rivals, drew       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/paying-professors-inside-googles-academic-influence-campaign-1499785286\">massive</url> attention to Google's remarkable funding of scholars and academics.<br/>Yelp and Other Consumer Protection Organizations: Google has also drawn the ire of other competitors, who are mad at Google because of its presentation of search results. That group is headlined by Yelp, which created a new lobbying campaign to criticize Google on antitrust matters called       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.focusontheuser.com/\">Focus on the User</url>. Their partner in the effort is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fightforthefuture.org/\">Fight for the Future</url>, an organization that shares some ancestry with MoveOn and other liberal, internet-interested activists.<br/>The Chinese Internet Industry: For years, American internet companies were dominant around the world. That's no longer as true. The Chinese internet is enormous-and with ByteDance's TikTok, it's begun to make inroads into Western markets. As Korean and Japanese internet companies have discovered, it's hard to beat Western companies on their home turf, but China has cultivated a plausible alternative ecosystem for messaging, social media, and other apps. It's not What's App or nothing, as long as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/who-what/wechat/article/2131523\">there's WeChat</url>.<br/>Big tech may survive this scuffle with only a couple of lumps, a la Microsoft in the 1990s. Or something much bigger may be in the offing. But one thing is for sure: After disrupting so many industries and having created so many enemies in consolidating control of the internet, it's going to be difficult for tech companies to find friends.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-howpoliticiansandscholarsturnedagainstbigtech591052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8H-4V41-JCG7-V17R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2004\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

                  </p><p>The biggest announcement is $27m over four years to be announced in Myefo on Monday for the ACCC's new digital division.</p><p>The new division will monitor and report twice a year on digital platforms, with the power to conduct inquiries when the treasurer directs it to undertake, and to take enforcement action.</p><p>The division's first inquiry will be to look at the competition for ad tech services and online advertising.</p><p>That announcement aside, the government is largely responding by announcing more reviews or voluntary codes.</p><p>The government will consult on more changes to the Privacy Act, including expanding the definition of personal information to include personal information collected by tech companies, strengthening notice and consent requirements, and the tort of privacy allowing people to take court action for compensation when their privacy is interfered with.</p><p>The review will also consider a recommendation that consumers be allowed to request to delete personal information companies hold on them.</p><p>In response to fake news, the government will ask the big companies like Facebook and Google to develop a voluntary code of conduct for disinformation and news quality, with oversight by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.</p><p>There will be a voluntary code developed between the news companies and the digital platforms to be more transparent over the news feed algorithms and ad placement by November next year. The government has said if it isn't satisfied with the code, it will consider a mandatory code.</p><p>There will also be a pilot scheme for people to lodge complaints about issues with the digital platforms, and this pilot will determine whether the government should bring in a digital platforms ombudsman to resolve complaints and disputes.</p><p>                   What has the government not adopted?                   </p><p>There will be no immediate changes to merger law, with the government promising \"broad consultations\" on the ACCC's proposal next year. The ACCC will also be asked to monitor the EU's efforts to force Google to offer alternatives to Chrome and Google search on Android devices, but there's no plans to proceed with that for now.</p><p>There's also no move on banning unfair contract terms, with the government proposing to consult more on protecting people.</p><p>The biggest rejection was the proposal to make funding journalism tax deductible. The government said it wasn't going to act on that recommendation.</p><p>\"There are a number of existing ways in which organisations that produce public interest journalism can seek deductible gift recipient (DGR) status and the government's current focus is on implementing the DGR reforms announced in December 2017 before considering further changes,\" the response states.</p><p>The government also rejected a proposal for a mandatory takedown code that would force Facebook and Google to remove material that was claimed to be infringing copyright. The government said there was the potential for unintended consequences.</p><p>                   What will it mean for people using Facebook and Google and other platforms?                   </p><p>Assuming changes to the Privacy Act get introduced and pass parliament, people will have more control over their own data, and if they've had their privacy breached, will be able to take the company to court over it to get compensation.</p><p>                   What will it mean for the media?                   </p><p>They will participate in more inquiries, and regional publishers will have access to more money, but in the immediate term there won't be much of a difference for the media sector.</p><p>The government is also consulting on changes to make media regulation technology neutral. This would mean the same rules that apply to broadcast TV, for example, around local content, could also apply to services like Netflix.</p><p>                   Should the tech companies be worried?                   </p><p>Google and Facebook will likely be breathing a sigh of relief. There's no immediate new regulation on them, just more reviews. The ACCC's new digital division will likely cause some headaches for them in the immediate term but Google has already been taken to court by the ACCC, and it is expected more of these cases will pop up in the near future.</p><p>                   What are other countries doing?                   </p><p>A lot of the privacy changes proposed by the ACCC bring Australia closer to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) but because more reviews are taking place, it is going to be a long time before we get there.</p><p>The Australian government is consulting with New Zealand about its unfair trading provision, with a view to try to adopt something similar in the future.</p><p>In new Android devices from early 2020, Google will offer European users the option of choosing a different default browser other than Chrome, and Google search. It will present users with options for different browsers and search engines.</p><p>The EU Commission fined Google (EURO)4.34bn last year for blocking rivals on Android, and having an unfair advantage in pre-installing Chrome and Google search in Android.</p><p>2020 US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has also proposed breaking up the big tech companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-58686413</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRG-WMT1-F021-653J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1108\"/><timeReceived>7:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Big tech companies like Google and Facebook, with their seemingly free products, are forcing lawmakers to consider whether monopoly power manifests itself in more than just higher prices for consumers. This is creating a bipartisan consensus that anti-trust regulation isn't just about protecting consumers, it's about protecting competition in general. There was a rare glimpse of productivity in Washington last week during an anti-trust hearing held by the House Judiciary Committee. </p><p>The hearing was about the impact tech giants like Google and Facebook have had on the American press and it went, most encouragingly, something like this: Members of Congress identified a problem: A struggling free press at the mercy of tech giants squeezing them for cash, which has contributed to the spread of disinformation on the internet. They then held a hearing to listen to witnesses involved in the space. And finally, after listening to the witnesses, those members of Congress then seemed to reach a bipartisan consensus on how to move forward. Recognizing the importance of a thriving free press to American democracy, both Both House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and House Judiciary ranking member Doug Collins (R-Ga.) agreed to support a bill called the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act[1], which would allow publishers to circumvent anti-trust restrictions for 4 years and collectively negotiate with internet companies.  Much of the news industry \u2014 including the News Media Alliance, a consortium of about 2,000 other print and online news outlets including The New York Times \u2014 likes the idea too. Consider this part of an evolution in Washington's thinking on how to protect American capitalism and democracy. For years, politicians, legal scholars and technocrats have believed that there was really only one reason to rein in big, concentrated businesses \u2014 if they were forcing prices too high for consumers. Now, in a digital era where it seems so many products we use on the internet are free, companies like Google and Facebook are challenging that notion. These companies are forcing politicians to ask a central question: \"If these products are free, why do so many Americans still feel like they're getting ripped off?\" Read more: Breaking up Facebook is just a step on the road to rehab for America's relationship with big companies[2]Penny precisionAmerican anti-trust legislation had been written around the turn of the century, to stop the encroachment of railroad robber barrons and to rip the tentacles off Standard Oil. It was written with the understanding that big companies naturally evolved into powerful actors who could bend the government to their will. So the legislation was crafted with the intention of preserving competition and making sure that no company became so large that it could prevent another company from competing with it. Back in 1890, Sen. John Sherman, an author of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, famously declared: \"If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life.\" But starting around the late 1970s Americans stopped thinking that big alone was bad. Economists and legal scholars started pushing a new way to look at regulating companies with \"consumer welfare\"[3] as the central tenant. In practice that meant that the government's powers to do things like stop mergers were only used when it was clear that the merger would ultimately push prices up for consumers. Enter the tech giants as we know them today. Because their services are free, they were, in many cases, allowed to grow without restraint. Activity that may have been seen as anti-competitive a generation ago was allowed to slide. For example, back in 2012[4], Federal Trade Commission (FTC) researchers showed that Google used its power[5]to make competitors harder to find on its search engine. The FTC, however,decided to do nothing about it,[6]saying simply that theirjob was not to protect competitors.[7] Regulators didn't do anything when Facebookcrippled video app Vine by blocking Vine from[8] its friend-finding feature. And they stood by and did nothing when Google acquired YouTube and changed its search[9] algorithm, substituting its own subjective, \"relevance\" ranking in place of objective search criteria. Watchdogs like the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) have been complaining[10] about stuff like this on Capitol Hill for a while now. When it comes to mergers, EPIC argues that agencies like the FTC should be thinking about whether or not the merger may erode consumer privacy. This, it said, is what should have been under consideration when Facebook acquired Whatsapp back in 2014. \"The FTC ultimately approved the merger after Facebook and WhatsApp promised not to make any changes to WhatsApp users' privacy settings,\" EPIC pointed out in Congressional testimony in December of 2018. \"However Facebook announced in 2016 that it would begin acquiring the personal information of WhatsApp users, including phone numbers, directly contradicting their previous promises to honor user privacy. Following this, EPIC and CDD filed another complaint with the FTC in 2016, but the Commission has taken no further action. Meanwhile, antitrust authorities in the EU fined Facebook $122 million for making deliberately false representations about the company's ability to integrate the personal data of WhatsApp users.\" Indeed Germany has basically outlawed Facebook's ad business reasoning that the way that it tracks users[11]\u2014 not just on its own app but also across Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 is too intrusive and gathers too much data.An idea infectionAnd so tech companies, unwittingly, have forced all of Washington to consider whether or not price is really paramount when it comes to protecting American capitalism \u2014 or if there's more to it than that. \"I think it's been substantial, the shift on the GOP side,\" said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute[12]. It's an organization dedicated to exposing the corruption of monopolization in all kinds of sectors, from healthcare to food and agriculture. Stoller pointed to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham's interest in regulating the advertising technology space, to Collins's work on the House Judiciary Committee, and to Attorneys General across the country[13] banding together in an anti-trust lawsuit against generic drug manufacturers. \"There's an increasingly powerful bipartisan view of anti-trust,\" he said. And then there are presidential candidates like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), whose stance on antitrust ensures that the topic will take center stage during the 2020 elections. Warren has been calling for anti-trust legislation to be updated and/or applied to big players in a variety of industries not just because they squeeze out other competitors, but also because of what they can squeeze out of Washington. \"The larger and more economically powerful these companies get, the more resources they can bring to bear on lobbying government to change the rules to benefit exactly the companies that are doing the lobbying,\" she said in a speech back in 2016. [14]\"Over time, this means a closed, self-perpetuating, rigged system - a playing field that lavishes favors on the big guys, hammers the small guys, and fuels even more concentration.\" The push for Congress to take legislative action from Warren and others like her has, in turn, put pressure on government agencies tasked with anti-trust enforcement, according to Stoller.  \"One of the things I've noticed talking to anti-trust people is there's a conversation that's starting to happen now about whether they're still relevant,\" he said. \"They're concerned they're going to have their authority stripped from them by politicians because they haven't brought cases... They don't want politicians coming in the with a meat cleaver.\" But the cleaver, it seems, is coming \u2014 and it's coming in a way America has not seen yet this century.

For years, politicians, legal scholars and technocrats have believed that there was really only one reason to rein in big, concentrated businesses - if they were forcing prices too high for consumers.</p><p>Now, in a digital era where it seems so many products we use on the internet are free, companies like Google and Facebook are challenging that notion. These companies are forcing politicians to ask a central question: \"If these products are free, why do so many Americans still feel like they're getting ripped off?\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read more: Breaking up Facebook is just a step on the road to rehab for America's relationship with big companies</emphasis></p><h>Penny precision</h><p>American anti-trust legislation had been written around the turn of the century, to stop the encroachment of railroad robber barrons and to rip the tentacles off Standard Oil. It was written with the understanding that big companies naturally evolved into powerful actors who could bend the government to their will. So the legislation was crafted with the intention of preserving competition and making sure that no company became so large that it could prevent another company from competing with it.</p><p>Wikimedia CommonsBack in 1890, Sen. John Sherman, an author of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, famously declared: \"If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life.\"</p><p>But starting around the late 1970s Americans stopped thinking that big alone was bad. Economists and legal scholars started pushing a new way to look at regulating companies with <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20181212/108774/HHRG-115-JU05-20181212-SD004.pdf\">\"consumer welfare\"</url> as the central tenant. In practice that meant that the government's powers to do things like stop mergers were only used when it was clear that the merger would ultimately push prices up for consumers.</p><p>Enter the tech giants as we know them today. Because their services are free, they were, in many cases, allowed to grow without restraint. Activity that may have been seen as anti-competitive a generation ago was allowed to slide.</p><p>For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-makes-most-of-close-ties-to-white-house-1427242076?tesla=y\">back in 2012</url>, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) researchers       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://graphics.wsj.com/google-ftc-report/\">showed that Google used its power</url>\u00a0to make competitors harder to find on its search engine. The FTC, however,\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/technology/google-agrees-to-changes-in-search-ending-us-antitrust-inquiry.html\">decided to do nothing about it,</url>\u00a0saying simply that their\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://searchengineland.com/ftc-law-protects-competition-not-competitors-says-not-enough-evidence-to-prove-search-bias-144119\">job was not to protect competitors.</url>\u00a0</p><p>Regulators didn't do anything when Facebook\u00a0crippled video app Vine by blocking <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127202/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vine-friends-api-block-parliament-documents\">Vine from</url> its friend-finding feature.

When it comes to mergers, EPIC argues that agencies like the FTC should be thinking about whether or not the merger may erode consumer privacy. This, it said, is what should have been under consideration when Facebook acquired Whatsapp back in 2014.\u00a0</p><p>\"The FTC ultimately approved the merger after Facebook and WhatsApp promised not to make any changes to WhatsApp users' privacy settings,\" EPIC pointed out in Congressional testimony in December of 2018.</p><p>\"However Facebook announced in 2016 that it would begin acquiring the personal information of WhatsApp users, including phone numbers, directly contradicting their previous promises to honor user privacy. Following this, EPIC and CDD filed another complaint with the FTC in 2016, but the Commission has taken no further action. Meanwhile, antitrust authorities in the EU fined Facebook $122 million for making deliberately false representations about the company's ability to integrate the personal data of WhatsApp users.\"</p><p>Indeed Germany has basically outlawed Facebook's ad business <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/germany-facebook-antitrust-ruling/\">reasoning that the way that it tracks users</url>\u00a0- not just on its own app but also across Instagram and WhatsApp - is too intrusive and gathers too much data.</p><h>An idea infection</h><p>And so tech companies, unwittingly, have forced all of Washington to consider whether or not price is really paramount when it comes to protecting American capitalism - or if there's more to it than that.</p><p>\"I think it's been substantial, the shift on the GOP side,\" said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://openmarketsinstitute.org/staff/matt-stoller/\">Open Markets Institute</url>. It's an organization dedicated to exposing the corruption of monopolization in all kinds of sectors, from healthcare to food and agriculture.</p><p>Stoller pointed to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham's interest in regulating the advertising technology space, to Collins's work on the House Judiciary Committee, and to <url normalizedValue=\"https://ago.nebraska.gov/news/nebraska-joins-43-attorneys-general-antitrust-lawsuit\">Attorneys General across the country</url> banding together in an anti-trust lawsuit against generic drug manufacturers.</p><p>\"There's an increasingly powerful bipartisan view of anti-trust,\" he said.</p><p>And then there are presidential candidates like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), whose stance on antitrust ensures that the topic will take center stage during the 2020 elections. Warren has been calling for anti-trust legislation to be updated and/or applied to big players in a variety of industries not just because they squeeze out other competitors, but also because of what they can squeeze out of Washington.</p><p>\"The larger and more economically powerful these companies get, the more resources they can bring to bear on lobbying government to change the rules to benefit exactly the companies that are doing the lobbying,\" she said in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2016-6-29_Warren_Antitrust_Speech.pdf\">speech back in 2016. </url>\"Over time, this means a closed, self-perpetuating, rigged system - a playing field that lavishes favors on the big guys, hammers the small guys, and fuels even more concentration.\"</p><p>The push for Congress to take legislative action from Warren and others like her has, in turn, put pressure on government agencies tasked with anti-trust enforcement, according to Stoller.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"One of the things I've noticed talking to anti-trust people is there's a conversation that's starting to happen now about whether they're still relevant,\" he said. \"They're concerned they're going to have their authority stripped from them by politicians because they haven't brought cases...

This sentiment has become increasingly common lately, even, notably, among the previously apolitical. Yet something is overlooked:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In keeping with President Reagan's observation, \"Freedomis never more thanone generation away from extinction,\" being one election away from tyranny means that not enough people noticed and took action when we were one generation away \u2014 or two or three.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also perhaps overlooked is that being one election away from tyranny now means we'll be one election away after the next election \u2014 whatever happens November 3. The point is that politics being downstream from culture (and, really, from morality, faith and philosophy), this isn't merely a \"moment.\" It's not a fashion. It won't just pass. And we need be prepared for things to come.</p><p>I've often cited late Soviet defector Yuri Bezmenov, who in 1980s interviews warned of \"demoralization\" \u2014 an undermining of a nation's morality that makes it ripe for leftist revolution \u2014 in America. As a young man in my late teens or early twenties at the time, I didn't know about Bezmenov (no Internet back then). But I'd recently become more intensely \"politically\" aware and quickly realized, and began telling people, that the West and the U.S. were in decline and gravitating toward tyranny. Oh, I did realize the republic's demise was decades away.</p><p>Now I suspect it's years away.</p><p>General Michael Flynn, whom, it's clear, was targeted by the Creep State for being a good man, just warned that if we don't act, two percent of the people are about to control the other 98 percent. But I'm here to tell you: Long term, voting wont' save us.</p><p>Oh, for sure, get out and vote in November as if your life depends on it (because in a way it does). But as was the case in 2016, a Trump victory and partial GOP control of Congress only amount to a \"stay of execution.\" The clock is ticking.</p><p>Moreover, President Trump's re-election, like his election, would have to defy the odds. Along with traditional media bias \u2014 which a college professor determined aids Democrat candidates by 8 to 10 points every election (an underestimation, I believe) \u2014 there's now social media/Big Tech bias. According to liberal psychologist Dr. Robert Epstein's research, this factor can shift up to 15 million votes toward one party or the other (not an overestimation, I believe). This is enough to turn any modern election.</p><p>Add to this vote fraud and vote harvesting \u2014 the latter of which flipped conservative Orange County, Calif., from GOP to Democrat control in 2018 \u2014 and left-wing mail-in voting scams, and the picture is clear: Even if Trump wins, the chances of him having two simpatico Houses are slim. And if Trump triumphs but the Democrats hold the House and seize the Senate, there's a good chance he'll be deposed.</p><p>Really, though, focusing on this, the micro, is to not see the forest for the trees. An excellent high-profile commentator said a while back that this all (the current unrest, intensifying cancel culture, etc.) seemed to happen so suddenly. But only the spark, the George Floyd situation, and the fire were sudden, and something else could have triggered the blaze as well. The kindling, however, and the many-layered sea of morally dead and intellectually dry wood had long been burgeoning.</p><p>And the spark only catalyzed the firestorm because we'd reached a point of critical mass.</p><p>This is why what we began talking about in the '80s, political correctness, has metastasized into \"cancel culture.\" It's why two people in two recent days \u2014 one a cop, the other an acquaintance \u2014 told me what's plain: They, and everyone else, are afraid to speak their minds, fearing career and reputational destruction. It's why social media censorship is intensifying by the month. An iron muzzle has descended upon America, and what can't be spoken against can't be effectively combated.</p><p>As I warned in 2012, there no longer is a culture war. \"What is occurring now is apacification effort.\" Its progress is why corporate America, including the now-absorbed Chik-fil-A and NASCAR, has turned decidedly to the dark side (shifted \"left\"). It's why prominent people, including Republicans such as Indiana senator Mike Braun, are bowing before terrorist group Black Lives Matter. It's why mobs are enabled and good people hobbled for defending themselves from the mobs. It's why we're seeing a complete cultural collapse \u2014 portending a political collapse.</p><p>This is partially due to a new \"woke\" generation having entered the corporate sphere and others of influence. But what did you expect? The apocryphal saying (no, it's not Lincoln's) informs, \"The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next.\" Did you really think the Left could completely control academia for generations and that, somehow, it all would \"stay in college\"?</p><p>Leftists have also controlled entertainment, which could even be more significant. A (perhaps loose) paraphrase of ancient Greek philosopher Plato warns, \"When modes ofmusic change,thefundamental lawsof thestate changewith them.\"</p><p>Now, though, we have television and the Internet, whose effects I've examined, which dwarf music's influence. Then there's the aforementioned media (conventional and social). This culture-shaping media/academia/entertainment triad has long been leftist controlled, the result of the long Gramscian \"march through the institutions,\" the rotten fruits of all our squandered yesterdays.</p><p>Being a culture-shaper also ultimately means, again, being a politics-shaper (and civilization-shaper), and this brings us to conservative rationalization. Even if we could somehow seize control of the media/academia/entertainment axis, sorry, it takes generations to thus reshape society, and the time for that was 60 years ago. That ship has sailed (and sunk).</p><p>Then there's our 1965-born immigration policy, which, I've estimated, gives Democrats 300,000 new voters yearly, three million a decade. And when the Democrats assume full control, they'll legalize the illegal aliens among us and open the floodgates further (goodbye, wall), giving themselves perhaps tens of millions of new voters in short order.</p><p>So Democrat presidential sock puppet Joe Biden, echoing the man whose name he couldn't recall a while back (because echoes are all he has left), not long ago said we had to \"fundamentally\" change America. But that fundamental change has already occurred. Does the 2020 U.S. even remotely resemble its few-generations-back former self?</p><p>So the question isn't what's coming, but this: Will you be ready? When the leftists take full political control federally, they'll mercilessly impose their agenda as leftists always do. If you have no idea what that agenda is, you're likely not reading this. But do know that it will be effected no-holds-barred.</p><p>For not only is there the critical-mass factor, but Machiavellian leftists have convinced their useful idiots, projecting all the way, that conservatives constitute a hateful, \"racist,\" fascistic, White Supremacist\u2122 threat to civilization. They thus have an ideal pretext for iron-fistedly crushing opponents. When \"Nazis\" threaten your civilization, after all, you're faced with desperate times requiring desperate measures, right, comrade?</p><p>So how do we proceed? This isn't a defeatist screed. I'm not saying keep a cyanide capsule handy. But knowing tomorrow's strategy requires knowing tomorrow's battlefield. So what can be done when, after this election or the next, the federal government becomes a complete leftist leviathan wholly unmoored from constitutional constraints?</p><p>I've long advocated nullification \u2014 meaning, in this case, the ignoring of unconstitutional federal and judicial dictates \u2014 something Thomas Jefferson called the \"rightful remedy\" for all federal overreach. This should have been embraced long ago (e.g., in response to the Obergefell opinion), but will become more conservative states' only recourse in the not-too-distant future. Note, too, that we'd just be doing what leftists do with their \"sanctuary\" cities and defiance of federal drug laws.</p><p>In this vein, you can't win a contest being a \"connedservative\" who insists on fighting by Queensberry rules while your adversary operates no-holds-barred. Remember that, more and more, we're living in post-constitutional and post-rule-of-law America. We're now increasingly subject to the rule of men and, in the coming conflict, it's only a matter of which men will win.</p><p>America is irremediably divided \u2014 if a marriage, she would've dissolved long ago \u2014 and the above resistance would, of course, make that division more official. This brings me to what I believe will be our fate.</p><p>After having my '80s insights, I concluded that we'd just continue descending into autocracy, as burgeoning laws, regulations and mandates gradually extinguished freedom, placing us in the iron grip of a central government behemoth. But I long ago changed that view: I now believe our country will dissolve, as the USSR did before us.</p><p>Assuming this happens, the question is: Will at least one emerging land be a new shining city on a hill?</p><p>That's up to us. And we'd better be ready for things to come, now \u2014 because it's later than you think, and inside-the-box thinking won't cut it in an outside-the-box future.</p><p>The article The Coming Collapse Of The Republic - OpEd appeared first on Eurasia Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-178745394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608N-V2S1-F11P-X1BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

That was the last time Congress seriously contemplated privacy regulation[1]. In November that year, the Republicans retook both the House and the Senate. When President Obama attempted to offer a 'Privacy Bill of Rights[2]' in 2015, it went nowhere. The only significant privacy legislation since then has been the repeal of privacy rules adopted by the Obama led Federal CommunicationsCommision[3]. Now, in light of the Facebook - Cambridge Analytica scandal[4], Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has called for the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify at an April 10th hearing on the 'future of data privacy and social media' which may discuss new 'rules of the road' for social media privacy. </p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee and the House Energy ...mmerce Committee also are planning hearings in response to what some have suggested is an 'Exxon Valdez' moment. Adding fuel to the fire was Apple's CEO Tim Cook, who stated that he believes that 'this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary.' This comes at a time when Congress and the Federal Elections Commission in contemplating extending existing political advertising disclosure requirements in place in other forms of media to online platforms. This is coming at a time when the tech lobby is in retreat on Capitol Hill, having reluctantly jumped on the bandwagon of the anti-sex trafficking legislation[5] they once vehemently opposed. The Facebook scandal also has triggered a FederalTrade Commission investigation and investigations by 37 state Attorney Generals. It also will only add fuel to European efforts to regulate Big Tech[6]. The New York Times quotes one European analyst[7] as warning that[w]e're at an inflection point, when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm. This is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers, and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances.Facebook is also weathering a growing backlash that includes prominent defections, a loss of consumer confidence and polls showing that nearly one-third of tech workers [8]and a majority of its users might quit[9].

Meanwhile, commentersin the live chat alongside the YouTube livestream spewed hateful slurs and racist remarks about Jews and other minorities. YouTube has since disabled the live chat feature on the YouTube livestream. </p><p>Visit BusinessInsider.com for more stories[3]. Congress' hearing on white nationalism started 15 minutes late on Tuesday, but even before it kicked off, people watching the livestream on YouTube[4] were using the live chat feature located next to the video to share racist ideologies and use vitriolic slurs. About 30 minutes later, YouTube disabled the live chat feature on the livestream. The House Judiciary Committee called policy executives from Facebook and Google to testify Tuesday as part of a series of hearings about hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism on social media. Anyone who wanted to follow the proceedings live could tune in via The House Judiciary Committee's livestream on YouTube. But the live chat located next to the video was quickly inundated with offensive language and slurs about Jews, black people, and other minorities. Some commenters used the clown emoji, which white nationalists have adopted as their own racist symbol[5]. The comments started before the hearing actually began, and continued as executives testified and victims of hate speech shared their stories. During the hearing, Google executive Alexandria Walden talked about YouTube's role in fighting white nationalism. \"That's why hate speech and violent extremism have no place on YouTube,\" said Walden, counsel for free expression and human rights atGoogle. The live chat was disabled about 20 minutes after the hearing began. \"Hate speech has no place on YouTube,\" YouTube said in a statement to Business Insider. \"We've invested heavily in teams and technology dedicated to removing hateful comments / videos. Due to the presence of hateful comments, we disabled comments on the livestream of today's House Judiciary Committee hearing.\" Read more: Facebook and Google will be grilled by Congress on Tuesday on white nationalism as they struggle to silence hate speech[6] The list of expected appearances at the hearings indicates[7]that Facebook's director of public policy, Neil Potts, as well as Google's public policy and government relations counsel, Alexandria Walden, will testify alongside expert witnesses from civil-rights organizations including the Anti-Defamation League. House Democrats told The Washington Post[8]that Tuesday's hearing would be the first of a series on the issue of white nationalism. The tech giants \"clearly have been conduits for that kind of hate speech,\" Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the House Judiciary Committee chair, told The Post.NOW WATCH: Nintendo Switch is the fastest-selling console of the current generation \u2014 here's why Nintendo is dominating video

European competition rules will undergo a \"fitness check\" for their applicability to the digital economy, including a review of state aid guidelines.</p><p>The strategy stresses that this will not only be done by writing new rules, but by enforcing old ones more effectively. To in turn support European companies in foreign markets, the Commission promises to address \"unjustified restrictions\" like data localisation requirements in third countries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hunting giants</emphasis></p><p>With commissioner Margrethe Vestager at the helm, it is no surprise that the document takes aim at big tech companies with market power. Calling them \"large private gatekeepers to markets, customers and information\", the document emphasises that their \"systemic role\" must not endanger fair competition.</p><p>Where competition policy is not enough to address such systemic problems of the platform economy, the Commission would enact additional regulations, such as ex-ante rules, to \"ensure contestability, fairness and innovation and the possibility of market entry\" as well as protect public interests \"beyond competition or economic considerations\".</p><p>They would be proposed as part of the Digital Service Act Package, scheduled towards the end of the year, accompanied by a sector inquiry to identify obstacles to fair competition in the digital economy.</p><p>The Digital Services Act Package will also increase the responsibility of online platforms and information providers as well as strengthen the EU's oversight capabilities over their content policies.</p><p>On taxation of the digital realm, the strategy points out that profits of big digital players are often not taxed where they are generated, which further distorts competition. A communication on Business Taxation for the 21st century is announced without a specific time frame, which will take into account the progress of current negotiations at the OECD.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Getting people up to speed</emphasis></p><p>To help European companies reap the benefits of digitalisation, the Commission outlines several supportive measures. Until 2021, investments into Europe's Gigabit connectivity will be sped up by a revision of regulations on broadband, 5G and 6G as well as radio spectrum policy.</p><p>This is supposed to help achieve the EU's connectivity goals: Gigabit connections for businesses (and public institutions like schools and hospitals) and at least 100 Mbps for households.</p><p>The EU executives' plans for digital skills will be strengthened through a reinforced Digital Education Action Plan, to be published this half of the year. To bolster cybersecurity, a European cybersecurity strategy has also been announced, albeit, again, without a timeline.</p><p>That will feature a newly-created joint Cybersecurity unit and a review of regulations on the Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ICT for Future</emphasis></p><p>Digital solutions will play a crucial role in the EU's ambitions to become climate neutral by 2050, states the strategy.</p><p>As the ICT sector accounts for 2% of global CO2 emissions (as much as air traffic) according to the document's data, with a potential increase to 14% by 2040, the Commission aims to make data centres and ICT infrastructure climate-neutral by 2030.</p><p>This will be complemented by updated regulations on device longevity and repairability, e.g. for smartphones.</p><p>For a cross-sectoral footprint decrease, the strategy outlines plans to use big data and AI for increasing efficiency and thus decreasing global emissions by a sevenfold. Tracking energy consumption could help predict when and where power is (and is not) needed.</p><p>Through precision farming, agricultural producers could, the Commission says, decrease their use of pesticides. Smart mobility could increase the efficiency of transport.</p><p>\"This is a good start, but does not exploit the technical potential\", German MEP Alexandra Geese said. While she approves of making the ITC-sector climate neutral, she added that \"training algorithms with huge amounts of data consumes a great deal of energy\" in the short-term, even if the goal of the algorithm is to have long-term increases in efficiency.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Benjamin Fox]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1432411</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7S-GX61-JCF9-44BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>digital services act</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>digital strategy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DSA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Magrethe Vestager</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Thierry Breton</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000342</classCode><className>COMPANY STRATEGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

This dual role, in the eyes of some, may prove tricky when Ms Vestager finds herself in a position when \u2014 on the one hand \u2014 she is looking to promote Europe as a leader in technology and \u2014 on the other \u2014 she is seeking to enforce competition for the benefit of consumers.</p><p>\u201cThe two approaches are conceptually different; competition enforcement requires neutrality towards the nationality of the firms in question, open-mindedness and confidentiality of proceedings,\u201d writes Mathew Heim, visiting research fellow at the Bruegel think-tank. \u201cProposing of legislation includes structuring markets, seeking pre-determined outcomes, consultation and openness.\u201d</p><p>Mr Heim adds: \u201cWe may have an incoming European Commission with a more directed industrial policy that may not sit well with traditional competition enforcement. What has changed is that the commissioner in charge of competition now also has an industrial policy function.\u201d</p><p>Scepticism over her dual role has been dismissed by people close to Ms Vestager as \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201ca non question\u201d.</p><p>The Dane, who Donald Trump has criticised and branded the \u201ctax lady\u201d, is also likely to face scrutiny over her plans to tackle big tech. She has already handed multibillion fines to tech giants including Google (more than \u20ac8bn) and Qualcomm (\u20ac1.2bn) and recently opened an investigation into Amazon\u2019s dual role as both a market place and a seller of its own products.</p><p>She may tease out new ways in which she is hoping to go after US tech companies following news that the commission will impose so-called interim measures on Broadcom to force the chipmaker to cease alleged anti-competitive practices.</p><p>Ms Vestager is expected to see this case through the courts and \u2014 if successful \u2014 use this long-forgotten competition tool as a way to stop anti-competitive behaviour by agile tech companies before they cause \u201cirreparable harm to competition\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> ; </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/javierespft?lang=en\"> @javierespFT</url></p><p>Hearings watch</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Spain\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josep Borrell</emphasis>, foreign policy chief in waiting,\u00a0gave a characteristically trenchant performance at his European Parliament confirmation session.

MEPs'\u00a0warm reception\u00a0at the end suggested Mr Borrell\u2019s confirmation\u00a0was unlikely to face serious opposition\u00a0from the institution he once headed.
