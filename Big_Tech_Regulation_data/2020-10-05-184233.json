More records on Wall Street. It's Wednesday, the 29th of August. Tonight, Donald Trump watches the US economy grow even faster and says he's optimistic about a trade deal with Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former US President Jimmy Carter tells me how the world can fix this housing crisis. And after a century of business, Aston Martin, that's James Bond's car, is ready to go public. You'll hear from the Chief Executive this hour. I'm Paula Newton and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yes, what is going to keep this market down? That's the question. Strong US growth numbers put so much steam into this market, all the major US markets moved higher and, of course, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P hit all-time highs. Here we are again, folks, with my chicken scratch, I'm going for 18 there and 29 here. That is incredible. That is just this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, US GDP growth for the second quarter was revised up to 4.2%, that is the highest rate since 2014. You can imagine, President Trump was pleased with those numbers, tweeting, \"Our country is doing great.\" And then saying this to reporters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know, our economy has picked up in terms of worth. There's a lot of money for everyone sitting around this table, but we picked up about $10 trillion, general, since my election and we're doing record business, record stock market, record everything, and also, record unemployment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: I'm joined now by Julia Coronado. She is the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives and formerly worked at the Federal Reserve. I don't know what you can think at what your former colleagues are thinking right now. You know, this market just does not see any danger ahead, but more importantly, do you think issue is that they see nowhere else to put their money at this point in time?</p><p>You know, it is slow and steady at the Federal Reserve and the growth in the rest of the world just isn't looking as attractive.</p><p>JULIA CORONADO, FOUNDER, MACROPOLICY PERSPECTIVES: That's right. I mean, part of what we're seeing in the US markets that is that the US economy is humming along. That was confirmed again with a minor upward revision to second quarter GDP. We see strong jobs growth and the rest of the world hasn't seen such great times. We've seen some slowdown in Asia, some slowdown in China. So relatively speaking, it does look attractive for now. Keep in mind, though, we've got a lot of stimulus under our wings from the tax cuts and that is inherently temporary, so, the party won't last forever.</p><p>NEWTON: And yet, at this point in time, it seems that it will. Remember, the record bull that we have going on here, Julia. when you think about how you actually try and care for this economy, if I can put it that way, whether you're the Fed or whether you're Congress, I mean, we've got some real fiscal issues in this country, once that will concern a lot of different people.</p><p>CORONADO: Correct.</p><p>NEWTON: And in Jay Powell's remarks last week, what I read from him was that, \"Look, we will be a lot more cautious going forward,\" but the data just doesn't -- it's not coming in the way we would like it to in real time. There are still some puzzling features about the data, especially where it goes to wage growth and inflation.</p><p>CORONADO: Exactly. And that is what justifies the Fed's sort of gradual approach is that so far, we have seen great growth numbers, great jobs numbers. Wage growth, still stuck below 3% and inflation at the Fed's target, but showing no alarming signs of acceleration.</p><p>So, for the Fed, that all adds up to, yes, take the punch bowl away, but very slowly, just sort of dim the lights a little bit on the party, but not slam on the brakes.</p><p>NEWTON: Definitely, they won't be slamming on any brakes. There's been a puzzling feature to this recovery, and that is the fact that the wages, they still do not continue to grow.</p><p>CORONADO: Correct.</p><p>NEWTON: One thing we've discussed over and over is that marginalized set of workers in the United States, who have been really closed -- really shut out of this economy, if you will, for so many years. Do you think that's why there isn't the wage pressure? Or do you think it has something else to do, even with undocumented workers, let's say?</p><p>CORONADO: No, I think that you've put your finger on a very important element of this, and in fact, Chairman Powell spoke about that at Jackson Hole and has spoken about that before and Janet Yellen has been talking about it for years, which is that the labor market was so terrible during the great recession, a lot of people gave up and left the labor force. Would those people come back? We are seeing them come back.</p><p>So that is the source of slack, if you will, that will keep downward pressure on wages until everybody that wants a job has found a job. So the labor market is great, but it's not exactly looking like it's moving into overheating territory, and that's a positive thing. We can bring back workers into economically active status. That's good for our potential growth rates.</p><p>[16:05:06]</p><p>NEWTON: Now, I want to throw -- I want to run something by you. There's been a great debate, as you know, about deregulation and tax reform policy in this country. I want you to listen to Mohamed El-Erian, who spoke to me yesterday just about whether or not this vindicates Donald Trump's economic policies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ: It's a vindication of tax reform, it's a vindication of deregulation, it's a vindication of the hope that we'll also get infrastructure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: What do you think, Julia? Do we need infrastructure now or just too much juice in the economy?</p><p>CORONADO: Look, I think infrastructure has been a great idea on the table for a long time, that we haven't gone down that road. I would be a little bit more cautious in calling this a vindication. We have borrowed a lot of money. This tax reform was not revenue neutral. We sort of all agreed that lower tax rates would be a good idea, but originally the intention was, let's close some loopholes, as well so that we don't explode the deficit.</p><p>Instead, we're going the exploding the deficit route. So we're borrowing against our future, and that will present us with harder challenges down the road. So again, it feels great right now, but I don't think you would recommend say, for example, that your teenager follows such a strategy in borrowing against their future. So I think it's a short-term vindication, that presents us with longer term challenges. It would have been probably more ideal to go with some infrastructure spending that was financed with public/private partnerships, something that would address some deeper productivity-enhancing investment without, necessarily, blowing up the deficit. But call me old school.</p><p>NEWTON: You and me both, Julia. I am happy to be in that category with you, because I would have loved to see some infrastructure, you know, those of us who use it in this country. Julia, thank you so much. We'll continue to check in with you. Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, President Trump says he's optimistic that Canada will join the US/Mexico trade deal and expects a breakthrough could come by Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The deal we've made is a fantastic deal. It's gotten great reviews with Mexico, trade deal. Right now, we call it the US-Mexico Trade Agreement and we'll see whether or not Canada gets into it. Otherwise, we'll doing something separately or we won't do anything, which is okay, too.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you optimistic?</p><p>TRUMP: I think so. I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Some more negotiating tactics there from the President. Now, those comments came as Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is due to meet with US Trade Representatives in about 45 minutes from now. Prime Minister Trudeau says that Canada is ready to walk away if he has to, adding no deal is still better than a bad deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: As I've said, Canada is always willing to sit down and work in a constructive and responsible way around the table. We've, done that from the very beginning and we will continue to be creative and constructive around the table. We're working now. We sent our whole team down to Washington to engage in this week's negotiations. We recognize that there is a possibility of getting there by Friday, but it is only a possibility, because it will hinge on whether or not there is ultimately a good deal for Canada, a good deal for Canadians.</p><p>I've said from the very beginning, no NAFTA deal is better that a bad NAFTA deal and we're going to remain firm on that principle, because Canadians expect us to stand up for them, and that's what this government is going to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Both the US and Canada are continuing to play politics. The auto sector, though, meantime, it's of material importance to them and they're watching quite anxiously.</p><p>Joining me now on the phone is Ann Wilson. She is senior vice president of the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association. Now, I want to stress that you deal -- you're not -- you deal with all the companies, the Ford, the GMs, the Chryslers of the world, but you are auto parts manufacturers, you have a huge stake in these negotiations though. From what you've seen so far of the US-Mexico deal, that Canada says that in principle they agree to, but they also have to see the details, does that put all three countries in a better position in terms of having a more competitive car industry?</p><p>ANN WILSON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, MOTOR AND EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION: Well, first, Paula, thank you very much for having me on the show. We are heartened by what we see between US and Mexico on many fronts. We do think that there's a real possibility here with the regional value content and the increase that our administration, the Trump administration sought to improve the trade agreement for all the parties.</p><p>But I would like to go back to what you started off the show on. It is really important that Canada be at the table and that this be a three-party agreement. We represent motor vehicle suppliers. We are actually the largest employer of manufacturing jobs in the United States.</p><p>[16:10:11]</p><p>WILSON: And our jobs have actually grown under NAFTA. So NAFTA has been good for our companies, but it's also been good for the American workers who are employed by our companies, but we need Canada to be there.</p><p>NEWTON: At times, President Trump does not seem to have listened to that message. He thinks that, look, if he doesn't get the trade deal that he wants, the trilateral deal doesn't have to happen. Do you find that sometimes that your message falls on deaf ears when it comes to the administration?</p><p>WILSON: Well, with I think the President is challenging all of us in the business community to come back to them to explain exactly why something that we have come to expect from NAFTA needs to continue, and I think that the auto industry has done a good job of trying to show how NAFTA allows the United States to be competitive in a global environment.</p><p>So it allows the three countries to be competitive compared to Europe, compared to Japan and Asia, and that's why this three-country agreement is so important.</p><p>NEWTON: If there is no deal, Donald Trump continues to say that he will impose tariffs on cars coming in from Canada into the United States. Given the integrated nature of the auto industry that you work in, is that possible? Would that be feasible?</p><p>WILSON: Well, it is feasible, but we are very much opposed to that. We build cars, we sell cars in a global environment. Most of our members are global players, but we also have a lot of manufacturers in this country who have just the facility in the US, but they are very dependent on all of the vehicle manufacturers being able to be successful.</p><p>I'm from the south, and I say a lot of rising tides with small boats, and what we need to talk about here is the dependency between vehicle manufacturers and their supply base, and then the dependency on US workers for those jobs.</p><p>So, you know, if we cannot be able to get parts into this country on a financially viable front, it's going to be much more difficult to make cars in this country, and if it's hard to make cars in this country, we won't employ as many people.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and that is a very clear message there. Ann Wilson, thanks so much for your time. Really appreciate it.</p><p>Now, later in the program, you are going to here from the Chief Executive of Aston Martin which has just announced it is preparing for an IPO. He will tell us why he's actually not worrying about the threat from auto tariffs.</p><p>Tesla shares closed down another 2% amid new trouble from CEO, Elon Musk. Now, he may face legal action for his verbal attack on a cave diver, after all. Here's a reminder of how we got here. Thank goodness. Last month, Musk offered a miniature submarine to help rescue 12 boys and their football coach who were trapped in a cave in Thailand.</p><p>One of the rescue divers called, Vernon Unsworth called it a PR stunt and said Musk can, quote, \"stick the submarine where it hurts.\" In a Twitter outburst, Musk called Unsworth a pedophile.</p><p>The Tesla boss later apologized, but on Tuesday, Musk tweeted that he thought, it was, quote, \"strange\" that that Unsworth hasn't sued him. Now, it appears that is going to change. Clare Sebastian has been following this.</p><p>Thank goodness, Clare, because I've completely lost track. You're going to give us the details of what' going on right now, but at the end of the day, it's still clear that Elon Musk has a trouble actually staying focused.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Right, and staying quiet on Twitter, Paula. In the wake of that whole 17-day debacle over whether or not he was going to take the company private, a lot of investors had really been hoping to see a more restrained Elon Musk and there were a couple of days when it looked like that might be the case on Twitter, but clearly that moment is over. This is the tweet that he put out in the last 24 to 36 hours about Vern Unsworth. It was a reply to another Twitter user. He said, \"You don't think it's strange that he hasn't sued me? He was offered free legal services.\" Well, as you said, he hasn't sued him yet, but we do have this letter that was sent by lawyers that have been retained by Vern Unsworth to Elon Musk. It's dated August 6th.</p><p>They say that they are preparing a civil complaint against Elon Musk for false and defamatory statements. They said that he had no basis for calling Vern Unsworth a pedophile and he did it in anger, which is something that Musk himself later admitted. So all of this, Paula, yet another example of how Musk's tweets are damaging the company, and I think this is going to prompt more calls, not only for him to stay off Twitter, but also for the board to step in and keep up that search for someone to fill his number two position and take the pressure off of him.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, as you were saying, you know, we talked earlier, the stock down 2% there. The new price targets are flying from analysts and they say it doesn't look good. And if we can allow ourselves to focus, unlike Elon Musk.</p><p>[16:15:08]</p><p>NEWTON: In terms of the production targets that you and I have talked about so much, Clare, people are still saying, look, it is going to be a rough third quarter for Tesla anyway you have it. And there you see a chart of what's gone on from his antics just in about the last four weeks.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right, the stock is down almost 20% from that peak, which you see of the back of that going private tweet on August 7th. The interesting thing is, Paula, the stock had risen just before that. They'd produced a good earnings report. It beat expectations, cash burn was starting to slow and they were starting to meeting those Model 3 production targets, but despite the noise and the distractions of the last month, the financial problems and the challenges that Tesla faces haven't gone away.</p><p>They are still burning through cash. They are under pressure to meet those Model 3 production targets. A lot of analysts are saying that if they don't, they will still have to raise money. They have $1 billion plus in bonds that are coming due by March next year. There are real questions over how they'll make those payments and musk has continually said that he doesn't want to raise cash externally.</p><p>I think a lot of people continue to question that and it doesn't help that they're losing confidence. You can see it in the market today. They're losing confidence in his ability to focus on the task at hand.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and he is going to be caught in that whole issue of numbers don't lie and they will expect to see some better numbers. Our Clare Sebastian continues to follow that soap opera that is the Tesla story. Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, a sea battle between the British and the French -- I'm not kidding. This is the 21st Century now, I think we're in -- that's not a scenario for the historical drama. It happened on Tuesday. You'll want to see this video. We'll have details, coming up.</p><p>And former US President Jimmy Carter joins me to talk about his hands-on effort to build affordable housing. Plus, more from him on Syria and the current President.</p><p>Now, think about this. Nearly everywhere in the United States, a minimum wage worker can't afford the rent on a one-bedroom apartment. Now, the government estimates about half a million people have no home at all. Habitat for humanity works to combat that crisis by building homes right across the United States and in 70 countries worldwide.</p><p>Now, the struggle to pay for housing is a global one, affecting families from Rio to Beijing. Two of Habitat's most well-known volunteers are former US President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn. They have personally joined teams in 14 countries to help people achieve their dream of owning an affordable home.</p><p>[16:20:11]</p><p>NEWTON: Now, I spoke to the former President a little while ago and I asked him what progress has been made towards affordable housing in the last three decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>JIMMY CARTER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, although Habitat has grown in the last 13 years that I know about, 30 times larger than it was 13 years ago, because of good leadership and the enthusiasm that people feel about it. In spite of the fact that we are building now a house or finishing up a house for a family to move into, every 50 seconds, 24 hours a day, in 70 countries around the world in 1,300 places in the United States, the need for low-income housing increases every year.</p><p>Because construction has increased in cost, because it's more expensive to finish a house, and because land has gone up. And as you know, rent has just skyrocketed in some places. So, nowadays, what we try to do is to make housing available through Habitat, which it always, invariably, is lower cost per month, without interest. We don't charge any interest because the Bible says you don't charge a poor person interest. If they just pay 30 years on the principle itself, they can own a house themselves cheaper than they used to pay rent for an inadequate place for a human being to live.</p><p>So we see Habitat as increasing rapidly in its service, but the need for low-income housing increasing and so local, state, and Federal governments ought to know this and the private sector, as well.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and you're right there, in the sense that the need is intensifying. We continue to see stories about homelessness, not just in large cities in the United States or expensive cities in the United States, but right around the world. Getting back to the issue, in terms of what you can do about that, I mean, what do you think that governments and regular folk are missing about how we can actually end homelessness, even in our richest cities?</p><p>CARTER: Well, I think most of the low-income housing is provided not by the government, but by private enterprise in America and the banks need to be more liberal, more progressive, more forthcoming in making housing loans available. The low interest payments that are imposed now make it very attractive.</p><p>But I think bank policies are very important, and I think that just the public sector, you know, people who serve in public office, mayors and city councilmen and members of the Congress and members of state legislatures, need to have public housing or low-income housing at the top of our agenda, as a top priority.</p><p>NEWTON: If you'll allow me, Mr. President, I just wanted to delve into current politics. I know you say you're out of the business of politics, but you have said that, you know, you don't think it's right that the Democrats pursue President Trump in terms of impeaching him. Why not?</p><p>CARTER: Well, I'm not -- I never have mentioned the word \"impeachment,\" I don't think o want to get involved in that. I think it's a mistake, politically, for Democrats to be talking about impeachment of a President. We need to wait until the special investigator or special prosecutor makes his report.</p><p>I think that Mr. Mueller is completely qualified to do that and if the President turns out to be guilty of a crime, I'm not assuming that he will, then the Congress will take action. But I don't think that it's good for Democrats to be talking about impeachment at this time.</p><p>NEWTON: I mean, how worried are you in general, though, about the fractious nature of politics right now in the United States? You know, we have these memorials to John McCain, someone who did reach across the aisle, we just don't see much of that anymore.</p><p>CARTER: Well, you know, obviously, all Presidents make mistake and I think that President Trump has been guilty of making a lot of mistakes. One of the mistakes that he made last week that was very troubling to me was not honoring John in an adequate way and the Senator has been a great hero for our country in the Navy and John McCain and I both graduated from the same institution, and that is the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, and I looked upon him as a great hero for our country, both in the military, and also as a great public servant through the US Senate.</p><p>So I think that President Trump made a mistake at first, by, you know, going back and forth on whether to raise a flag or not -- or lower the flag. I think he's made a correction on that. So, we all make mistakes, but I think that he's trying to correct his mistakes, as best he can. He made a mistake at first, I think he's partially corrected it.</p><p>[16:25:16]</p><p>NEWTON: You had an editorial in \"The New York Times\" regarding Syria and you wrote that many Syrians have concluded that almost any peace, even an imperfect or ugly peace, is better than ongoing violence.</p><p>CARTER: Yes.</p><p>NEWTON: I mean, some would say, that at worse, that's complicity in Syrian war crimes and at best, it's really vindication of the brutal war that has been conducted by Syria and its backers, Iran, and Russia. I mean, why are you calling for this now?</p><p>CARTER: Well, I think, the best thing to do is to end the violence now and then work out the problem with the incumbent President Assad. I know him quite well, as a matter of fact. I used to -- I haven't talked to him in many, many years now, but he has committed, I think some very serious crimes against his own people.</p><p>But the first thing we need to do is, as I said in the editorial, is to stop the war and then work out with the United Nations and other forces the -- how to treat the incumbent leader of Syria and it's inevitable, I think that he and with his allies, particularly the Russians and to some lesser degree, the Iranians are expanding his hold on the country.</p><p>So he needs to be given a chance for peace, first of all, and if he accepts it, then we can accommodate his crimes later on.</p><p>NEWTON: But at any cost? You know, they have called him a butcher. Many people in Syria would really have problems with the fact that he would remain in power and basically win at this war.</p><p>CARTER: Well, I think the basic assumption is he's going to be in power anyway, and his power is increasing. But in the meantime, a lot of people in Syria are getting killed and can't move back to their homes. So the first thing to do is to end the war and that would end barrel bombs and that would also end the use of chemical weapons on innocent people if the war ends. And then when that is done and a lot of people are in favor of that, then we can deal with the crimes that have been committed already.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: The former President there, now 93 years old. So we move on to a skirmish over scallops. Tempers fly as British and French fishermen clash on the sea. You do not want to miss this story.</p><p>[16:30:00] PAULA NEWTON, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Hello, I'm Paula Newton, coming up in the next half hour of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Aston Martin's chief executive tells us how the company is preparing for Brexit as it gets ready for its own IPO.</p><p>And never mind, the scour of some British and French boats are doing battle in the English channel. First, these are the top news stories we're following this hour. Late Senator John McCain is now lying in state in Phoenix, Arizona on what would have been his 82nd birthday.</p><p>You are looking at live pictures there as National Guard members carried his caskets to the Arizona Capitol building where visitors continued to pay their respects. Now, earlier, the war hero's wife Cindy McCain delicately patted flagged-draped casket.</p><p>There will soon be another high profile departure from Donald Trump's inner circle. The U.S. President announced on Twitter that Don McGahn will leave his job as White House counsel just in the next few months. Mr. Trump said it will happen following the expected confirmation of Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>A dam bursting has forced more than 50,000 people in central Myanmar to evacuate their homes, but officials say several villages are now flooded and at least one of them was hit with a wall of water more than 2 meters high -- incredible pictures there. There's no word yet on any casualties.</p><p>The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico said Wednesday that bureaucracy and government inefficiency are to blame for the death of almost 3,000 people in the wake of Hurricane Maria. That revised death toll came to light as part of a new study commissioned by the Puerto Rican government.</p><p>Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz blamed President Donald Trump's administration for not providing more assistance. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter says the west may have to work with Bashar al-Assad in order to end Syria's civil war. Now, Mr. Carter has called on western nations to re-engage with the Syrian government as a step for securing peace.</p><p>Speaking to me on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, he said there were major risks in simply waiting for the Assad regime to fall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES CARTER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes, basically, Assad here is going to be in power anyway and his power increasing. But in the meantime, a lot of people in Syria are getting killed, they can't move back to their homes.</p><p>For the first thing they do is to the end the war and that would -- that would end barrel bombs and that would also end their use of chemical weapons on innocent people. If the war ends and when that is done and a lot of people are in favor of that, then we can deal with the crimes that have been committed already.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: James Bond's favorite car maker is gearing up for a $6 billion IPO. Now, Aston Martin's long road to its market debut has been far from soon. It was founded by Robert Bamford and Lionel Martin in 1914 and passed through numerous owners including Ford Motors.</p><p>Most recently though, it was bought by an international consortium in 2007. Now, the company has flown the flag for the British car industry for more than a century now. It is of course famous for being James Bond's car of choice.</p><p>Here you see Daniel Craig Bond putting the car to its chases in \"Quantum of Solace\". Now, it's perhaps fitting that the company has gone bankrupt 007 times in history, that is the quirk, there we go, not a coincidence, but now that it's back on firmer footing, it seems to be taking inspiration from Italian rival Ferrari.</p><p>Shares in that company are up 160 percent since its New York IPO back in 2016. Anna Stewart is live in London, she's been speaking with Aston Martin's CEO and he's quite optimistic about not just the company's legacy, but going forward, he says that this could be a popular IPO.</p><p>I'm curious though, Anna, you know, we've got Brexit, we've got auto tariffs, he's not even a little bit worried.</p><p>[16:35:00] ANNA STEWART, CNN: Not really, he was very bullish. He's really determined. This will follow on the footsteps of Ferrari which of course, as he said IPO in a couple of years ago, three years ago and has since over-doubled its valuation. But the market is kind of different now and the headwinds are huge, so much Brexit uncertainty.</p><p>And the risks still lingers that President Trump could impose tariffs on European car makers. So I asked him, why IPO now? What's in it for you? What about all these headwinds?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDY PALMER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ASTON MARTIN: From a management point of view, the management view is based upon our history. Our history is we have 105-year-old brand. We've made beautiful cars in the past, but we've always not been successful on the balance sheet basis.</p><p>And you've had a tendency over the years to have millionaires and billionaires buying into the company, build their car and walk away. And in consequence, the company suffered in rebuilding the company which I hope me and my team have been able to do since 2015 in bringing it back to profitability.</p><p>In creating the cadence of product, seven cars over seven years, one car every year, each car having a seven-year life, copy, repeat, copy, repeat, copy, repeat. In doing that, we've been able to create this tempo in the company and it is this tempo that's making the company profitable.</p><p>Now, what I hope in leaving a legacy is though I leave behind stability and importantly government. And what listing does, it forces you to have independent chairman, independent non-executive directors, a governance around the company which will allow that tempo to continue.</p><p>And the reason that we call the plan the second century plan is about taking all of the earnings from the first century, improving them into the second century and making sure that we have the last British, really British car company which is capable of surviving for the next 100 years.</p><p>STEWART: You turned the company around, but it has been bankrupt several times before. Will investors really want to buy into this company?</p><p>PALMER: By the way, you know, a turnaround isn't one gentleman, it's a team. And the team that we've created is very much a meritocracy, the way we work together. And I think that's what investors are buying. They're buying this team, this team that's demonstrated this company.</p><p>You can liken to Ferrari and of course, Ferrari has been very successful. So if you want a benchmark, it's there, you see the multiple that they've managed to generate against their aevitas(ph). Obviously, our aevitas(ph) is a little bit behind them, but with the same time of company.</p><p>I mean, in fact, over time, as we add new models and we replace models, the pricing is accretive, that means the margin is accretive and we tend towards the Ferrari margins over time, and of course, we go from today's roughly speaking 7,000 cars a year to a volume in 2022 of 14,000 cars a year.</p><p>So you've got this wonderful luxury growth model which of course is very attractive to investors.</p><p>STEWART: Now this IPO will take place among some pretty strong headwinds. Brexit uncertainty on the one hand and still risk lingering at the potential tariffs from the U.S. with President Donald Trump waging tariffs potentially on European cars. Is this the right time to IPO?</p><p>PALMER: Well, I'd say it's therefore the risks that you outline, which are risks to the general economy. I'd say that Aston is the counter that in many cases, it's sheltered from those risks. So if you're looking for a kind of safe haven for your investment, then you choose luxury companies like Aston Martin.</p><p>Luxury companies tend to survive through this turbulence and turbulence better than anybody else mainly because our buyers are less affected by those macro-economics. Now, if you take Brexit for example, we export 25 percent of our cars to the EU, and we sell 30 percent of our cars in the U.K.</p><p>Let's assume that there's a hard Brexit, let's assume that the EU puts a 10 percent tariff, yet, that would have been cars that go to Europe a little bit more expensive, and you might argue we might lose a little bit of market share.</p><p>On the other hand, coming in the other direction, Ferraris and Lamborghinis are also now 10 percent more expensive, and that means that we're more competitive in our own market where we sell a slightly higher percentage of our cars, therefore in that instance, it's a little bit positive.</p><p>On top of that, of course, one assumes that if you have a hard Brexit, that the pound is going to go softer, it will weaken. And when the pound weakens, that's good for us as an exporter, so improves our profitability. So you see in the case of Brexit, it's not something that keeps me awake at night, it's not something that I put you know, hard Brexit with tariffs.</p><p>It's not something though I would advocate, but it's certainly not something that worries me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:40:00] STEWART: Andy Palmer; the CEO there, Paula. He did put a very positive spin on Brexit, but I would say later in the discussion he did say he was prepared for a hard Brexit, for a no-deal Brexit. Although, all that's hard amid here in the U.K., most of the components are imported in.</p><p>In fact, most of them from Europe and Germany in particular. And as a result, they offer a just-in time production, much like all the car makers around Europe and many in Asia of course. Which means components arrive just in time for them to be fitted into the car.</p><p>They now have a process whereby they keep components for five days in a warehouse because they are ready for potential custom delay, and he said they could even increase that.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and that is going to be a problem, you know, just in time, obviously, pioneered really in the auto industry in North America is so important, interesting even to a luxury car maker. I know you're saying he put a positive spin on Brexit, did he also put a positive spin on Asia's growth because obviously, if you have to look at the evaluation of this company going forward, Asia's got to be part of the equation.</p><p>STEWART: Asia is actually where they're really planning to double-down in terms of sales coming up. They have a vast increase in sales planned for the next few years, particularly when they're new facility in Wales comes online. And Asia is certainly the biggest target for them.</p><p>In the United States, they're still planning to continue their growth there, and they said that, yes, with any tariffs that may come their way, they'll simply pass on that cost to the consumer. Paula?</p><p>NEWTON: And I didn't ask you, I should have before, did you get a spin in the car?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>STEWART: Paula, they were just on (INAUDIBLE) reason to get spin on anything. But I can tell you, at least I've already broken the bad news to all our viewers out there, the ticker symbol will not be 007, I'm sorry to say --</p><p>NEWTON: Oh, shame --</p><p>STEWART: The CEO himself told me, it wouldn't be, it's more likely to be AML, which I think is a huge disappointment.</p><p>NEWTON: Maybe they could have come up with some other James Bond acronym, but I'll leave it there, maybe I'll get creative, Anna, thanks so much for bringing us this story, appreciate it. Now, European markets ended the day on a mixed note.</p><p>In London, the FTSE was dragged down by energy stocks and miners, it was a slightly better story on the continent indices. And Paris and Frankfurt ended about a third of a percent higher, it will be interesting where they go tomorrow, given those highs in the U.S. markets.</p><p>Now, next on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a turf war on the high seas, these fishermen are brawling over scallops, I can't get enough of these pictures, it's incredible. Bumper cars pulling the shrimps.</p><p>[16:45:00] NEWTON: This is not a historical feature, this is bumper cars in the English channel, boats running into one another, flares being shot, bottles being thrown, rocks, it's a story that really takes you back in time. British and French fishermen have clashed in a spectacular fashion over scallops.</p><p>Now this is where the skirmish took place, the English channel, French fishermen were restricted by their government on when they can try and catch those scallops. Now regulations they say the English ignore.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's seven days a week for them, they fill up, they come, they dretch, they fill up the hole and then they go home. There you go. They just leave us the scraps.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Leave us the scraps. Now, the CEO of the U.K. Federation of Fishermen's Organization told Cnn this is not the way to solve this dispute.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARRIE DEAS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ORGANIZATIONS, UNITED KINGDOM: There had been disputes over fishing rights in the past and I'm sure there will be in the future. The place to resolve them is around the table by talking, not by firing flares, throwing shackles, engaging in dangerous maneuvers that jeopardize safety at sea.</p><p>So what we've seen here is a step change that is really concerning, and we very much hope it isn't the pattern for the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, so do we all. Now, that's the British side of the story. We want to hear of course from the French side as well. Manuel Evrard is the director of the Normandy Fishermen Organization, he joins me now live from Normandy, France, via Skype.</p><p>I mean, look, we are all just stunned by that video, that was incredibly dangerous. What kind -- what was the boiling point here? What was the tipping point to make the French fishermen take those kinds of extreme actions.</p><p>MANUEL EVRARD, DIRECTOR OF NORMANDY FISHERMEN ORGANIZATION: Well, you know, that is a kind of piece of many of the resource for the French fisherman particularly in Normandy. I think the French and the U.S. market, both of them are the main consumers of scallops in the world.</p><p>Regarding of fishermen, of late, it represents up to 80 percent of the annual sales, so it's significant for fishing industry. The French fisherman adopted in the past years specific fishing model, taking good measure to make it sustainable.</p><p>We are opening an enclosure of baits, we also have bigger net size or fishing gear. We also have daily quarter of fishing vessel, and we may have sometimes from time to time to close the fishing for one or two days just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NEWTON: OK, I understand -- I understand that -- I understand what you're saying. You're saying that the French are doing this sustainably, but look, I'm really good by the pictures that I'm seeing there. Do you think there's a risk that this would happen again and who should negotiate this?</p><p>Because clearly, there's got to be a resolution. This can't go on, I mean, look at this.</p><p>EVRARD: Yes, it may happen again. The last few years we reached an agreement with the U.K. vessels and over 16 meters length, but this year, we have not reached this agreement again, so on the British side, it's just an open fishery this year.</p><p>So yes, it may happen again. But still we have to keep in touch with them and we still have a -- we still think that we must have a dialogue and to solve that problem.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and I hear you're enforcing, you're saying this may happen again. When you look to a dialogue, and I know this is visceral, I know the fishermen are fighting for their livelihoods, but is the onus on the fishermen or is the onus on the British and French governments?</p><p>EVRARD: You mean, what do you mean?</p><p>NEWTON: Who needs to negotiate this? Are you looking to the government to negotiate that --</p><p>EVRARD: OK --</p><p>NEWTON: For you or the fishermen?</p><p>EVRARD: I believe that, that should be solved between fishermen themselves. You know, the thing is -- the trouble is that, the counsel(ph), you know, is that they have to spend time to hang on it at sea. So it's -- sometimes if you go to them to gather, to be around the table.</p><p>But I'm pretty sure that sometimes all the fishermen themselves are on the table, we can -- we can reach an agreement.</p><p>[16:50:00] NEWTON: Well, I'm certainly hopeful that that arguing goes on in a conference table and not on the high seas as we've been watching. We'll continue to follow this story, appreciate it. Now, when we come back, Facebook is under pressure again, this time from inside the company.</p><p>The internal posts, that's the talk of the social network.</p><p>NEWTON: OK, there's apparently a growing group of Facebook employees. I'm happy about what they see as the company's lack of diversity and tolerance of their different political views. Oliver Darcy is here to explain. You know, the reporting on this was really interesting that from inside Facebook, they kind of are going with a line that, look, our conservative views are sometimes not tolerated.</p><p>OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: Yes, there's a couple of things you want to mention first. So this happened in the \"New York Times\" last night, and it's a group of Facebook employees who feel that, like you said, their conservative views are not tolerated by the company.</p><p>It was posted on the internal message system at Facebook. But it's important to remember, there are thousands and thousands and thousands of Facebook employees, I think about 25,000 in total, and this group only had a few dozen individuals in there, got a lot more popular groups on Facebook's internal message board where there are thousands of members.</p><p>This one like I said has a few dozen. They're upset that they said their conservative views aren't taken seriously, but a lot of their colleagues too have been pushing back, saying they are taken seriously, and so you're seeing a little debate grow inside Facebook itself.</p><p>NEWTON: But this does play into the narrative certainly from Donald Trump saying that, look, he's not getting a fair shape from the big tech company. I want to talk about that, though, for a minute, Oliver, because you and I are trained to not be so naive about our own bias.</p><p>DARCY: Right --</p><p>NEWTON: We know that we have bias and we try and have people that back our stories, edit our stories, guard against that bias.</p><p>DARCY: Yes --</p><p>NEWTON: I think when Jack Dorsey from Twitter said last week that, oh, you know, yes, our staff is mostly liberal, but it's not a problem. I kind of don't believe it. And if I believe it, I'm willing to bet that even the employees inside these companies don't believe it. What can they do? Do they not have to do more to guard against that bias?</p><p>I mean, Jack Dorsey was very open in saying, yes, our employees are mostly liberal.</p><p>DARCY: Right, but he also said right after, that Twitter works extremely hard to make sure that their personal biases of their employees don't get into how they enforce their policies. Now, I think actually if you just study Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey, I think they're actually really committed to this.</p><p>[16:55:00] You see, Jack Dorsey for instance, he didn't cave to pressure to ban Alex Jones in for worst founder who pushes conspiracy theories on those platforms. So I think if they really were these left-wingers that are portrayed in the press or -- sorry, in the conservative press, you would see them taking issue with Alex Jones and banning him from Twitter.</p><p>And Twitter hasn't done that, they've actually let him stay on the platform. So while their personal biases on employees might certainly lean left, they are saying, they work really hard to make sure that doesn't sip into how they enforce policy.</p><p>NEWTON: And here's the thing. Here at the \"New York Times\", at the newspapers, you know, you have an arm, but sometimes you have a certain -- let's say a certain outlet to kind of test that --</p><p>DARCY: Yes --</p><p>NEWTON: I don't see that yet at these technology companies. We're going to have these hearings coming up next week, do you think we will learn more about this and many other things that go on at those tech companies.</p><p>DARCY: I imagine we'll get very loyally responses to a lot of the questions. The fact is that big corporations, whether it's media outlets, whether it's big tech companies, they don't like being transparent. They generally refuse transparency. They don't like people coming in and examining every single detail they do.</p><p>And I think that while we're like calling for transparency, these corporations -- I don't think you could find any corporation that would say yes, invite the media in, but examine everything we do, let's make sure it's all public for everyone to see.</p><p>No company really likes that, and Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are no different. The issue is that they have a lot of influence on the public debate, and so you're hearing people say, you know, you guys need to be a little more transparent in the way you enforce policies, the way you make policy and so on and so forth.</p><p>NEWTON: And we should be a little more vocal, I mean, we've been trying to get Google on here for literally years, these are not secret societies, the CEOs need to come and talk, at least Jack Dorsey came on Cnn --</p><p>DARCY: Well, both do, doesn't want to go to Congress, so --</p><p>NEWTON: Exactly, they're going to have empty chairs --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>They're going to have empty chairs at these hearings. Yes, so, you know, the more they speak, the more we'll start to learn about how these things are functioning and the more we'll have confidence, right? That they don't have a bias.</p><p>DARCY: And I think one last thing to keep in mind is they're worried that any word they say is going to be misconstrued and exploited by certain outlets, particularly partisan outlets on the right to say, see, we caught you, you do have that kind sort of bias.</p><p>I think that that's something they really are cautious of, so when they make statements, when they go before Congress, you get a lot of loyally responses because they're really afraid that their comments might be taken out of context.</p><p>NEWTON: And that tees up the hearings very well. Oliver, thanks so much - -</p><p>DARCY: Thank you --</p><p>NEWTON: I appreciate it.

More records on  Wall Street.  It's Wednesday, the 29th of August.  Tonight, Donald Trump  watches the US economy grow even faster and says he's optimistic about a  trade deal with Canada.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Former US President Jimmy Carter tells me how the world can fix this  housing crisis.  And after a century of business, Aston Martin, that's  James Bond's car, is ready to go public.  You'll hear from the Chief  Executive this hour.  I'm Paula Newton and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Yes, what is going to keep this market down?  That's the question.  Strong  US growth numbers put so much steam into this market, all the major US  markets moved higher and, of course, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P hit all-time  highs.  Here we are again, folks, with my chicken scratch, I'm going for 18  there and 29 here.  That is incredible.  That is just this year.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now, US GDP growth for the second quarter was revised up to 4.2%, that is  the highest rate since 2014.  You can imagine, President Trump was pleased  with those numbers, tweeting, \"Our country is doing great.\"  And then  saying this to reporters.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know, our economy has  picked up in terms of worth.  There's a lot of money for everyone sitting  around this table, but we picked up about $10 trillion, general, since my  election and we're doing record business, record stock market, record  everything, and also, record unemployment.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> NEWTON:  I'm joined now by Julia Coronado.  She is the founder of  MacroPolicy Perspectives and formerly worked at the Federal Reserve.  I  don't know what you can think at what your former colleagues are thinking  right now.  You know, this market just does not see any danger ahead, but  more importantly, do you think issue is that they see nowhere else to put  their money at this point in time?  </p><p> You know, it is slow and steady at the Federal Reserve and the growth in  the rest of the world just isn't looking as attractive.  </p><p> JULIA CORONADO, FOUNDER, MACROPOLICY PERSPECTIVES:  That's right.  I mean,  part of what we're seeing in the US markets that is that the US economy is  humming along.  That was confirmed again with a minor upward revision to  second quarter GDP.  We see strong jobs growth and the rest of the world  hasn't seen such great times.  We've seen some slowdown in Asia, some  slowdown in China.  So relatively speaking, it does look attractive for  now.  Keep in mind, though, we've got a lot of stimulus under our wings  from the tax cuts and that is inherently temporary, so, the party won't  last forever.  </p><p> NEWTON:  And yet, at this point in time, it seems that it will.  Remember,  the record bull that we have going on here, Julia. when you think about how  you actually try and care for this economy, if I can put it that way,  whether you're the Fed or whether you're Congress, I mean, we've got some  real fiscal issues in this country, once that will concern a lot of  different people.  </p><p> CORONADO:  Correct.  </p><p> NEWTON:  And in Jay Powell's remarks last week, what I read from him was  that, \"Look, we will be a lot more cautious going forward,\" but the data  just doesn't -- it's not coming in the way we would like it to in real  time.  There are still some puzzling features about the data, especially  where it goes to wage growth and inflation.  </p><p> CORONADO:  Exactly.  And that is what justifies the Fed's sort of gradual  approach is that so far, we have seen great growth numbers, great jobs  numbers.  Wage growth, still stuck below 3% and inflation at the Fed's  target, but showing no alarming signs of acceleration.  </p><p> So, for the Fed, that all adds up to, yes, take the punch bowl away, but  very slowly, just sort of dim the lights a little bit on the party, but not  slam on the brakes.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Definitely, they won't be slamming on any brakes.  There's been a  puzzling feature to this recovery, and that is the fact that the wages,  they still do not continue to grow.  </p><p> CORONADO:  Correct.  </p><p> NEWTON:  One thing we've discussed over and over is that marginalized set  of workers in the United States, who have been really closed -- really shut  out of this economy, if you will, for so many years.  Do you think that's  why there isn't the wage pressure?  Or do you think it has something else  to do, even with undocumented workers, let's say?  </p><p> CORONADO:  No, I think that you've put your finger on a very important  element of this, and in fact, Chairman Powell spoke about that at Jackson  Hole and has spoken about that before and Janet Yellen has been talking  about it for years, which is that the labor market was so terrible during  the great recession, a lot of people gave up and left the labor force.   Would those people come back?  We are seeing them come back.  </p><p> So that is the source of slack, if you will, that will keep downward  pressure on wages until everybody that wants a job has found a job.  So the  labor market is great, but it's not exactly looking like it's moving into  overheating territory, and that's a positive thing.  We can bring back  workers into economically active status.  That's good for our potential  growth rates.  </p><p> [16:05:06]  </p><p> NEWTON:  Now, I want to throw -- I want to run something by you.  There's  been a great debate, as you know, about deregulation and tax reform policy  in this country.  I want you to listen to Mohamed El-Erian, who spoke to me  yesterday just about whether or not this vindicates Donald Trump's economic  policies.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ:  It's a vindication of  tax reform, it's a vindication of deregulation, it's a vindication of the  hope that we'll also get infrastructure.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> NEWTON:  What do you think, Julia?  Do we need infrastructure now or just  too much juice in the economy?  </p><p> CORONADO:  Look, I think infrastructure has been a great idea on the table  for a long time, that we haven't gone down that road.  I would be a little  bit more cautious in calling this a vindication.  We have borrowed a lot of  money.  This tax reform was not revenue neutral.  We sort of all agreed  that lower tax rates would be a good idea, but originally the intention  was, let's close some loopholes, as well so that we don't explode the  deficit.  </p><p> Instead, we're going the exploding the deficit route.  So we're borrowing  against our future, and that will present us with harder challenges down  the road.  So again, it feels great right now, but I don't think you would  recommend say, for example, that your teenager follows such a strategy in  borrowing against their future.  So I think it's a short-term vindication,  that presents us with longer term challenges.  It would have been probably  more ideal to go with some infrastructure spending that was financed with  public/private partnerships, something that would address some deeper  productivity-enhancing  investment without, necessarily, blowing up the  deficit.  But call me old school.  </p><p> NEWTON:  You and me both, Julia.  I am happy to be in that category with  you, because I would have loved to see some infrastructure, you know, those  of us who use it in this country.  Julia, thank you so much.  We'll  continue to check in with you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p> Now, President Trump says he's optimistic that Canada will join the  US/Mexico trade deal and expects a breakthrough could come by Friday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TRUMP:  The deal we've made is a fantastic deal.  It's gotten great reviews  with Mexico, trade deal.  Right now, we call it the US-Mexico Trade  Agreement and we'll see whether or not Canada gets into it.  Otherwise,  we'll doing something separately or we won't do anything, which is okay,  too.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you optimistic?  </p><p> TRUMP:  I think so.  I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I  think it's going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I  think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> NEWTON:  Some more negotiating tactics there from the President.  Now,  those comments came as Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is due  to meet with US Trade Representatives in about 45 minutes from now.  Prime  Minister Trudeau says that Canada is ready to walk away if he has to,  adding no deal is still better than a bad deal.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> JUSTIN TRUDEAU, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA:  As I've said, Canada is always  willing to sit down and work in a constructive and responsible way around  the table.  We've, done that from the very beginning and we will continue  to be creative and constructive around the table.  We're working now.  We  sent our whole team down to Washington to engage in this week's  negotiations.  We recognize that there is a possibility of getting there by  Friday, but it is only a possibility, because it will hinge on whether or  not there is ultimately a good deal for Canada, a good deal for Canadians.  </p><p> I've said from the very beginning, no NAFTA deal is better that a bad NAFTA  deal and we're going to remain firm on that principle, because Canadians  expect us to stand up for them, and that's what this government is going to  do.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> NEWTON:  Both the US and Canada are continuing to play politics.  The auto  sector, though, meantime, it's of material importance to them and they're  watching quite anxiously.  </p><p> Joining me now on the phone is Ann Wilson.  She is senior vice president of  the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association.  Now, I want to stress  that you deal -- you're not -- you deal with all the companies, the Ford,  the GMs, the Chryslers of the world, but you are auto parts manufacturers,  you have a huge stake in these negotiations though.  From what you've seen  so far of the US-Mexico deal, that Canada says that in principle they agree  to, but they also have to see the details, does that put all three  countries in a better position in terms of  having a more competitive car  industry?  </p><p> ANN WILSON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, MOTOR AND EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS  ASSOCIATION:  Well, first, Paula, thank you very much for having me on the  show.  We are heartened by what we see between US and Mexico on many  fronts.  We do think that there's a real possibility here with the regional  value content and the increase that our administration, the Trump  administration sought to improve the trade agreement for all the parties.  </p><p> But I would like to go back to what you started off the show on.  It is  really important that Canada be at the table and that this be a three-party  agreement.  We represent motor vehicle suppliers.  We are actually the  largest employer of manufacturing jobs in the United States.  </p><p> [16:10:11]  </p><p> WILSON:  And our jobs have actually grown under NAFTA.  So NAFTA has been  good for our companies, but it's also been good for the American workers  who are employed by our companies, but we need Canada to be there.  </p><p> NEWTON:  At times, President Trump does not seem to have listened to that  message.  He thinks that, look, if he doesn't get the trade deal that he  wants, the trilateral deal doesn't have to happen.  Do you find that  sometimes that your message falls on deaf ears when it comes to the  administration?  </p><p> WILSON:  Well, with I think the President is challenging all of us in the  business community to come back to them to explain exactly why something  that we have come to expect from NAFTA needs to continue, and I think that  the auto industry has done a good job of trying to show how NAFTA allows  the United States to be competitive in a global environment.  </p><p> So it allows the three countries to be competitive compared to Europe,  compared to Japan and Asia, and that's why this three-country agreement is  so important.  </p><p> NEWTON:  If there is no deal, Donald Trump continues to say that he will  impose tariffs on cars coming in from Canada into the United States.  Given  the integrated nature of the auto industry that you work in, is that  possible?  Would that be feasible?  </p><p> WILSON:  Well, it is feasible, but we are very much opposed to that.  We  build cars, we sell cars in a global environment.  Most of our members are  global players, but we also have a lot of manufacturers in this country who  have just the facility in the US, but they are very dependent on all of the  vehicle manufacturers being able to be successful.  </p><p> I'm from the south, and I say a lot of rising tides with small boats, and  what we need to talk about here is the dependency between vehicle  manufacturers and their supply base, and then the dependency on US workers  for those jobs.  </p><p> So, you know, if we cannot be able to get parts into this country on a  financially viable front, it's going to be much more difficult to make cars  in this country, and if it's hard to make cars in this country, we won't  employ as many people.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, and that is a very clear message there.  Ann Wilson, thanks  so much for your time.  Really appreciate it.  </p><p> Now, later in the program, you are going to here from the Chief Executive  of Aston Martin which has just announced it is preparing for an IPO.  He  will tell us why he's actually not worrying about the threat from auto  tariffs.  </p><p>Tesla shares closed down another 2% amid new trouble from CEO, Elon Musk.   Now, he may face legal action for his verbal attack on a cave diver, after  all.  Here's a reminder of how we got here.  Thank goodness.  Last month,  Musk offered a miniature submarine to help rescue 12 boys and their  football coach who were trapped in a cave in Thailand.  </p><p> One of the rescue divers called, Vernon Unsworth called it a PR stunt and  said Musk can, quote, \"stick the submarine where it hurts.\"  In a Twitter  outburst, Musk called Unsworth a pedophile.  </p><p> The Tesla boss later apologized, but on Tuesday, Musk tweeted that he  thought, it was, quote, \"strange\" that that Unsworth hasn't sued him.  Now,  it appears that is going to change.  Clare Sebastian has been following  this.  </p><p> Thank goodness, Clare, because I've completely lost track.  You're going to  give us the details of what' going on right now, but at the end of the day,  it's still clear that Elon Musk has a trouble actually staying focused.  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Right, and staying quiet on Twitter,  Paula.  In the wake of that whole 17-day debacle over whether or not he was  going to take the company private, a lot of investors had really been  hoping to see a more restrained Elon Musk and there were a couple of days  when it looked like that might be the case on Twitter, but clearly that  moment is over.  This is the tweet that he put out in the last 24 to 36  hours about Vern Unsworth.  It was a reply to another Twitter user.  He  said, \"You don't think it's strange that he hasn't sued me?  He was offered  free legal services.\"  Well, as you said, he hasn't sued him yet, but we do  have this letter that was sent by lawyers that have been retained by Vern  Unsworth to Elon Musk.  It's dated August 6th.  </p><p> They say that they are preparing a civil complaint against Elon Musk for  false and defamatory statements.  They said that he had no basis for  calling Vern Unsworth a pedophile and he did it in anger, which is  something that Musk himself later admitted.  So all of this, Paula, yet  another example of how Musk's tweets are damaging the company, and I think  this is going to prompt more calls, not only for him to stay off Twitter,  but also for the board to step in and keep up that search for someone to  fill his number two position and take the pressure off of him.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, as you were saying, you know, we talked earlier, the stock  down 2% there.  The new price targets are flying from analysts and they say  it doesn't look good.  And if we can allow ourselves to focus, unlike Elon  Musk.  </p><p> [16:15:08]  </p><p> NEWTON:  In terms of the production targets that you and I have talked  about so much, Clare, people are still saying, look, it is going to be a  rough third quarter for Tesla anyway you have it.  And there you see a  chart of what's gone on from his antics just in about the last four weeks.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Right, the stock is down almost 20% from that peak, which you  see of the back of that going private tweet on August 7th.  The interesting  thing is, Paula, the stock had risen just before that.  They'd produced a  good earnings report.  It beat expectations, cash burn was starting to slow  and they were starting to meeting those Model 3 production targets, but  despite the noise and the distractions of the last month, the financial  problems and the challenges that Tesla faces haven't gone away.  </p><p> They are still burning through cash.  They are under pressure to meet those  Model 3 production targets.  A lot of analysts are saying that if they  don't, they will still have to raise money.  They have $1 billion plus in  bonds that are coming due by March next year.  There are real questions  over how they'll make those payments and musk has continually said that he  doesn't want to raise cash externally.  </p><p> I think a lot of people continue to question that and it doesn't help that  they're losing confidence.  You can see it in the market today.  They're  losing confidence in his ability to focus on the task at hand.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, and he is going to be caught in that whole issue of numbers  don't lie and they will expect to see some better numbers.  Our Clare  Sebastian continues to follow that soap opera that is the Tesla story.   Appreciate it.  </p><p> Now, a sea battle between the British and the French -- I'm not kidding.   This is the 21st Century now, I think we're in -- that's not a scenario for  the historical drama.  It happened on Tuesday.  You'll want to see this  video.  We'll have details, coming up.  </p><p> And former US President Jimmy Carter joins me to talk about his hands-on  effort to build affordable housing.  Plus, more from him on Syria and the  current President.  </p><p> Now, think about this.  Nearly everywhere in the United States, a minimum  wage worker can't afford the rent on a one-bedroom apartment.  Now, the  government estimates about half a million people have no home at all.   Habitat for humanity works to combat that crisis by building homes right  across the United States and in 70 countries worldwide.  </p><p> Now, the struggle to pay for housing is a global one, affecting families  from Rio to Beijing.  Two of Habitat's most well-known volunteers are  former US President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn.  They have  personally joined teams in 14 countries to help people achieve their dream  of owning an affordable home.  </p><p> [16:20:11]  </p><p> NEWTON:  Now, I spoke to the former President a little while ago and I  asked him what progress has been made towards affordable housing in the  last three decades.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> JIMMY CARTER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, although  Habitat has grown in the last 13 years that I know about, 30 times larger  than it was 13 years ago, because of good leadership and the enthusiasm  that people feel about it.  In spite of the fact that we are building now a  house or finishing up a house for a family to move into, every 50 seconds,  24 hours a day, in 70 countries around the world in 1,300 places in the  United States, the need for low-income housing increases every year.  </p><p> Because construction has increased in cost, because it's more expensive to  finish a house, and because land has gone up.  And as you know, rent has  just skyrocketed in some places.  So, nowadays, what we try to do is to  make housing available through Habitat, which it always, invariably, is  lower cost per month, without interest.  We don't charge any interest  because the Bible says you don't charge a poor person interest.  If they  just pay 30 years on the principle itself, they can own a house themselves  cheaper than they used to pay rent for an inadequate place for a human  being to live.  </p><p> So we see Habitat as increasing rapidly in its service, but the need for  low-income housing increasing and so local, state, and Federal governments  ought to know this and the private sector, as well.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, and you're right there, in the sense that the need is  intensifying.  We continue to see stories about homelessness, not just in  large cities in the United States or expensive cities in the United States,  but right around the world.  Getting back to the issue, in terms of what  you can do about that, I mean, what do you think that governments and  regular folk are missing about how we can actually end homelessness, even  in our richest cities?  </p><p> CARTER:  Well, I think most of the low-income housing is provided not by  the government, but by private enterprise in America and the banks need to  be more liberal, more progressive, more forthcoming in making housing loans  available.  The low interest payments that are imposed now make it very  attractive.  </p><p> But I think bank policies are very important, and I think that just the  public sector, you know, people who serve in public office, mayors and city  councilmen and members of the Congress and members of state legislatures,  need to have public housing or low-income housing at the top of our agenda,  as a top priority.  </p><p> NEWTON:  If you'll allow me, Mr. President, I just wanted to delve into  current politics.  I know you say you're out of the business of politics,  but you have said that, you know, you don't think it's right that the  Democrats pursue President Trump in terms of impeaching him.  Why not?  </p><p> CARTER:  Well, I'm not -- I never have mentioned the word \"impeachment,\" I  don't think o want to get involved in that.  I think it's a mistake,  politically, for Democrats to be talking about impeachment of a President.   We need to wait until the special investigator or special prosecutor makes  his report.  </p><p> I think that Mr. Mueller is completely qualified to do that and if the  President turns out to be guilty of a crime, I'm not assuming that he will,  then the Congress will take action.  But I don't think that it's good for  Democrats to be talking about impeachment at this time.  </p><p> NEWTON:  I mean, how worried are you in general, though, about the  fractious nature of politics right now in the United States?  You know, we  have these memorials to John McCain, someone who did reach across the  aisle, we just don't see much of that anymore.  </p><p> CARTER:  Well, you know, obviously, all Presidents make mistake and I think  that President Trump has been guilty of making a lot of mistakes.  One of  the mistakes that he made last week that was very troubling to me was not  honoring John in an adequate way and the Senator has been a great hero for  our country in the Navy and John McCain and I both graduated from the same  institution, and that is the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, and I looked  upon him as a great hero for our country, both in the military, and also as  a great public servant through the US Senate.  </p><p> So I think that President Trump made a mistake at first, by, you know,  going back and forth on whether to raise a flag or not -- or lower the  flag.  I think he's made a correction on that.  So, we all make mistakes,  but I think that he's trying to correct his mistakes, as best he can.  He  made a mistake at first, I think he's partially corrected it.  </p><p> [16:25:16]  </p><p> NEWTON:  You had an editorial in \"The New York Times\" regarding Syria and  you wrote that many Syrians have concluded that almost any peace, even an  imperfect or ugly peace, is better than ongoing violence.  </p><p> CARTER:  Yes.  </p><p> NEWTON:  I mean, some would say, that at worse, that's complicity in Syrian  war crimes and at best, it's really vindication of the brutal war that has  been conducted by Syria and its backers, Iran, and Russia.  I mean, why are  you calling for this now?  </p><p> CARTER:  Well, I think, the best thing to do is to end the violence now and  then work out the problem with the incumbent President Assad.  I know him  quite well, as a  matter of fact.  I used to -- I haven't talked to him in  many, many years now, but he has committed, I think some very serious  crimes against his own people.  </p><p> But the first thing we need to do is, as I said in the editorial, is to  stop the war and then work out with the United Nations and other forces the  -- how to treat the incumbent leader of Syria and it's inevitable, I think  that he and with his allies, particularly the Russians and to some lesser  degree, the Iranians are expanding his hold on the country.  </p><p> So he needs to be given a chance for peace, first of all, and if he accepts  it, then we can accommodate his crimes later on.  </p><p> NEWTON:  But at any cost?  You know, they have called him a butcher.  Many  people in Syria would really have problems with the fact that he would  remain in power and basically win at this war.  </p><p> CARTER:  Well, I think the basic assumption is he's going to be in power  anyway, and his power is increasing.  But in the meantime, a lot of people  in Syria are getting killed and can't move back to their homes.  So the  first thing to do is to end the war and that would end barrel bombs and  that would also end the use of chemical weapons on innocent people if the  war ends. And then when that is done and a lot of people are in favor of  that, then we can deal with the crimes that have been committed already.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> NEWTON:  The former President there, now 93 years old.  So we move on to a  skirmish over scallops.  Tempers fly as British and French fishermen clash  on the sea.  You do not want to miss this story.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [16:30:00] PAULA NEWTON, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello, I'm Paula  Newton, coming up in the next half hour of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Aston  Martin's chief executive tells us how the company is preparing for Brexit  as it gets ready for its own IPO.</p><p> And never mind, the scour of some British and French boats are doing battle  in the English channel.  First, these are the top news stories we're  following this hour.  Late Senator John McCain is now lying in state in  Phoenix, Arizona on what would have been his 82nd birthday. </p><p> You are looking at live pictures there as National Guard members carried  his caskets to the Arizona Capitol building where visitors continued to pay  their respects.  Now, earlier, the war hero's wife Cindy McCain delicately  patted flagged-draped casket.</p><p> There will soon be another high profile departure from Donald Trump's inner  circle.  The U.S. President announced on Twitter that Don McGahn will leave  his job as White House counsel just in the next few months.  Mr. Trump said  it will happen following the expected confirmation of Supreme Court Justice  nominee Brett Kavanaugh. </p><p> A dam bursting has forced more than 50,000 people in central Myanmar to  evacuate their homes, but officials say several villages are now flooded  and at least one of them was hit with a wall of water more than 2 meters  high -- incredible pictures there.  There's no word yet on any casualties.</p><p> The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico said Wednesday that bureaucracy and  government inefficiency are to blame for the death of almost 3,000 people  in the wake of Hurricane Maria.  That revised death toll came to light as  part of a new study commissioned by the Puerto Rican government. </p><p> Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz blamed President Donald Trump's administration for  not providing more assistance.  Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter says the  west may have to work with Bashar al-Assad in order to end Syria's civil  war.  Now, Mr. Carter has called on western nations to re-engage with the  Syrian government as a step for securing peace. </p><p> Speaking to me on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, he said there were major risks in  simply waiting for the Assad regime to fall.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JAMES CARTER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Yes, basically, Assad  here is going to be in power anyway and his power increasing.  But in the  meantime, a lot of people in Syria are getting killed, they can't move back  to their homes.</p><p> For the first thing they do is to the end the war and that would -- that  would end barrel bombs and that would also end their use of chemical  weapons on innocent people.  If the war ends and when that is done and a  lot of people are in favor of that, then we can deal with the crimes that  have been committed already.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> NEWTON:  James Bond's favorite car maker is gearing up for a $6 billion  IPO.  Now, Aston Martin's long road to its market debut has been far from  soon.  It was founded by Robert Bamford and Lionel Martin in 1914 and  passed through numerous owners including Ford Motors.</p><p> Most recently though, it was bought by an international consortium in 2007.   Now, the company has flown the flag for the British car industry for more  than a century now.  It is of course famous for being James Bond's car of  choice. </p><p> Here you see Daniel Craig Bond putting the car to its chases in \"Quantum of  Solace\".  Now, it's perhaps fitting that the company has gone bankrupt 007  times in history, that is the quirk, there we go, not a coincidence, but  now that it's back on firmer footing, it seems to be taking inspiration  from Italian rival Ferrari.</p><p> Shares in that company are up 160 percent since its New York IPO back in  2016.  Anna Stewart is live in London, she's been speaking with Aston  Martin's CEO and he's quite optimistic about not just the company's legacy,  but going forward, he says that this could be a popular IPO. </p><p> I'm curious though, Anna, you know, we've got Brexit, we've got auto  tariffs, he's not even a little bit worried. </p><p> [16:35:00] ANNA STEWART, CNN:  Not really, he was very bullish.  He's  really determined.  This will follow on the footsteps of Ferrari which of  course, as he said IPO in a couple of years ago, three years ago and has  since over-doubled its valuation.  But the market is kind of different now  and the headwinds are huge, so much Brexit uncertainty.</p><p> And the risks still lingers that President Trump could impose tariffs on  European car makers.  So I asked him, why IPO now? What's in it for you?  What about all these headwinds?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ANDY PALMER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ASTON MARTIN:  From a management  point of view, the management view is based upon our history.  Our history  is we have 105-year-old brand.  We've made beautiful cars in the past, but  we've always not been successful on the balance sheet basis.</p><p> And you've had a tendency over the years to have millionaires and  billionaires buying into the company, build their car and walk away.  And  in consequence, the company suffered in rebuilding the company which I hope  me and my team have been able to do since 2015 in bringing it back to  profitability.</p><p> In creating the cadence of product, seven cars over seven years, one car  every year, each car having a seven-year life, copy, repeat, copy, repeat,  copy, repeat.  In doing that, we've been able to create this tempo in the  company and it is this tempo that's making the company profitable.</p><p> Now, what I hope in leaving a legacy is though I leave behind stability and  importantly government.  And what listing does, it forces you to have  independent chairman, independent non-executive directors, a governance  around the company which will allow that tempo to continue.</p><p> And the reason that we call the plan the second century plan is about  taking all of the earnings from the first century, improving them into the  second century and making sure that we have the last British, really  British car company which is capable of surviving for the next 100 years.</p><p> STEWART:  You turned the company around, but it has been bankrupt several  times before.  Will investors really want to buy into this company?</p><p> PALMER:  By the way, you know, a turnaround isn't one gentleman, it's a  team.  And the team that we've created is very much a meritocracy, the way  we work together.  And I think that's what investors are buying.  They're  buying this team, this team that's demonstrated this company.</p><p> You can liken to Ferrari and of course, Ferrari has been very successful.   So if you want a benchmark, it's there, you see the multiple that they've  managed to generate against their aevitas(ph).  Obviously, our aevitas(ph)  is a little bit behind them, but with the same time of company. </p><p> I mean, in fact, over time, as we add new models and we replace models, the  pricing is accretive, that means the margin is accretive and we tend  towards the Ferrari margins over time, and of course, we go from today's  roughly speaking 7,000 cars a year to a volume in 2022 of 14,000 cars a  year.</p><p> So you've got this wonderful luxury growth model which of course is very  attractive to investors.</p><p> STEWART:  Now this IPO will take place among some pretty strong headwinds.   Brexit uncertainty on the one hand and still risk lingering at the  potential tariffs from the U.S. with President Donald Trump waging tariffs  potentially on European cars.  Is this the right time to IPO?</p><p> PALMER:  Well, I'd say it's therefore the risks that you outline, which are  risks to the general economy.  I'd say that Aston is the counter that in  many cases, it's sheltered from those risks.  So if you're looking for a  kind of safe haven for your investment, then you choose luxury companies  like Aston Martin.</p><p> Luxury companies tend to survive through this turbulence and turbulence  better than anybody else mainly because our buyers are less affected by  those macro-economics.  Now, if you take Brexit for example, we export 25  percent of our cars to the EU, and we sell 30 percent of our cars in the  U.K.</p><p> Let's assume that there's a hard Brexit, let's assume that the EU puts a 10  percent tariff, yet, that would have been cars that go to Europe a little  bit more expensive, and you might argue we might lose a little bit of  market share.</p><p> On the other hand, coming in the other direction, Ferraris and Lamborghinis  are also now 10 percent more expensive, and that means that we're more  competitive in our own market where we sell a slightly higher percentage of  our cars, therefore in that instance, it's a little bit positive. </p><p> On top of that, of course, one assumes that if you have a hard Brexit, that  the pound is going to go softer, it will weaken.  And when the pound  weakens, that's good for us as an exporter, so improves our profitability.   So you see in the case of Brexit, it's not something that keeps me awake at  night, it's not something that I put you know, hard Brexit with tariffs.</p><p> It's not something though I would advocate, but it's certainly not  something that worries me.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> [16:40:00] STEWART:  Andy Palmer; the CEO there, Paula.  He did put a very  positive spin on Brexit, but I would say later in the discussion he did say  he was prepared for a hard Brexit, for a no-deal Brexit.  Although, all  that's hard amid here in the U.K., most of the components are imported in.</p><p> In fact, most of them from Europe and Germany in particular.  And as a  result, they offer a just-in time production, much like all the car makers  around Europe and many in Asia of course.  Which means components arrive  just in time for them to be fitted into the car.</p><p> They now have a process whereby they keep components for five days in a  warehouse because they are ready for potential custom delay, and he said  they could even increase that.</p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, and that is going to be a problem, you know, just in time,  obviously, pioneered really in the auto industry in North America is so  important, interesting even to a luxury car maker.  I know you're saying he  put a positive spin on Brexit, did he also put a positive spin on Asia's  growth because obviously, if you have to look at the evaluation of this  company going forward, Asia's got to be part of the equation.</p><p> STEWART:  Asia is actually where they're really planning to double-down in  terms of sales coming up.  They have a vast increase in sales planned for  the next few years, particularly when they're new facility in Wales comes  online.  And Asia is certainly the biggest target for them.</p><p> In the United States, they're still planning to continue their growth  there, and they said that, yes, with any tariffs that may come their way,  they'll simply pass on that cost to the consumer.  Paula?</p><p> NEWTON:  And I didn't ask you, I should have before, did you get a spin in  the car?</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> STEWART:  Paula, they were just on (INAUDIBLE) reason to get spin on  anything.  But I can tell you, at least I've already broken the bad news to  all our viewers out there, the ticker symbol will not be 007, I'm sorry to  say -- </p><p> NEWTON:  Oh, shame -- </p><p> STEWART:  The CEO himself told me, it wouldn't be, it's more likely to be  AML, which I think is a huge disappointment.</p><p> NEWTON:  Maybe they could have come up with some other James Bond acronym,  but I'll leave it there, maybe I'll get creative, Anna, thanks so much for  bringing us this story, appreciate it.  Now, European markets ended the day  on a mixed note.</p><p> In London, the FTSE was dragged down by energy stocks and miners, it was a  slightly better story on the continent indices.  And Paris and Frankfurt  ended about a third of a percent higher, it will be interesting where they  go tomorrow, given those highs in the U.S. markets.</p><p> Now, next on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a turf war on the high seas, these  fishermen are brawling over scallops, I can't get enough of these pictures,  it's incredible.  Bumper cars pulling the shrimps.      </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> [16:45:00] NEWTON:  This is not a historical feature, this is bumper cars  in the English channel, boats running into one another, flares being shot,  bottles being thrown, rocks, it's a story that really takes you back in  time.  British and French fishermen have clashed in a spectacular fashion  over scallops.</p><p> Now this is where the skirmish took place, the English channel, French  fishermen were restricted by their government on when they can try and  catch those scallops.  Now regulations they say the English ignore. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's seven days a week for them, they fill up, they  come, they dretch, they fill up the hole and then they go home.  There you  go.  They just leave us the scraps.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> NEWTON:  Leave us the scraps.  Now, the CEO of the U.K. Federation of  Fishermen's Organization told Cnn this is not the way to solve this  dispute.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARRIE DEAS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S  ORGANIZATIONS, UNITED KINGDOM:  There had been disputes over fishing rights  in the past and I'm sure there will be in the future.  The place to resolve  them is around the table by talking, not by firing flares, throwing  shackles, engaging in dangerous maneuvers that jeopardize safety at sea. </p><p> So what we've seen here is a step change that is really concerning, and we  very much hope it isn't the pattern for the future.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, so do we all.  Now, that's the British side of the story.  We  want to hear of course from the French side as well.  Manuel Evrard is the  director of the Normandy Fishermen Organization, he joins me now live from  Normandy, France, via Skype.</p><p> I mean, look, we are all just stunned by that video, that was incredibly  dangerous.  What kind -- what was the boiling point here? What was the  tipping point to make the French fishermen take those kinds of extreme  actions.</p><p> MANUEL EVRARD, DIRECTOR OF NORMANDY FISHERMEN ORGANIZATION:  Well, you  know, that is a kind of piece of many of the resource for the French  fisherman particularly in Normandy.  I think the French and the U.S.  market, both of them are the main consumers of scallops in the world.</p><p> Regarding of fishermen, of late, it represents up to 80 percent of the  annual sales, so it's significant for fishing industry.  The French  fisherman adopted in the past years specific fishing model, taking good  measure to make it sustainable.</p><p> We are opening an enclosure of baits, we also have bigger net size or  fishing gear.  We also have daily quarter of fishing vessel, and we may  have sometimes from time to time to close the fishing for one or two days  just -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> NEWTON:  OK, I understand -- I understand that -- I understand what you're  saying.  You're saying that the French are doing this sustainably, but  look, I'm really good by the pictures that I'm seeing there.  Do you think  there's a risk that this would happen again and who should negotiate this?</p><p> Because clearly, there's got to be a resolution.  This can't go on, I mean,  look at this.</p><p> EVRARD:  Yes, it may happen again.  The last few years we reached an  agreement with the U.K. vessels and over 16 meters length, but this year,  we have not reached this agreement again, so on the British side, it's just  an open fishery this year.</p><p> So yes, it may happen again.  But still we have to keep in touch with them  and we still have a -- we still think that we must have a dialogue and to  solve that problem. </p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, and I hear you're enforcing, you're saying this may happen  again.  When you look to a dialogue, and I know this is visceral, I know  the fishermen are fighting for their livelihoods, but is the onus on the  fishermen or is the onus on the British and French governments?</p><p> EVRARD:  You mean, what do you mean? </p><p> NEWTON:  Who needs to negotiate this? Are you looking to the government to  negotiate that -- </p><p> EVRARD:  OK -- </p><p> NEWTON:  For you or the fishermen?</p><p> EVRARD:  I believe that, that should be solved between fishermen  themselves.  You know, the thing is -- the trouble is that, the  counsel(ph), you know, is that they have to spend time to hang on it at  sea.  So it's -- sometimes if you go to them to gather, to be around the  table. </p><p> But I'm pretty sure that sometimes all the fishermen themselves are on the  table, we can -- we can reach an agreement.</p><p> [16:50:00] NEWTON:  Well, I'm certainly hopeful that that arguing goes on  in a conference table and not on the high seas as we've been watching.   We'll continue to follow this story, appreciate it.  Now, when we come  back, Facebook is under pressure again, this time from inside the company.</p><p> The internal posts, that's the talk of the social network.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> NEWTON:  OK, there's apparently a growing group of Facebook employees.  I'm  happy about what they see as the company's lack of diversity and tolerance  of their different political views.  Oliver Darcy is here to explain.  You  know, the reporting on this was really interesting that from inside  Facebook, they kind of are going with a line that, look, our conservative  views are sometimes not tolerated. </p><p> OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER:  Yes, there's a couple of things  you want to mention first.  So this happened in the \"New York Times\" last  night, and it's a group of Facebook employees who feel that, like you said,  their conservative views are not tolerated by the company. </p><p> It was posted on the internal message system at Facebook.  But it's  important to remember, there are thousands and thousands and thousands of  Facebook employees, I think about 25,000 in total, and this group only had  a few dozen individuals in there, got a lot more popular groups on  Facebook's internal message board where there are thousands of members.</p><p> This one like I said has a few dozen.  They're upset that they said their  conservative views aren't taken seriously, but a lot of their colleagues  too have been pushing back, saying they are taken seriously, and so you're  seeing a little debate grow inside Facebook itself.</p><p> NEWTON:  But this does play into the narrative certainly from Donald Trump  saying that, look, he's not getting a fair shape from the big tech company.   I want to talk about that, though, for a minute, Oliver, because you and I  are trained to not be so naive about our own bias.</p><p> DARCY:  Right -- </p><p> NEWTON:  We know that we have bias and we try and have people that back our  stories, edit our stories, guard against that bias.</p><p> DARCY:  Yes -- </p><p> NEWTON:  I think when Jack Dorsey from Twitter said last week that, oh, you  know, yes, our staff is mostly liberal, but it's not a problem.  I kind of  don't believe it.  And if I believe it, I'm willing to bet that even the  employees inside these companies don't believe it.  What can they do? Do  they not have to do more to guard against that bias? </p><p> I mean, Jack Dorsey was very open in saying, yes, our employees are mostly  liberal.</p><p> DARCY:  Right, but he also said right after, that Twitter works extremely  hard to make sure that their personal biases of their employees don't get  into how they enforce their policies.  Now, I think actually if you just  study Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey, I think they're actually really  committed to this. </p><p> [16:55:00] You see, Jack Dorsey for instance, he didn't cave to pressure to  ban Alex Jones in for worst founder who pushes conspiracy theories on those  platforms.  So I think if they really were these left-wingers that are  portrayed in the press or -- sorry, in the conservative press, you would  see them taking issue with Alex Jones and banning him from Twitter.</p><p> And Twitter hasn't done that, they've actually let him stay on the  platform.  So while their personal biases on employees might certainly lean  left, they are saying, they work really hard to make sure that doesn't sip  into how they enforce policy.</p><p> NEWTON:  And here's the thing.  Here at the \"New York Times\", at the  newspapers, you know, you have an arm, but sometimes you have a certain --  let's say a certain outlet to kind of test that -- </p><p> DARCY:  Yes -- </p><p> NEWTON:  I don't see that yet at these technology companies.  We're going  to have these hearings coming up next week, do you think we will learn more  about this and many other things that go on at those tech companies.</p><p> DARCY:  I imagine we'll get very loyally responses to a lot of the  questions.  The fact is that big corporations, whether it's media outlets,  whether it's big tech companies, they don't like being transparent.  They  generally refuse transparency.  They don't like people coming in and  examining every single detail they do. </p><p> And I think that while we're like calling for transparency, these  corporations -- I don't think you could find any corporation that would say  yes, invite the media in, but examine everything we do, let's make sure  it's all public for everyone to see.</p><p> No company really likes that, and Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are no  different.  The issue is that they have a lot of influence on the public  debate, and so you're hearing people say, you know, you guys need to be a  little more transparent in the way you enforce policies, the way you make  policy and so on and so forth.</p><p> NEWTON:  And we should be a little more vocal, I mean, we've been trying to  get Google on here for literally years, these are not secret societies, the  CEOs need to come and talk, at least Jack Dorsey came on Cnn -- </p><p> DARCY:  Well, both do, doesn't want to go to Congress, so -- </p><p> NEWTON:  Exactly, they're going to have empty chairs -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> They're going to have empty chairs at these hearings.  Yes, so, you know,  the more they speak, the more we'll start to learn about how these things  are functioning and the more we'll have confidence, right? That they don't  have a bias.</p><p> DARCY:  And I think one last thing to keep in mind is they're worried that  any word they say is going to be misconstrued and exploited by certain  outlets, particularly partisan outlets on the right to say, see, we caught  you, you do have that kind sort of bias.</p><p> I think that that's something they really are cautious of, so when they  make statements, when they go before Congress, you get a lot of loyally  responses because they're really afraid that their comments might be taken  out of context.</p><p> NEWTON:  And that tees up the hearings very well.  Oliver, thanks so much - - </p><p> DARCY:  Thank you -- </p><p> NEWTON:  I appreciate it.

More records on  Wall Street.  It's Wednesday, the 29th of August.  Tonight, Donald Trump  watches the US economy grow even faster and says he's optimistic about a  trade deal with Canada.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former US President Jimmy Carter tells me how the world can fix this  housing crisis.  And after a century of business, Aston Martin, that's  James Bond's car, is ready to go public.  You'll hear from the Chief  Executive this hour.  I'm Paula Newton and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yes, what is going to keep this market down?  That's the question.  Strong  US growth numbers put so much steam into this market, all the major US  markets moved higher and, of course, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P hit all-time  highs.  Here we are again, folks, with my chicken scratch, I'm going for 18  there and 29 here.  That is incredible.  That is just this year.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, US GDP growth for the second quarter was revised up to 4.2%, that is  the highest rate since 2014.  You can imagine, President Trump was pleased  with those numbers, tweeting, \"Our country is doing great.\"  And then  saying this to reporters.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know, our economy has  picked up in terms of worth.  There's a lot of money for everyone sitting  around this table, but we picked up about $10 trillion, general, since my  election and we're doing record business, record stock market, record  everything, and also, record unemployment.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>NEWTON:  I'm joined now by Julia Coronado.  She is the founder of  MacroPolicy Perspectives and formerly worked at the Federal Reserve.  I  don't know what you can think at what your former colleagues are thinking  right now.  You know, this market just does not see any danger ahead, but  more importantly, do you think issue is that they see nowhere else to put  their money at this point in time?  </p><p>You know, it is slow and steady at the Federal Reserve and the growth in  the rest of the world just isn't looking as attractive.  </p><p>JULIA CORONADO, FOUNDER, MACROPOLICY PERSPECTIVES:  That's right.  I mean,  part of what we're seeing in the US markets that is that the US economy is  humming along.  That was confirmed again with a minor upward revision to  second quarter GDP.  We see strong jobs growth and the rest of the world  hasn't seen such great times.  We've seen some slowdown in Asia, some  slowdown in China.  So relatively speaking, it does look attractive for  now.  Keep in mind, though, we've got a lot of stimulus under our wings  from the tax cuts and that is inherently temporary, so, the party won't  last forever.  </p><p>NEWTON:  And yet, at this point in time, it seems that it will.  Remember,  the record bull that we have going on here, Julia. when you think about how  you actually try and care for this economy, if I can put it that way,  whether you're the Fed or whether you're Congress, I mean, we've got some  real fiscal issues in this country, once that will concern a lot of  different people.  </p><p>CORONADO:  Correct.  </p><p>NEWTON:  And in Jay Powell's remarks last week, what I read from him was  that, \"Look, we will be a lot more cautious going forward,\" but the data  just doesn't -- it's not coming in the way we would like it to in real  time.  There are still some puzzling features about the data, especially  where it goes to wage growth and inflation.  </p><p>CORONADO:  Exactly.  And that is what justifies the Fed's sort of gradual  approach is that so far, we have seen great growth numbers, great jobs  numbers.  Wage growth, still stuck below 3% and inflation at the Fed's  target, but showing no alarming signs of acceleration.  </p><p>So, for the Fed, that all adds up to, yes, take the punch bowl away, but  very slowly, just sort of dim the lights a little bit on the party, but not  slam on the brakes.  </p><p>NEWTON:  Definitely, they won't be slamming on any brakes.  There's been a  puzzling feature to this recovery, and that is the fact that the wages,  they still do not continue to grow.  </p><p>CORONADO:  Correct.  </p><p>NEWTON:  One thing we've discussed over and over is that marginalized set  of workers in the United States, who have been really closed -- really shut  out of this economy, if you will, for so many years.  Do you think that's  why there isn't the wage pressure?  Or do you think it has something else  to do, even with undocumented workers, let's say?  </p><p>CORONADO:  No, I think that you've put your finger on a very important  element of this, and in fact, Chairman Powell spoke about that at Jackson  Hole and has spoken about that before and Janet Yellen has been talking  about it for years, which is that the labor market was so terrible during  the great recession, a lot of people gave up and left the labor force.   Would those people come back?  We are seeing them come back.  </p><p>So that is the source of slack, if you will, that will keep downward  pressure on wages until everybody that wants a job has found a job.  So the  labor market is great, but it's not exactly looking like it's moving into  overheating territory, and that's a positive thing.  We can bring back  workers into economically active status.  That's good for our potential  growth rates.  </p><p>[16:05:06]  </p><p>NEWTON:  Now, I want to throw -- I want to run something by you.  There's  been a great debate, as you know, about deregulation and tax reform policy  in this country.  I want you to listen to Mohamed El-Erian, who spoke to me  yesterday just about whether or not this vindicates Donald Trump's economic  policies.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ:  It's a vindication of  tax reform, it's a vindication of deregulation, it's a vindication of the  hope that we'll also get infrastructure.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>NEWTON:  What do you think, Julia?  Do we need infrastructure now or just  too much juice in the economy?  </p><p>CORONADO:  Look, I think infrastructure has been a great idea on the table  for a long time, that we haven't gone down that road.  I would be a little  bit more cautious in calling this a vindication.  We have borrowed a lot of  money.  This tax reform was not revenue neutral.  We sort of all agreed  that lower tax rates would be a good idea, but originally the intention  was, let's close some loopholes, as well so that we don't explode the  deficit.  </p><p>Instead, we're going the exploding the deficit route.  So we're borrowing  against our future, and that will present us with harder challenges down  the road.  So again, it feels great right now, but I don't think you would  recommend say, for example, that your teenager follows such a strategy in  borrowing against their future.  So I think it's a short-term vindication,  that presents us with longer term challenges.  It would have been probably  more ideal to go with some infrastructure spending that was financed with  public/private partnerships, something that would address some deeper  productivity-enhancing  investment without, necessarily, blowing up the  deficit.  But call me old school.  </p><p>NEWTON:  You and me both, Julia.  I am happy to be in that category with  you, because I would have loved to see some infrastructure, you know, those  of us who use it in this country.  Julia, thank you so much.  We'll  continue to check in with you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>Now, President Trump says he's optimistic that Canada will join the  US/Mexico trade deal and expects a breakthrough could come by Friday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  The deal we've made is a fantastic deal.  It's gotten great reviews  with Mexico, trade deal.  Right now, we call it the US-Mexico Trade  Agreement and we'll see whether or not Canada gets into it.  Otherwise,  we'll doing something separately or we won't do anything, which is okay,  too.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you optimistic?  </p><p>TRUMP:  I think so.  I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I  think it's going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I  think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>NEWTON:  Some more negotiating tactics there from the President.  Now,  those comments came as Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is due  to meet with US Trade Representatives in about 45 minutes from now.  Prime  Minister Trudeau says that Canada is ready to walk away if he has to,  adding no deal is still better than a bad deal.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA:  As I've said, Canada is always  willing to sit down and work in a constructive and responsible way around  the table.  We've, done that from the very beginning and we will continue  to be creative and constructive around the table.  We're working now.  We  sent our whole team down to Washington to engage in this week's  negotiations.  We recognize that there is a possibility of getting there by  Friday, but it is only a possibility, because it will hinge on whether or  not there is ultimately a good deal for Canada, a good deal for Canadians.  </p><p>I've said from the very beginning, no NAFTA deal is better that a bad NAFTA  deal and we're going to remain firm on that principle, because Canadians  expect us to stand up for them, and that's what this government is going to  do.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>NEWTON:  Both the US and Canada are continuing to play politics.  The auto  sector, though, meantime, it's of material importance to them and they're  watching quite anxiously.  </p><p>Joining me now on the phone is Ann Wilson.  She is senior vice president of  the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association.  Now, I want to stress  that you deal -- you're not -- you deal with all the companies, the Ford,  the GMs, the Chryslers of the world, but you are auto parts manufacturers,  you have a huge stake in these negotiations though.  From what you've seen  so far of the US-Mexico deal, that Canada says that in principle they agree  to, but they also have to see the details, does that put all three  countries in a better position in terms of  having a more competitive car  industry?  </p><p>ANN WILSON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, MOTOR AND EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS  ASSOCIATION:  Well, first, Paula, thank you very much for having me on the  show.  We are heartened by what we see between US and Mexico on many  fronts.  We do think that there's a real possibility here with the regional  value content and the increase that our administration, the Trump  administration sought to improve the trade agreement for all the parties.  </p><p>But I would like to go back to what you started off the show on.  It is  really important that Canada be at the table and that this be a three-party  agreement.  We represent motor vehicle suppliers.  We are actually the  largest employer of manufacturing jobs in the United States.  </p><p>[16:10:11]  </p><p>WILSON:  And our jobs have actually grown under NAFTA.  So NAFTA has been  good for our companies, but it's also been good for the American workers  who are employed by our companies, but we need Canada to be there.  </p><p>NEWTON:  At times, President Trump does not seem to have listened to that  message.  He thinks that, look, if he doesn't get the trade deal that he  wants, the trilateral deal doesn't have to happen.  Do you find that  sometimes that your message falls on deaf ears when it comes to the  administration?  </p><p>WILSON:  Well, with I think the President is challenging all of us in the  business community to come back to them to explain exactly why something  that we have come to expect from NAFTA needs to continue, and I think that  the auto industry has done a good job of trying to show how NAFTA allows  the United States to be competitive in a global environment.  </p><p>So it allows the three countries to be competitive compared to Europe,  compared to Japan and Asia, and that's why this three-country agreement is  so important.  </p><p>NEWTON:  If there is no deal, Donald Trump continues to say that he will  impose tariffs on cars coming in from Canada into the United States.  Given  the integrated nature of the auto industry that you work in, is that  possible?  Would that be feasible?  </p><p>WILSON:  Well, it is feasible, but we are very much opposed to that.  We  build cars, we sell cars in a global environment.  Most of our members are  global players, but we also have a lot of manufacturers in this country who  have just the facility in the US, but they are very dependent on all of the  vehicle manufacturers being able to be successful.  </p><p>I'm from the south, and I say a lot of rising tides with small boats, and  what we need to talk about here is the dependency between vehicle  manufacturers and their supply base, and then the dependency on US workers  for those jobs.  </p><p>So, you know, if we cannot be able to get parts into this country on a  financially viable front, it's going to be much more difficult to make cars  in this country, and if it's hard to make cars in this country, we won't  employ as many people.  </p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, and that is a very clear message there.  Ann Wilson, thanks  so much for your time.  Really appreciate it.  </p><p>Now, later in the program, you are going to here from the Chief Executive  of Aston Martin which has just announced it is preparing for an IPO.  He  will tell us why he's actually not worrying about the threat from auto  tariffs.  </p><p>Tesla shares closed down another 2% amid new trouble from CEO, Elon Musk.   Now, he may face legal action for his verbal attack on a cave diver, after  all.  Here's a reminder of how we got here.  Thank goodness.  Last month,  Musk offered a miniature submarine to help rescue 12 boys and their  football coach who were trapped in a cave in Thailand.  </p><p>One of the rescue divers called, Vernon Unsworth called it a PR stunt and  said Musk can, quote, \"stick the submarine where it hurts.\"  In a Twitter  outburst, Musk called Unsworth a pedophile.  </p><p>The Tesla boss later apologized, but on Tuesday, Musk tweeted that he  thought, it was, quote, \"strange\" that that Unsworth hasn't sued him.  Now,  it appears that is going to change.  Clare Sebastian has been following  this.  </p><p>Thank goodness, Clare, because I've completely lost track.  You're going to  give us the details of what' going on right now, but at the end of the day,  it's still clear that Elon Musk has a trouble actually staying focused.  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Right, and staying quiet on Twitter,  Paula.  In the wake of that whole 17-day debacle over whether or not he was  going to take the company private, a lot of investors had really been  hoping to see a more restrained Elon Musk and there were a couple of days  when it looked like that might be the case on Twitter, but clearly that  moment is over.  This is the tweet that he put out in the last 24 to 36  hours about Vern Unsworth.  It was a reply to another Twitter user.  He  said, \"You don't think it's strange that he hasn't sued me?  He was offered  free legal services.\"  Well, as you said, he hasn't sued him yet, but we do  have this letter that was sent by lawyers that have been retained by Vern  Unsworth to Elon Musk.  It's dated August 6th.  </p><p>They say that they are preparing a civil complaint against Elon Musk for  false and defamatory statements.  They said that he had no basis for  calling Vern Unsworth a pedophile and he did it in anger, which is  something that Musk himself later admitted.  So all of this, Paula, yet  another example of how Musk's tweets are damaging the company, and I think  this is going to prompt more calls, not only for him to stay off Twitter,  but also for the board to step in and keep up that search for someone to  fill his number two position and take the pressure off of him.  </p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, as you were saying, you know, we talked earlier, the stock  down 2% there.  The new price targets are flying from analysts and they say  it doesn't look good.  And if we can allow ourselves to focus, unlike Elon  Musk.  </p><p>[16:15:08]  </p><p>NEWTON:  In terms of the production targets that you and I have talked  about so much, Clare, people are still saying, look, it is going to be a  rough third quarter for Tesla anyway you have it.  And there you see a  chart of what's gone on from his antics just in about the last four weeks.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Right, the stock is down almost 20% from that peak, which you  see of the back of that going private tweet on August 7th.  The interesting  thing is, Paula, the stock had risen just before that.  They'd produced a  good earnings report.  It beat expectations, cash burn was starting to slow  and they were starting to meeting those Model 3 production targets, but  despite the noise and the distractions of the last month, the financial  problems and the challenges that Tesla faces haven't gone away.  </p><p>They are still burning through cash.  They are under pressure to meet those  Model 3 production targets.  A lot of analysts are saying that if they  don't, they will still have to raise money.  They have $1 billion plus in  bonds that are coming due by March next year.  There are real questions  over how they'll make those payments and musk has continually said that he  doesn't want to raise cash externally.  </p><p>I think a lot of people continue to question that and it doesn't help that  they're losing confidence.  You can see it in the market today.  They're  losing confidence in his ability to focus on the task at hand.  </p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, and he is going to be caught in that whole issue of numbers  don't lie and they will expect to see some better numbers.  Our Clare  Sebastian continues to follow that soap opera that is the Tesla story.   Appreciate it.  </p><p>Now, a sea battle between the British and the French -- I'm not kidding.   This is the 21st Century now, I think we're in -- that's not a scenario for  the historical drama.  It happened on Tuesday.  You'll want to see this  video.  We'll have details, coming up.  </p><p>And former US President Jimmy Carter joins me to talk about his hands-on  effort to build affordable housing.  Plus, more from him on Syria and the  current President.  </p><p>Now, think about this.  Nearly everywhere in the United States, a minimum  wage worker can't afford the rent on a one-bedroom apartment.  Now, the  government estimates about half a million people have no home at all.   Habitat for humanity works to combat that crisis by building homes right  across the United States and in 70 countries worldwide.  </p><p>Now, the struggle to pay for housing is a global one, affecting families  from Rio to Beijing.  Two of Habitat's most well-known volunteers are  former US President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn.  They have  personally joined teams in 14 countries to help people achieve their dream  of owning an affordable home.  </p><p>[16:20:11]  </p><p>NEWTON:  Now, I spoke to the former President a little while ago and I  asked him what progress has been made towards affordable housing in the  last three decades.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>JIMMY CARTER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, although  Habitat has grown in the last 13 years that I know about, 30 times larger  than it was 13 years ago, because of good leadership and the enthusiasm  that people feel about it.  In spite of the fact that we are building now a  house or finishing up a house for a family to move into, every 50 seconds,  24 hours a day, in 70 countries around the world in 1,300 places in the  United States, the need for low-income housing increases every year.  </p><p>Because construction has increased in cost, because it's more expensive to  finish a house, and because land has gone up.  And as you know, rent has  just skyrocketed in some places.  So, nowadays, what we try to do is to  make housing available through Habitat, which it always, invariably, is  lower cost per month, without interest.  We don't charge any interest  because the Bible says you don't charge a poor person interest.  If they  just pay 30 years on the principle itself, they can own a house themselves  cheaper than they used to pay rent for an inadequate place for a human  being to live.  </p><p>So we see Habitat as increasing rapidly in its service, but the need for  low-income housing increasing and so local, state, and Federal governments  ought to know this and the private sector, as well.  </p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, and you're right there, in the sense that the need is  intensifying.  We continue to see stories about homelessness, not just in  large cities in the United States or expensive cities in the United States,  but right around the world.  Getting back to the issue, in terms of what  you can do about that, I mean, what do you think that governments and  regular folk are missing about how we can actually end homelessness, even  in our richest cities?  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I think most of the low-income housing is provided not by  the government, but by private enterprise in America and the banks need to  be more liberal, more progressive, more forthcoming in making housing loans  available.  The low interest payments that are imposed now make it very  attractive.  </p><p>But I think bank policies are very important, and I think that just the  public sector, you know, people who serve in public office, mayors and city  councilmen and members of the Congress and members of state legislatures,  need to have public housing or low-income housing at the top of our agenda,  as a top priority.  </p><p>NEWTON:  If you'll allow me, Mr. President, I just wanted to delve into  current politics.  I know you say you're out of the business of politics,  but you have said that, you know, you don't think it's right that the  Democrats pursue President Trump in terms of impeaching him.  Why not?  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I'm not -- I never have mentioned the word \"impeachment,\" I  don't think o want to get involved in that.  I think it's a mistake,  politically, for Democrats to be talking about impeachment of a President.   We need to wait until the special investigator or special prosecutor makes  his report.  </p><p>I think that Mr. Mueller is completely qualified to do that and if the  President turns out to be guilty of a crime, I'm not assuming that he will,  then the Congress will take action.  But I don't think that it's good for  Democrats to be talking about impeachment at this time.  </p><p>NEWTON:  I mean, how worried are you in general, though, about the  fractious nature of politics right now in the United States?  You know, we  have these memorials to John McCain, someone who did reach across the  aisle, we just don't see much of that anymore.  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, you know, obviously, all Presidents make mistake and I think  that President Trump has been guilty of making a lot of mistakes.  One of  the mistakes that he made last week that was very troubling to me was not  honoring John in an adequate way and the Senator has been a great hero for  our country in the Navy and John McCain and I both graduated from the same  institution, and that is the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, and I looked  upon him as a great hero for our country, both in the military, and also as  a great public servant through the US Senate.  </p><p>So I think that President Trump made a mistake at first, by, you know,  going back and forth on whether to raise a flag or not -- or lower the  flag.  I think he's made a correction on that.  So, we all make mistakes,  but I think that he's trying to correct his mistakes, as best he can.  He  made a mistake at first, I think he's partially corrected it.  </p><p>[16:25:16]  </p><p>NEWTON:  You had an editorial in \"The New York Times\" regarding Syria and  you wrote that many Syrians have concluded that almost any peace, even an  imperfect or ugly peace, is better than ongoing violence.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  </p><p>NEWTON:  I mean, some would say, that at worse, that's complicity in Syrian  war crimes and at best, it's really vindication of the brutal war that has  been conducted by Syria and its backers, Iran, and Russia.  I mean, why are  you calling for this now?  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I think, the best thing to do is to end the violence now and  then work out the problem with the incumbent President Assad.  I know him  quite well, as a  matter of fact.  I used to -- I haven't talked to him in  many, many years now, but he has committed, I think some very serious  crimes against his own people.  </p><p>But the first thing we need to do is, as I said in the editorial, is to  stop the war and then work out with the United Nations and other forces the  -- how to treat the incumbent leader of Syria and it's inevitable, I think  that he and with his allies, particularly the Russians and to some lesser  degree, the Iranians are expanding his hold on the country.  </p><p>So he needs to be given a chance for peace, first of all, and if he accepts  it, then we can accommodate his crimes later on.  </p><p>NEWTON:  But at any cost?  You know, they have called him a butcher.  Many  people in Syria would really have problems with the fact that he would  remain in power and basically win at this war.  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, I think the basic assumption is he's going to be in power  anyway, and his power is increasing.  But in the meantime, a lot of people  in Syria are getting killed and can't move back to their homes.  So the  first thing to do is to end the war and that would end barrel bombs and  that would also end the use of chemical weapons on innocent people if the  war ends. And then when that is done and a lot of people are in favor of  that, then we can deal with the crimes that have been committed already.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>NEWTON:  The former President there, now 93 years old.  So we move on to a  skirmish over scallops.  Tempers fly as British and French fishermen clash  on the sea.  You do not want to miss this story.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:30:00] PAULA NEWTON, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello, I'm Paula  Newton, coming up in the next half hour of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Aston  Martin's chief executive tells us how the company is preparing for Brexit  as it gets ready for its own IPO.</p><p>And never mind, the scour of some British and French boats are doing battle  in the English channel.  First, these are the top news stories we're  following this hour.  Late Senator John McCain is now lying in state in  Phoenix, Arizona on what would have been his 82nd birthday. </p><p>You are looking at live pictures there as National Guard members carried  his caskets to the Arizona Capitol building where visitors continued to pay  their respects.  Now, earlier, the war hero's wife Cindy McCain delicately  patted flagged-draped casket.</p><p>There will soon be another high profile departure from Donald Trump's inner  circle.  The U.S. President announced on Twitter that Don McGahn will leave  his job as White House counsel just in the next few months.  Mr. Trump said  it will happen following the expected confirmation of Supreme Court Justice  nominee Brett Kavanaugh. </p><p>A dam bursting has forced more than 50,000 people in central Myanmar to  evacuate their homes, but officials say several villages are now flooded  and at least one of them was hit with a wall of water more than 2 meters  high -- incredible pictures there.  There's no word yet on any casualties.</p><p>The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico said Wednesday that bureaucracy and  government inefficiency are to blame for the death of almost 3,000 people  in the wake of Hurricane Maria.  That revised death toll came to light as  part of a new study commissioned by the Puerto Rican government. </p><p>Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz blamed President Donald Trump's administration for  not providing more assistance.  Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter says the  west may have to work with Bashar al-Assad in order to end Syria's civil  war.  Now, Mr. Carter has called on western nations to re-engage with the  Syrian government as a step for securing peace. </p><p>Speaking to me on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, he said there were major risks in  simply waiting for the Assad regime to fall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES CARTER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Yes, basically, Assad  here is going to be in power anyway and his power increasing.  But in the  meantime, a lot of people in Syria are getting killed, they can't move back  to their homes.</p><p>For the first thing they do is to the end the war and that would -- that  would end barrel bombs and that would also end their use of chemical  weapons on innocent people.  If the war ends and when that is done and a  lot of people are in favor of that, then we can deal with the crimes that  have been committed already.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NEWTON:  James Bond's favorite car maker is gearing up for a $6 billion  IPO.  Now, Aston Martin's long road to its market debut has been far from  soon.  It was founded by Robert Bamford and Lionel Martin in 1914 and  passed through numerous owners including Ford Motors.</p><p>Most recently though, it was bought by an international consortium in 2007.   Now, the company has flown the flag for the British car industry for more  than a century now.  It is of course famous for being James Bond's car of  choice. </p><p>Here you see Daniel Craig Bond putting the car to its chases in \"Quantum of  Solace\".  Now, it's perhaps fitting that the company has gone bankrupt 007  times in history, that is the quirk, there we go, not a coincidence, but  now that it's back on firmer footing, it seems to be taking inspiration  from Italian rival Ferrari.</p><p>Shares in that company are up 160 percent since its New York IPO back in  2016.  Anna Stewart is live in London, she's been speaking with Aston  Martin's CEO and he's quite optimistic about not just the company's legacy,  but going forward, he says that this could be a popular IPO. </p><p>I'm curious though, Anna, you know, we've got Brexit, we've got auto  tariffs, he's not even a little bit worried. </p><p>[16:35:00] ANNA STEWART, CNN:  Not really, he was very bullish.  He's  really determined.  This will follow on the footsteps of Ferrari which of  course, as he said IPO in a couple of years ago, three years ago and has  since over-doubled its valuation.  But the market is kind of different now  and the headwinds are huge, so much Brexit uncertainty.</p><p>And the risks still lingers that President Trump could impose tariffs on  European car makers.  So I asked him, why IPO now? What's in it for you?  What about all these headwinds?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDY PALMER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ASTON MARTIN:  From a management  point of view, the management view is based upon our history.  Our history  is we have 105-year-old brand.  We've made beautiful cars in the past, but  we've always not been successful on the balance sheet basis.</p><p>And you've had a tendency over the years to have millionaires and  billionaires buying into the company, build their car and walk away.  And  in consequence, the company suffered in rebuilding the company which I hope  me and my team have been able to do since 2015 in bringing it back to  profitability.</p><p>In creating the cadence of product, seven cars over seven years, one car  every year, each car having a seven-year life, copy, repeat, copy, repeat,  copy, repeat.  In doing that, we've been able to create this tempo in the  company and it is this tempo that's making the company profitable.</p><p>Now, what I hope in leaving a legacy is though I leave behind stability and  importantly government.  And what listing does, it forces you to have  independent chairman, independent non-executive directors, a governance  around the company which will allow that tempo to continue.</p><p>And the reason that we call the plan the second century plan is about  taking all of the earnings from the first century, improving them into the  second century and making sure that we have the last British, really  British car company which is capable of surviving for the next 100 years.</p><p>STEWART:  You turned the company around, but it has been bankrupt several  times before.  Will investors really want to buy into this company?</p><p>PALMER:  By the way, you know, a turnaround isn't one gentleman, it's a  team.  And the team that we've created is very much a meritocracy, the way  we work together.  And I think that's what investors are buying.  They're  buying this team, this team that's demonstrated this company.</p><p>You can liken to Ferrari and of course, Ferrari has been very successful.   So if you want a benchmark, it's there, you see the multiple that they've  managed to generate against their aevitas(ph).  Obviously, our aevitas(ph)  is a little bit behind them, but with the same time of company. </p><p>I mean, in fact, over time, as we add new models and we replace models, the  pricing is accretive, that means the margin is accretive and we tend  towards the Ferrari margins over time, and of course, we go from today's  roughly speaking 7,000 cars a year to a volume in 2022 of 14,000 cars a  year.</p><p>So you've got this wonderful luxury growth model which of course is very  attractive to investors.</p><p>STEWART:  Now this IPO will take place among some pretty strong headwinds.   Brexit uncertainty on the one hand and still risk lingering at the  potential tariffs from the U.S. with President Donald Trump waging tariffs  potentially on European cars.  Is this the right time to IPO?</p><p>PALMER:  Well, I'd say it's therefore the risks that you outline, which are  risks to the general economy.  I'd say that Aston is the counter that in  many cases, it's sheltered from those risks.  So if you're looking for a  kind of safe haven for your investment, then you choose luxury companies  like Aston Martin.</p><p>Luxury companies tend to survive through this turbulence and turbulence  better than anybody else mainly because our buyers are less affected by  those macro-economics.  Now, if you take Brexit for example, we export 25  percent of our cars to the EU, and we sell 30 percent of our cars in the  U.K.</p><p>Let's assume that there's a hard Brexit, let's assume that the EU puts a 10  percent tariff, yet, that would have been cars that go to Europe a little  bit more expensive, and you might argue we might lose a little bit of  market share.</p><p>On the other hand, coming in the other direction, Ferraris and Lamborghinis  are also now 10 percent more expensive, and that means that we're more  competitive in our own market where we sell a slightly higher percentage of  our cars, therefore in that instance, it's a little bit positive. </p><p>On top of that, of course, one assumes that if you have a hard Brexit, that  the pound is going to go softer, it will weaken.  And when the pound  weakens, that's good for us as an exporter, so improves our profitability.   So you see in the case of Brexit, it's not something that keeps me awake at  night, it's not something that I put you know, hard Brexit with tariffs.</p><p>It's not something though I would advocate, but it's certainly not  something that worries me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[16:40:00] STEWART:  Andy Palmer; the CEO there, Paula.  He did put a very  positive spin on Brexit, but I would say later in the discussion he did say  he was prepared for a hard Brexit, for a no-deal Brexit.  Although, all  that's hard amid here in the U.K., most of the components are imported in.</p><p>In fact, most of them from Europe and Germany in particular.  And as a  result, they offer a just-in time production, much like all the car makers  around Europe and many in Asia of course.  Which means components arrive  just in time for them to be fitted into the car.</p><p>They now have a process whereby they keep components for five days in a  warehouse because they are ready for potential custom delay, and he said  they could even increase that.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, and that is going to be a problem, you know, just in time,  obviously, pioneered really in the auto industry in North America is so  important, interesting even to a luxury car maker.  I know you're saying he  put a positive spin on Brexit, did he also put a positive spin on Asia's  growth because obviously, if you have to look at the evaluation of this  company going forward, Asia's got to be part of the equation.</p><p>STEWART:  Asia is actually where they're really planning to double-down in  terms of sales coming up.  They have a vast increase in sales planned for  the next few years, particularly when they're new facility in Wales comes  online.  And Asia is certainly the biggest target for them.</p><p>In the United States, they're still planning to continue their growth  there, and they said that, yes, with any tariffs that may come their way,  they'll simply pass on that cost to the consumer.  Paula?</p><p>NEWTON:  And I didn't ask you, I should have before, did you get a spin in  the car?</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>STEWART:  Paula, they were just on (INAUDIBLE) reason to get spin on  anything.  But I can tell you, at least I've already broken the bad news to  all our viewers out there, the ticker symbol will not be 007, I'm sorry to  say -- </p><p>NEWTON:  Oh, shame -- </p><p>STEWART:  The CEO himself told me, it wouldn't be, it's more likely to be  AML, which I think is a huge disappointment.</p><p>NEWTON:  Maybe they could have come up with some other James Bond acronym,  but I'll leave it there, maybe I'll get creative, Anna, thanks so much for  bringing us this story, appreciate it.  Now, European markets ended the day  on a mixed note.</p><p>In London, the FTSE was dragged down by energy stocks and miners, it was a  slightly better story on the continent indices.  And Paris and Frankfurt  ended about a third of a percent higher, it will be interesting where they  go tomorrow, given those highs in the U.S. markets.</p><p>Now, next on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a turf war on the high seas, these  fishermen are brawling over scallops, I can't get enough of these pictures,  it's incredible.  Bumper cars pulling the shrimps.      </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[16:45:00] NEWTON:  This is not a historical feature, this is bumper cars  in the English channel, boats running into one another, flares being shot,  bottles being thrown, rocks, it's a story that really takes you back in  time.  British and French fishermen have clashed in a spectacular fashion  over scallops.</p><p>Now this is where the skirmish took place, the English channel, French  fishermen were restricted by their government on when they can try and  catch those scallops.  Now regulations they say the English ignore. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's seven days a week for them, they fill up, they  come, they dretch, they fill up the hole and then they go home.  There you  go.  They just leave us the scraps.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NEWTON:  Leave us the scraps.  Now, the CEO of the U.K. Federation of  Fishermen's Organization told Cnn this is not the way to solve this  dispute.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARRIE DEAS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S  ORGANIZATIONS, UNITED KINGDOM:  There had been disputes over fishing rights  in the past and I'm sure there will be in the future.  The place to resolve  them is around the table by talking, not by firing flares, throwing  shackles, engaging in dangerous maneuvers that jeopardize safety at sea. </p><p>So what we've seen here is a step change that is really concerning, and we  very much hope it isn't the pattern for the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, so do we all.  Now, that's the British side of the story.  We  want to hear of course from the French side as well.  Manuel Evrard is the  director of the Normandy Fishermen Organization, he joins me now live from  Normandy, France, via Skype.</p><p>I mean, look, we are all just stunned by that video, that was incredibly  dangerous.  What kind -- what was the boiling point here? What was the  tipping point to make the French fishermen take those kinds of extreme  actions.</p><p>MANUEL EVRARD, DIRECTOR OF NORMANDY FISHERMEN ORGANIZATION:  Well, you  know, that is a kind of piece of many of the resource for the French  fisherman particularly in Normandy.  I think the French and the U.S.  market, both of them are the main consumers of scallops in the world.</p><p>Regarding of fishermen, of late, it represents up to 80 percent of the  annual sales, so it's significant for fishing industry.  The French  fisherman adopted in the past years specific fishing model, taking good  measure to make it sustainable.</p><p>We are opening an enclosure of baits, we also have bigger net size or  fishing gear.  We also have daily quarter of fishing vessel, and we may  have sometimes from time to time to close the fishing for one or two days  just -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>NEWTON:  OK, I understand -- I understand that -- I understand what you're  saying.  You're saying that the French are doing this sustainably, but  look, I'm really good by the pictures that I'm seeing there.  Do you think  there's a risk that this would happen again and who should negotiate this?</p><p>Because clearly, there's got to be a resolution.  This can't go on, I mean,  look at this.</p><p>EVRARD:  Yes, it may happen again.  The last few years we reached an  agreement with the U.K. vessels and over 16 meters length, but this year,  we have not reached this agreement again, so on the British side, it's just  an open fishery this year.</p><p>So yes, it may happen again.  But still we have to keep in touch with them  and we still have a -- we still think that we must have a dialogue and to  solve that problem. </p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, and I hear you're enforcing, you're saying this may happen  again.  When you look to a dialogue, and I know this is visceral, I know  the fishermen are fighting for their livelihoods, but is the onus on the  fishermen or is the onus on the British and French governments?</p><p>EVRARD:  You mean, what do you mean? </p><p>NEWTON:  Who needs to negotiate this? Are you looking to the government to  negotiate that -- </p><p>EVRARD:  OK -- </p><p>NEWTON:  For you or the fishermen?</p><p>EVRARD:  I believe that, that should be solved between fishermen  themselves.  You know, the thing is -- the trouble is that, the  counsel(ph), you know, is that they have to spend time to hang on it at  sea.  So it's -- sometimes if you go to them to gather, to be around the  table. </p><p>But I'm pretty sure that sometimes all the fishermen themselves are on the  table, we can -- we can reach an agreement.</p><p>[16:50:00] NEWTON:  Well, I'm certainly hopeful that that arguing goes on  in a conference table and not on the high seas as we've been watching.   We'll continue to follow this story, appreciate it.  Now, when we come  back, Facebook is under pressure again, this time from inside the company.</p><p>The internal posts, that's the talk of the social network.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>NEWTON:  OK, there's apparently a growing group of Facebook employees.  I'm  happy about what they see as the company's lack of diversity and tolerance  of their different political views.  Oliver Darcy is here to explain.  You  know, the reporting on this was really interesting that from inside  Facebook, they kind of are going with a line that, look, our conservative  views are sometimes not tolerated. </p><p>OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER:  Yes, there's a couple of things  you want to mention first.  So this happened in the \"New York Times\" last  night, and it's a group of Facebook employees who feel that, like you said,  their conservative views are not tolerated by the company. </p><p>It was posted on the internal message system at Facebook.  But it's  important to remember, there are thousands and thousands and thousands of  Facebook employees, I think about 25,000 in total, and this group only had  a few dozen individuals in there, got a lot more popular groups on  Facebook's internal message board where there are thousands of members.</p><p>This one like I said has a few dozen.  They're upset that they said their  conservative views aren't taken seriously, but a lot of their colleagues  too have been pushing back, saying they are taken seriously, and so you're  seeing a little debate grow inside Facebook itself.</p><p>NEWTON:  But this does play into the narrative certainly from Donald Trump  saying that, look, he's not getting a fair shape from the big tech company.   I want to talk about that, though, for a minute, Oliver, because you and I  are trained to not be so naive about our own bias.</p><p>DARCY:  Right -- </p><p>NEWTON:  We know that we have bias and we try and have people that back our  stories, edit our stories, guard against that bias.</p><p>DARCY:  Yes -- </p><p>NEWTON:  I think when Jack Dorsey from Twitter said last week that, oh, you  know, yes, our staff is mostly liberal, but it's not a problem.  I kind of  don't believe it.  And if I believe it, I'm willing to bet that even the  employees inside these companies don't believe it.  What can they do? Do  they not have to do more to guard against that bias? </p><p>I mean, Jack Dorsey was very open in saying, yes, our employees are mostly  liberal.</p><p>DARCY:  Right, but he also said right after, that Twitter works extremely  hard to make sure that their personal biases of their employees don't get  into how they enforce their policies.  Now, I think actually if you just  study Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey, I think they're actually really  committed to this. </p><p>[16:55:00] You see, Jack Dorsey for instance, he didn't cave to pressure to  ban Alex Jones in for worst founder who pushes conspiracy theories on those  platforms.  So I think if they really were these left-wingers that are  portrayed in the press or -- sorry, in the conservative press, you would  see them taking issue with Alex Jones and banning him from Twitter.</p><p>And Twitter hasn't done that, they've actually let him stay on the  platform.  So while their personal biases on employees might certainly lean  left, they are saying, they work really hard to make sure that doesn't sip  into how they enforce policy.</p><p>NEWTON:  And here's the thing.  Here at the \"New York Times\", at the  newspapers, you know, you have an arm, but sometimes you have a certain --  let's say a certain outlet to kind of test that -- </p><p>DARCY:  Yes -- </p><p>NEWTON:  I don't see that yet at these technology companies.  We're going  to have these hearings coming up next week, do you think we will learn more  about this and many other things that go on at those tech companies.</p><p>DARCY:  I imagine we'll get very loyally responses to a lot of the  questions.  The fact is that big corporations, whether it's media outlets,  whether it's big tech companies, they don't like being transparent.  They  generally refuse transparency.  They don't like people coming in and  examining every single detail they do. </p><p>And I think that while we're like calling for transparency, these  corporations -- I don't think you could find any corporation that would say  yes, invite the media in, but examine everything we do, let's make sure  it's all public for everyone to see.</p><p>No company really likes that, and Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are no  different.  The issue is that they have a lot of influence on the public  debate, and so you're hearing people say, you know, you guys need to be a  little more transparent in the way you enforce policies, the way you make  policy and so on and so forth.</p><p>NEWTON:  And we should be a little more vocal, I mean, we've been trying to  get Google on here for literally years, these are not secret societies, the  CEOs need to come and talk, at least Jack Dorsey came on Cnn -- </p><p>DARCY:  Well, both do, doesn't want to go to Congress, so -- </p><p>NEWTON:  Exactly, they're going to have empty chairs -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>They're going to have empty chairs at these hearings.  Yes, so, you know,  the more they speak, the more we'll start to learn about how these things  are functioning and the more we'll have confidence, right? That they don't  have a bias.</p><p>DARCY:  And I think one last thing to keep in mind is they're worried that  any word they say is going to be misconstrued and exploited by certain  outlets, particularly partisan outlets on the right to say, see, we caught  you, you do have that kind sort of bias.</p><p>I think that that's something they really are cautious of, so when they  make statements, when they go before Congress, you get a lot of loyally  responses because they're really afraid that their comments might be taken  out of context.</p><p>NEWTON:  And that tees up the hearings very well.  Oliver, thanks so much - - </p><p>DARCY:  Thank you -- </p><p>NEWTON:  I appreciate it.

Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Ranking Member Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) set the tone for the hearing, with both congressmen's introductory comments showing just how troubling the Libra is to some of America's top legislators. </p><p>Libra Under the Microscope 'Concerns include, but are in no way limited, to how the payment system will work, how it will be managed, and how Libra, the Libra Association, Calibra, and Facebook will all interact,' Chairman Crapo noted at the beginning of the hearing.For his part, Sen. Brown followed up with a considerably more scathing opening, giving the social media powerhouse no quarter. The Ranking Member said the nefarious track record of Facebook in recent years showed the company was poorly positioned to disrupt payments:'Facebook is dangerous. Now Facebook might not intend to be dangerous, but surely they don't respect the power of the technologies they are playing with, like a todder who has gotten his hands on a book of matches. Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience.'What we learned from today's senate hearing and grilling of Mr. Marcus: + A bunch of Senators hate FB + A couple of them think the tech could be cool + Senators attuned to in weeds issues (Warner a good example) + Marcus is a skilled operator + There will be more hearings\u2014 Palley (@stephendpalley) July 16, 2019[2]As the hearing progressed, David Marcus held his ground well enough, parrying the senators biting questions where he could and answering as diplomatically as possible where he couldn't.'Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulators' concerns and received appropriate approvals,' the head of Calibra said.Indeed, Marcus implored the committee that Facebook would follow all necessary rules and wouldn't dominate the token, adding at one point that the U.S. government should want such a project to occur within in its purview rather than beyond its direct reach. Little Settled for Now While some senators were open-minded to the possibilities of Libra, Marcus wasn't able to decisively tilt the hearing in Facebook's favor. With that said, the book certainly isn't closed on American legislators drawing up ways to push back against the Libra.In post-hearing comments to the press, Sen. Brown reaffirmed the social media giant was on nothing short of thin ice when it came to perceptions of its trustworthiness:'Facebook has shown time after time after time it's betrayed the public trust and I can't imagine there's anything that would make us trust them.'Sure enough, the hearings show that #Libra[3]'s biggest problem is Facebook's trust deficit. No amount of ring-fencing, decentralizing consortium agreements or legal protections can remove the reality that the project is born of a company with an extremely fraught public reputation\u2014 Michael Casey (@mikejcasey) July 16, 2019[4]Zooming out, Marcus will face the music again in short order, as he's appearing for a similar oversight hearing in the House of Representatives on July 17th.Notably, a draft bill[5] was just put forth in the House that would block companies that make more than $25 billion USD in annual revenues \u2014 e.g. Facebook \u2014 from establishing a digital asset like the Libra.The Tuesday Senate Banking Committee hearing was predominantly focused on Libra, so little was said therein on bitcoin or other specific cryptocurrencies.But in a CNBC interview the morning of the hearing, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) suggested the Libra was playing decentralization theater and that it couldn't hold a candle to bitcoin[6] in that regard:'I like bitcoin [] the real thing I like when it comes to bitcoin is blockchain because I like the security. I want government to actually start using bitcoin and blockchain.'The comments come after President Trump blasted the viability of cryptocurrencies[7] last week. <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton\">https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro\">https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro</url> eToro Risk Warning: 66% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

Times News: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com\">http://www.ibtimes.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  Four Republican senators introduced a bill Wednesday aimed at limiting legal protections of Big Tech platforms if they \"selectively\" suppress certain content, stepping up a political battle with social media.Senator Josh Hawley said his measure, if enacted, \"gives users the right to sue if the big platforms enforce their terms unfairly or unequally.\"The bill comes weeks after President Donald Trump accused social platforms of suppressing conservative political voices and signed an executive order which could eliminate the liability shield of online services for content posted by third parties, despite doubts about its enforceability.The Hawley bill, co-sponsored by fellow Republicans Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton and Mike Braun, would revise the \"Section 230\" legal protection mechanism for online services if they fail to act \"in good faith\" to moderate content.The bill would strip the liability protection to services that \"restrict access to or availability of material against a user by employing an algorithm that selectively enforces\" its policies.The legislation and executive order stem from claims by Trump and his allies that social media platforms are biased, despite his own large following on Twitter and other platforms.\"Big Tech companies like Twitter, Google and Facebook have used their power to silence political speech from conservatives without any recourse for users,\" Hawley said in a statement. </p><p>\"Congress should act to ensure bad actors are not given a free pass to censor and silence their opponents.\" Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, proposes legislation opening the door to easier legal action against internet platforms for \"selectively\" taking down content Photo: GETTY IMAGES / POOL Activists and legal specialists argue that Section 230 is a cornerstone of the open internet by allowing services to host content from third parties without fear of legal action.The law allows for platforms to moderate content and remove materials deemed to be promoting hate or violence, according to Section 230 defenders.But critics across the political spectrum have said the liability shield opens the door to a range of harmful online content.Some analysts argue that the efforts to regulate social media could be unconstitutional limits on free expression under the constitution's First Amendment.\"I see this as a straightforward First Amendment violation,\" Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said of the bill.Additionally, he said the bill would lead to \"an infinite number of lawsuits\" against internet firms because of the vague definition of good faith actions.Separately, the Trump administration called for reforms of Section 230 to \"provide stronger incentives for online platforms to address illicit material on their services while continuing to foster innovation and free speech. \"A Justice Department statement called for legislation creating \"carve outs\" of immunity for platforms enabling \"child abuse, terrorism and cyber-stalking\" and for \"bad Samaritan\" actions by online services that facilitate criminal activity. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Senator Josh Hawley said his measure, if enacted, \"gives users the right to sue if the big platforms enforce their terms unfairly or unequally.\" </p><p>The bill comes weeks after President Donald Trump accused social platforms of suppressing conservative political voices and signed an executive order which could eliminate the liability shield of online services for content posted by third parties, despite doubts about its enforceability. The Hawley bill, co-sponsored by fellow Republicans Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton and Mike Braun, would revise the \"Section 230\" legal protection mechanism for online services if they fail to act \"in good faith\" to moderate content. The bill would strip the liability protection to services that \"restrict access to or availability of material against a user by employing an algorithm that selectively enforces\" its policies. The legislation and executive order stem from claims by Trump and his allies that social media platforms are biased, despite his own large following on Twitter and other platforms. \"Big Tech companies like Twitter, Google and Facebook have used their power to silence political speech from conservatives without any recourse for users,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"Congress should act to ensure bad actors are not given a free pass to censor and silence their opponents.\"Activists and legal specialists argue that Section 230 is a cornerstone of the open internet by allowing services to host content from third parties without fear of legal action. The law allows for platforms to moderate content and remove materials deemed to be promoting hate or violence, according to Section 230 defenders.  But critics across the political spectrum have said the liability shield opens the door to a range of harmful online content. Some analysts argue that the efforts to regulate social media could be unconstitutional limits on free expression under the constitution's First Amendment. \"I see this as a straightforward First Amendment violation,\" Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said of the bill. Additionally, he said the bill would lead to \"an infinite number of lawsuits\" against internet firms because of the vague definition of good faith actions. Separately, the Trump administration called for reforms of Section 230 to \"provide stronger incentives for online platforms to address illicit material on their services while continuing to foster innovation and free speech. \" A Justice Department statement called for legislation creating \"carve outs\" of immunity for platforms enabling \"child abuse, terrorism and cyber-stalking\" and for \"bad Samaritan\" actions by online services that facilitate criminal activity. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132857159242798201125876100127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132857</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6058-PJP1-JCMN-Y2T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"505\"/><timeReceived>9:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times Australia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Burr attempted to minimize the influence of Russian-linked Facebook ads in determining the result of the 2016 election, while Mark Warner, the committee's vice-chair, explicitly criticized the Trump administration's approach to this issue.</p><p>\"We have a president who remains unwilling to acknowledge the threat that Russia poses to our democracy,\" said the Virginia Democrat. \"President Trump should stop actively delegitimizing American journalism and acknowledge and address this real threat posed by Russian propaganda.\"</p><p>Warner also raised concern about the sheer scope of misinformation on social media. He said in his opening statement that, in addition to the 80,000 Russian-backed posts on Facebook that reached 126 million Americans during the 2016 campaign, there were potentially 120,000 similar posts on Instagram and that up to 15% of Twitter accounts are \"fake or automated. An executive for Facebook conceded that starting from October 2016, just before the election, the Russian posts on Instagram reached an additional 16 million Americans.\"</p><p>Warner went on to attack the tech companies testifying, telling them that members of the committee \"were frankly blown off by the leadership of your companies, and dismissed\" when they initially raised concerns. All three tech executives said their internal investigations were continuing and that they had yet to determine the full scope of Russian interference.</p><p>Warner's outrage was shared by other members, including Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California, who explicitly told the tech executives, \"I don't think you get it\" and described Russian interference as \"the beginning of cyberwarfare\".</p><p>In questioning, Burr displayed two ads from Russian-created Facebook pages, one from a group called \"Heart of Texas\" and the second from a group called \"United Muslims of America\" that pushed divisive contact. In particular, he noted that both groups created events at the same time and location in Houston, Texas, in an attempt to spark conflict in 2016.</p><p>The questioning also touched on other issues. Facebook executive Colin Stretch conceded that his network had blocked a profile of Chinese dissident Guo Wengui after the Chinese government had reported it to them. Wengui, who lives in the United States, had used his account to expose corruption within China, where Facebook is banned.</p><p>Later in the day, the House intelligence committee held a hearing on the same topic. The hearing included the release of a number of Facebook ads used by Russia during the 2016 election and the concession from Stretch that Facebook did \"have an obligation to prevent foreign interference in the election\" and that foreign interference represented \"an existential threat to our democracy\".</p><p>The South Carolina Republican Trey Gowdy berated the executives over fake news. \"For the life of me, I do not understand how a republic is served by provably intentionally false information,\" said Gowdy. \"And I get it that you don't want to be the arbiter of opinion. I don't want you to be, either. But today is not Thursday. So if I say it is, I swear I don't understand how my fellow citizens benefit from me telling them something that is demonstrably false and saying it with the intent to deceive. For the life of me, I don't get it.\" </p><p>However, his colleague Chris Stewart, of Utah, claimed \"fake news is in the eye of the beholder\" and defended a story run on the conspiracy-theory-peddling website Infowars.</p><p>The Senate intelligence committee's hearing came a day after the Senate judiciary committee held a similar session on Russian use of social media to influence and interfere in the 2016 election. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-38579451</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PVM-XR81-F021-60KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"720\"/><timeReceived>4:33 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Sen. Warren says that on their way to the top, the big tech companies purchased a long list of potential competitors, like Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. She added that she would nominate regulators who would unwind acquisitions such as Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's deals for Whole Foods and Zappos, and Google's purchases of Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick.'They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,' Warren wrote.Investors, however, shrugged off her comments with shares in the three companies barely affected. Experts say that even if she gets elected, such a proposal would face multiple obstacles in Congress and the courts. It must be noted that tech companies are also some of the biggest political donors, with Google spending $21 million to lobby in 2018, while Amazon and Facebook spending $14.2 million and $12.62 million respectively.

The survival of our democracy depends on it. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) August 6, 2018[1]Think about it \u2014 think about what that means: A U.S. senator in the business of upholding the Constitution has called on social media companies to cut out all the conservative chatter. Truly, could the Democratic Party be any more treasonous? From Breitbart[2]: U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) is calling on social media monopolies to 'do more than take down one website,' meaning take down more websites on top of InfoWars, which was de-platformed by YouTube, Facebook, and others on Monday. 'Infowars [sic] is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart,' Murphy tweeted Monday afternoon. 'These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival of our democracy depends on it.' Obviously, what Murphy sees here is an opportunity to go around the First Amendment, to kill free and open speech he disagrees with, and to accomplish that using social media giants as his hit squad. Democrats and the establishment media are desperate to return America back to the pre-Internet days when a very few corporations controlled the free flow of information, those corporations being the four television networks and a handful of newspapers and wire services. Conservatives now find themselves, once again, in the precarious position of being at the mercy of just a handful of companies: Twitter, Facebook, Apple, YouTube, Pinterest, etc And what Murphy and his left-wing confederates want is to crush speech, to control the flow of information, to strangle certain ideas in the crib, and to use these monopolies as a way to go back to the 'good old days' when the left-wing establishment fully controlled the dissemination of news. If America had a media that was worth a damn, Murphy would be asked for a list of these 'websites' he would like to see de-platfomed and disappeared. Unfortunately, the same media outlets that claim the First Amendment is being violated whenever they are criticized, have joined in this unholy and un-American crusade to silence their critics on the political right. What's more, Murphy's call for these big companies to remove websites is not a small deal. As a sitting United States Senator, he has the power to threaten and regulate these corporations to do his bidding. In more ways than one way Alex Jones and InfoWars are the canary in the coalmine of free speech. While I personally find InfoWars ridiculous and dishonest (although there are some good people working there), as a free speech extremist, I want to protect the rights of those who lie and spread nonsense in the same way I want to protect the rights of pornographers and even an outlet like CNN that spreads hate and foments violence. If InfoWars and pornographers and CNN are safe from censorship, than so are you and I. Moreover, there is no speech out there (unless it's an open call for violence) that results in something worse than what we see when speech is regulated or silenced. In other words, I prefer a world where people are allowed to lie to a world where someone decides what is and is not a lie. nfoWars being silenced tightens the free speech circle, brings the line closer to you and I, especially in a terrifying and chilling climate where the left-wing establishment are deciding what 'lies and hate' are. Killing the InfoWars canary, however, will also embolden the censors at CNN and those like Murphy in the political world. They see that dead canary as a success, and as a blueprint to come after the rest of us. And make no mistake, we are all next. Finally, and this is important, what Murphy is calling for is even more extreme than what happened to InfoWars. Murphy is calling for 'websites' to be taken down \u2014 entire websites. In deleting their accounts, what Facebook and YouTube did to Infowars is bad enough, but Jones still has his own site, his own outlet; and now we have a sitting United States Senator is calling for that to be removed.

Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, introduced legislation to create the Data Protection Agency, an independent body that would be tasked with enforcing data privacy laws while also fostering digital innovation within the U.S. government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a blog post published on<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Medium</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>explaining the bill, Gillibrand said the Data Protection Agency would bring protection of consumers   privacy and freedom into the digital age,  adding that  lawlessness in the data privacy space can give rise to new, unexpected forms of injustice. </p><p> Your data is extremely valuable to many companies with unknown motives, who are looking to exploit your data for profit,  she wrote.  As a result, your very existence is being parsed, split, and sold to the highest bidder, and there is very little you   or anyone, including the federal government   can do about it. I believe that this needs to be fixed, and that you deserve to be in control of your own data. You have the right to know if companies are using your information for profit. You need a way to protect yourself, and you deserve a place that will look out for you.</p><p>The<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>41-page bill</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>outlines the Data Protection Agency s purpose, objectives and enforcement powers. A key component of the law would allow people to file complaints with the DPA when they believe a company has violated data privacy laws that would then potentially trigger investigations that could result in civil penalties, fines or injunctive relief. Right now, those complaints need to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission, but some consumer rights advocates and government officials have expressed frustration with the agency s ability to enforce existing laws.</p><p>One of the first groups to endorse Gillibrand s plan is the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an independent nonprofit that advocates for consumer privacy.\u00a0</p><p> EPIC has been advocating for a data protection agency for a long time,  said EPIC Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald.  We firmly believe that enforcement is really the most important piece of any privacy legislation. Because the FTC has failed time and time again to protect America s privacy, we need to have a new agency to be the cop on the beat and look under the hood. </p><p>The bill is just one of several that have been introduced in the past year aimed at regulating consumer data privacy.\u00a0Earlier this week, U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, introduced a bill to overhaul the FTC and bring it within the U.S Justice Department in order to better take on Big Tech. And in November, U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, introduced the<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, which she co-sponsored with U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, to provide new data privacy rights to U.S. consumers. That same month, U.S. Representatives Anna Eshoo, D-California, and Zoe Lofgren, D-California, introduced the Online Privacy Act to create the Digital Privacy Agency.</p><p>As lawmakers look to regulate how companies deal with Big Data, consumers are also becoming increasingly wary of Big Tech. According to a new survey of 2,000 U.S. adults conducted by Wakefield Research, 95% of respondents thought data privacy laws should do more to protect consumers. The<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>report</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, commissioned by the customer engagement platform Braze, also found that 64% think government entities should be the  most responsible  for driving changes in data privacy policies, while 52% said it should be handled specifically by the federal government. A national law is also something marketing and technology trade groups have lobbied to pass to prevent a wave of states from passing their own.</p><p>Despite marketers saying they care about data privacy, they seem to underestimate its level importance to consumers. Wakefield and Braze found that 82% of consumers said privacy is  very important  while just 29% of marketers surveyed thought data privacy is  very important  to consumers. According to Jon Hyman, Braze s co-founder and chief technology officer, this might be because markers see the value in data-driven marketing and services while consumers wonder if Facebook is listening to their calls or Google is tracking them at the airport.\u00a0</p><p> I kind of look at these things in that marketers are looking at it from a product angle and consumers are looking at a life-encompassing angle of it,  he said.</p><p>Data privacy is also a top that many would like to see play a larger role leading up to the 2020 election. According to the survey s results, 92% of parents said protecting children s data should be a top issue while 73% said they d support the federal government taking the lead. Meanwhile, 72% of marketing execs agreed that privacy should be a key concern to presidential candidate. Consumers are also taking matters into their own hands at least when they can, with 84% choosing to not engage with a company that needed too much personal information and 59% saying they deleted an app from their phone for the same reason.</p><p> I do think that it s really great that there is a lot of focus on the data privacy and that we do start to have regulations around it so we know what companies are able to do around data protection,  Hyman said.\u00a0</p><p>Discussion of data privacy was also top of mind for advertising and marketing executives earlier this week at the IAB Annual Leadership Summit in Palm Desert, California. This year, the influential advertising trade group created several talks and workshops focused what data privacy concerns mean for marketers. (A session about complying with the California Consumer Privacy Act was standing-room-only as attendees gathered to hear about the topic from top lawyers.)</p><p>To deal with the evolution of laws and perceptions, the IAB introduced what it s calling Project Rearc a new industry initiative to  rearchitect  digital advertising in a way that s compliant with current laws without ruining an industry already<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>fraught with volatility</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. In a keynote address on Sunday, IAB CEO Randall Rothenberg called on the industry to collaborate more than it has in the past.</p><p> We need sales leaders talking to engineers,  Rothenberg said.  We need CMOs talking to product developers, we need publishers talking to ad-tech intermediaries, we need lawyers talking to retailers, we need chief procurement officers talking to chief privacy officers. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-5e45ac804a29550006bc40cb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6P-R9T1-JBCM-F4GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1079\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Despite the protests of the Federal Reserve's <person><nameText>Janet Yellen, </nameText></person>as well as repeated warnings from the Bank of England today, the latest opinion poll bears out that voters are not listening to those protests. </p><p>Britain's anti-EU 'Leave' campaign has increased its lead by seven points, rushing ahead of its rivals to 45%, according to a poll by Survation and IG on Thursday. With just a week before the referendum, the Leave camp increased its lead from 38%, with Remain falling two points to 42%, in a phone survey from the company carried out on June 15. It is the first time the Brexit camp has been in front since the polling began from Survation in February. The S...00 bellwether was flat at 2,071, while the S...idcap 400 lost 0.4% to 1,474, and led by weakness in Sm Energy (NYSE:SM), down 9.4% to $26.73, in the wake of weaker oil prices. Cyclical stocks took the biggest beating on the day, with the S...00 energy sector falling by more than 2%, and financials, industrials, materials, and technology all falling by more than 1%. Oil prices came off sharply. The US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was down 3.5% at $46.34. A week ago oil was closing in on $52 a barrel. The picture was gloomier still among small-cap stocks. The S...mallcap 600 lost 0.6% to 699, led by Korn Ferry International (NYSE:KFY), down 19.7% to $22.17 - a day after announcing strong Q4 earnings. The sell-off appears to be profit-taking.

The ACCC inquiry is -attracting global attention -because it is the first of its type in the world.</p><p>Oracle told the ACCC that Google knew where phone users lived and worked, even if they didn't have a Google account, and that it knew where they were at any given time, even if they did have a Google account and weren't signed in.</p><p>It was able to determine -locations by secretly capturing how close an Android phone was to Wi-Fi base stations and at what time.</p><p>The Commission also released a submission from News Corp Australia, publisher of The Daily Telegraph, which urged Google to be split up to boost competition.</p><p>News Corp is not alone in making that call.</p><p>US Democrat and 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren last week said if elected to the Oval Office she would seek to unwind anti-competitive takeovers, including Google's purchases of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick, along with Facebook's buyouts of WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" the former Harvard law professor said.</p><p>\"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\" At the judicial committee hearing, Google's senior privacy counsel admitted it still collected data after a user thought they had opted out.</p><p>But they argued \"location information was absolutely core to making a mobile phone work the way that you want it to work\".</p><p>Mr Hawley told the hearing: \"I think when somebody turns off their user information, their location history, they expect their location tracking to be off, but it is not. In fact, they don't have a way, apparently, to turn it off.\"It comes as Facebook this week announced its future was in private, rather than public, interactions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-2bbde65a452311e9848614797179ec6fc28240225c6b490eb1dda0e1e05e3ecb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAITEL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMM-GRN1-JD3N-52SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"504\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Telegraph Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Google collects detailed information about its users, including their physical locations, to target users for advertising. Often, this is done without the users' consent or knowledge,\" the Attorney General had tweeted. <br/> Referring to an article in AP News regarding how the search giant uses location data for its advertising business whether or not does the user consent to it, Brnovich wrote, \"We began our investigation of Google following a 2018 @AP article that detailed how users are lulled into a false sense of security, believing Google provides users the ability to actually disable their Location History.\"<br/> \"We brought forward this action to put a stop to Google's deceptive collection of user data, obtain monetary relief, and require Google to disgorge gross receipts arising from its Arizona activities,\" he added. <br/> The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages arguing that the company which makes the Android OS for smartphones is deceiving smartphone owners regarding the protection of their personal data on their phones by setting its mobile software as such to do the same. <br/> \"Through these deceptive and unfair acts and practices, Google makes it impractical if not impossible for users to meaningfully opt-out of Google's collection of location information, should the users seek to do so,\" the complaint read. <br/> The lawsuit comes at a time when the big tech company has been facing a lot of scrutiny for its business practices in terms of user data and advertising. According to a Washington Post report, over 40 attorney generals in the US-led by Texas are looking to investigate the company's practices and are likely to file more such lawsuits by fall. <br/> The tech major's practices are also being probed into Europe under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Its primary regulators in Europe earlier this year have launched formal investigations into its processing of personal data in the context of its online Ad Exchange along with its processing of location data, TechCrunch reported. <br/>Google in its statement had said that the Attorney General and the lawyers behind this lawsuit appear to have \"mischaracterized\" its services, Reuters reported. The company provides \"robust controls\" for location data and has built privacy features into its products, it added. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-A-372008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-2341-JBYT-H062-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\"Amazon and Apple may also be in the crosshairs of antitrust enforcers. Critics have complained that Amazon wields too much power in online retail, and that Apple may disadvantage rivals offering services in its app store.Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has made a breakup of the big tech firms a part of her campaign platform.But some legal analysts say the case against the tech firms faces challenges because the companies have in many cases provided services for free and brought prices down, making it hard to prove they harmed \"consumer welfare,\" the legal standard applied under judicial precedent.In the European Union, Google has faced a series of antitrust actions and Amazon is now being targeted by enforcers. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767156778474039125176100112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0C-V891-JCMN-Y36K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"588\"/><timeReceived>3:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Joining the action were attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, according to James.Facebook did not immediately respond to an AFP query on the announcement.The move marks the first official United States antitrust action against one of the so-called Big Tech companies \u2014 although a landmark case had targeted Microsoft back in the 1990s.'Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers,' James said.'We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, or increased the price of advertising.' </p><p>Earlier this year, the US Justice Department said it would launch a 'review' of major online platforms to determine if they have stifled innovation or reduced competition.It was not immediately clear if the states would be working in coordination with federal officials.Facebook, by far the largest social network, in the past has claimed it is not a monopoly and that consumers have many choices for how to connect with people online.The probe \"shows how unease with large tech companies is spreading beyond Congress and the federal government agencies to the states. With each passing day, there are greater fears about these companies controlling our online lives,' said Michael Carrier, a professor antitrust law at Rutgers University.\"Facebook in particular has received attention for its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram \u2014 is that too much power in one company? Should those acquisitions be unwound? The states are likely to focus on issues like these.\" Sign of 'techlash' The case may be the first in a series of antitrust actions against Big Tech firms and highlights growing \"techlash\", based on worries about dominant platforms which control the flow of information.According to The Wall Street Journal, a separate coalition of states was set to launch an antitrust action against Google on Monday.Asked about the report, Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said: 'Google's services help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country. We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\"Amazon and Apple may also be in the crosshairs of antitrust enforcers.Critics have complained that Amazon wields too much power in online retail, and that Apple may disadvantage rivals offering services in its app store.Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has made a breakup of the big tech firms a part of her campaign platform.But some legal analysts say the case against the tech firms faces challenges because the companies have in many cases provided services for free and brought prices down, making it hard to prove they harmed \"consumer welfare\", the legal standard applied under judicial precedent.In the European Union, Google has faced a series of antitrust actions and Amazon is now being targeted by enforcers. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-RPNW1084631567783846503251761300037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RPNW-7005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0C-V891-JCMN-Y461-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"585\"/><timeReceived>3:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Dawn</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Natalie Allen. CNN NEWSROOM starts right now.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ALLEN: Thank you for joining us.</p><p>The U.S. fight against the coronavirus is getting increasingly political as much of the focus for the world's virus epicenter shifts to talk of reopening the country. This despite a week that has seen a surge in cases and deaths. Johns Hopkins University reports that the U.S. has more than 706,000 cases and more than 37,000 deaths.</p><p>Meantime, as a battle is brewing over plans to reopen the country, testing is seen as the key to do it safely. The White House insists that the capacity is already there to begin the process. But President Trump is not giving a timeline.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION: Which states are ready to reopen in your mind and how soon?</p><p>TRUMP: I want to let the governors make that decision. We're watching very closely. If we see something happening bad this we think is wrong, we'll come down very strong on that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALLEN: But he went on Twitter Friday and singled out several states led by Democrats, highlighting how many governors find themselves at odds with the president. CNN's Erica Hill has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): This is mayhem. We need a coordinated approach between the federal government and the states.</p><p>ERICA HILL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): New York Governor Cuomo repeating his plea for help with testing supplies and funding as the president tweets, states have to step up their testing.</p><p>CUOMO: Don't pass the buck without passing the bucks.</p><p>GOV. RAY COOPER (D-NC): When governors are faced with global supply chain breakdowns, when it comes to supplies and equipment, the federal government must help more.</p><p>HILL (voice-over): A handful of states may soon be ready for phase one of the president's guidelines but there is no one size fits all solution.</p><p>GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): Ohio's plan is going to be by Ohioans for Ohioans.</p><p>HILL (voice-over): Hospitalizations are down in New York City but all events there now cancelled for the month of May.</p><p>Texas schools will remain closed but not state parks.</p><p>In Jacksonville, beaches reopened Friday with limited hours.</p><p>MAYOR LENNY CURRY (R-FL): Folks, this can be the beginning of the pathway back to normal life but please respect and follow these limitations.</p><p>HILL (voice-over): Mississippi's shelter in place orders extended to April 27th.</p><p>GOV. TATE REEVES (R-MS): I know we cannot stay in this position for much longer but we are still in the eye of the storm.</p><p>HILL (voice-over): As New Jersey's governor warns face coverings may be here through the fall. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would bet the answer's yes, we will be masked when kids go back to school.</p><p>HILL (voice-over): The president encouraging protesters in Minnesota, Virginia...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can't keep healthy people locked in their houses and watch the economy just go down.</p><p>HILL (voice-over): -- and Michigan, as that state's governor doubles down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's better to be 6 feet apart right now than 6 feet under. And that is the whole point of this.</p><p>HILL (voice-over): In San Antonio, seemingly endless lines for food. And across the country, outrage and concern for some of the most vulnerable Americans.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When they lock down, we have no connection with our mom.</p><p>HILL (voice-over): A New Jersey facility now under investigation after more than a dozen bodies were found in its morgue, 36 deaths there now linked to COVID-19.</p><p>[04:05:00]</p><p>HILL (voice-over): Those on the front lines also sounding an alarm.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Underpaid, understaffed nursing homes has been a problem in our country for a long time and this crisis has only made it worse.</p><p>HILL: And it is not just nursing homes that are a concern. In New Jersey, 50 residents at veterans' homes have now died of COVID related illnesses. In fact, 75 combat medics with the National Guard were dispatched to assist in those veterans' homes.</p><p>And in Massachusetts, the Holyoke Soldier Home, 47 veteran residents have died there. In fact, a federal investigation has been opened into the care at that facility. Back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLEN: There are fears that the United Kingdom will be the hardest hit country in Europe because of the government's strategy at the beginning of the pandemic. National Health Service providers say there is a critical shortage of clinical gowns. They tried to get emergency deliveries from other country but it was too late.</p><p>Those countries had also run out of personal protective equipment. We know that's abbreviated as PPE. The U.K. is one of the most affected countries when it comes to this deadly virus.</p><p>We do not have a vaccine for COVID-19 or officially approved specific treatments and there are also many questions about testing. Let's get perspective from an expert. Gary McLean is a professor at London Metropolitan University.</p><p>Good morning, thank you for coming on.</p><p>Can you hear me?</p><p>GARY MCLEAN, LONDON METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY: Yes.</p><p>ALLEN: Good morning, thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>MCLEAN: Good morning. Sorry about that.</p><p>ALLEN: That is all right. We're all trying to figure it out, live reporting in this era. I want to talk with you about -- just mentioned that the United Kingdom is still seeing shortages in PPE and is still behind in testing.</p><p>What do you see as issues facing the United Kingdom right now?</p><p>MCLEAN: Yes, obviously case numbers are still increasing. Europe is the epicenter of the outbreak right now. Many countries in Europe are really suffering. I think that we have to continue the way we are with the lockdowns.</p><p>The PPE issue is really an ongoing problem. We're seeing the frontline NHS staff really lacking for the essential equipment that they need. The government is, however, ramping up the testing for those people that are on the front lines, so we're seeing more people getting tested and hopefully that will continue.</p><p>And we'll consequently see case numbers dropping soon.</p><p>ALLEN: That hasn't been the case yet but that is a positive note. We'll take it.</p><p>We also know that there are many, many agencies around the world working on a vaccine. One is headlined (sic) in Oxford.</p><p>Are you encouraged over the search for a vaccine?</p><p>MCLEAN: Yes, it seems like this is an unprecedented effort. At least 115 different candidates underway. And these candidates have the full spectrum of platforms from killed or inactivated viruses to subunits, small pieces of the virus or even much more experimental approaches with the vectors put into other viruses and then used or even just RNA or DNA vaccines.</p><p>And we have to assume that these platforms worked in the past and that one will work in this case. But it will take time. The safety issues, regulation takes at least a year, in my opinion.</p><p>ALLEN: So meantime, until there is a vaccine, there is diagnostic tests, there will hopefully be an antibody test. We're hearing more about contact tracing, the need for that.</p><p>How do you get ahead of this disease other than social distancing right now?</p><p>MCLEAN: It is extreme testing. We have to test as many people as possible, really understand the dynamics of the virus and the outbreak and how many people do get infected.</p><p>It is always the old simple question, when there is a new infection, the population is not immune. We have to understand what proportion of the population do get immune and what proportion of the population do get infected.</p><p>We have to assume, once you are infected, you do become immune and that will protect all the other people. Until we have that, the only exit strategy is effective immunity, which is a vaccine. And it is just going to take time, more research, more understanding.</p><p>ALLEN: And you talk about the belief that, once someone has had coronavirus, they are immune. But we're hearing about a case in South Korea.</p><p>[04:10:00]</p><p>ALLEN: A mystery where 163 people who recovered have now retested positive.</p><p>MCLEAN: Yes, there is a lot of debate about that. It is an intriguing story. I'm not sure on the exact specifics of those cases and whether or not they had very high levels of antibodies initially or not.</p><p>A lot of this also depends on how effectively the test was done, what they are looking for in these situations is the virus. They need to swab inside the airways or through the nose, back of the throats, to find the virus. And if that is not effectively done, you could get a false negative presumably.</p><p>People with antibodies that get reinfected?</p><p>We know there are at least three different stratifications of antibody responses, the high, medium and those who may carry very few or no antibodies. So maybe some of these people did not have a strong antibody response in the initial stages of the infection.</p><p>ALLEN: Let's talk about the United States for a moment. We're in the middle of this battle. So many deaths, so many people have this. And the president is encouraging some states to reopen.</p><p>Without widespread testing, is now the time for the U.S. to ease up on distancing?</p><p>Everyone wants their economy back.</p><p>But is this the time?</p><p>MCLEAN: Well, it is really a fine balance. I think you've got to balance out the effects on the economy, which are going to be huge worldwide. It is not just the United States. Everywhere will suffer from this. And you have to balance that with the health aspects. I do understand that it is very difficult and the authorities and President Trump have not got an easy job on this one. But I think that it is too soon to relax these measures of lockdown and quarantine.</p><p>These are the only effective measures in a pandemic such as this, where we don't have immunity or a protective vaccine, the only way of stopping the virus. And I think that it would being more dramatically worse to release things too early and see the virus come back.</p><p>At the epicenter in Wuhan, they had an 11 week lockdown. And I think the United States should look at what is happening in Europe first, because they are a little ahead in terms of case numbers. And we're not going to relief measures here in Europe just yet.</p><p>ALLEN: Agreed. Yes, Wuhan had many more deaths than we knew about, we just learned about that as well. Professor Gary McLean, thank you so much for your time.</p><p>MCLEAN: You're welcome. Thank you.</p><p>ALLEN: Just ahead here, the U.S. state of Texas, though, is ready to get back to normal, whatever that is. And the governor has a plan to make it happen sooner rather than later. We'll have a report from Dallas.</p><p>Plus, can you remember everyone you were in contact with weeks before the lockdown started?</p><p>People who were infected might have to answer that question before their lives get back to normal.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[04:15:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like it is just entirely too soon. Don't go from making it seem like it is a huge deal and people, bodies literally dropping and say, oh, we can just open it back up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALLEN: Despite concerns about reopening everything too soon, some local U.S. governments are itching to get things back to normal. The states of Texas and Vermont have announced plans to reopen some sectors in the coming weeks. CNN's Ed Lavandera is in Dallas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Texas governor Greg Abbott has announced what he described as a phased approach to reopening the Texas economy. He made four major announcements today, the first being that Texas schools will remain closed for the rest of this academic school year. It will all remain online.</p><p>Secondly, he is outlining what he describes as, quote, \"retail to go,\" essentially allowing retail stores to reopen in a limited way, allowing customers to come up to the doors and place orders and drive away with whatever it is that they are buying.</p><p>Thirdly, Texas state parks will reopen on Monday.</p><p>And then the fourth announcement, that an easing of restrictions on what kind of surgeries can take place surgeries can take place in hospitals and the governor says in the next 10 days or so they are even considering allowing more elective surgeries.</p><p>All of this happening as the stay-at-home order will remain in place for the rest of the month but that he will reevaluate that, depending on the medical data that we have and the flattening of the curve here in Texas and where the coronavirus cases stand.</p><p>But all of this really happening under a huge cloud here in Texas. This is a state with 29 million people and it has a dismal rate of testing. Less than 1 percent of the population has been tested.</p><p>The governor says a massive amount of private lab testing will come online by the end of April into early May. But there were few details about how many tests would actually be online and exactly how all of that would unfold and actually play out in reality.</p><p>So that is where we stand now, as many leaders in cities like Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin have expressed a great deal of concern about the low levels of testing in this state -- Ed Lavandera, CNN, Dallas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLEN: U.S. public health officials say there is a crucial step needed for a safe reopening and that is contact tracing. That means tracking down anyone an infected patient might have come in contact with to contain the virus and keep it from spreading. But as CNN's Sara Sidner shows us from Los Angeles, it is not that easy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMY DRISCOLL, SURVIVED CORONAVIRUS: This was painful.</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Amy Driscoll says coronavirus had a her in a vise grip that wouldn't let go for weeks.</p><p>DRISCOLL: Every breath, every humidity, every raising your arms, rolling over in bed, every single thing is painful.</p><p>SIDNER: Less than two hours after arriving home from the hospital, her phone rang. [04:20:00]</p><p>SIDNER (voice-over): It was the county health department, asking lots of questions.</p><p>DRISCOLL: Who have I seen in the last two weeks, where was I in the last two weeks, who was I in contact with, where do I work.</p><p>SIDNER: The Health Department was doing what is called contact tracing.</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): You have to trace every person who comes up positive. Trace means investigate. Investigate all those prior contacts.</p><p>SIDNER: Driscoll traced her steps. She had gone to work. Her boss and staff had to be contacted.</p><p>She went to a restaurant for lunch. She went to her hair salon, they had to be contacted. She went to a Cleveland Cavaliers game. All the family members who sat with her were contacted.</p><p>This kind of contact tracing is happening across the country and the world.</p><p>From those suffering through the deadly COVID outbreak in New York and those connected to the first major U.S. outbreak in Washington state, to California, the first place where a statewide stay-at-home order was announced.</p><p>Experts say without contract tracing and enough testing, America and the world cannot reopen safely.</p><p>JOSHUA MICHAUD, KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION: We're going to be at risk of resurgence of this disease, not just in the fall, but going into next year.</p><p>SIDNER (on camera): So you're saying without contact tracing, without testing a massive amount, we could find ourselves right back where we started?</p><p>MICHAUD: I think we could find ourselves very much at risk of another resurgence.</p><p>SIDNER (voice-over): But the U.S. does not have enough people to do the tracing. State health officials estimate there are about 2,000 people doing this work now, but Johns Hopkins University warns we need at least 100,000.</p><p>(on camera): For now, contact tracing is only as good as your memory. This is hard. I mean, before stay-at-home orders, can you remember all the people you had close contact with over a two-week period, say, at the coffee shop? Or at the grocery store? Or at a restaurant? Or at your child's school?</p><p>And that's where big tech like Google and Apple are jumping in. They will soon have an app you can voluntarily download that works with health departments so they can see detailed location data from your cellphone. But the public may be skittish about it due to privacy concerns.</p><p>Contact tracing requires serious legwork. L.A.'s mayor is pushing for federal help.</p><p>MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI (D-CA): We're probably going to need hundreds of thousands of people who would be put to work. It should be funded by the feds by enacted locally.</p><p>SIDNER: As for Driscoll, her contacts have been found. The Health Department tells Driscoll that none of the people she was in contact with have symptoms so far. But testing is still a problem.</p><p>DRISCOLL: I've had no additional testing.</p><p>SIDNER: Amy says she was supposed to have two negative tests to make sure that she was no longer spreading the virus. She wouldn't have the testing because they don't have enough and it makes her worried to go back into the community safely.</p><p>And as far as how important contact tracing is, the CDC announced a pilot program and sending out protection teams to eight states to try to help ramp up contact tracing -- Sara Sidner, CNN, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLEN: And, of course, these are all the steps being taken until there is a vaccine. The British government forming a vaccine task force to help fight the coronavirus, it is investing more than $17 million U.S. to help bring a vaccine to market as soon as possible. Nina dos Santos is joining us now.</p><p>Nina, may the NIH people win that come up with the vaccine that is safe and ready to go but it may be a while.</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNNMONEY EUROPE EDITOR: It may be many months from here, according to the government's chief scientific adviser. In a press conference yesterday afternoon, one of the daily coronavirus briefings that the government has been giving, it was up to the business secretary to announce these new measures that they are putting in place to try to ramp up protection of the vaccine with the announcement of this task force here that will encompass the private sector and some really big and effective pharmaceutical firms like GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca.</p><p>And also they will be able to harness the academia that we have here in the U.K. as well, scientists at Oxford University and Imperial College claim that they could be close to having some kind of viable vaccine perhaps as early as September.</p><p>Also in the United States, some scientists have made similar claims at the NIH as well. However the broader scientific community also still remains slightly skeptical about this, saying that any vaccine could only be up and ready by the month of March. And a vaccine is a key way of ending the lockdown as safely and perhaps as soon as possible. The other, of course, being mass testing to find out who has had the virus and who hasn't.</p><p>[04:25:00]</p><p>DOS SANTOS: So that those who have can go back to work and the economy can get back up and running.</p><p>ALLEN: Absolutely. We know that the United States is struggling with testing.</p><p>What is the latest from the U.K.?</p><p>They have had their issues as well.</p><p>DOS SANTOS: That's right. And one of the things that they have been trying to get at least in front of is being this issue of vaccines because, when it comes to as you discussed with your previous guest earlier personal protective equipment, the government strategy has been heavily criticized on that front.</p><p>The other one that is being criticized in terms of responses has been antibody testing kits. The U.K. has continued to set rather aggressive targets, up to about 100,000 people to be tested per day by the end of this month, according to the health secretary.</p><p>He announced that the U.K. is woefully way away from those kind of levels of testing. In the press conference I was mentioning earlier, the business secretary said that the U.K. now has the capacity to test around 38,000 workers.</p><p>Of course at the moment they are focusing the tests on those National Health System workers, the workers who are most potentially exposed to coronavirus. But he said not all of the people have been able to take them up. The level of testing, it is only around about the 20,000s and they will need to scale it up massively if they are to hit the 100,000 target.</p><p>And then, of course, there is the embarrassment of having bought millions of dollars' worth of tests from China that seem don't actually work.</p><p>ALLEN: All right. A long way to go. Nina dos Santos, thank you so much.</p><p>COVID-19 hits some people hard while others never have any symptoms. Next we take a look at why that might be.</p><p>Also during this pandemic, a tale of two cities, Singapore and Hong Kong. Both had aggressive strategies from the start. But now that they are fighting a second wave of cases, one of them has a clear edge. We'll look into it.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[04:30:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ALLEN: Welcome back to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Natalie Allen and you're watching CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>More now on our top story this hour, the growing political feud over how and when to reopen the U.S. economy. A day after insisting that governors would call the shots in their own states, President Trump tweeted for several Democrat-led states to be, quote, \"liberated.\"</p><p>Meanwhile the country's cases and reported deaths are surging. There is now more than 706,000 infections in the U.S. and the number of deaths has surpassed 37,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>Surviving coronavirus is not as simple as a patient's age or pre- existing conditions. Many healthy people have fallen victim to the disease while others never show any symptoms. Dr. Sanjay Gupta looks into why this may be.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These were some of the first heartbreaking images we saw of the coronavirus in the United States. It was an outbreak at the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, a nursing home. At the time, it made sense.</p><p>Earlier studies had shown the disease was more severe and more deadly among people who were older and had underlying conditions. Yet, all along, we kept hearing stories of young, healthy people also becoming extremely sick, like 30 year old Ben Luderer (ph).</p><p>BRANDY LUDERER, BEN'S WIFE: He came into our bedroom where I was laying and he said, I got to go. I have to take myself to the hospital.</p><p>I said are sure you want to go there?</p><p>Like are you sure?</p><p>He said yes, I need to.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): Or 39-year-old Conrad Buchanan --</p><p>NICOLE BUCHANAN, CONRAD'S WIFE: That day he was starting to decline because he did not have a horrible cough this whole time and then 20 seconds when I brought him to the hospital.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): Young couples, husbands and wives all infected. Yet, in these cases, the wives stayed relatively healthy, while their husbands became suddenly critically ill and died.</p><p>BUCHANAN: They would not let me in the hospital as he was begging that I need my wife. My wife makes my decisions. They told me to park the car. We thought I was going to get to go in with him and, when I walked up to the doors, the hospitals was on lockdown. They would not let anybody in. And that was it. I never got to see him. I never got to say I love you.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): Two days after Ben Luderer was released from the hospital, he was back home in bed.</p><p>LUDERER: I could hear through the door that he was still breathing and I fell asleep.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): By the time Brandy woke up in the morning, Ben had passed away.</p><p>Why does COVID-19 hit some people like Conrad Buchanan and Ben Luderer so hard, while many others have mild or no symptoms at all?</p><p>It is a question that Dr. Anthony Fauci posed to me when I spoke with him on my podcast.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I am fascinated, Sanjay, by what I would call the pathogenesis. You get so many people who do well. Then some people who just, bingo, they are not on a respirator and they are on ECMO and they're dead.</p><p>I mean, the dichotomy between that -- there is something there, Sanjay, that we are missing from a pathogenesis standpoint. I don't think if it's only if you are elderly or if you have underlying conditions. There is something else going on there that, hopefully, we will ultimately figure out.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): We still do not know the answer to this. But even over the last few weeks, I have been talking to multiple scientists and frontline workers, trying to better understand what is happening here.</p><p>For older and more vulnerable people, it could be that the virus itself overwhelmed their immune system. For younger people, it could be that their immune system was almost too strong, reacted too violently, resulting in a storm of inflammation.</p><p>AKIKO IWASAKI, YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: The cytokines are immune defense molecules that are normally used to control the infection. But when it is triggered in this way, it is an uncontrolled level of cytokines that ultimately damage the tissue, such as the lungs or the blood vessels.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): Some have told me, maybe it is the amount of virus itself.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For reasons we do not understand, frontline health care workers are a great risk for serious illness, despite their younger age. Maybe it is due to a higher dose of virus they are receiving.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): A number of researchers brought up the idea that the answer could be in our genes, that maybe there is another risk factor besides just being older or having underlying disease.</p><p>DR. LEANA WEN, E.R. PHYSICIAN: Studies show that those who are more likely to have severe infections are those who are older or have medical chronic conditions.</p><p>[04:35:00]</p><p>WEN: But it is unclear what exactly counts as a chronic medical condition. Some things are very clear but some things are not.</p><p>BUCHANAN: There is no discrimination when it comes to this virus and seeing what my husband had to go through was horrible. Now our life has turned into this horrible nightmare.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLEN: So many families in so much pain.</p><p>Singapore had been getting praise for its efforts early on to stop the spread and now the country is reporting more than 600 new cases, bringing the total to more than 5,000.</p><p>The health ministry there says the overwhelming majority of these new cases are workers from abroad who live in dormitories. The tourism industry says it may use cruise ship to house foreign workers once they recover. Johns Hopkins University meanwhile is reporting that Japan is about to hit 10,000 confirmed cases.</p><p>And there is another story in Asia making headlines. Singapore and Hong Kong have very different plans to combat the coronavirus. Both are fighting a new wave of infections but one of them seems to have found a winning strategy. We get this story from Kristie Lu Stout.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): It's a tale of two cities amid one pandemic, Singapore and Hong Kong, two wealthy Asian societies that have launched aggressive virus fighting campaigns from the start.</p><p>Both cities tightened borders in late January; both turned away many visitors in March. And as both face a second wave of infections from residents returning home from overseas, cases spiked, especially in Singapore.</p><p>On April 13th, Singapore had more than 2,900 cases while Hong Kong had 1,009.</p><p>So how can Hong Kong, with a larger population sitting right next to Mainland China, manage to keep the numbers lower, at least for now?</p><p>Observers say it could be due to the people here and their collective memory of another pandemic.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: SARS remain very fresh on the memories of Hong Kongers. When COVID-19 broke out, the people knew we needed masks, we needed to be away from one another, we need to start becoming very hygienic about things, we need to listen to the medical people, we need to close borders.</p><p>The basic protocol that I think are found in any government in cases of pandemics in crisis, the Hong Kong people knew exactly what do. And they did it.</p><p>STOUT (voice-over): Nearly two decades ago, the SARS outbreak killed 774 people, just under 40 percent of the fatalities in Hong Kong. So at the start of the latest pandemic, Hong Kongers were quick to wear masks while in Singapore --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't need to wear a mask if you are not sick.</p><p>STOUT (voice-over): A government public service announcement said healthy people did not need to wear masks. Months later, it is now mandatory to wear a mask outside.</p><p>Another key difference, social distancing. In late January, Hong Kong closed schools and government offices, pressuring private companies to work from home while Singapore left its schools and government offices open. After a sharp rise in cases, including an outbreak among foreign workers in cramped dormitories, the city state changed course.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now to preempt escalating infections.</p><p>STOUT (voice-over): Singapore has closed schools and most workplaces and has also banned all social gatherings as part of a circuit breaker to fight the virus. From the start, they have been screening, quarantining, contact tracing and yet, months later, the city is under virtual lockdown.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That is the price we have to pay to combat pandemics such as COVID-19. Social distancing will be an integral part of all the lockdown or circuit breaker measures.</p><p>But the critical thing is that the government and the people have to remain eternally vigilant because it may be COVID-19 this year and the next year but there will be future pandemics.</p><p>STOUT (voice-over): With an outbreak, there are no shortcuts, only lessons learned from a still unfolding tale of two cities -- Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLEN: There is definitely one upside to the widespread lockdowns and it is the air. It is so much cleaner right now, all around the world. We'll talk with our guest about that coming up here.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[04:40:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ALLEN: Here is a bright spot in the midst of this pandemic. This is Venice, Italy, the water is clear, the air is clean. Satellite images that you can find on cnn.com give you a sense of why.</p><p>This one was taken about a year ago. You see the water around Venice, teeming with boats. The water is virtually empty now. It has been nearly seven weeks since the nationwide lockdown began, cutting off the flow of tourists.</p><p>While there are obvious economic concerns, there are also obvious environmental benefits. The lockdown is allowing Mother Nature to have a comeback as people remain indoors, cars remain parked, wild animals have come out to party.</p><p>In South Africa, an African penguin casually strolls through the parking lot of a restaurant near a popular beach. The restaurant is closed.</p><p>And in Argentina, sea lions are seen on an empty street by a harbor. The significant decrease in traffic has also done wonders for air pollution.</p><p>This is Los Angeles. Normally with endless traffic and smog, it is now clear. But this new cleaner air may not last long for the United States.</p><p>Reports say that the Trump administration has weakened regulations on mercury, a dangerous toxin, and air pollutants earlier this week, an apparent attempt to help the struggling coal industry. Let's talk more about this, joining me now from Oxford, England, is George Monbiot, he's an environmental campaigner and writer.</p><p>Good morning, thanks for coming on. First I want to talk about these beautiful pictures that we're seeing around the world. I personally have never seen such blue sky that we're seeing in Atlanta, normally a city with a lot of smog and traffic. Speak to that first.</p><p>GEORGE MONBIOT, ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNER AND WRITER: It is amazing, isn't it?</p><p>And we are seeing in a recent poll here in the U.K. huge numbers of people saying we don't want to go back to normal when this is over. We want to stick with our low levels of air pollution, we want to be able to see the sky, we don't want it covered in a fabric of contrails.</p><p>[04:45:00]</p><p>MONBIOT: Let's try to lock in some of the positive environmental aspects of this terrible crisis so that, when we come out of this, we come out into a new economy, a green economy, one which doesn't depend on the burning of loads of fossil fuels.</p><p>And I think a lot of people around the world are feeling that. One extraordinary likely fact is that, overall, the pandemic could actually save more lives than it kills because of the huge numbers of people who die as a result of air pollution every year.</p><p>There are now more people dying of air pollution worldwide than of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. So we could well see that the awful tragedies and fatalities caused by the COVID-19 virus will be balanced out by a reduction of fatalities caused by air pollution.</p><p>ALLEN: That has been an interesting aspect to the story, has it not?</p><p>And you know, it also goes to speak to the reluctance for the world to tackle climate change, when we see what just parking cars and limiting businesses to some extent and how they run things, we can see the difference, it is right there. It is almost tangible. You can feel it in the air.</p><p>MONBIOT: It is very interesting, isn't it, because we're being told now for years, oh, you can't possibly make the changes required to prevent climate breakdown, the economy wouldn't stand it, people wouldn't stand it, no one would put up with it if you were to say, let's change lifestyles in order to prevent this great crisis from materializing.</p><p>And yet what we're being called to do as a result of this pandemic is a much more drastic and extreme change of lifestyles. We're not talking about the need for a lockdown to prevent climate breakdown; we're just talking about the need to change the way that we travel, to change the way that we heat our homes, to change the sources of energy that we use.</p><p>There will be some lifestyle changes but they're not nearly as far- reaching and severe as those required in the pandemic. But suddenly, you see, hang on a minute, it can be done. All these people who have been telling us that it was completely impossible to make such changes, well, we've made far more drastic changes and people do accept it.</p><p>ALLEN: Absolutely. Well, the one drawback might be the Trump administration, which has continued to roll back environmental protections.</p><p>Is there any hope there with this administration, with what we've seen their record become?</p><p>MONBIOT: It is quite extraordinary, isn't it. Last month the Environmental Protection Agency suspended all monitoring and enforcement of pollution. So companies can do as much air and water pollution as they like because there will nobody around to stop them.</p><p>This is quite extraordinary. Companies are saying that, because of the pandemic, we can't prevent releases of air pollution and water pollution.</p><p>You think, why not?</p><p>You can continue to operate your plants, you can keep the refineries going, you can keep the chemical plants going.</p><p>But there is something about this pandemic which stops you from maintaining pollution controls?</p><p>It is preposterous. This is a classic example of disaster capitalism, of people operating within emergency, making use of that emergency to get what they always wanted.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trump has always wanted to give them these moratoriums on public protections, to basically sweep away the protections that look after our health, that look after the natural world and give the big companies what they want.</p><p>And he is locked into that position because he is completely enmeshed in the society of the people who want a complete removal of those protections. And so, unfortunately under the Trump government, it is very hard to see that changing.</p><p>ALLEN: That is one unfortunate aspect. As the skies stay clear, we'll continue to hear the voices thinking, why not, why can't we keep it this way?</p><p>George, thank you so much for talking with us this morning, thank you.</p><p>MONBIOT: Thank you very much.</p><p>ALLEN: A fleeting moment caught on camera, married nurses in full gear share an embrace. They talk about that moment and what it is like on the coronavirus front lines ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[04:50:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ALLEN: Now a photo that has tugged heartstrings all over the world. Two nurses married to each other, embracing in full protective gear. That's Ben Cayer and Mindy Brock, both nurse anesthetists in Florida. Erin Burnett spoke with them and asked what led to that moment right there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MINDY BROCK, NURSE ANESTHETIST: It was like the second day we (INAUDIBLE) new COVID-19 airway team in our hospital. And Ben and I were actually on the way to work, driving that morning. We were a little stressed out. We were arguing about like who was supposed to empty the dishwasher or what music we were going to listen to on the way to work.</p><p>And we get into work and we do a couple of cases, do all these intubations. And we were sort of in between cases when Ben came over to my room. He was right beside me and that is when that picture was taken.</p><p>At that moment, we were just telling us each, this is something we've never seen before, you know, anything like this in our lives and that we just need to be here together for each other and all of that stuff we were arguing about, the mundane things, that doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>[04:55:00]</p><p>ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR: Ben, what was going through your mind at that moment when you walked into the room and saw Mindy?</p><p>BEN CAYER, NURSE ANESTHETIST: I was just checking on her because it was her first day, it was my second day. And I had talked to her the first night and she didn't understand why I was acting like (INAUDIBLE) mentally drained. And so I wanted to check on her and see how she was doing.</p><p>My day hadn't been perfect, either. So I went in there and it was like she was stressed but she was doing it, she was doing a great job. When I went in there, it is like we were just like what were we arguing about?</p><p>Why were we arguing about this stuff in the car.</p><p>This has never happened to us before and there are bigger things to worry about. And we definitely just -- I felt a strong bond that we were able to do it together like colleagues as well as being (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BURNETT: It is an incredible thing.</p><p>Mindy, I know you and Ben volunteered, You were referencing it but I guess the airway team. So you are actually intubating patients. And that, as we now all know, the highest risk thing that you can possibly do in terms of exposure and just, of course, the tragedy of what you see, of people who are so sick and some of them dying and some of them not able to obviously see their own families in those crucial and painful moments.</p><p>Did you make the decision to join this team together?</p><p>BROCK: Yes, we definitely discussed it and we just felt like we wouldn't want to look back on this day and regret anything that we did, you know. I think this is the kind of thing that sort of defines you and you want to be there to help others.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALLEN: Ben and Mindy, what a couple and what a great photograph.</p><p>I'm Natalie Allen. I'll be back with another hour of NEWSROOM, the latest on the coronavirus right after this.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2020041821CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YPC-KVT1-JB20-G3M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 18, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>FOOD &amp;

There have also been complaints of potentially anti-competitive behavior in how it runs the advertising side of its business.</p><p>Google said in a statement on Friday that it had not yet been contacted by state antitrust enforcers but would work constructively with them.</p><p>Separately, a second group of state attorneys general, led by New York, is focusing on Facebook Inc (FB.O), it was announced on Friday.</p><p>The social media platform, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has more than 1.5 billion daily users, has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and so-called \"fake news\" on its service. Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president for state and local policy, said last week that the company would cooperate with state attorneys general.</p><p>One criticism of Facebook is that it has been slow to clamp down on hate speech, and it recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users' data with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The consultancy's clients included Trump's 2016 election campaign.</p><p>On the federal level, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are probing Facebook, Google, Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), also for potential violations of antitrust law.</p><p>Google's parent Alphabet said on Friday the Department of Justice in late August requested information and documents related to prior antitrust probes of the company. The company added in a securities filing that it expects similar investigative demands from state attorneys general, and that it is cooperating with regulators.</p><p>Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, has been accused of unfair tactics with third-party sellers on its website, who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private label sales by Amazon itself.</p><p>Apple has come under fire from app developers over practices like making only iPhone apps available through its official App Store. The music-streaming app Spotify (SPOT.N) has alleged that App Store policies make it difficult to compete against Apple Music for paid subscribers.</p><p>State attorneys general have fewer resources than the federal agencies but have been known to team up to take on even giant corporations.</p><p>Most recently, 43 states and Puerto Rico sued Teva Pharmaceutical Industries LtdTEVA.O and 19 other drugmakers in May, accusing them of scheming to inflate prices and reduce competition for more than 100 generic drugs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRDECO-3116194</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRDECO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X14-H781-JBMJ-33CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345568</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"562\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT +4</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Trend News Agency All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Trend Daily Economic News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61541\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There have also been complaints of potentially anti-competitive behavior in how it runs the advertising side of its business.</p><p>Google said in a statement on Friday that it had not yet been contacted by state antitrust enforcers but would work constructively with them.</p><p>Separately, a second group of state attorneys general, led by New York, is focusing on Facebook Inc (FB.O), it was announced on Friday.</p><p>The social media platform, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has more than 1.5 billion daily users, has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and so-called \"fake news\" on its service. Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president for state and local policy, said last week that the company would cooperate with state attorneys general.</p><p>One criticism of Facebook is that it has been slow to clamp down on hate speech, and it recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users' data with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The consultancy's clients included Trump's 2016 election campaign.</p><p>On the federal level, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are probing Facebook, Google, Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), also for potential violations of antitrust law.</p><p>Google's parent Alphabet said on Friday the Department of Justice in late August requested information and documents related to prior antitrust probes of the company. The company added in a securities filing that it expects similar investigative demands from state attorneys general, and that it is cooperating with regulators.</p><p>Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, has been accused of unfair tactics with third-party sellers on its website, who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private label sales by Amazon itself.</p><p>Apple has come under fire from app developers over practices like making only iPhone apps available through its official App Store. The music-streaming app Spotify (SPOT.N) has alleged that App Store policies make it difficult to compete against Apple Music for paid subscribers.</p><p>State attorneys general have fewer resources than the federal agencies but have been known to team up to take on even giant corporations.</p><p>Most recently, 43 states and Puerto Rico sued Teva Pharmaceutical Industries LtdTEVA.O and 19 other drugmakers in May, accusing them of scheming to inflate prices and reduce competition for more than 100 generic drugs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNCAEN-3116194</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNCAEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X11-NB21-JBMJ-30J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">432763</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"562\"/><timeReceived>6:00 PM GMT +4</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Trend News Agency All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Trend News Agency - Central Asia (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26477\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Paxton leads the probe, he said, which will focus on Google's advertising business. California and Alabama are not part of the investigation. States on Monday formally requested documents from Google on its advertising business, Paxton said. </p><p>Several of the attorneys general at the announcement in Washington described the investigation as \"preliminary\" but said they expected it would expand to cover other issues including data privacy. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said the probe was \"for the benefit of the tech ecosystem to help level the playing field.\" Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge called Google's online search engine a \"juggernaut,\" and argued that a free search sometimes came at the cost of the freedom to choose the best products from the best companies. The tech giants that were once praised as engines of economic growth with massive efficiencies have increasingly come under fire for allegedly misusing their clout in the market and lapses such as privacy breaches. U.S. President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of social media firms and Google, accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online without presenting any evidence. Google specifically has faced accusations that its web search service, which has become so dominant that it is now a verb, leads consumers to its own products at the cost of competitors. There have also been complaints of potentially anti-competitive behaviour in how it runs the advertising side of its business. Google said in a statement on Friday that it would work constructively with them. It had no further comment on Monday. Its shares were down 0.6 percent in late trading. Senator Josh Hawley, who as Missouri attorney general opened a Google probe in 2017, lauded the announcement on Monday as \"a very big day for the folks who care about antitrust enforcement.\" \"I hope that Congress will get serious about acting. And I hope the United States Senate will lead the way there,\" he said. Separately, a second group of state attorneys general, led by New York, is focusing on Facebook Inc , it was announced on Friday. The social media platform, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has more than 1.5 billion daily users, has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and so-called \"fake news\" on its service. Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president for state and local policy, said last week that the company would cooperate with state attorneys general. One criticism of Facebook is that it has been slow to clamp down on hate speech, and it recently paid a US$5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users' data with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The consultancy's clients included Trump's 2016 election campaign. On the federal level, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are probing Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon , also for potential violations of antitrust law. Google's parent Alphabet said on Friday the Department of Justice in late August requested information and documents related to prior antitrust probes of the company. The company added in a securities filing that it expects similar investigative demands from state attorneys general, and that it is cooperating with regulators. Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, has been accused of unfair tactics with third-party sellers on its website, who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private label sales by Amazon itself. Apple has come under fire from app developers over practices like making only iPhone apps available through its official App Store. The music-streaming app Spotify has alleged that App Store policies make it difficult to compete against Apple Music for paid subscribers. State attorneys general have fewer resources than the federal agencies but have been known to team up to take on even giant corporations. Most recently, 43 states and Puerto Rico sued Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and 19 other drugmakers in May, accusing them of scheming to inflate prices and reduce competition for more than 100 generic drugs.

With each passing day, there are greater fears about these companies controlling our online lives,\" said Michael Carrier, a professor antitrust law at Rutgers University.</p><p>Sign of 'techlash'</p><p>The case may be the first in a series of antitrust actions against Big Tech firms and highlights growing \"techlash,\" based on worries about dominant platforms which control the flow of information.</p><p>A separate coalition of states was set to launch an antitrust action, with Google reportedly a target.</p><p>The office of the Texas attorney general scheduled an event Monday in Washington with a \"broad coalition of states\" to unveil a multistate probe into \"whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access, and harmed consumers.\"</p><p>Asked about the move, Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said: \"Google's services help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country. We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\"</p><p>What's the remedy?</p><p>Maurice Stucke, a University of Tennessee law professor, said he expects one of the areas being investigated will be online advertising markets, which are dominated by Google and Facebook.</p><p>\"This is a great area to look at because the market has been criticized as being opaque,\" Stucke said.</p><p>But Stucke said the investigations may go further by looking at how tech platforms control data, potentially examining \"the intersection between competition law and privacy.\"</p><p>Amazon and Apple may also be in the crosshairs. Critics have complained that Amazon wields too much power in online retail, and that Apple may disadvantage rivals offering services in its app store.</p><p>In the European Union, Google has faced a series of antitrust actions and Amazon is now being targeted by enforcers.</p><p>Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has made a breakup of the big tech firms a part of her campaign platform.</p><p>But some analysts say the case against the tech firms faces challenges because the companies have in many cases provided services for free and brought prices down, making it hard to prove they harmed \"consumer welfare,\" the legal standard applied under judicial precedent.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a recent research note that \"a broad movement to break up companies solely because they are large will fail without a change to existing antitrust laws,\" which he said is \"exceedingly unlikely.\"</p><p>But Stucke said it would be wrong to view antitrust law as solely focused on consumer prices, and that it may be applied to questions of competition and innovation.</p><p>The probes could end up with a variety of outcomes including fines, restrictions on conduct or a breakup, Stucke maintained.</p><p>\"You'd have to show how the remedy would address the concerns,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-598563765</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 598563765</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-9SB1-JCBJ-K4SY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newsweek Media Group</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times - US ed.</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>James, Tish</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust Law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Restraint of Trade</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>News, opinion and commentary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer software industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>High technology industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Investigations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Restraint of trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Software industry</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Legal issues &amp;

With each passing day, there are greater fears about these companies controlling our online lives,\" said Michael Carrier, a professor antitrust law at Rutgers University.</p><p>- Sign of 'techlash' -</p><p>The case may be the first in a series of antitrust actions against Big Tech firms and highlights growing \"techlash,\" based on worries about dominant platforms which control the flow of information.</p><p>A separate coalition of states was set to launch an antitrust action, with Google reportedly a target.</p><p>The office of the Texas attorney general scheduled an event Monday in Washington with a \"broad coalition of states\" to unveil a multistate probe into \"whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access, and harmed consumers.\"</p><p>Asked about the move, Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said: \"Google's services help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country. We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\"</p><p>- What's the remedy? -</p><p>Maurice Stucke, a University of Tennessee law professor, said he expects one of the areas being investigated will be online advertising markets, which are dominated by Google and Facebook.</p><p>\"This is a great area to look at because the market has been criticized as being opaque,\" Stucke said.</p><p>But Stucke said the investigations may go further by looking at how tech platforms control data, potentially examining \"the intersection between competition law and privacy.\"</p><p>Amazon and Apple may also be in the crosshairs. Critics have complained that Amazon wields too much power in online retail, and that Apple may disadvantage rivals offering services in its app store.</p><p>In the European Union, Google has faced a series of antitrust actions and Amazon is now being targeted by enforcers.</p><p>Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has made a breakup of the big tech firms a part of her campaign platform.</p><p>But some analysts say the case against the tech firms faces challenges because the companies have in many cases provided services for free and brought prices down, making it hard to prove they harmed \"consumer welfare,\" the legal standard applied under judicial precedent.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a recent research note that \"a broad movement to break up companies solely because they are large will fail without a change to existing antitrust laws,\" which he said is \"exceedingly unlikely.\"</p><p>But Stucke said it would be wrong to view antitrust law as solely focused on consumer prices, and that it may be applied to questions of competition and innovation.</p><p>The probes could end up with a variety of outcomes including fines, restrictions on conduct or a breakup, Stucke maintained.</p><p>\"You'd have to show how the remedy would address the concerns,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook</p><p>GOOGLE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFP-US states launch antitrust probe of Facebook </dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0H-3C91-JBV1-X3R0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><timeReceived>4:34 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Agence France Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20278\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Federal review underway Earlier this year the US Justice Department said it would launch a \"review\" of major online platforms to determine if they have stifled innovation or reduced competition.It was not immediately clear if the states would be working in coordination with federal officials.Facebook, by far the largest social network, in the past has claimed it is not a monopoly and that consumers have many choices for how to connect with people online.The new probe \"shows how unease with large tech companies is spreading beyond Congress and the federal government agencies to the states. </p><p>With each passing day, there are greater fears about these companies controlling our online lives,\" said Michael Carrier, a professor antitrust law at Rutgers University. Sign of 'techlash' The case may be the first in a series of antitrust actions against Big Tech firms and highlights growing \"techlash,\" based on worries about dominant platforms which control the flow of information.A separate coalition of states was set to launch an antitrust action, with Google reportedly a target.The office of the Texas attorney general scheduled an event Monday in Washington with a \"broad coalition of states\" to unveil a multistate probe into \"whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access, and harmed consumers.\"Asked about the move, Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said: \"Google's services help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country. We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\" What's the remedy? Maurice Stucke, a University of Tennessee law professor, said he expects one of the areas being investigated will be online advertising markets, which are dominated by Google and Facebook.\"This is a great area to look at because the market has been criticized as being opaque,\" Stucke said.But Stucke said the investigations may go further by looking at how tech platforms control data, potentially examining \"the intersection between competition law and privacy.\"Amazon and Apple may also be in the crosshairs. Critics have complained that Amazon wields too much power in online retail, and that Apple may disadvantage rivals offering services in its app store.In the European Union, Google has faced a series of antitrust actions and Amazon is now being targeted by enforcers.Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has made a breakup of the big tech firms a part of her campaign platform.But some analysts say the case against the tech firms faces challenges because the companies have in many cases provided services for free and brought prices down, making it hard to prove they harmed \"consumer welfare,\" the legal standard applied under judicial precedent.Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a recent research note that \"a broad movement to break up companies solely because they are large will fail without a change to existing antitrust laws,\" which he said is \"exceedingly unlikely.\"But Stucke said it would be wrong to view antitrust law as solely focused on consumer prices, and that it may be applied to questions of competition and innovation.The probes could end up with a variety of outcomes including fines, restrictions on conduct or a breakup, Stucke maintained.\"You'd have to show how the remedy would address the concerns,\" he said. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX1087671567791941933251763300034</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0C-V891-JCMN-Y37V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"786\"/><timeReceived>5:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

James said the investigation \"focuses on Facebook's dominance in the industry and the potential anticompetitive conduct stemming from that dominance\".</p><p>\"We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices or increased the price of advertising,\" James said.</p><p>The investigations come as the tech giants have come under increasing scrutiny in the US.

The Chinese yuan fell to its weakest level in 11 years as China warned the U.S. that any further tariffs will be met with an escalation.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.3% at about 6:10 a.m. ET. Germany's Dax was 0.3% lower after rising yesterday for the third time in four days, while the French benchmark, the CAC 40, fell 0.5%. The FTSE 100 declined 0.6%; shares in U.K.-listed NMC Health PLC's surged 26% amid reports that two Chinese companies are competing to acquire a 40% stake in the healthcare services company.</p><p>In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index was little changed as data showed the country's services sector expanded while the manufacturing sector remained in contractionary territory in August. The Shanghai SE Composite added 0.1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.8%.</p><p>The euro traded at $1.1080, close to the lowest level since May 2017, while the Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of developed-market peers, was steady at 98.318.</p><p>Yesterday, Minutes from the Federal Reserve's July monetary policy meeting showed that most officials viewed the 25-basis-point rate cut as a \"mid-cycle adjustment\" rather than the first of several interest rate cuts, while two members wanted to lower rates by 50 basis points. However, much has happened since the meeting, including an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, \"hence we still expect the Fed to deliver more cuts,\" Danske Bank Research said in a note.</p><p>The Kansas City Fed's economic symposium is due to begin today in Jackson Hole, and markets await Fed Chair Jerome Powell's address tomorrow for signals on the central bank's monetary policy path forward.</p><p>\"The risk is that, given the extent of market expectations for easing over the next 12 months, Chair Powell could again come across as more hawkish and encourage a stronger dollar,\" said Fritz Louw and Lee Hardman, currency analysts at MUFG Bank.</p><p>The Eurozone composite Purchasing Managers' Index unexpectedly rose to 51.8 in August from 51.5 in July, with improvement in both the manufacturing and services sectors. However, it was still close to a six-year low, and manufacturing remained in contraction for an eighth month.</p><p>The recovery is mildly positive news, but the growth rate \"is too weak to generate meaningful inflation pressures, which means the [European Central Bank] needs to do more,\" said Jan von Gerich, chief analyst at Nordea Markets. \"We continue to expect an easing package from the central bank at the September meeting.\"</p><p>The yuan depreciated 0.3% to 7.0862 against the dollar, the lowest level since 2008, after China warned the U.S. that any further tariffs will be met with an escalation.</p><p>The Indonesian rupiah weakened 0.7% to a six-month low against the dollar after the country's central bank unexpectedly lowered its key rate by 25 basis points. The Japanese yen appreciated 0.2% against the dollar. Sterling was little changed at $1.2124.</p><p>In the bond market, Treasurys rose as 10-year yields fell 1 basis point to 1.58%.

Apple shed 1% on the day that the iPhone seller kicked off its annual software showcase. Amazon fell 4.6%. The four have a combined market value of nearly $3 trillion, and their losses helped tilt the S&amp;P 500 lower on a day when there were actually more gainers than losers in the stock market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Investors were reacting to media reports suggesting that government regulators are setting the stage for potential antitrust probes into each of the four technology giants.</p><p> The sell-off knocked the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index into a correction, Wall Street-speak for a drop of 10% or more from a peak.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 4.74 points, or less than 0.1%, to 24,819.78.</p><p> The Nasdaq composite lost 120.13 points, or 1.6%, to 7,333.02.

Reports say consumer groups and vendors have complained that Amazon is unfairly edging out competition as it expands its business and offerings.</p><p> Declines by the big tech companies depressed their sectors for much of the day. Microsoft dropped 3.1% and Twitter slid 5.5%. The losses outweighed gains in household goods makers, banks and elsewhere in the market.</p><p>Campbell Soup rose 2.9% and American International Group added 3.2%.</p><p> The day of indecisive trading came amid a wave of volatility in the market as investors wrestle with the uncertainty of the U.S. and its growing use of tariffs in international trade disputes.</p><p> Investors spent the bulk of May fleeing to safer holdings as a global trade war flared up. China and the U.S. have been escalating their trade dispute with more tariffs on each other's goods while also threatening to ban technology and resource sales.

Stocks opened mostly flat on Monday morning, amid continuing trade tensions between the United States and its major trading partners, China and Mexico. PHOTO: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Major U.S. stock indexes ended mostly lower Monday amid signs that the Trump administration is laying the groundwork to ratchet up scrutiny on some of the market's biggest names: Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google. Google's parent Alphabet lost 6.1% and Facebook sank 7.5%. Apple shed 1% on the day that the iPhone seller kicked off its annual software showcase. Amazon fell 4.6%. The four have a combined market value of nearly $3 trillion, and their losses helped tilt the S&amp;P 500 lower on a day when there were actually more gainers than losers in the stock market. Investors were reacting to media reports suggesting that government regulators are setting the stage for potential antitrust probes into each of the four technology giants. </p><p>The sell-off knocked the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index into a correction, Wall Street speak for a drop of 10% or more from a peak. The Nasdaq hit its most recent all-time high early last month, before the trade dispute between the U.S. and China escalated, setting off a monthlong slide. \"We do have this trade uncertainty, and we now have some uncertainty with tech companies and government regulations,\" said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior markets strategist at Voya Investment Management. \"These are the go-to big names, and if they're vulnerable, that just makes investors a little bit nervous.\" The S&amp;P 500 index fell 7.61 points, or 0.3%, to 2,744.45. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 4.74 points, or less than 0.1%, to 24,819.78. The Nasdaq composite lost 120.13 points, or 1.6%, to 7,333.02. It's now down 10.2% from its all-time high set May 3. The Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 4.50 points, or 0.3%, to 1,469.98. Major stock indexes in Europe closed broadly higher. U.S. stock indexes briefly headed higher, with technology companies among the big gainers, in what appeared to be a budding rebound for the market after it closed out May with its first monthly decline this year. But the slight gains evaporated as investors weighed the implications of a possible wave of heightened scrutiny on the market's biggest technology companies. Alphabet tumbled as media reports suggested it faces an antitrust investigation by the Justice Department. The company has faced a series of European regulatory investigations into its practices. In one instance last year, it was fined $5 billion by European regulators over contracts dealing with smartphone makers and the search engine's apps. The speculation over the latest investigation comes on top of a tough weekend for the company when high levels of network congestion caused outages for some of its services, including YouTube and Google Cloud. Reports also suggested the Justice Department would take the lead on any probe into Apple, while any antitrust investigations into Amazon and Facebook would come from the Federal Trade Commission. Reports say consumer groups and vendors have complained that Amazon is unfairly edging out competition as it expands its business and offerings. Declines by the big tech companies depressed their sectors for much of the day. Microsoft dropped 3.1% and Twitter slid 5.5%. The losses outweighed gains in household goods makers, banks and elsewhere in the market. Campbell Soup rose 2.9% and American International Group added 3.2%. The day of indecisive trading came amid a wave of volatility in the market as investors wrestle with the uncertainty of the U.S. and its growing use of tariffs in international trade disputes. Investors spent the bulk of May fleeing to safer holdings as a global trade war flared up. China and the U.S. have been escalating their trade dispute with more tariffs on each other's goods while also threatening to ban technology and resource sales. The U.S. expanded its trade war and threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican goods starting June 10 because of an immigration dispute. All of these moves have rattled investors' confidence in prospects for global economic growth. Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch lowered its earnings estimates for companies in the S&amp;P 500, citing trade tensions. Analysts have also warned that uncertainty over trade deals will crimp business confidence and keep companies from investing internationally. \"Things are likely to get worse before they get better,\" said a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN67708400</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8P-5F21-DYRV-4201-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"719\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Apple shed 1% on the day that the iPhone seller kicked off its annual software showcase. Amazon fell 4.6%. The four have a combined market value of nearly $3 trillion, and their losses helped tilt the S&amp;P 500 lower on a day when there were actually more gainers than losers in the stock market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors were reacting to media reports suggesting that government regulators are setting the stage for potential antitrust probes into each of the four technology giants.</p><p>The sell-off knocked the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index into a correction, Wall Street speak for a drop of 10% or more from a peak. The Nasdaq hit its most recent all-time high early last month, before the trade dispute between the U.S. and China escalated, setting off a monthlong slide.</p><p>\"We do have this trade uncertainty, and we now have some uncertainty with tech companies and government regulations,\" said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior markets strategist at Voya Investment Management. \"These are the go-to big names, and if they're vulnerable, that just makes investors a little bit nervous.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index fell 7.61 points, or 0.3%, to 2,744.45. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 4.74 points, or less than 0.1%, to 24,819.78.</p><p>The Nasdaq composite lost 120.13 points, or 1.6%, to 7,333.02. It's now down 10.2% from its all-time high set May 3.</p><p>The Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 4.50 points, or 0.3%, to 1,469.98.</p><p>Major stock indexes in Europe closed broadly higher.</p><p>U.S. stock indexes briefly headed higher, with technology companies among the big gainers, in what appeared to be a budding rebound for the market after it closed out May with its first monthly decline this year.</p><p>But the slight gains evaporated as investors weighed the implications of a possible wave of heightened scrutiny on the market's biggest technology companies.</p><p>Alphabet tumbled as media reports suggested it faces an antitrust investigation by the Justice Department.</p><p>The company has faced a series of European regulatory investigations into its practices. In one instance last year, it was fined $5 billion by European regulators over contracts dealing with smartphone makers and the search engine's apps.</p><p>The speculation over the latest investigation comes on top of a tough weekend for the company when high levels of network congestion caused outages for some of its services, including YouTube and Google Cloud.</p><p>Reports also suggested the Justice Department would take the lead on any probe into Apple, while any antitrust investigations into Amazon and Facebook would come from the Federal Trade Commission. Reports say consumer groups and vendors have complained that Amazon is unfairly edging out competition as it expands its business and offerings.</p><p>Declines by the big tech companies depressed their sectors for much of the day. Microsoft dropped 3.1% and Twitter slid 5.5%. The losses outweighed gains in household goods makers, banks and elsewhere in the market.</p><p>Campbell Soup rose 2.9% and American International Group added 3.2%.</p><p>The day of indecisive trading came amid a wave of volatility in the market as investors wrestle with the uncertainty of the U.S. and its growing use of tariffs in international trade disputes.</p><p>Investors spent the bulk of May fleeing to safer holdings as a global trade war flared up. China and the U.S. have been escalating their trade dispute with more tariffs on each other's goods while also threatening to ban technology and resource sales. The U.S. expanded its trade war and threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican goods starting June 10 because of an immigration dispute.</p><p>All of these moves have rattled investors' confidence in prospects for global economic growth. Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch lowered its earnings estimates for companies in the S&amp;P 500, citing trade tensions. Analysts have also warned that uncertainty over trade deals will crimp business confidence and keep companies from investing internationally.</p><p>\"Things are likely to get worse before they get better,\" said a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report.</p><p>The investment bank is recommending more caution from investors as trade disputes play out. Investors have already been heading to less-risky holdings, including utility stocks and bonds, since the trade dispute with China sharply escalated in May.</p><p>Companies in the S&amp;P 500 performed better than expected in the first quarter, posting less than a half-percentage point contraction in profit, according to Factset. But, the trade war continues hanging over the current quarter, with analysts expecting a 2% contraction in corporate profit.</p><p>Bond prices climbed again Monday, pulling the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down to 2.07% from 2.14% late Friday.</p><p>News of deals, confirmed and denied, drove movement for several stocks.</p><p>Cypress Semiconductor surged 23.8% on the announcement that German chipmaker Infineon is buying the company for more than $10 billion in cash. Cypress Semiconductors specializes in wireless and USB technology and Infineon said the deal with create the eighth biggest chipmaker in the world and a leading supplier of chips to the automotive sector.</p><p>Centene slid 10.3% after Humana declined to make a buyout proposal. Both insurance companies focus heavily on government-sponsored plans, including Medicare and Medicaid. Humana made clear that it is not seeking Centene in a rare filing aimed at quashing investor speculation. Humana shares rose 2.2%.</p><p>El Paso Electric jumped 13.5% after getting a $2.78 billion buyout offer from a private equity fund affiliated with J.P. Morgan.</p><p>Energy futures closed broadly lower Monday. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 0.5% to settle at $53.25 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, closed 1.1% lower at $61.28 per barrel.</p><p>Wholesale gasoline fell 1.7% to $1.74 per gallon. Heating oil dropped 1.8% to $1.81 per gallon. Natural gas gave up 2.1% to $2.40 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p><p>Gold gained 1.3% to $1,327.90 per ounce, silver added 1.2% to $14.74 per ounce and copper fell 0.4% to $2.65 per pound.</p><p>The dollar fell to 108.02 Japanese yen from 108.41 yen on Friday.

Apple shed 1% on the day that the iPhone seller kicked off its annual software showcase. Amazon fell 4.6%. The four have a combined market value of nearly $3 trillion, and their losses helped tilt the S&amp;P 500 lower on a day when there were actually more gainers than losers in the stock market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors were reacting to media reports suggesting that government regulators are setting the stage for potential antitrust probes into each of the four technology giants.</p><p>The sell-off knocked the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index into a correction, Wall Street speak for a drop of 10% or more from a peak. The Nasdaq hit its most recent all-time high early last month, before the trade dispute between the U.S. and China escalated, setting off a monthlong slide.</p><p>\"We do have this trade uncertainty, and we now have some uncertainty with tech companies and government regulations,\" said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior markets strategist at Voya Investment Management. \"These are the go-to big names, and if they're vulnerable, that just makes investors a little bit nervous.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index fell 7.61 points, or 0.3%, to 2,744.45.

Apple shed 1% on the day that the iPhone seller kicked off its annual software showcase. Amazon fell 4.6%. The four have a combined market value of nearly $3 trillion, and their losses helped tilt the S&amp;P 500 lower on a day when there were actually more gainers than losers in the stock market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors were reacting to media reports suggesting that government regulators are setting the stage for potential antitrust probes into each of the four technology giants.</p><p>The sell-off knocked the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index into a correction, Wall Street speak for a drop of 10% or more from a peak. The Nasdaq hit its most recent all-time high early last month, before the trade dispute between the U.S. and China escalated, setting off a monthlong slide.</p><p>\"We do have this trade uncertainty, and we now have some uncertainty with tech companies and government regulations,\" said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior markets strategist at Voya Investment Management. \"These are the go-to big names, and if they're vulnerable, that just makes investors a little bit nervous.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index fell 7.61 points, or 0.3%, to 2,744.45. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 4.74 points, or less than 0.1%, to 24,819.78.</p><p>The Nasdaq composite lost 120.13 points, or 1.6%, to 7,333.02. It's now down 10.2% from its all-time high set May 3.</p><p>The Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 4.50 points, or 0.3%, to 1,469.98.</p><p>Major stock indexes in Europe closed broadly higher.</p><p>U.S. stock indexes briefly headed higher, with technology companies among the big gainers, in what appeared to be a budding rebound for the market after it closed out May with its first monthly decline this year.</p><p>But the slight gains evaporated as investors weighed the implications of a possible wave of heightened scrutiny on the market's biggest technology companies.</p><p>Alphabet tumbled as media reports suggested it faces an antitrust investigation by the Justice Department.</p><p>The company has faced a series of European regulatory investigations into its practices. In one instance last year, it was fined $5 billion by European regulators over contracts dealing with smartphone makers and the search engine's apps.</p><p>The speculation over the latest investigation comes on top of a tough weekend for the company when high levels of network congestion caused outages for some of its services, including YouTube and Google Cloud.</p><p>Reports also suggested the Justice Department would take the lead on any probe into Apple, while any antitrust investigations into Amazon and Facebook would come from the Federal Trade Commission. Reports say consumer groups and vendors have complained that Amazon is unfairly edging out competition as it expands its business and offerings.</p><p>Declines by the big tech companies depressed their sectors for much of the day. Microsoft dropped 3.1% and Twitter slid 5.5%. The losses outweighed gains in household goods makers, banks and elsewhere in the market.</p><p>Campbell Soup rose 2.9% and American International Group added 3.2%.</p><p>The day of indecisive trading came amid a wave of volatility in the market as investors wrestle with the uncertainty of the U.S. and its growing use of tariffs in international trade disputes.</p><p>Investors spent the bulk of May fleeing to safer holdings as a global trade war flared up. China and the U.S. have been escalating their trade dispute with more tariffs on each other's goods while also threatening to ban technology and resource sales. The U.S. expanded its trade war and threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican goods starting June 10 because of an immigration dispute.</p><p>All of these moves have rattled investors' confidence in prospects for global economic growth. Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch lowered its earnings estimates for companies in the S&amp;P 500, citing trade tensions. Analysts have also warned that uncertainty over trade deals will crimp business confidence and keep companies from investing internationally.</p><p>\"Things are likely to get worse before they get better,\" said a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report.</p><p>The investment bank is recommending more caution from investors as trade disputes play out. Investors have already been heading to less-risky holdings, including utility stocks and bonds, since the trade dispute with China sharply escalated in May.</p><p>Companies in the S&amp;P 500 performed better than expected in the first quarter, posting less than a half-percentage point contraction in profit, according to Factset. But, the trade war continues hanging over the current quarter, with analysts expecting a 2% contraction in corporate profit.</p><p>Bond prices climbed again Monday, pulling the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down to 2.07% from 2.14% late Friday.</p><p>News of deals, confirmed and denied, drove movement for several stocks.</p><p>Cypress Semiconductor surged 23.8% on the announcement that German chipmaker Infineon is buying the company for more than $10 billion in cash. Cypress Semiconductors specializes in wireless and USB technology and Infineon said the deal with create the eighth biggest chipmaker in the world and a leading supplier of chips to the automotive sector.</p><p>Centene slid 10.3% after Humana declined to make a buyout proposal. Both insurance companies focus heavily on government-sponsored plans, including Medicare and Medicaid. Humana made clear that it is not seeking Centene in a rare filing aimed at quashing investor speculation. Humana shares rose 2.2%.</p><p>El Paso Electric jumped 13.5% after getting a $2.78 billion buyout offer from a private equity fund affiliated with J.P. Morgan.</p><p>Energy futures closed broadly lower Monday. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 0.5% to settle at $53.25 a barrel.

Natural gas gave up 2.1% to $2.40 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p><p>Gold gained 1.3% to $1,327.90 per ounce, silver added 1.2% to $14.74 per ounce and copper fell 0.4% to $2.65 per pound.</p><p>The dollar fell to 108.02 Japanese yen from 108.41 yen on Friday.

So his predecessor Jeroen Dijsselbloem really did give the game away earlier when he described Centeno as his successor, before the vote had even taken place..... It's official - no Brexit breakthrough today. The pound is now dropping back, after DUP leader (and Theresa May ally) Arlene Foster warned that her party wouldn't accept any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That could be a spanner in the works for May's Brexit breakthrough..... It has nudged sterling back below $1.35, and wiping out most of today's gains. Wall Street investors are hoping that a final tax deal can be done soon (ironing out differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives). Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, explains (via Marketwatch): \"Getting the tax plan done will still be a challenge, but it doesn't seem as impossible as it once did, and now there's optimism that it could happen before the end of the year, which means it could be made retroactive and change the liability for companies and individuals for this year as well as next, which would be a positive. Here's a sobering thought. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers has predicted that thousands of Americans will die early, if the tax changes approved by the Senate go through. CNBC has the details: About 10,000 Americans will die every year from lack of health coverage if the tax reform bill goes through as proposed, Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and White House economic advisor under Barack Obama, said Monday. Citing studies on what happens to people who go from being insured to uninsured, Summers said the estimate is likely conservative. \"I think this bill is very dangerous,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" program. \"When people lose health insurance, they're less likely to get preventive care, they're more likely to defer health care they need, and ultimately they're more likely to die.\" Reports are coming through that the Eurogroup has approved the policy package agreed over the weekend by Athens and its creditors. The county's leading daily, Kathimerini, says Euro group chairman, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, welcomed the deal ahead of the meeting telling the assembled media \"it was exceptional\" it had been agreed in time. The deal paves the way to Greece receiving fresh rescue funds from its current and third international bailout pushing the country inexorably towards self-finance when the (EURO)86bn rescue programme officially expires next August. Stocks are racing higher in New York, as traders cheer the US Senate's tax vote. The Dow Jones has now gained an impressive 300 points, or 1.2%, to 24,532. That shows that Wall Street is applauding the prospect of corporation tax being cut from 35% to around 20%. Walt Disney is the biggest gainer, up 3.8% (readers should insert their own joke about the financial markets being a Mickey Mouse operation). Aeroplane maker Boeing are up 3.3%, with financial stocks and basic materials companies also having a good day. Before we get carried away, let's remember that barely half of all Americans own stocks (either individual shares or through retirement accounts). Inevitably, they will be the wealthier members of society -- who are also in the front line to benefit from Trump's tax changes (as this charts showed). Gallup reported earlier this year that stock ownership has contracted since the financial crisis, especially among younger and less-wealthy Americans. But share ownership has held firm among Adults aged 65 and older and those with an annual household income of at least $100,000. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The Dow jumped by 244 points to 24,475, a gain of around 1%, as New York traders applaud the prospect of tax reform legislation hitting the statute book. The S&amp;P 500, which tracks a broader group of US companies, is also at record levels. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says corporate America approves of Trump's efforts: Tax reform is popular with US businesses. The proposed law could reduce corporate tax rates to 20% (compared to 35% currently) and cut individual taxes too. Today, the honour of ringing the Wall Street opening bell goes to Groupon, the deals website.... There's quite a festive mood on Wall Street today, partly thanks to the impressive Christmas tree outside the New York Stock Exchange. New York traders should prepare for a lively opening, when trading begins on Wall Street in 30 minutes. A fresh record high looks nailed on, following the Senate's tax approval vote. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explain: The Dow Jones is set to strap a rocket to its back after the bell, with the futures pointing to a 220 point surge. That'd leave the Dow at - what else - a fresh all time high of around 24450, already making last Friday's FBI-revelations inspired panic a distant memory. The pound has now hit a six-month high against a basket of currencies. Elsewhere in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are gathering for a eurogroup meeting. They'll be electing their next president, to succeed Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Officially it's a close contest, with four candidates throwing their caps into the ring: Although, the chat may be out of the sac.... It could also be a big day for Greece, with the leftist-led government presenting the deal it has reached in ongoing bailout negotiations with creditor. Athens officials hope for a warm reception from the euro group, marking the beginning of the end of international surveillance for debt-stricken Greece. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: With a compliance review completed in record time over the weekend, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tskakalotos will present the deal (referred to as staff level agreement) to euro area finance ministers today. The policy package, a key part of the country's third bailout programme review, must be approved by the euro group before another tranche of aid worth (EURO)5bn can be released to Greece. If rubber-stamped today - less than two months after talks began - the disbursement could be made in January. \"Although a lot of the measures are sensitive the real news is that the agreement was concluded in record time,\" said one insider. \"It is recognised that we are committed to exiting the [bailout] programme.\" It's not all plain sailing. Under the deal, which covered issues ranging from energy and labour market reforms, bad loans and privatisations and tax measures, Greece will have to implement around 100 'prior actions' or reforms by January. The demand that Athens presses ahead with more foreclosures - a necessary evil if banks are to deal with the highest non-performing loan ratio in the euro zone - is particularly sensitive. Many Greeks, unable to keep up with bank payments, fear they could lose their homes. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras' government is especially keen to wrap up the review (and negotiations more generally with creditors) so it can exit the (EURO)86bn bailout programme, the country's third, next summer. Only one more bailout review remains and once that is concluded debt relief talks can begin. The government is betting on debt relief helping it win a fresh term in office (despite lagging drastically in the polls). Here's a neat chart, showing how morale in Britain's construction and manufacturing sectors picked up in November. Tomorrow we discover if the service sector also had a good month. The pound has now hit a one-month high against the euro, at (EURO)1.1415, thanks to those reports of a deal over the Irish border. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, says investors are hoping for a significant Brexit breakthrough: \"It is understood that Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded ground to the EU around the Irish border and the final divorce bill for leaving the EU, which have been sticking points for both sides for months. Despite the fine details of a draft agreement unlikely to be resolved until next week, the pound will be buoyed by the news that, for the time being, it looks like the EU will vote in favour of progressing talks to the next phase.\" But.... there's confusion over whether Britain is really offering \"no divergence\" on regulations, as some MEPs said, or simply \"continued regulatory compliance\". The final decision will be crucial. The Guardian's Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day's main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market - and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The president is up, and predicting a Wall Street rally today: Sterling is pushing higher against the euro and the US dollar, following reports that Britain and the EU are close to a breakthrough. After a slow start, the pound is now up half a cent against the dollar at $1.352. Against the euro, it's gained three-quarters of a eurocent at (EURO)1.14. It follows reports that Britain has made a key concession over the Irish border. According to MEPs, the UK has offered no divergence between Northern Ireland the Republic over single market and customs union rules. Irish broadcaster RTE says it would have \"far-reaching implications\". But it's not clear that Northern Ireland's DUP party would accept it -- which is significant, as they're currently propping up Theresa May's government. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: The loudest complaint against Trump's tax 'reforms' is that the richest Americans will benefit the most. And yesterday, the bi-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed very clearly that this is true: Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned that the US budget deficit could spiral to $1 trillion by the end of the decade, thanks to Donald Trump's tax shake-up. He fears it will precede a squeeze on government spending, potentially hurting welfare spending. Economics lecturer Stephen Kinsella of Ireland's University of Limerick agrees that the fiscal axe will soon fall on US government spending. A bit of work still needs to be done before Donald Trump can sign off a tax reform bill. That's because the Senate and the House of Representatives (America's upper and lower chambers) have both passed different legislation. The two versions now need to be merged, starting today - creating an opportunity for lawmakers to raise objections. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: It is by no means a done deal given that the Senate bill is different to the one passed by Congress in November which means any final version is likely to be revised, and then passed by both houses, before being sent for signature by the President. What is unlikely to change are the headline numbers, which means that we can expect to see the corporation tax rate number reduced substantially from its current 35% to as low as 20%. After a stellar year, world stock markets are closing in on a new record -- $100 trillion! Over in New York, Wall Street traders will be waking up to predictions of another record-breaking open in four hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is forecast to jump by over 200 points, following the Senate's approval of US tax reforms over the weekend. It means the long rally since Trump's shock election win will continue.... Barbara Kollmeyer of Marketwatch puts it: The gains came as investors shifted their focus away from political tensions in Washington and cheered weekend news that Senate Republicans passed a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code..... Hopes that the Trump administration and Republicans would usher in a business-friendly tax overhaul have been a driver for the stock market's record-setting streak over the past year. The House and Senate now must agree on a single tax bill before it can be sent to Trump to sign. Blane Perrotton, managing director of the national surveyors Naismiths, says UK housebuilders are feeling more upbeat. \"After the Autumn Budget, developers feel like they have the Government behind them and that is further boosting confidence and activity levels. \"Residential development is certainly the most active it has been since before the Global Financial Crisis. \"On the frontline we're seeing a huge amount of activity, especially among small and mid-sized developers, who are making the most of the vastly increased finance options available. This jump in the UK's construction PMI is a little surprising, says Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Jones reckons confidence among builders is quite 'brittle, adding: \"Anecdotal feedback indicates that margins are coming under pressure with competition increasing amid the ongoing economic uncertainty. Larger firms also feel caught in the middle between clients pushing for fixed-price contracts and investors hungry for fatter margins. Construction bosses are also worried that the might struggle to find enough skilled labour after Brexit, Jones adds - although others are keen to invest in their UK workforce. Breaking: Britain's construction sector grew at its fastest rate in five months in November. Markit's latest PMI survey shows that housebuilding picked up last month, bringing some relief to Britain's builders after an autumn slowdown. That pushed the construction PMI up to 53.1, up from October's 50.8. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this is an encouraging signal. Here are the key findings: Residential work drives modest construction rebound in November Commercial and civil engineering activity continue to decline Business optimism picks up from October's near five-year low Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, blames political uncertainty for the slowdown in commercial construction activity and civil engineering work: \"UK construction companies experienced a solid yet uneven improvement in business conditions during November. Once again, resilient house building growth helped to offset lower volumes of commercial work and civil engineering activity. \"Survey respondents noted that residential projects underpinned the rebound in total new order growth to its strongest since June, helped by strong demand fundamentals and a supportive policy backdrop. \"Construction firms reported that heightened economic and political uncertainty continued to hold back commercial development activity. The latest drop in civil engineering was linked to a recent lack of tender opportunities for infrastructure-related projects. Trump's push to cut America's corporation from 35% to 20% could encourage US companies to repatriate some of their immense overseas cash piles. Fortune Magazine says this is a victory for tech giants, who have lobbied hard on this issue: Tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have for a long time balked at the 35% corporate tax the current tax code requires them to pay on worldwide profits returned to the U.S. To avoid paying, the companies have parked as much of their profit as possible in overseas subsidiaries in countries like Bermuda and Ireland, where tax rates are low. The Big 5 tech companies-Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft-currently have a combined $457 billion held in overseas subsidiaries. Apple holds more profits overseas than any other company, with Microsoft not far behind. More here: Big Tech's Lobbying Splurge Is About To Pay Off With The Tax Vote Europe's stock markets are recovering from Friday's shock news that former Trump advisor Michael Flynn had pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: \"European markets are playing catch up after closing at the depths of the Friday market meltdown on Michael Flynn concerns and embracing the weekend's senate tax bill success. The pro-business tax cuts look set to boost US economic growth and have provided further impetus for US and global valuations. Every sector of the FTSE 100 is up this morning. Multinational equipment rental firm Ashtead Group is leading the way, up 3.5%, followed by cruise company Carnival and plumbing and heating firm Ferguson. Ashtead and Ferguson both have big operations in America, so would benefit if Trump's tax reforms do deliver a growth burst. All the major European stock markets are up this morning, after the US Senate approved the tax reform package over the weekend. The German DAX is leading the charge, up over 1%, with Britain's FTSE 100 and the French CAC close behind. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: The U.S. Senate's approval to pass the tax cut bill on Saturday overshadowed the continuing investigation into connections between U.S. President's inner circle and Russia. The US dollar has jumped by 0.5% against a basket of currencies this morning, reports Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Europe and America are set to rally today, after Donald Trump took a massive step towards shaking up the US tax system. In Trump's first legislative triumph, the Senate finally passed the president's long-awaited tax reform bill. The move means the president can look forward to signing off a final bill on tax reform soon. The reforms include a hefty cut to US corporation tax, down from 35% to 20%, bringing America into line with other advanced economies. There are also sweeping changes to individual tax rates - which Trump claims will make people \"very, very happy'. But...the \"once-in-a-lifetime\" plan to cut taxes for \"average Americans\" has been criticised by experts who say it's a shameless giveaway of wealth to the richest 1%. Republicans claim that the $1.4tn package of cuts can be funded through growth; but an independent committee found it could add $1 trillion to the national debt. Democrats, though, slammed the changes as a giveaway to corporate America and the wealthy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declared: \"In the waning hours, this bill is tilting further towards businesses and away from families. \"Every time the choice is between corporations and families, the Republicans choose corporations.\" But the financial world is welcoming the Senate vote, despite the pressure building on the White House over links with Russia. Today, Wall Street is tipped to open strongly, possibly driving the Dow Jones to a new all-time high. The FTSE 100 has already reacted, jumping by 60 points to 7360 at the start of trading in London. But sterling is under pressure this morning as Theresa May heads to Brussels for crunch talks with the EU. The pound has shed almost half a cent at $1.343, amid reports that London and Dublin haven't (yet) reached an agreement on the Irish border. As my colleague Lisa O'Carroll reported last night: Theresa May and the Irish government have failed to reach a deal on the crucial Brexit issue of the Northern Ireland border ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday lunchtime with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Despite intense efforts over the weekend to agree a proposal on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, Irish officials revealed at midnight on Sunday that \"there is still a way to go\" to achieve a meeting of minds on the issue. But there could be plenty of drama in Brussels, as Britain pushes for a breakthrough that would pave the way for trade talks. Also coming up today, we get a new health check on Britain's builders (who have been struggling in recent months) plus the latest eurozone investor confidence index and US factory orders figures.

And who can blame traders? There's plenty of reasons to be cautious, frankly - the stalling Brexit talks, the Michael Flynn situation, and the ongoing North Korean tensions for starters. Plus the fact that stock valuations do look a little high..... So we'll find out tomorrow whether the Trump bump continues, or if markets take a breather. Until then, goodnight, and thanks for reading. GW NEWSFLASH! America's Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new record high, thanks to optimism over Donald Trump's tax reforms. But....the rally did threaten to fizzle out. In the end, the Dow only gained around 58 points to 24,290 - a gain of 0.25%. That takes the blue-chip index to a new closing peak, extending the rally sine Trump won the US presidential election 13 months ago. Tech stocks had a bad day, dragging the Nasdaq down. The S&amp;P 500 also lost its early sparkle, and closed a little lower. Traders may have decided to 'sell the news' and bank profits, especially with other issues swirling over the White House.... Now this wasn't in the script. With 15 minutes to go, the rally is running out of puff. The S&amp;P 500 is now pretty-much flat, and the Dow is shedding some of its gains too - now up just 0.3%. The tech selloff seems to be responsible. Technology stocks are still refusing to join the rally. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down almost 1% today, partly due to big names like PayPal (down 5.8%), Adobe (down 5.6%) and NVIDIA (down 5.1%). The chatter on Wall Street is that investors are moving out of tech, and into financial stocks, consumer-focused companies and industrial companies today. With around 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is toying with a new closing high. The Dow is up 160 points at 24,391, as traders keep giving the tax reforms push a thumbs-up (despite the reservations we've already flagged up). Disney is the top riser, up almost 5%. That's due to reports that talks have resumed with Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox to buy some of Fox's entertainment assets. Boeing are next on the Dow risers chart, up 3%, followed by chemicals giant DowDuPont (+2.6%) and JPMorgan Chase (+2.5%). Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, isn't terribly impressed by today's stock market rally. It's all so terribly short term, he writes... Once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Here's Nils' column: The US stock market rally could head even higher, if the two houses of Congress can agree a final tax bill. Mike Bell of JP Morgan believes the tax trade has more legs, adding (via the FT): We estimate that the market is only pricing in about a 50% probability of tax cuts and that if a tax plan is finalised this would push US equities higher. The Dow Jones continues to enjoy a good day, up around 200 points at 24,430. Financial stocks are still leading the charge, up 1.7%. But tech stocks aren't coming to the party. Facebook and Google are both down 0.5% while Microsoft has shed 2%. European stock markets have closed higher tonight, led by Germany: The eurozone's finance ministers have elected a new leader - Portugal's Mario Centeno. So his predecessor Jeroen Dijsselbloem really did give the game away earlier when he described Centeno as his successor, before the vote had even taken place..... It's official - no Brexit breakthrough today. The pound is now dropping back, after DUP leader (and Theresa May ally) Arlene Foster warned that her party wouldn't accept any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That could be a spanner in the works for May's Brexit breakthrough..... It has nudged sterling back below $1.35, and wiping out most of today's gains. Wall Street investors are hoping that a final tax deal can be done soon (ironing out differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives). Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, explains (via Marketwatch): \"Getting the tax plan done will still be a challenge, but it doesn't seem as impossible as it once did, and now there's optimism that it could happen before the end of the year, which means it could be made retroactive and change the liability for companies and individuals for this year as well as next, which would be a positive. Here's a sobering thought. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers has predicted that thousands of Americans will die early, if the tax changes approved by the Senate go through. CNBC has the details: About 10,000 Americans will die every year from lack of health coverage if the tax reform bill goes through as proposed, Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and White House economic advisor under Barack Obama, said Monday. Citing studies on what happens to people who go from being insured to uninsured, Summers said the estimate is likely conservative. \"I think this bill is very dangerous,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" program. \"When people lose health insurance, they're less likely to get preventive care, they're more likely to defer health care they need, and ultimately they're more likely to die.\" Reports are coming through that the Eurogroup has approved the policy package agreed over the weekend by Athens and its creditors. The county's leading daily, Kathimerini, says Euro group chairman, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, welcomed the deal ahead of the meeting telling the assembled media \"it was exceptional\" it had been agreed in time. The deal paves the way to Greece receiving fresh rescue funds from its current and third international bailout pushing the country inexorably towards self-finance when the (EURO)86bn rescue programme officially expires next August. Stocks are racing higher in New York, as traders cheer the US Senate's tax vote. The Dow Jones has now gained an impressive 300 points, or 1.2%, to 24,532. That shows that Wall Street is applauding the prospect of corporation tax being cut from 35% to around 20%. Walt Disney is the biggest gainer, up 3.8% (readers should insert their own joke about the financial markets being a Mickey Mouse operation). Aeroplane maker Boeing are up 3.3%, with financial stocks and basic materials companies also having a good day. Before we get carried away, let's remember that barely half of all Americans own stocks (either individual shares or through retirement accounts). Inevitably, they will be the wealthier members of society -- who are also in the front line to benefit from Trump's tax changes (as this charts showed). Gallup reported earlier this year that stock ownership has contracted since the financial crisis, especially among younger and less-wealthy Americans. But share ownership has held firm among Adults aged 65 and older and those with an annual household income of at least $100,000. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The Dow jumped by 244 points to 24,475, a gain of around 1%, as New York traders applaud the prospect of tax reform legislation hitting the statute book. The S&amp;P 500, which tracks a broader group of US companies, is also at record levels. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says corporate America approves of Trump's efforts: Tax reform is popular with US businesses. The proposed law could reduce corporate tax rates to 20% (compared to 35% currently) and cut individual taxes too. Today, the honour of ringing the Wall Street opening bell goes to Groupon, the deals website.... There's quite a festive mood on Wall Street today, partly thanks to the impressive Christmas tree outside the New York Stock Exchange. New York traders should prepare for a lively opening, when trading begins on Wall Street in 30 minutes. A fresh record high looks nailed on, following the Senate's tax approval vote. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explain: The Dow Jones is set to strap a rocket to its back after the bell, with the futures pointing to a 220 point surge. That'd leave the Dow at - what else - a fresh all time high of around 24450, already making last Friday's FBI-revelations inspired panic a distant memory. The pound has now hit a six-month high against a basket of currencies. Elsewhere in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are gathering for a eurogroup meeting. They'll be electing their next president, to succeed Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Officially it's a close contest, with four candidates throwing their caps into the ring: Although, the chat may be out of the sac.... It could also be a big day for Greece, with the leftist-led government presenting the deal it has reached in ongoing bailout negotiations with creditor. Athens officials hope for a warm reception from the euro group, marking the beginning of the end of international surveillance for debt-stricken Greece. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: With a compliance review completed in record time over the weekend, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tskakalotos will present the deal (referred to as staff level agreement) to euro area finance ministers today. The policy package, a key part of the country's third bailout programme review, must be approved by the euro group before another tranche of aid worth (EURO)5bn can be released to Greece. If rubber-stamped today - less than two months after talks began - the disbursement could be made in January. \"Although a lot of the measures are sensitive the real news is that the agreement was concluded in record time,\" said one insider. \"It is recognised that we are committed to exiting the [bailout] programme.\" It's not all plain sailing. Under the deal, which covered issues ranging from energy and labour market reforms, bad loans and privatisations and tax measures, Greece will have to implement around 100 'prior actions' or reforms by January. The demand that Athens presses ahead with more foreclosures - a necessary evil if banks are to deal with the highest non-performing loan ratio in the euro zone - is particularly sensitive. Many Greeks, unable to keep up with bank payments, fear they could lose their homes. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras' government is especially keen to wrap up the review (and negotiations more generally with creditors) so it can exit the (EURO)86bn bailout programme, the country's third, next summer. Only one more bailout review remains and once that is concluded debt relief talks can begin. The government is betting on debt relief helping it win a fresh term in office (despite lagging drastically in the polls). Here's a neat chart, showing how morale in Britain's construction and manufacturing sectors picked up in November. Tomorrow we discover if the service sector also had a good month. The pound has now hit a one-month high against the euro, at (EURO)1.1415, thanks to those reports of a deal over the Irish border. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, says investors are hoping for a significant Brexit breakthrough: \"It is understood that Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded ground to the EU around the Irish border and the final divorce bill for leaving the EU, which have been sticking points for both sides for months. Despite the fine details of a draft agreement unlikely to be resolved until next week, the pound will be buoyed by the news that, for the time being, it looks like the EU will vote in favour of progressing talks to the next phase.\" But.... there's confusion over whether Britain is really offering \"no divergence\" on regulations, as some MEPs said, or simply \"continued regulatory compliance\". The final decision will be crucial. The Guardian's Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day's main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market - and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The president is up, and predicting a Wall Street rally today: Sterling is pushing higher against the euro and the US dollar, following reports that Britain and the EU are close to a breakthrough. After a slow start, the pound is now up half a cent against the dollar at $1.352. Against the euro, it's gained three-quarters of a eurocent at (EURO)1.14. It follows reports that Britain has made a key concession over the Irish border. According to MEPs, the UK has offered no divergence between Northern Ireland the Republic over single market and customs union rules. Irish broadcaster RTE says it would have \"far-reaching implications\". But it's not clear that Northern Ireland's DUP party would accept it -- which is significant, as they're currently propping up Theresa May's government. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: The loudest complaint against Trump's tax 'reforms' is that the richest Americans will benefit the most. And yesterday, the bi-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed very clearly that this is true: Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned that the US budget deficit could spiral to $1 trillion by the end of the decade, thanks to Donald Trump's tax shake-up. He fears it will precede a squeeze on government spending, potentially hurting welfare spending. Economics lecturer Stephen Kinsella of Ireland's University of Limerick agrees that the fiscal axe will soon fall on US government spending. A bit of work still needs to be done before Donald Trump can sign off a tax reform bill. That's because the Senate and the House of Representatives (America's upper and lower chambers) have both passed different legislation. The two versions now need to be merged, starting today - creating an opportunity for lawmakers to raise objections. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: It is by no means a done deal given that the Senate bill is different to the one passed by Congress in November which means any final version is likely to be revised, and then passed by both houses, before being sent for signature by the President. What is unlikely to change are the headline numbers, which means that we can expect to see the corporation tax rate number reduced substantially from its current 35% to as low as 20%. After a stellar year, world stock markets are closing in on a new record -- $100 trillion! Over in New York, Wall Street traders will be waking up to predictions of another record-breaking open in four hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is forecast to jump by over 200 points, following the Senate's approval of US tax reforms over the weekend. It means the long rally since Trump's shock election win will continue.... Barbara Kollmeyer of Marketwatch puts it: The gains came as investors shifted their focus away from political tensions in Washington and cheered weekend news that Senate Republicans passed a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code..... Hopes that the Trump administration and Republicans would usher in a business-friendly tax overhaul have been a driver for the stock market's record-setting streak over the past year. The House and Senate now must agree on a single tax bill before it can be sent to Trump to sign. Blane Perrotton, managing director of the national surveyors Naismiths, says UK housebuilders are feeling more upbeat. \"After the Autumn Budget, developers feel like they have the Government behind them and that is further boosting confidence and activity levels. \"Residential development is certainly the most active it has been since before the Global Financial Crisis. \"On the frontline we're seeing a huge amount of activity, especially among small and mid-sized developers, who are making the most of the vastly increased finance options available. This jump in the UK's construction PMI is a little surprising, says Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Jones reckons confidence among builders is quite 'brittle, adding: \"Anecdotal feedback indicates that margins are coming under pressure with competition increasing amid the ongoing economic uncertainty. Larger firms also feel caught in the middle between clients pushing for fixed-price contracts and investors hungry for fatter margins. Construction bosses are also worried that the might struggle to find enough skilled labour after Brexit, Jones adds - although others are keen to invest in their UK workforce. Breaking: Britain's construction sector grew at its fastest rate in five months in November. Markit's latest PMI survey shows that housebuilding picked up last month, bringing some relief to Britain's builders after an autumn slowdown. That pushed the construction PMI up to 53.1, up from October's 50.8. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this is an encouraging signal. Here are the key findings: Residential work drives modest construction rebound in November Commercial and civil engineering activity continue to decline Business optimism picks up from October's near five-year low Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, blames political uncertainty for the slowdown in commercial construction activity and civil engineering work: \"UK construction companies experienced a solid yet uneven improvement in business conditions during November. Once again, resilient house building growth helped to offset lower volumes of commercial work and civil engineering activity. \"Survey respondents noted that residential projects underpinned the rebound in total new order growth to its strongest since June, helped by strong demand fundamentals and a supportive policy backdrop. \"Construction firms reported that heightened economic and political uncertainty continued to hold back commercial development activity. The latest drop in civil engineering was linked to a recent lack of tender opportunities for infrastructure-related projects. Trump's push to cut America's corporation from 35% to 20% could encourage US companies to repatriate some of their immense overseas cash piles. Fortune Magazine says this is a victory for tech giants, who have lobbied hard on this issue: Tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have for a long time balked at the 35% corporate tax the current tax code requires them to pay on worldwide profits returned to the U.S. To avoid paying, the companies have parked as much of their profit as possible in overseas subsidiaries in countries like Bermuda and Ireland, where tax rates are low. The Big 5 tech companies-Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft-currently have a combined $457 billion held in overseas subsidiaries. Apple holds more profits overseas than any other company, with Microsoft not far behind. More here: Big Tech's Lobbying Splurge Is About To Pay Off With The Tax Vote Europe's stock markets are recovering from Friday's shock news that former Trump advisor Michael Flynn had pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: \"European markets are playing catch up after closing at the depths of the Friday market meltdown on Michael Flynn concerns and embracing the weekend's senate tax bill success. The pro-business tax cuts look set to boost US economic growth and have provided further impetus for US and global valuations. Every sector of the FTSE 100 is up this morning. Multinational equipment rental firm Ashtead Group is leading the way, up 3.5%, followed by cruise company Carnival and plumbing and heating firm Ferguson. Ashtead and Ferguson both have big operations in America, so would benefit if Trump's tax reforms do deliver a growth burst. All the major European stock markets are up this morning, after the US Senate approved the tax reform package over the weekend. The German DAX is leading the charge, up over 1%, with Britain's FTSE 100 and the French CAC close behind. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: The U.S. Senate's approval to pass the tax cut bill on Saturday overshadowed the continuing investigation into connections between U.S. President's inner circle and Russia. The US dollar has jumped by 0.5% against a basket of currencies this morning, reports Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Europe and America are set to rally today, after Donald Trump took a massive step towards shaking up the US tax system. In Trump's first legislative triumph, the Senate finally passed the president's long-awaited tax reform bill. The move means the president can look forward to signing off a final bill on tax reform soon. The reforms include a hefty cut to US corporation tax, down from 35% to 20%, bringing America into line with other advanced economies. There are also sweeping changes to individual tax rates - which Trump claims will make people \"very, very happy'. But...the \"once-in-a-lifetime\" plan to cut taxes for \"average Americans\" has been criticised by experts who say it's a shameless giveaway of wealth to the richest 1%. Republicans claim that the $1.4tn package of cuts can be funded through growth; but an independent committee found it could add $1 trillion to the national debt. Democrats, though, slammed the changes as a giveaway to corporate America and the wealthy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declared: \"In the waning hours, this bill is tilting further towards businesses and away from families. \"Every time the choice is between corporations and families, the Republicans choose corporations.\" But the financial world is welcoming the Senate vote, despite the pressure building on the White House over links with Russia. Today, Wall Street is tipped to open strongly, possibly driving the Dow Jones to a new all-time high. The FTSE 100 has already reacted, jumping by 60 points to 7360 at the start of trading in London. But sterling is under pressure this morning as Theresa May heads to Brussels for crunch talks with the EU. The pound has shed almost half a cent at $1.343, amid reports that London and Dublin haven't (yet) reached an agreement on the Irish border. As my colleague Lisa O'Carroll reported last night: Theresa May and the Irish government have failed to reach a deal on the crucial Brexit issue of the Northern Ireland border ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday lunchtime with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Despite intense efforts over the weekend to agree a proposal on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, Irish officials revealed at midnight on Sunday that \"there is still a way to go\" to achieve a meeting of minds on the issue. But there could be plenty of drama in Brussels, as Britain pushes for a breakthrough that would pave the way for trade talks. Also coming up today, we get a new health check on Britain's builders (who have been struggling in recent months) plus the latest eurozone investor confidence index and US factory orders figures.

Good evening to all of you. Welcome to Washington. I`m Shannon Bream in for Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, U.S. stock markets are back in positive territory as China stabilizes its currency following a massive drop Monday amid fears of a major escalation in the trade war between the world`s two largest economies.</p><p>The Dow gained 312. The S&amp;P 500 finished ahead 37. NASDAQ surged 107. Also, tonight, President Trump is preparing to visit the sites of the weekend`s mass shootings in Ohio and Texas that left 31 people dead. Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts starts us off tonight. Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good evening to you. President Trump will be out of the White House early tomorrow to travel to meet with first responders, law enforcement and some of the victims of the shooting. But there was a lot of debate tonight among elected officials whether he should be even making the trip</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: With President Trump heading to El Paso and Dayton tomorrow. The White House today pushing back against critics linking the President`s rhetoric to the El Paso shooting.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: There are plenty of people in this country who commit acts of evil in the name of politicians, of celebrities and all types of things. It`s not the politicians` fault when someone acts out their evil intention.</p><p>ROBERTS: The Vice President today doubling down on the President`s condemnation of hate.</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Hate has no place in America. And the sinister ideologies of racism, bigotry and White Supremacy must be defeated.</p><p>ROBERTS: El Paso`s Republican Mayor says, he will greet the President but as part of the duty of his office. Dayton`s Democratic Mayor says, she will meet the President but appeared less than thrilled at the prospect.</p><p>MAYOR NAN WHALEY (D-OH): He`s made this bed and he`s got to lie in it. You know he hasn`t - his rhetoric has been painful for many in our community. And I think that people should stand up and say they`re not happy, if they`re not happy that he`s coming.</p><p>ROBERTS: White House officials today making the point that Dayton`s shooter posted Left-wing ideology on Twitter and no one is blaming Democrats for his actions.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: I`m hopping mad this morning because I see very little scant coverage of the fact that this Dayton shooter has been confirmed as having a Twitter feed that was supportive of ANTIFA, that was supportive of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders. Obviously, nine, 10 years ago in high school, he had a kill list for boys, a rape list for girls and there is scant attention being paid to this.</p><p>ROBERTS: The White House today also moving to stay ahead of the deteriorating trade relationship with China. Chief Economic Adviser, Larry Kudlow remaining optimistic.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: The door is open for additional negotiations. We are planning for the Chinese team to come here in September.</p><p>ROBERTS: But China has indicated it will not go back to concessions it had agreed to in the spring then reneged on. Instead it would end imports of all U.S. agricultural products, a move farmer say could be disastrous.</p><p>DALE MOORE, AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION: It is a body blow and I don`t know any other way to describe it. It is a punch in the gut that it`s just taking away one of the most important and largest markets that we`ve spent decades developing.</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump today insisting he will protect farmers tweeting as they have learned in the last two years, our great American farmers know that China will not be able to hurt them and that their President has stood with them and done what no other President would do. And I`ll do it again next year if necessary.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, the stock market today clawed back only a little more than a third of yesterday`s losses, investors did find some other reasons for optimism thinking that continued trade turmoil with China may lead to another Fed rate cut sometime in September. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, we`ll hit all these topics with the panel coming up. John Roberts live at the White House. Thank you.</p><p>Authorities in Ohio and Texas are trying to piece together what happened and why during the weekend carnage. The back-to-back shootings. 1300 miles apart leave 31 dead. We continue our coverage tonight with Correspondent Jeff Paul in El Paso</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: They started their school year like no one imagined with the loss of one of their own.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s unfair, he was too young.</p><p>PAUL: Just 15 years old, Javier Amir Rodriguez (ph) is the youngest murdered in the El Paso shooting. He was shopping with his uncle Octavio Ramiro Lizarde when the shots erupted.</p><p>OCTAVIO RAMIRO LIZARDE, SHOOTING VICTIM: I just feel grateful that I am alive. He had the chance to kill me, but he didn`t.</p><p>PAUL: Octavio speaking from the hospital today was hit in the foot. But the gunfire that struck his nephew was fatal.</p><p>LIZARDE: It was my nephew. Right in front of me. I won`t go to details, but it was horrible image.

Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: Mike Tobin on the scene. Thank you. Democrats and some of the mainstream media are targeting The New York Times in their continued condemnation of President Trump. At issue today, a headline. Many of the critics say wasn`t originally tough enough. Fox News Media Analyst and Host of Fox Media Buzz, Howard Kurtz shows us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and White Supremacy.</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS CORRESPODENT: That was the main thrust of President Trump`s speech yesterday after the weekend`s mass shootings reflected in The New York Times front page headline, Trump urges unity versus racism. But for some critics on the Left, accurately citing the President was unacceptable.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the headline a reminder of how White Supremacy is aided by the cowardice of mainstream institutions. The headline was changed today after the first edition to assailing hate, but not guns.</p><p>Times Editor Dean Baquet told Politico, he changed it not because of Democratic complaints, but because it was a bad headline. Though some liberals denounced the second version. The nation`s Joan Walsh, the only accurate headline would be a sailing White Supremacist hate, but not his own. Former CNN anchor Soledad O`Brien, he should be ashamed of printing this crap.</p><p>The President does not, in fact, assail Haiti, fans the flames and inspires White Supremacists. The tragic shootings in El Paso and Dayton are fueling a media frenzy in which there is no longer a debate about whether Trump`s sometimes divisive rhetoric is encouraging racism and White Supremacy. It simply stated as fact.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president reading off of a teleprompter condemned racism. He condemned White Supremacy. But at rallies, in his tweets, he says things that fuel those beliefs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He is inciting hatred and inciting violence, inciting racism. This is a President who seems to want these things to happen.</p><p>KURTZ: It`s Trump, not the liberals who often brands The New York Times fake news, just as he`s gone after CNN, NBC, The Washington Post and at times, Fox News, such as after our recent unfavorable poll.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: President Trump is fair game for criticism over his attacks on minority lawmakers, big cities and illegal immigration.

Gavel the Senate into an emergency session we can take immediate action on the bipartisan, already passed gun legislation.</p><p>REP. PETE KING, (R-NY): All this legislation does is basically say that people who are criminals, people who have been adjudged mental patients, have mental issues, and people who are spousal abusers or guilty of domestic violence will not be able to purchase guns.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: He has said he is looking at background checks. He also has given credence and a very strong look to the red flag legislation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: OK, so let`s bring in our panel to talk about that, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist.\" Byron, I`ll start with you. What is the appetite for any of this getting done on Capitol Hill?</p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Congress has a really long history of not doing anything after these shootings, no matter how horrible they were. It does appear that there`s growing support for these red flag laws. And this is not for Congress to pass a national red flag law, but to pass a law encouraging states to pass their own red flag laws.</p><p>BREAM: Some grant money. Some funding to --</p><p>YORK: Some grant money to do so. It`s not clear whether it would actually help in this mass shooting problem. Certainly, it appeared to be an issue in the Parkland shooting. Actually, experts say it would help a lot more preventing suicides, which is a good goal as well. But beyond that, as far as the background checks that you just heard about are concerned, Democrats are saying in the House we have passed it, it`s in the Senate. Mitch McConnell should call the Senate back to pass it immediately. In February, President Trump issued a veto threat of this bill. He wrote it down and put it out. It`s an actual threat to this bill. It would have to be some sort of different bill for Republicans even to think about it.</p><p>BREAM: Amy, do these circumstances change the dynamics now with the president himself talking about and his staff talking about possible executive actions? He definitely must feel the need to get something done.</p><p>AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": And where the pressure is coming from, right. We know that in politics the pressure, first it comes on to the individual members of Congress from their individual districts. And when you look back at the history of gun policy, the last time we really had bipartisan legislation on this was back in the 90s, and that was also the time when we had moderate Republicans who were from the northeast and from suburban areas, and we had conservative Democrats who voted against then President Clinton on the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill from the south and from rural areas.</p><p>The realignment over last 25 years has meant that there really aren`t any Democrats left in rural America, and there aren`t many if any Republicans left in those suburban, urban area. And so where the pressure is coming is from the places that have already flopped. So they are pressuring Democrats to do something, which would be Republicans in those districts to do something. Now those are Democratic districts. And Byron is right about the Senate, the challenge there is a presidential veto and the filibuster, which those two things are very difficult, especially when you know that rural states do have significant influence when you need 60 votes.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>Mollie, I want to ask you about something we noted at 11:00 last night when this started bubbling up. \"The New York Times\" had a headlight out originally talking about the president had in his speech in the morning. It said \"Trump urges unity versus racism.\" Then there were all kinds of tweets from 2020 Democratic contenders, Beto O`Rourke saying \"Unbelievable,\" Cory Booker, \"Literally lives depended on you doing better, \"New York Times.\" Please do.\" Kirsten Gillibrand, \"That is not what happened.\" Then the updated headline was \"Assailing hate, but not guns.\" And there were a number of folks on the left who that wasn`t good enough for them either.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Clearly, the first headline was more factual and less opiniony than the second headline, which was not a very well constructed headline.</p><p>More interesting, I think, is that \"The New York Times\" was bullied and pressured by an online mob consisting of a lot of journalists to take that factual headline and change it into something else to fit a narrative that has been promoted by a lot of people. You hear a lot of people asserting things about Donald Trump without actually showing their work or showing evidence in support of it. But it can be scary to watch media companies or corporations like \"The New York Times\" fall prey to these type of online mobs.</p><p>BREAM: OK, so as this continues to play out, the president has got some foreign policy issues to deal with as well, primarily this issue of the escalating trade war, now, could it be a currency war with China. The president tweeting today after some, Dianne Feinstein, top Democrat in the Senate, who has talked about farmers in her state in California are going to get hit hard by this. He says, \"Massive amounts of money from China and other parts of the world is pouring into the United States for reasons of safety, investment, and interest rates. We are in a very strong position. Companies are also coming into the U.S. in big numbers, a beautiful thing to watch.\" He also talked about American farmers, saying they know that I`m going to stick up for them. I`m the person to do it. Byron?</p><p>YORK: This has really escalated, and we knew or should have known that it was going to happen this way. China has been abusing its trade relationship with the United States for a very long time, forced technology transfers, currency manipulation, all sorts of things. Stopping it was not going to be easy.</p><p>And I think there are two important things to watch now that this trade war has morphed sort of into a currency war, it could get even bigger and uglier. Two things to watch. One, those farmers. We have had indications that a lot of Americans support, a lot of American farmers support the president on this because they know somebody had to do something about the way China was behaving. Will that stay? And will Chuck Schumer continue to stay? The Senate minority leader has been a vocal supporter of the president on China specifically, and also of declaring China a currency manipulator. So we`ll see if his good friend from New York can hang with him.</p><p>BREAM: Chuck Schumer has urged him openly, you need to be tougher on China. We`re with you on this.</p><p>WALTER: It`s interesting, I was in China at the end of last year, and what I was picking up from being there was there was a lot of pressure on President Xi then to be tougher on Trump. They felt like he was rolling over and getting pushed around by Trump.</p><p>A lot of the folks there in the business community like the idea actually of better trade relations, of course, with the U.S., even some of the things that the U.S. is asking for. But as a leader Xi has to be very careful with his own party and his own political standing not to look like he is getting bullied. And so I think what we have now is this very intense standoff with neither man blinking. And I think Byron is right, too. The bottom line isn`t even so much what happened in the agricultural community, but if indeed consumers start to feel a pinch and if there is an impact on the economy, the Chinese are hoping that we blink first because there is an election coming up much sooner.</p><p>BREAM: Right. They don`t have a reelection next year, their president. And Larry Kudlow saying today, consumer spending is up. It`s one of the real bright points right now in the economy that has a lot of bright points. And so he doesn`t think that it`s impacting the way Americans view this back and forth yet.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And yesterday was a very scary day. It was a big drop in the Dow, and people are very concerned with it. Today was a much better day.</p><p>I think there is a way to interpret what happened yesterday with the currency devaluation and not a show of strength for China. They are really struggling to figure out how to manage this process, and the U.S. seems to think that maybe this is now the time to squeeze them a bit more. You talk about what people thought about China not being strong enough. We did have a deal with them, and they backed away from it in part because they wanted to save face. And that didn`t work out well for them. We didn`t get the deal. But as time goes on, everybody is going to want to get on the same page.</p><p>BREAM: Find some kind of resolution. You are right, the markets had some rebound today we noted that at the top of the show. And the administration continues to say that there are meeting still planned in September, so we will see as we move forward.</p><p>Next up, by the way, President Trump versus Google.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, GOOGLE CEO: I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. We are a company that provides platforms for diverse perspectives and opinions, and there are no shortage of them amongst our employees.</p><p>KEVIN CERNEKEE, FORMER GOOGLE ENGINEER: When President Trump won in 2016, Google executives went up on stage right away and cried, literally tears streaming down their faces over the fact that President Trump won. They vowed that it would never happen again. When I joined Google, I saw a lot of conservative employees being mistreated. They were being harassed. They were being threatened. They were being blacklisted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: We are back with our panel to discuss the president versus Google. Mollie, I`ll start with you. Today the president said he is watching Google very closely.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And I`m not sure exactly what that means.</p><p>BREAM: Don`t know either.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Or what proposals people have in mind. The idea, though, that Google is not beset by systematic bias is absurd. This is something that people have been able to witness for a long time, whether it`s not allowing certain ads for certain political causes, de-platforming people. There are all sorts of structural problems built into the algorithms made by their largely liberal workforce, or almost exclusively liberal workforce. And it is a big issue, and that type of censorship that is coming from corporations is something that people are rightly concerned about.</p><p>BREAM: Amy, today, a number of groups and outlets reporting on this, saying the president is essentially making accusations without anything to back up what he`s saying, the fact that there could be bias against conservatives or specifically against him. But certainly he looks at the at the anecdotal data, like 95 percent of donations from Google employees last year were to Democratic candidates in the midterms. That`s got to give him a little fuel for his fire.</p><p>WALTER: I guess so. But are we going to go to every company in America and say let`s look at the donations that you`ve given? Obviously, this is a search engine, so it`s different than, say, an energy company or something. But the fact is when I talk to people who study this and cybersecurity and the issues of the Internet, the number one thing they are concerned about is how effectively misinformation is built in. If you want to talk about a bias in algorithms, there is a bias in there, and it has been exploited. And the challenge going forward for the Google, the Facebook, everybody in this community is to figure out how to root out the disinformation that is spreading and is allowing conspiracy theories to take hold. And that is a lot more dangerous, I think, than whether or not what percent of people who work at Google are donating to Democrats or feel that they`re liberal.</p><p>This is a very popular thing for the president to say for his base because basically Google and all of big tech are saying we are on the left. We`re almost 100 percent on the left, but we are playing this straight down the middle. You all can trust us. And I think the president`s base certainly just doesn`t believe that. But I think the bigger questions for big tech right now are their fears about privacy and antitrust, and what is going to be done at the capital about that.</p><p>And to the degree that Republicans believe that big tech is putting its thumb on the scale against conservatives or against Republicans, their problems on those issues of privacy and antitrust get more serious.</p><p>WALTER: They are on the left. It`s Elizabeth Warren who wants to break up big tech, and is actually doing more to mess with their business model than anybody on the Republican side.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Also, you said that the big threat would be proliferation of conspiracy theories. The big threat might be also tamping down some of those, how we handle that. We have conspiracy theories that have beset this entire country over the last couple of years, some of them promulgated by people within the media, and they were allowed to fester and spread. If you start limiting speech from individuals while privileging the false information that is coming from people who are supposed to be trustworthy, that`s a very dangerous situation that could blow up as well.</p><p>WALTER: Yes. But we have also seen Pizza-gate. So to say that there`s conspiracies that are only --</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Very back to take part in conspiracy theories without evidence.</p><p>WALTER: The challenge is these take hold because they are believable enough. They are conspiracy theories that are not believable to most people, but they are believable enough because of the way that all of us are taking in media. We already come in with a certain level of bias. But this idea that the big issue is certain views -- it`s the same thing about \"The New York Times\" headline.</p><p>I think the frustration for so many is that voters aren`t behaving the way the partisans would like them to behave given what the news is. How can you think this way? Don`t you know if you just change the headline people would change their opinions. If you just change the algorithm, voters would have a different opinion about this. Trusting people to make their own decisions based on what they are getting is the most important piece of this.</p><p>BREAM: Byron, of course, what the president is saying is they are not getting accurate information. That`s his accusation.</p><p>YORK: That is right. The striking thing about the \"New York Times\" headline flap was the degree to which many people in the Democratic Party on the left felt like this is our bulletin board, and you are not playing by the right rules. And I think to a certain degree many people on the left feel the same about big tech. And what happens, I think, when big is under attack for bias, is they retreat to safety and say, well, we will use sources from \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post,\" which of course increases the accusations of bias from conservatives. They`re in a semi no-win situation there.</p><p>BREAM: And as you said, Amy, this comes from the left and the right. I interviewed Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard after the debate last week. We were there with her in Detroit, and she talked about how after the first debate, she had a real spike where people were searching for her, one of the biggest names, what is she doing? She claims that Google hurt their ability for the ads to air during that time period. She is suing them. So they are people on the left and the right who are saying that this is a problem. If Google decides your voice is the one they want to silence, that`s the accusation. It doesn`t matter if you`re a conservative or liberal.</p><p>WALTER: It is ridiculous that the regulation, it is still the wild west when it comes to regulation on this. We have figured out T.V. over the years and how to regulate that. We still haven`t figured out how to do this correctly.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and Mollie, we have the conversation that some of these tech companies are hinting that they do want to be regulated. They want to know where the boundaries are.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: They want to be regulated in part because they have such market control that they know that they can handle regulation, but that upstarts wouldn`t be able to handle that same level of regulation. That makes them very friendly toward working with the regulators to see how they can keep competitors out.</p><p>BREAM: Final word to you, Byron.</p><p>YORK: These companies, a lot of them started out as platforms that had semi-neutral purposes. They were going to be a way for people to get together and share some sort of information or just to find information on the Internet. They have turned into actual platforms. They`ve turned into publications where they have huge staffs that curate which information their users can see and cannot see. And that gets them into trouble. They`ve turned into publishers, and they`re going to have to deal with Congress on that.</p><p>BREAM: OK, that may be coming as well, because there is a bipartisan call for that as well. Panel, thank you.</p><p>When we come back, a funeral for a real hero.</p><p>BREAM: Finally tonight, no man left behind.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m here out of respect for this gentleman who served his country, and no veteran should travel to his final resting place alone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: The funeral of Navy veteran Bradford Parker was supposed to be a small affair. The 66-year-old from Troy, New York, had only one known relative in the area and no close friends. But an appeal on social media resulted in hundreds of people, most of whom who have never met this gentleman, attending the funeral which was held with full military honors. In this day and age we knew more stories like that. God bless him for his service.</p><p>Thank you for watching SPECIAL REPORT. I`m Shannon Bream in Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019080601cb254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRX-N6J1-DXH2-645V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7404\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 6, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Great to be with you this hour, and we have lots of cutting edge science coming right up, including the CEO of Novavax who will be discussing the testing of their vaccine candidate and some global production deals, too.</p><p>And another major test for China's Huawei, as I mentioned. The Chief Security Officer, Andy Purdy will be here later in the show to discuss the latest U.S. restrictions on their business, too.</p><p>Now, speaking of tests, a fresh test for the bulls on Wall Street as well. The S&amp;P 500 flirting with record highs. We closed a couple of points short yesterday. The NASDAQ, however, achieved it, looking to extend those record gains as you can see in the session today.</p><p>The message is clear, it seems, Wall Street, unfazed by the pandemic, the renewed U.S.-China tensions and the collapsed stimulus negotiations here in the United States as well. Unfazed or just immunized? We'll discuss later on in the show, too.</p><p>For now, Tesla driving the NASDAQ higher yesterday. The Musk march continues with the stock soaring some 11 percent Monday, closing above $1,800.00 a share for the first time ever. It's up another three percent, I believe. Yes, more than three percent premarket today. Wowsers. Bubbalicious, I think.</p><p>Now, home building may be less sexy than electric cars, but that sector is on fire, too. An exchange traded fund tracking S&amp;P 500 home building stocks hit multiyear highs yesterday as well. Why? Rock bottom mortgage rates.</p><p>U.S. home builder sentiment just hit the best levels since the late '90s and what do homes need? Well, they need filling with stuff, shares of Walmart and Home Depot trading mixed premarket after posting strong Q2 sales results, Walmart's sales spiking almost 100 percent, and enhanced benefits and stimulus checks supported spending there, too. Much of that, of course, now gone while those negotiations continue, or they don't.</p><p>Let's get to the drivers. Christine Romans joins me now and much to discuss. Unfazed or immunized, Christine? Let's start there because one, the stimulus, at least for now, is not coming as we discuss on a daily basis. Meanwhile, shares making record highs.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It's remarkable, isn't it? And when you look at these retail earnings in particular, I see the stimulus in flashing green lights here in these numbers, right?</p><p>People stayed home and they spent the money the government sent them, the stimulus checks and the unemployment benefits and when you look at what they bought from Walmart, for example, home goods, and lawn supply things and electronics. Even Kohl's didn't lose as much money as people thought it would and that's in part because of all that stimulus that really was a wind in the sail of the American consumer.</p><p>But it's gone now, and that's why you've got Walmart shares down a little bit in premarket because the CFO on his earnings call saying that, you know, look, the stimulus -- the stimulus tailwind is not there anymore in terms of sales, so that will be an uncertainty going forward.</p><p>So, what we see in the rear view mirror is all of that epic help from Congress that kept the consumer afloat, but you still don't see that urgency reflected in Washington right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. And Christine, actually, thank you for pointing that out because that did catch me off guard. I was expecting there to be talking about seeing them making fresh record highs at the open, Walmart and Home Depot, and of course they've turned round and your point exactly.</p><p>What happens to spending now if we don't see people, particularly those without jobs at this current moment in time, not getting support, relatively unchanged?</p><p>Christine, also, interesting to point out as well, insiders, corporate insiders are taking money off the table.</p><p>ROMANS: That's right, at a rate we haven't seen since 2006. Whenever we're making comparisons to 2006 and 2007, I start to get nervous, right, because that was an incredibly bullish time when then you started to see some of the insiders begin to sell again and we headed into a recession after that.</p><p>[09:05:13]</p><p>ROMANS: So the insiders, you know, they have to disclose their sales, the time and how much, but they don't have to say the why.</p><p>So, we don't know the why of the sales, we just know the what, and the when. And now, it is billions of dollars in insider sales, which reflects, I think, a feeling that, if I were to surmise, that this has been an epic rally, some 40 percent for the NASDAQ, more than double digits for the S&amp;P 500 from the lows, and so now it's time to pause and take a look at what the recovery is going to look like.</p><p>We also saw a note from Bank of America this morning that said that leaders -- business leaders and chief executives see we're more likely to have double-dip recession than a V-shape recovery. That's a concern.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Christine, are you daring to suggest that we actually have to look at the fundamentals here rather than just ride the wave of stimulus? Wow.</p><p>ROMANS: It's hard with $12 trillion of stimulus all around the world. It's hard to sort of parse out where the fundamentals end and where euphoria begins and unintended consequences, also, of stimulus.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. We'll keep bringing it back to the real economy and real people. Christine Romans, thank you so much for that.</p><p>ROMANS: You're welcome.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, Beijing lashing out at the Trump administration as it tightens restrictions on Huawei. The Chinese Foreign Ministry says the U.S. has generalized the concept of national security, abused national power, imposed various restrictive measures on Chinese companies such as Huawei, and bullied without providing any evidence.</p><p>Sherisse Pham is live in Hong Kong with more. Well, Sherisse that was being pretty punchy there from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. A lot of people here, though, saying this is a lethal blow to Huawei's smartphone business.</p><p>SHERISSE PHAM, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: This is a deadly blow for Huawei's business altogether, actually. This could be the final nail in the coffin for the company.</p><p>Analysts are saying that without access to this vital technology, Huawei will be really hard pressed to build its smartphones and its 5G network gear that it sells to clients around the world.</p><p>So let's dig in a little bit into what these latest U.S. restrictions are. They dig further than the restrictions that were imposed on the company in May. Back then, Washington was pretty much cutting off access for Huawei chip design subsidiary companies, a company called High Silicon from manufacturing chips -- contract manufacturing chips and then powering Huawei's devices.</p><p>This time around, the restrictions that were announced overnight are that Huawei is now cut off from any foreign chip designers, which means that they do not have any access now to advanced semiconductors for its 5G phones, for its high-end smartphones, for its mid-range smartphones as well as its telecommunications networking gear.</p><p>And this, of course, is all part of Trump's campaign against Huawei. Washington has long alleged that Huawei poses a national security risk, that the company could be used to spy on Americans.</p><p>These are allegations that Huawei has repeatedly denied. We haven't heard from the company yet. I will say this is an unusually lengthy time for Huawei to be silent on such broad, sweeping restrictions against the company.</p><p>I know, like you said at the top there, you'll be talking to Andy Purdy later in the show and we will really be watching to see what he says about what this means for Huawei's business.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We absolutely will, and Sherisse, I was going to tease that again, but you've done it for me. So thank you so much for that, and we shall see what the company says about this.</p><p>Sherisse Pham there, brilliant to have you with us, and as always.</p><p>And as Sherisse says, the Chief Security Officer for Huawei in the United States is coming up on the show, so we'll ask him what this means and perhaps how China responds, a critical question here, too.</p><p>All right, let's move on. An epic battle against Apple. Epic Games says Apple is a bully that, quote, \"retaliated ferociously against its entire business.\" That, according to court documents filed Monday.</p><p>Last week, Apple removed the hugely popular game, Fortnite, from its store after Epic introduced its own in-app payment system in violation of Apple's App Store policies.</p><p>Clare Sebastian joins us now. Wow. When I read this, I thought, this is bold from Epic Games. There are a lot of people, app developers that say Apple is too powerful in charging the money for access to the App Store. That this is Epic literally flouting the rules here and saying, okay, bring it on.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so, Julia, this is unfolding pretty rapidly. Last week, we have the removal of Fortnite\" from the App Store and Google Play and a sort of separate issue and then Epic filing that court case, that blockbuster court case against Apple, basically asking for an injunction to stop Apple from being able to exert so much control over its App Store.</p><p>[09:10:08]</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Their particular issue is with the 30 percent commission that Apple charges on both app downloads and also in-app purchases and the fact that Apple requires developers and app makers to use their own proprietary payment systems.</p><p>Well, Fortnite, of course, triggered this by giving users a choice that they could go directly to Epic and save some money.</p><p>Now, this week, we have a new issue. Epic now says that Apple has not only removed Fortnite from the App Store, but they are threatening to cut off access to Epic Games. That includes not only Fortnite but also their Unreal Engine, which is their game engine, which developers, hundreds of developers use to make games -- to cut them off from the Apple developer program.</p><p>They say this represents an existential threat to their business, so they have filed an injunction to stop, not only the removal of Fortnite from the App Store, but this next round of what they call retaliation.</p><p>Now, we do have, Julia, a response from Apple this morning. They say they want to keep the company as part of the Apple Developer Program, but the problem Epic, they say, has created for itself is one that can be easily remedied if they submit an update of their app that reverts it to comply with the guidelines they agreed to and which applies to all developers.</p><p>They say, we won't make an exception for Epic because we don't think it's right to put their business interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers.</p><p>So, Apple is saying there's an easy way out for Epic, just go back to the rules, don't put this alternative payment system in the Fortnite app and everything will be fine, but of course, neither side is budging at the moment.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. And let us keep taking our cut. I can see both sides of this. It goes back to the big argument in Congress, of course, of anti- competitive behavior. It's going to be a fascinating one to watch.</p><p>Clare Sebastian, thank you for giving us the details on there and making it so clear because it's quite complicated, this story. Thank you.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed with some of the other stories making headlines around the world.</p><p>Democrats held the first of four nights of their virtual convention with a few small technical glitches, but no major ones. Speakers including Democratic heavy hitters, voters, and even some Republicans.</p><p>Former First Lady, Michelle Obama closed out the night with a powerful criticism of President Trump's leadership. CNN's Jessica Dean has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: We have to vote for Joe Biden in numbers that cannot be ignored.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JESSICA DEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Former First Lady, Michelle Obama wrapping up Night One of the Democratic National Convention with an impassioned plea to Americans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>M. OBAMA: Donald Trump is the wrong President for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head.</p><p>He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: The Former First Lady pulled no punches.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>M. OBAMA: Whenever we look to this White House for some leadership or consolation or any semblance of steadiness, what we get instead is chaos, division, and a total and utter lack of empathy.</p><p>You know that I tell you exactly what I'm feeling. You know I hate politics. But you also know that I care about this nation.</p><p>If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can and they will if we don't make a change in this election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: A source tells CNN, Obama practiced her speech for weeks and while a speech writer helped her draft the speech, she knew exactly what she wanted to say. Obama imploring Americans to think of the next generation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>M. OBAMA: They watch in horror as children are torn from their families and thrown into cages and pepper spray and rubber bullets are used on peaceful protesters for a photo op.</p><p>Sadly, this is the America that is on display for the next generation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN (voice over): Another top speaker, Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden's staunchest opponent in the primaries gave a full-throated endorsement, speaking out to his supporters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Joe Biden will end the hate and division Trump has created. He will stop the demonization of immigrants, the coddling of white nationalists, the racist dog whistling, and the religious bigotry.</p><p>To everyone who supported other candidates in the primary, and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election, the future of our democracy is at stake.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN (voice over): Four Republicans also endorsing Biden, including former Ohio Governor John Kasich.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN KASICH (R), FORMER OHIO GOVERNOR: I'm a lifelong Republican, but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN (voice over): President Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic playing a big role throughout the evening.</p><p>Kristin Urquiza spoke about losing her 65-year-old father to the virus, saying he contracted the virus after visiting a karaoke bar once Arizona's lockdown was lifted because he believed President Trump that it was safe.</p><p>[09:15:18]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KRISTIN URQUIZA, LOST FATHER TO COVID-19: My dad was a healthy 65-year- old. His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump and for that, he paid with his life.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN (voice over): But in the end, it was Michelle Obama's speech, laying out the stark choice all the night speakers presented.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>M. OBAMA: If we want to be able to look our children in the eye after this election, we have got to reassert our place in American history, and we have got to do everything we can to elect my friend, Joe Biden as the next President of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: One thing that jumped out to me about that speech, just look at her necklace. You don't often see that, but look at that. Whatever your political persuasion -- Republican, Democrat -- wherever you are in the world, the importance of voting. I liked the necklace. Yes.</p><p>Okay, over the weekend, thousands of party goers packed out this pool at a water park in Wuhan, China. Social distancing and masks were out while music and dancing were in.</p><p>The city was the original epicenter of what became the worldwide coronavirus pandemic just months earlier. The city was under a strict lockdown that lasted 76 days. Wow. We've forgotten what those kind of things feel like but that is Wuhan, well and truly back, it seems.</p><p>All right, still to come here on FIRST MOVE, an update on the race for a COVID vaccine as one of the U.S.-backed candidates enters a new trial in South Africa. We're joined by the CEO of its producer, Novavax.</p><p>And China criticizing President Trump's newest restrictions on Huawei. As we discussed, we'll be talking to the company's U.S. Head of Security about being caught in the cross fire. What next? Stay with us. We're back after this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE on what looks to be a pretty strong day for global stock markets. We've got Wall Street futures in the green following the tone from Europe and much of Asia.</p><p>[09:20:07]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Cautious comments, though, let's be clear, from Walmart on its sales outlook, injected a little bit of caution premarket. That said, the S&amp;P 500 will be trading close to record highs at the open.</p><p>A record close for the S&amp;P 500 today would be a key psychological milestone, I think, for the markets. Some see it as the true end to the bear market that began with the COVID-19 lockdown, swiftly leaving those, it seems.</p><p>Stocks have made a late summer leap, but the dollar, meanwhile, in the doldrums, falling for a fifth straight session. It reflects continued concern I think about the pace of economic recoveries as we await the longer term fix.</p><p>And in that vein, there are more than 30 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in clinical trials. One of the few backed by the U.S. government is Novavax.</p><p>The company has gone broad in its bid for a vaccine. Its productions agreements in India, a deal with the U.K. to supply millions of doses, and it just started a new study in South Africa, too. We've got lots to discuss.</p><p>Joining us now is Stanley Erck, he is the CEO and President of Novavax. Stanley, fantastic to have you on the show. Let's start with that trial specifically. Talk to me about what you're going to be doing in South Africa.</p><p>STANLEY ERCK, CEO AND PRESIDENT, NOVAVAX: Well, thanks for having me on. It's an important trial. It's designed to be -- it's called a Phase 2-B trial so it's an advanced Phase 2 trial where we'll be actually looking not just for safety and immunogenicity, which you normally do in a Phase 1 or a Phase 1-2, but we're also looking for efficacy.</p><p>And so the trial is designed to show efficacy in a country that has had a very high level of COVID disease recently.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: One of the big challenges that we've been discussing in the last two days from Moderna with their Phase 3 trial where they're trying to get thousands and thousands of people is that they're not getting enough people from minority backgrounds, African-Americans, Latinx people that have suffered so cruelly, disproportionately as a result of what we're seeing with COVID-19.</p><p>Does doing trials in other countries outside of the United States perhaps address some of those concerns.</p><p>ERCK: Well, it does, and you know, we look at this as -- this is a global problem, and so we will be doing trials in late stages in several countries in parallel with each other, this one in South Africa. It will be primarily South Africans, black volunteers, and the U.S., we'll try to be as diverse as possible.</p><p>You know, there's diversity of race, but also of gender and age, and so we're going to be going into older adults for the first time as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Two of the other subset of groups that obviously are going to be key when regulators are looking at approving this.</p><p>Stanley, do you think that will allow you some degree of catch-up in getting this vaccine if it's successful to market, simply because you're getting a lot of the diversity in the trials that you're undergoing now?</p><p>ERCK: Well, I think we will. I mean, it's hard to predict who is going to be able to show the first efficacy data. We've got Moderna and others who are -- who have started their Phase 3 trials already, and it's hard to predict because it really depends upon what the rate of viral infection is in a particular location that you started with.</p><p>So we're all working toward the same goal of getting efficacy data as soon as we can. We all expect to be able to do that this calendar year, and that would precede our filing of most data with the various agencies.</p><p>Our goal will be to file with the F.D.A. and with E.M.A. in Europe and possibly South Africa and India.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And I want to talk about that, because if I look at who you're making agreements with, the U.K. government has asked for doses, you're obviously operating as part of Operation Warp Speed here in the United States.</p><p>There's an agreement with South Korea. You're working with the Serum Institute of India. Who gets what when? How do you prioritize? Because as you pointed out, this is a global problem.</p><p>ERCK: Yes. Well, we're doing something that is unprecedented. We are trying to get manufacturing, transfer to seven or eight different manufacturing sites in seven or eight different countries all at the same time, and so you have to show -- you have to develop an assay system that allows you to show comparability in all of these different locations that you're making exactly the same vaccine.</p><p>And we're doing it for a reason, because we need to get diversity, to get speed, to make sure that we have places where we have the best chance of showing efficacy in a high attack -- what's called an attack rate where we have a high rate of virus.</p><p>And so we're doing all of those at the same time, and I think it's a strategy that ultimately reduces the risk that we would be able to show efficacy.</p><p>[09:25:23]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What is the greatest challenge here, beyond just getting to the point where we have a vaccine that we're comfortable with and that is approved for use? Because you have talked about stepping up manufacturing capabilities all over the world. It's a global problem.</p><p>But even just on a micro level, the glass vials, the rollout of this, fridges, the capacity of fridges to keep the vaccine cool until you distribute it. Are we doing enough work globally in order to address some of those challenges too?</p><p>ERCK: Well, there's -- yes. Yes. And so, that's a really key point. And so, we have a vaccine, and to make a good vaccine, a viable vaccine, it needs to be safe, and so everybody is showing various levels of safety of their vaccine.</p><p>It has to work. It has to be able to neutralize the virus so you don't get infected. But importantly, you raise a good point. It has to be stable and I think it has to be -- it's better if it's stable at either room temperature or refrigerated, and if it's -- if ours, it turns out that it is, and so there's a whole established, what they call a cold chain, globally, not just in high-income countries. But it's a global vaccine distribution chain that's there.</p><p>So as long as you can store it at refrigerated temperatures and maybe leave it out for a day or two while it's being used in a clinic, that's fine, then I think that our product fits that profile.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Stanley, very quickly, for an ordinary person that doesn't have preexisting conditions, isn't operating on the frontlines like a healthcare worker, how long will we likely be waiting for this? Should we be thinking middle of next year? Back end of next year?</p><p>ERCK: Yes, I think it's a practical matter, that's probably right. I think that we and other companies are trying to get product in the warehouse, on the shelf by the end of this year that would align with when we think we might be able to get regulatory approval, but all those are being scaled up.</p><p>For instance, what we're doing is we're trying to get as much as a hundred million doses produced by sometime in the early first quarter, but then we want to be at the scale where we can make a hundred million doses every single month, and we think we can be there in January or February.</p><p>But just the logistics of getting it out means that probably, as you point out, the frontline workers are going to be first in line, but I think the non-frontline workers, regular folks, it's going to be more in the second, third quarter by the time it really gets out there in masses -- to the masses.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. A reality check. Stanley, great to chat with you, and thank you for all your work and for the team's work as well.</p><p>ERCK: Sure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We'll keep in touch. Stanley Erck there, the CEO and President of Novavax.</p><p>ERCK: All right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, the market opens next.</p><p>[09:16:39]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. U.S. stocks are open for trading this Tuesday. Let me give you a look at what we're seeing.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500, which briefly traded in record territory last week will try once again to close at record highs today. The NASDAQ meanwhile on track for its 34th record close this year. Yes. I mean, that tells you everything.</p><p>Tech stocks posting the biggest gains in early trading this morning, too. The first of the big U.S. retailers to report Q2 results this morning as well. Home depot and Walmart trading pretty mixed as we've discussed after reporting strong sales.</p><p>Walmart's e-commerce business almost doubled from a year ago. We can call that a jobless benefits bounce, stimulating spending, but of course, with the negotiations in Congress stalled, that may not be repeated any time soon, and with millions of Americans suddenly dependent on benefit payments, the pandemic has presented a somewhat antiquated banking industry, to say the least, with a pretty huge challenge.</p><p>Our next guest, Brian Brooks, the new head of the U.S. National Banks Regulators says they all need to innovate to keep up. He's granted a banking license to a Fintech company, which has raised a few eyebrows, but he has also opened a new avenue for existing banks, allowing them for the first time to hold cryptocurrencies -- digital assets -- for safekeeping.</p><p>And perhaps, it should come as no surprise as he is the former Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase Global, the biggest U.S. Exchange for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Brian Brooks, the acting U.S. Comptroller of the Currency joins us now. Brian, fantastic to have you with us. I'm really excited to have you on.</p><p>You sort of have a 21st Century view of what the banking sector should look like, and I said it's raising a few eyebrows. It's raising a few more. Give me a sense of what your vision is.</p><p>BRIAN BROOKS, ACTING U.S. COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY: Well, Julia, thanks so much for having me, and these are really important questions to ask in a time like this.</p><p>You know, this is a time when Americans are depending on their banking system more than they ever have before.</p><p>When we made a decision, collectively in this country to shut down the economy very broadly, back in March, we depended on the banks to deliver payment benefits in the form of Paycheck Protection Program loans and checks sent from the Treasury Department and the problem is we were sending those across 19th Century banking rails.</p><p>Many people said that it took days or sometimes weeks to receive their payments, and my vision is that we need to get to a place in this country where payments can be transmitted virtually instantaneously, where errors can be eliminated, and it turns out technology exists today that can help us do that, so we need to get there, I think, sooner rather than later.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You've talked about a new payment charter. What does that mean, and what is the technology that we have today that exists that circumvents, to your point, the 19th Century rails that the train has been running on so far?</p><p>BROOKS: Well, it's really interesting, Julia. If you look at the payments business over the last 30 years, there was a time when all payments happened through the banking system, and in the last 10 or 15 years with the rise of Fintech, largely dominated by a bunch of Silicon Valley firms, it turns out that technologies exist, whether they're based on block chain or other kinds of networks that allow payments to go much faster.</p><p>And as a result of that, what's happened in this country is that millions and millions of daily payments no longer are principally processed by banks. They're run by companies like PayPal and Stripe and Square.</p><p>The question for the payments charter is, do we think it's a good thing or a bad thing that all of that activity is now happening outside the banking system where the examiners who work in my agency can look at them and make sure that there's fraud being prevented and make sure consumers are protected or do we think it would be better for them to run entirely outside of regulation?</p><p>I think the best solution, which you see in other parts of the world, including the U.K. today, is to have faster payments that are innovated by private companies, but are supervised by Federal watchdogs like us. That, I think, is what the future looks like.</p><p>[09:35:33]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, the pushback that you're getting on getting here is from existing banks, whether the state level or those that are federally regulated. I mean, they have existing businesses, I guess, to protect. The problem is, they don't best serve the customer.</p><p>BROOKS: Well, that's the thing, Julia, and if you look at what the reason is why so much payments activity has moved outside of the banking system, part of it is because consumers want to receive their services in a different way.</p><p>I mean, let's face it, there was a time when we all used to buy our clothes in department stores where we could also get our oil changed and have lunch. The world changed on the high street shopping market, right?</p><p>Now we all go to boutique stores. We buy our computers at Apple, our jeans at the Levi's store, et cetera. Banks are sort of the last bastion of the amalgamated comprehensive supermarket, if you will, of financial services. But that's not the way consumers shop anymore.</p><p>The other thing that's really important is markets look at these companies very, very differently. So it turns out the return on equity for start-up tech companies is far higher than the return on equities for banks, which is what creates strong market incentives for these services to move into specialty platforms and outside of comprehensive banks.</p><p>All of which means that if we don't rethink what the bank charter is and find a way for the bank charter to be broad enough to encompass services that were historically provided by banks, we're going to have a problem.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: SWIFT. Some people will recognize this term, others won't but it is the way right now that the system works and the information, the money is passed between banks and the last thing with this SWIFT, it is clunky. It's slow.</p><p>Those outside of the industry, particularly in the Fintech sector, know there are better options. Brian, is this the plan, to replace, improve on the existing infrastructure that SWIFT is at this moment?</p><p>BROOKS: Well, Julia, you make a great point that SWIFT is one of the most ironically named organizations in the world. The joke in my world is that if you wanted to move money from America to Australia, the fastest way to do that is to load it in a suitcase and put it on an airplane, which is a little bit crazy, right?</p><p>So, to me, what has to happen is thereby faster solutions and they exist in other parts of the world. So, the U.K., Singapore, China and many of our global competitors have adopted real-time payments.</p><p>In the U.S., that seems to be still years away unless we allow existing technologies to do the work for us, and I think that's very possible.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Brian, how quickly can you do this? How quickly can you achieve this given, as we've discussed, there are existing resistant points and they're pretty powerful in this country?</p><p>BROOKS: Well, they are, Julia, but in the world, there's nothing more powerful than markets because markets represent what millions of consumers want every day, and so my job is not to build new payment rails. My job is to identify impediments that make it harder for people to get what they want and need.</p><p>And at the OCC, we have an ability to do that. So, among those include the questions of, should banks be allowed to participate in the cryptocurrency market at all? Should banks be allowed to connect to block chains? Should we have Central Bank digital currencies perhaps issued by private companies, but backed by bank deposits?</p><p>I can identify what the impediments to that are and try to solve that so people can get what they want as they express through markets. I think that's very possible.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Brian, very quickly, I've read recently that 15 percent of Americans now own some form of digital asset or a cryptocurrency. You also want to tackle this and make sure that banks can provide services as far as digital assets are concerned. You're trying to protect consumers again.</p><p>BROOKS: Well, look, in a world where 50 million Americans do hold cryptocurrencies and many, many millions more outside of this country do, to me, we can't ignore that phenomenon.</p><p>So I am not a crypto bull nor a crypto bear, but I recognize reality. A lot of people have this stuff. They have it for good reasons. And we need to make sure it's accessible to them in the same safe and sound way that they can get their checking account. So that's our role, it is to innovate as people change the way they consume financial services in the future.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I have to say, I find you a breath of fresh air, but I can see you're going to be a whirlwind to others.</p><p>Brian, we will continue this conversation. Thank you so much for describing your role and what your plans are. We'll continue this conversation soon.</p><p>Brian Brooks, acting U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. Thank you for that.</p><p>All right, coming up on FIRST MOVE, Huawei's reaction after the U.S. imposed new and tough rules against the Chinese telecommunications giant. What does it mean for the company? Find out next.</p><p>[09:40:58]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The Trump administration tightening restrictions on Huawei, making it harder for the company to access foreign chips made with American technology.</p><p>Beijing says it firmly opposes what it calls, quote, \"The deliberate smear and suppression of Huawei and other Chinese companies.\"</p><p>Andy Purdy is the Chief Security Officer for Huawei in the United States and joins us now. Andy, great to have you on the show as always.</p><p>This is consistently being called a lethal blow to your business. Is that what it is? A lethal blow?</p><p>ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI-UNITED STATES: Oh, I don't think so. The full impact and the time it's going to take for us to adjust is not clear, but what is clear is that tens of thousands of American jobs are at risk and that's really my primary concern.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Andy, you mention this a lot and I hear you, but where do you get semiconductors or chips from if you can't use any now of the avenues that you were using?</p><p>PURDY: Well, one thing we did last year, as you may recall, we ramped up our research and development up to about $18 billion, we're going to about $20 billion this year, so we are working hard to develop the capabilities to build ourselves and we're exploring hard around the world to find capabilities that can help us meet the need, and we're quite confident that we will be able to do that.</p><p>We're not a publicly traded company. We're privately owned. We have time, and if we take a hit in revenue, that's fine. We can bounce back as we continue to do.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Richard Yu who is Huawei's Consumer Device Business Head, said on August 7th that the current smartphone chips will cease production as of September 15th. It's a real loss, a very big loss, he said, for the business.</p><p>Is that the case, that, as of middle of September, you can't produce even your own chips?</p><p>PURDY: Well, as I said, we don't have a full assessment of the impact and timing of the disruption of our supply chain, the disruption of the ability of nearly 300 American companies to sell non-sensitive technology to Huawei, and we're working through it.</p><p>And you know, as I said, we took a hit of about $12 billion in 2019 in our revenue, and we may take a hit again. But we are committed to the long- term, and we have the capabilities and resources to adjust over time.</p><p>[09:45:24]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, the message is, whatever happens, Huawei will survive this?</p><p>PURDY: Well, we will survive, but as I said, I'm particularly concerned about -- I'm particularly concerned about two things. It is the tens of thousands of American jobs that are at risk and the impact of American policies on the competitiveness of the U.S. and the ability to bring internet connectivity to the underserved and unserved, both in American rural areas and in -- to the three billion people around the world that don't have connectivity.</p><p>We do a lot better when there's one global common set of standards where governments don't control. It's a free and open exchange of information and systems, and that's worked well over the history of the internet, and it can work well in the future, but it's definitely at risk right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's a cost that this U.S. administration is seemingly willing to accept. Is there a fix here, Andy? Because you've said to me many times, look, we're opening for communication, but this administration is saying, we simply don't trust you and when you say you're not a risk, you're lying.</p><p>Do you need administration change in order to improve this relationship, or do you think even that might not make a difference at this stage?</p><p>PURDY: Well, a lot of experts in the United States and elsewhere recognize that when we look at the long-term, we need to build on some of the guidance that came as long ago as 2005 with the World System on Information Security, the WSIS, the Tunis agreement that called for the kinds of standards in testing.</p><p>And more recently, this year, the Department of Defense 5G strategy and the U.S. government 5G strategy. The U.S. is ignoring what's required in those documents to make sure their objective standards, independent testing, we have to be able to deal with an untrusted set of suppliers.</p><p>We have to have a zero trust environment, and that's what the experts are saying, and even if you want to block Huawei, the U.S. and our allies, we need to work towards implementing those kinds of agreements, implementing the actual terms of the Department of Defense and the U.S. 5G strategy.</p><p>We have to address these risks. We can address them.</p><p>So, rather than simply saying, as a general proposition, do you trust Company X or Country Y, there need to be mechanisms in place that allow each company, each third party supplier to provide independent evidence that they're worthy of trust, and we are prepared to do that, and if we don't get to participate, it's still of paramount importance that the U.S. and others work toward that kind of standard so we all have a basis for trust as we become increasingly dependent on information and communication technologies.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think you can have a different conversation with a different administration, Andy? Or do you think the U.S. now, as a nation, as a Congress, is that set against China, you're caught in the cross fire, nothing will change this?</p><p>PURDY: Well, the question of what might happen if there's a new administration has been often asked. I don't think one can say with confidence what will happen with a new administration.</p><p>I do assume there will be a little greater predictability. I think there's a chance that the U.S. would then treat our allies with a little more respect and work on agreements -- bilateral agreements that provide value to both sides.</p><p>But the kinds of issues that I'm talking about in terms of what's necessary for organizations and citizens around the world, for an objective and transparent basis for knowing which products are worthy of trust, I think that's going to get greater attention than some of the policies that are in place right now.</p><p>But the importance of those difficult security measures, those measures outlined in the DoD and U.S. 5G security strategies, those are going to be very important regardless of which administration is in office.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think there's any perceived difference in risk as far as data is concerned between Tencent, Alibaba and Huawei?</p><p>PURDY: Well, I think each country looks at the risk situation in a particular way. I think the experts have a tendency to look in situations in the same way.</p><p>So, I think when one looks at whether it's apps, whether it's major manufacturers of semiconductors, whether it's manufacturers or network or other 5G equipment, to look at what is the situation, what is the evidence, what are the standards? How do we make sure there's proof of the standards?</p><p>So in this case of, for example, apps, one needs to make sure that one knows where the data is held. One needs to make sure that there are security measures in place to make sure the data isn't abused and it isn't sent where it shouldn't go.</p><p>And the U.S. has been lagging, frankly, in developing national privacy standards. These kinds of standards that are necessary to protect the privacy of Americans, those kinds of standards that we've seen proliferate in Europe.</p><p>So we need to make sure these objective kinds of standards are used to evaluate whether it's Alibaba, Tencent, Microsoft, Huawei or any other company.</p><p>[09:50:35]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Or a Facebook indeed, Andy, you do raise a great point there, but it takes us off in a completely different direction.</p><p>Always great to chat with you. Thank you so much for joining us on this and no doubt we'll speak again soon.</p><p>PURDY: You're welcome.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Andy Purdy, Chief Security Officer for Huawei, USA.</p><p>All right, coming up, big surprises in store for Walmart and Home Depot. E- commerce sales are soaring, and giving even Jeff Bezos a run for his money. More after this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. A quick look at the markets once again. This might be the day, stumbling over my words in my excitement, that the S&amp;P 500 does it. The benchmark U.S. index trading in record territory once again and on track for its first record close since February.</p><p>The NASDAQ, of course, already there, too. All this as earnings from the all-important retail sector start coming in.</p><p>Paul La Monica joins us with more. Paul, if someone had said to me five months ago we would be back here in this short a space of time, I probably would have laughed at them, but hey, stimulus lifts the aggregate if not the whole.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Exactly. You wouldn't have been the only one laughing, I'm sure, Julia, but you're right.</p><p>What you have is a combination of government stimulus really boosting consumer spending. Consumers also, to their credit, are doing a better job of saving in this higher savings rate, I think, makes a lot of customers feel more flush and willing to spend on certain necessities like the types of things they get at Walmart, especially since they can now get that online.</p><p>Walmart's, you know, digital sales nearly doubling, so obviously, as you pointed out, giving Amazon a run for their money, but then you look at Home Depot, people are nesting. You know, when was the last time you went to a restaurant or a movie theater? You're staying home, so people are doing these DIY projects, even if they're not looking to sell the house, which a lot of people are looking to do to go to the suburbs, get a bigger space, that's definitely good news for Home Depot, and I suspect Lowe's, which reports its results tomorrow morning.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And yes, these stocks are trading at or around record highs, but there was some cautiousness that filtered in when the executives of these companies sort of said that a lot of this was stimulus money driven and given that Congress can't agree on more stimulus here, the outlook, perhaps, for spending is a little bit less clear.</p><p>Can we continue to make fresh record gains when the fundamentals tell a very different story -- Paul.</p><p>[09:55:10]</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, that is a great point. I think there are growing concerns about what will happen to the U.S. economy and a lot of these stocks that have boosted the markets to all-time highs, if you don't get another round of stimulus because also, maybe not so much with the retailers, but if you look at the big tech companies that are leading the market, their valuations are back near 2000 levels and I remember covering 2000, it wasn't a heck of a lot of fun when the bottom fell out.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Absolutely not. Paul La Monica, great to have you with us as always. Thank you for that.</p><p>All right, that just about wraps up the show. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. I'm Julia Chatterley. Stay safe and I'll see you tomorrow. Have a good day.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020081801cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-FR81-JB20-G0HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7468\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Encouraging news about manufacturing provided an early boost, but stocks fell later after a report on the pace of home sales fell short of expectations.</p><p><br/>\u3000<br/>The government said before trading began that orders for long-lasting goods rose in December by 4.6 percent, helped by a 10 percent gain in orders for new aircraft. The report was a sign of strength for the manufacturing sector, a crucial driver of economic growth.<br/>\u3000<br/>Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar said separately that its fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts' expectations, after adjusting for the cost of a soured deal to buy a Chinese maker of roofing supports for mines. Caterpillar said it took a big charge in the quarter because the Chinese company had misrepresented its finances.<br/>\u3000<br/>Caterpillar Inc.said it expects growth in China to improve without regaining the levels seen in 2010 or 2011. The stock was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, closing up US$1.87, or 2 percent, at US$97.45.<br/>\u3000<br/>The Dow Jones transportation index, a proxy for future economic activity, edged higher, notching its tenth straight increase and its twelfth gain in the past 13 trading days.<br/>\u3000<br/>A half-hour after trading began, the National Association of Realtors said that its index of pending home sales fell in December, suggesting that sales of previously occupied homes may slow in the coming months. The report, which was weaker than many economists had expected, helped push stocks lower for much of the morning. They were roughly flat by midday, and spent the afternoon swapping small bumps and dips.<br/>\u3000<br/>The Dow closed down 14.05 points, or 0.1 percent, at 13,881.93. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.78, or 0.2 percent, to 1,500.18. The Nasdaq composite index added 4.59, or 0.2 percent, to 3,154.<br/>\u3000<br/>The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are rapidly approaching their all-time closing highs, reached on Oct. 9, 2007. The Dow is about 282 points below its high of 14,164.53; the S&amp;P 500 is 65 points shy of its record of 1,565.<br/>\u3000<br/>Economic data may be less likely to boost the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data have strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with PNC Asset Management Group.<br/>\u3000<br/>\"Before, even if you came in just at expectations, that was like a victory,\" he said. Because of the market's recent upturn, he said, \"you get less of a pop for just making the numbers.\"<br/>\u3000<br/>Among companies in the S&amp;P 500 that reported earnings yesterday, Biogen Idec Inc. said its fourth-quarter net income slipped nearly 3 percent because of a tax charge and higher expenses. Still, the biotech drug maker rose US$3.79, or 2.6 percent, to US$149.99.<br/>\u3000<br/>Roper Industries Inc., which makes medical and industrial equipment, said its fourth-quarter net income rose 18 percent. But the company issued mixed guidance for the current quarter and full year 2013. It fell 33 cents to US$118.50.<br/>\u3000<br/>Oil company Hess Inc. was the biggest gainer in the S&amp;P 500, adding 6.1 percent after the company said it plans to sell its US terminal network, shutter its New Jersey refinery and continue shifting its focus to exploration and production. Hess also said that the hedge fund Elliott Associates plans to seek regulatory approval to buy a major stake in the company. Hess rose US$3.58 to US$62.48.<br/>\u3000<br/>Several big tech companies reported their results after the market closed and saw big price swings in after-hours trading:<br/>\u3000<br/>- Web portal Yahoo Inc. rose 81 cents, or 4 percent, to US$21.12 after saying its fourth-quarter earnings topped analyst estimates as an upturn in its international investments helped end a three-year revenue slump.<br/>\u3000<br/>- Hard disk maker Seagate Technology PLC said it beat analysts' estimates in its results for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 28. It rose 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to US$38.10 after hours.<br/>\u3000<br/>- Cloud computing provider VMWare Inc. said its net income edged higher, but the company announced guidance that was far weaker than analysts had expected. VMWare lost US$10.83, or 11 percent, to US$87.49 after hours.<br/>\u3000<br/>Strong corporate earnings helped push the S&amp;P 500 through the 1,500 milestone Friday after several calm, relatively news-free weeks. In addition to companies' performance, traders have been encouraged by signals that housing market is improving steadily and hiring is picking up, albeit slowly.<br/>\u3000<br/>There will plenty of fresh data to drive trading this week, including retail sales, economic growth and the government's report on hiring and employment in January, which is due out Friday. More than one-fifth of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report fourth-quarter earnings this week.<br/>\u3000<br/>Stone said stocks are trading sideways in part because many investors are awaiting economic reports later this week, especially the employment report. There is agreement among economists and analysts that the economy slowed in the fourth quarter, he said, and this week's numbers will help answer the question of \"how slow, and how much did it impact employment.\"<br/>\u3000<br/>The yield in the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.97 percent from 1.95 percent late Friday, reflecting lower demand for ultra-safe investments. After yesterday's factory orders report, the yield rose briefly above 2 percent for the first time since April.

Encouraging news about manufacturing provided an early boost, but stocks fell later after a report on the pace of home sales fell short of expectations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government said before trading began that orders for long-lasting goods rose in December by 4.6 percent, helped by a 10 percent gain in orders for new aircraft. The report was a sign of strength for the manufacturing sector, a crucial driver of economic growth.</p><p>Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar said separately that its fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts' expectations, after adjusting for the cost of a soured deal to buy a Chinese maker of roofing supports for mines. Caterpillar said it took a big charge in the quarter because the Chinese company had misrepresented its finances.</p><p>Caterpillar Inc.said it expects growth in China to improve without regaining the levels seen in 2010 or 2011. The stock was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, closing up $1.87, or 2 percent, at $97.45.</p><p>The Dow Jones transportation index, a proxy for future economic activity, edged higher, notching its tenth straight increase and its twelfth gain in the past 13 trading days.</p><p>A half-hour after trading began, the National Association of Realtors said that its index of pending home sales fell in December, suggesting that sales of previously occupied homes may slow in the coming months. The report, which was weaker than many economists had expected, helped push stocks lower for much of the morning. They were roughly flat by midday, and spent the afternoon swapping small bumps and dips.</p><p>The Dow closed down 14.05 points, or 0.1 percent, at 13,881.93. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.78, or 0.2 percent, to 1,500.18. The Nasdaq composite index added 4.59, or 0.2 percent, to 3,154.</p><p>The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are rapidly approaching their all-time closing highs, reached on Oct. 9, 2007. The Dow is about 282 points below its high of 14,164.53; the S&amp;P 500 is 65 points shy of its record of 1,565.</p><p>Economic data may be less likely to boost the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data have strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with PNC Asset Management Group.</p><p>\"Before, even if you came in just at expectations, that was like a victory,\" he said. Because of the market's recent upturn, he said, \"you get less of a pop for just making the numbers.\"</p><p>Among companies in the S&amp;P 500 that reported earnings Monday, Biogen Idec Inc. said its fourth-quarter net income slipped nearly 3 percent because of a tax charge and higher expenses. Still, the biotech drug maker rose $3.79, or 2.6 percent, to $149.99.</p><p>Roper Industries Inc., which makes medical and industrial equipment, said its fourth-quarter net income rose 18 percent. But the company issued mixed guidance for the current quarter and full year 2013. It fell 33 cents to $118.50.</p><p>Oil company Hess Inc. was the biggest gainer in the S&amp;P 500, adding 6.1 percent after the company said it plans to sell its U.S. terminal network, shutter its New Jersey refinery and continue shifting its focus to exploration and production. Hess also said that the hedge fund Elliott Associates plans to seek regulatory approval to buy a major stake in the company. Hess rose $3.58 to $62.48.</p><p>Several big tech companies reported their results after the market closed and saw big price swings in after-hours trading:</p><p> Web portal Yahoo Inc. rose 81 cents, or 4 percent, to $21.12 after saying its fourth-quarter earnings topped analyst estimates as an upturn in its international investments helped end a three-year revenue slump.</p><p> Hard disk maker Seagate Technology PLC said it beat analysts' estimates in its results for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 28. It rose 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $38.10 after hours.</p><p> Cloud computing provider VMWare Inc. said its net income edged higher, but the company announced guidance that was far weaker than analysts had expected. VMWare lost $10.83, or 11 percent, to $87.49 after hours.</p><p>Strong corporate earnings helped push the S&amp;P 500 through the 1,500 milestone Friday after several calm, relatively news-free weeks. In addition to companies' performance, traders have been encouraged by signals that housing market is improving steadily and hiring is picking up, albeit slowly.</p><p>There will plenty of fresh data to drive trading this week, including retail sales, economic growth and the government's report on hiring and employment in January, which is due out Friday. More than one-fifth of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report fourth-quarter earnings this week.</p><p>Stone said stocks are trading sideways in part because many investors are awaiting economic reports later this week, especially the employment report. There is agreement among economists and analysts that the economy slowed in the fourth quarter, he said, and this week's numbers will help answer the question of \"how slow, and how much did it impact employment.\"</p><p>The yield in the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.97 percent from 1.95 percent late Friday, reflecting lower demand for ultra-safe investments. After Monday's factory orders report, the yield rose briefly above 2 percent for the first time since April. A bond's yield rises as demand for it decreases.</p><p>Daniel Wagner can be reached at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/wagnerreports\">www.twitter.com/wagnerreports</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-US Wall Street_US stocks close mixed on uneven economic signals</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57M5-K0H1-DYN6-W21F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><timeReceived>9:52 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>January 28, 2013 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Encouraging news about manufacturing provided an early boost, but stocks fell later after a report on the pace of home sales fell short of expectations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government said before trading began that orders for long-lasting goods rose in December by 4.6 percent, helped by a 10 percent gain in orders for new aircraft. The report was a sign of strength for the manufacturing sector, a crucial driver of economic growth.</p><p>Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar said separately that its fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts' expectations, after adjusting for the cost of a soured deal to buy a Chinese maker of roofing supports for mines. Caterpillar said it took a big charge in the quarter because the Chinese company had misrepresented its finances.</p><p>Caterpillar Inc.said it expects growth in China to improve without regaining the levels seen in 2010 or 2011. The stock was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, closing up $1.87, or 2 percent, at $97.45.</p><p>The Dow Jones transportation index, a proxy for future economic activity, edged higher, notching its tenth straight increase and its twelfth gain in the past 13 trading days.</p><p>A half-hour after trading began, the National Association of Realtors said that its index of pending home sales fell in December, suggesting that sales of previously occupied homes may slow in the coming months. The report, which was weaker than many economists had expected, helped push stocks lower for much of the morning. They were roughly flat by midday, and spent the afternoon swapping small bumps and dips.</p><p>The Dow closed down 14.05 points, or 0.1 percent, at 13,881.93. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.78, or 0.2 percent, to 1,500.18. The Nasdaq composite index added 4.59, or 0.2 percent, to 3,154.</p><p>The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are rapidly approaching their all-time closing highs, reached on Oct. 9, 2007. The Dow is about 282 points below its high of 14,164.53; the S&amp;P 500 is 65 points shy of its record of 1,565.</p><p>Economic data may be less likely to boost the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data have strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with PNC Asset Management Group.</p><p>\"Before, even if you came in just at expectations, that was like a victory,\" he said. Because of the market's recent upturn, he said, \"you get less of a pop for just making the numbers.\"</p><p>Among companies in the S&amp;P 500 that reported earnings Monday, Biogen Idec Inc. said its fourth-quarter net income slipped nearly 3 percent because of a tax charge and higher expenses. Still, the biotech drug maker rose $3.79, or 2.6 percent, to $149.99.</p><p>Roper Industries Inc., which makes medical and industrial equipment, said its fourth-quarter net income rose 18 percent. But the company issued mixed guidance for the current quarter and full year 2013. It fell 33 cents to $118.50.</p><p>Oil company Hess Inc. was the biggest gainer in the S&amp;P 500, adding 6.1 percent after the company said it plans to sell its U.S. terminal network, shutter its New Jersey refinery and continue shifting its focus to exploration and production. Hess also said that the hedge fund Elliott Associates plans to seek regulatory approval to buy a major stake in the company. Hess rose $3.58 to $62.48.</p><p>Several big tech companies reported their results after the market closed and saw big price swings in after-hours trading:</p><p> Web portal Yahoo Inc. rose 81 cents, or 4 percent, to $21.12 after saying its fourth-quarter earnings topped analyst estimates as an upturn in its international investments helped end a three-year revenue slump.</p><p> Hard disk maker Seagate Technology PLC said it beat analysts' estimates in its results for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 28. It rose 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $38.10 after hours.</p><p> Cloud computing provider VMWare Inc. said its net income edged higher, but the company announced guidance that was far weaker than analysts had expected. VMWare lost $10.83, or 11 percent, to $87.49 after hours.</p><p>Strong corporate earnings helped push the S&amp;P 500 through the 1,500 milestone Friday after several calm, relatively news-free weeks. In addition to companies' performance, traders have been encouraged by signals that housing market is improving steadily and hiring is picking up, albeit slowly.</p><p>There will plenty of fresh data to drive trading this week, including retail sales, economic growth and the government's report on hiring and employment in January, which is due out Friday. More than one-fifth of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report fourth-quarter earnings this week.</p><p>Stone said stocks are trading sideways in part because many investors are awaiting economic reports later this week, especially the employment report. There is agreement among economists and analysts that the economy slowed in the fourth quarter, he said, and this week's numbers will help answer the question of \"how slow, and how much did it impact employment.\"</p><p>The yield in the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.97 percent from 1.95 percent late Friday, reflecting lower demand for ultra-safe investments. After Monday's factory orders report, the yield rose briefly above 2 percent for the first time since April. A bond's yield rises as demand for it decreases.</p><p/><p>Daniel Wagner can be reached at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/wagnerreports\">www.twitter.com/wagnerreports</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APNE-US Wall Street, 5th Ld-Writethru</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57M5-K2N1-JBGK-G3K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><timeReceived>09:52 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>January 28, 2013 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Encouraging news about manufacturing provided an early boost, but stocks fell later after a report on the pace of home sales fell short of expectations.</p><p><br/>\u3000<br/>The government said before trading began that orders for long-lasting goods rose in December by 4.6 percent, helped by a 10 percent gain in orders for new aircraft. The report was a sign of strength for the manufacturing sector, a crucial driver of economic growth.<br/>\u3000<br/>Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar said separately that its fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts' expectations, after adjusting for the cost of a soured deal to buy a Chinese maker of roofing supports for mines. Caterpillar said it took a big charge in the quarter because the Chinese company had misrepresented its finances.<br/>\u3000<br/>Caterpillar Inc.said it expects growth in China to improve without regaining the levels seen in 2010 or 2011. The stock was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, closing up US$1.87, or 2 percent, at US$97.45.<br/>\u3000<br/>The Dow Jones transportation index, a proxy for future economic activity, edged higher, notching its tenth straight increase and its twelfth gain in the past 13 trading days.<br/>\u3000<br/>A half-hour after trading began, the National Association of Realtors said that its index of pending home sales fell in December, suggesting that sales of previously occupied homes may slow in the coming months. The report, which was weaker than many economists had expected, helped push stocks lower for much of the morning. They were roughly flat by midday, and spent the afternoon swapping small bumps and dips.<br/>\u3000<br/>The Dow closed down 14.05 points, or 0.1 percent, at 13,881.93. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.78, or 0.2 percent, to 1,500.18. The Nasdaq composite index added 4.59, or 0.2 percent, to 3,154.<br/>\u3000<br/>The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are rapidly approaching their all-time closing highs, reached on Oct. 9, 2007. The Dow is about 282 points below its high of 14,164.53; the S&amp;P 500 is 65 points shy of its record of 1,565.<br/>\u3000<br/>Economic data may be less likely to boost the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data have strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with PNC Asset Management Group.<br/>\u3000<br/>\"Before, even if you came in just at expectations, that was like a victory,\" he said. Because of the market's recent upturn, he said, \"you get less of a pop for just making the numbers.\"<br/>\u3000<br/>Among companies in the S&amp;P 500 that reported earnings yesterday, Biogen Idec Inc. said its fourth-quarter net income slipped nearly 3 percent because of a tax charge and higher expenses. Still, the biotech drug maker rose US$3.79, or 2.6 percent, to US$149.99.<br/>\u3000<br/>Roper Industries Inc., which makes medical and industrial equipment, said its fourth-quarter net income rose 18 percent. But the company issued mixed guidance for the current quarter and full year 2013. It fell 33 cents to US$118.50.<br/>\u3000<br/>Oil company Hess Inc. was the biggest gainer in the S&amp;P 500, adding 6.1 percent after the company said it plans to sell its US terminal network, shutter its New Jersey refinery and continue shifting its focus to exploration and production. Hess also said that the hedge fund Elliott Associates plans to seek regulatory approval to buy a major stake in the company. Hess rose US$3.58 to US$62.48.<br/>\u3000<br/>Several big tech companies reported their results after the market closed and saw big price swings in after-hours trading:<br/>\u3000<br/>- Web portal Yahoo Inc. rose 81 cents, or 4 percent, to US$21.12 after saying its fourth-quarter earnings topped analyst estimates as an upturn in its international investments helped end a three-year revenue slump.<br/>\u3000<br/>- Hard disk maker Seagate Technology PLC said it beat analysts' estimates in its results for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 28. It rose 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to US$38.10 after hours.<br/>\u3000<br/>- Cloud computing provider VMWare Inc. said its net income edged higher, but the company announced guidance that was far weaker than analysts had expected. VMWare lost US$10.83, or 11 percent, to US$87.49 after hours.<br/>\u3000<br/>Strong corporate earnings helped push the S&amp;P 500 through the 1,500 milestone Friday after several calm, relatively news-free weeks. In addition to companies' performance, traders have been encouraged by signals that housing market is improving steadily and hiring is picking up, albeit slowly.<br/>\u3000<br/>There will plenty of fresh data to drive trading this week, including retail sales, economic growth and the government's report on hiring and employment in January, which is due out Friday. More than one-fifth of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report fourth-quarter earnings this week.<br/>\u3000<br/>Stone said stocks are trading sideways in part because many investors are awaiting economic reports later this week, especially the employment report. There is agreement among economists and analysts that the economy slowed in the fourth quarter, he said, and this week's numbers will help answer the question of \"how slow, and how much did it impact employment.\"<br/>\u3000<br/>The yield in the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.97 percent from 1.95 percent late Friday, reflecting lower demand for ultra-safe investments. After yesterday's factory orders report, the yield rose briefly above 2 percent for the first time since April. A bond's yield rises as demand for it decreases.<br/>\u3000<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SHADLY-3375182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SHADLY2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57MK-HDJ1-JC5R-2394-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383971</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2014-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"911\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Benchmark Information Limited<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2013 Shanghai Daily Publishing House</copyright><publicationName>Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>January 30, 2013 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
