It may look as if people across Europe are enjoying the sunshine but for many, soaring temperatures are taking their toll and they are set to get hired to do the heat experience across much of Europe is down to a weather system over the Atlantic. It is created atmospheric treasure over the region, drawn up hot air from northern Africa and Spain. This means high temperatures. </p><p>Previous record temperatures of 38.5 degrees in Germany and 41.5 in France looks set to be beaten this week. In Paris, a Level three extreme heat plan has been activated. Level four, the maximum, has never been used. As part of the plan, 900 cool places have been set up including putting up temporary fountains and Mr Machine stated parks are being kept open at night for people to cool down in. 800,000 schoolchildren have had their exams postponed because of concerns about people's health. Comparisons are being drawn to the heat wave France experienced in August 2003. Almost 15,000 people died then and the president is urged people to be aware of the dangers. TRANSLATION: The most vulnerable people must be taken care of quickly because during this kind of episode, people who are sick, pregnant, newborns and the elderly are the most vulnerable. We must remain vigilant and have preventative measures in place to intervene as quickly as possible. It looks as if many people have heeded his advice dig there has been a rush at this store that sells fans and air conditioning units. And people will need plenty of this stuff. Rising humidity will make weather feel even hotter. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SE-7c8348b64f1d4d0db035d95a7377eb8c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-3981-JBH6-C42H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

In Paris, a Level three extreme heat plan has been activated. Level four, the maximum, has never been used. As part of the plan, 900 cool places have been set up including putting up temporary fountains and Mr Machine stated parks are being kept open at night for people to cool down in. </p><p>800,000 schoolchildren have had their exams postponed because of concerns about people's health. Comparisons are being drawn to the heat wave France experienced in August 2003. Almost 15,000 people died then and the president is urged people to be aware of the dangers. TRANSLATION: The most vulnerable people must be taken care of quickly because during this kind of episode, people who are sick, pregnant, newborns and the elderly are the most vulnerable. We must remain vigilant and have preventative measures in place to intervene as quickly as possible. It looks as if many people have heeded his advice dig there has been a rush at this store that sells fans and air conditioning units. And people will need plenty of this stuff. Rising humidity will make weather feel even hotter. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-44e3b775a9b947a69de1d04658c8fe36</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-3981-JBH6-C48K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild.

It may look as if people across Europe are enjoying the sunshine but for many, soaring temperatures are taking their toll and they are set to get hired to do the heat experience across much of Europe is down to a weather system over the Atlantic. It is created atmospheric treasure over the region, drawn up hot air from northern Africa and Spain. This means high temperatures. </p><p>Previous record temperatures of 38.5 degrees in Germany and 41.5 in France looks set to be beaten this week. In Paris, a Level three extreme heat plan has been activated. Level four, the maximum, has never been used. As part of the plan, 900 cool places have been set up including putting up temporary fountains and Mr Machine stated parks are being kept open at night for people to cool down in. 800,000 schoolchildren have had their exams postponed because of concerns about people's health. Comparisons are being drawn to the heat wave France experienced in August 2003. Almost 15,000 people died then and the president is urged people to be aware of the dangers. TRANSLATION: The most vulnerable people must be taken care of quickly because during this kind of episode, people who are sick, pregnant, newborns and the elderly are the most vulnerable. We must remain vigilant and have preventative measures in place to intervene as quickly as possible. It looks as if many people have heeded his advice dig there has been a rush at this store that sells fans and air conditioning units. And people will need plenty of this stuff. Rising humidity will make weather feel even hotter. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples.

It may look as if people across Europe are enjoying the sunshine but for many, soaring temperatures are taking their toll and they are set to get hired to do the heat experience across much of Europe is down to a weather system over the Atlantic. It is created atmospheric treasure over the region, drawn up hot air from northern Africa and Spain. This means high temperatures. </p><p>Previous record temperatures of 38.5 degrees in Germany and 41.5 in France looks set to be beaten this week. In Paris, a Level three extreme heat plan has been activated. Level four, the maximum, has never been used. As part of the plan, 900 cool places have been set up including putting up temporary fountains and Mr Machine stated parks are being kept open at night for people to cool down in. 800,000 schoolchildren have had their exams postponed because of concerns about people's health. Comparisons are being drawn to the heat wave France experienced in August 2003. Almost 15,000 people died then and the president is urged people to be aware of the dangers. TRANSLATION: The most vulnerable people must be taken care of quickly because during this kind of episode, people who are sick, pregnant, newborns and the elderly are the most vulnerable. We must remain vigilant and have preventative measures in place to intervene as quickly as possible. It looks as if many people have heeded his advice dig there has been a rush at this store that sells fans and air conditioning units. And people will need plenty of this stuff. Rising humidity will make weather feel even hotter. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples.

Almost 15,000 people died then and the president is urged people to be aware of the dangers. TRANSLATION: The most vulnerable people must be taken care of quickly because during this kind of episode, people who are sick, pregnant, newborns and the elderly are the most vulnerable. We must remain vigilant and have preventative measures in place to intervene as quickly as possible. It looks as if many people have heeded his advice dig there has been a rush at this store that sells fans and air conditioning units. </p><p>And people will need plenty of this stuff. Rising humidity will make weather feel even hotter. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants of animals that were taken decades ago from Africa. We have to do everything we can now to pay back what we did in the past, and one of the ways we can do it is to get involved in the conservation projects, like translocating of rhinos from European zoos back to Rwanda and helping establishing a new population in this African country. These are critically endangered Eastern Black Rhinos, brought together here from three different zoos in preparation for their 6,000</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-eff04480de51417faacb308599b11044</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-3981-JBH6-C42F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"812\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The streets will come alive with the vitality that we expect from the greatest urban environments, in a way that has never actually been seen before. Ever since, it's fair to say that things have not gone entirely to plan. Marc Cieslak has been back to Toronto to get the latest on the project. </p><p>Toronto, Canada's largest city. Its waterfront is undergoing redevelopment. Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the sister company to tech giant Google, has partnered with Waterfront Toronto, an agency set up by local government to manage the whole redevelopment. Sidewalk originally had plans to build a so-called \"Smart City\", on a 12 acre site in the rebuilt area. 307 is Sidewalk's test facility where ideas for this new development are prototyped. So what you're looking at right here is a prototype for a new paving system for our streets. This one is actually a permeable paper, here the water goes into the paver down into the ground itself. Up here you see a solar panel, testing the integration of lights into the pavers themselves. Jesse Schapins is the director of urban design at Sidewalk Labs, he's showing off some of the tech that it's testing before the company begins construction on the Quayside project. This one is testing a heating system embedded in the pavers, and we then heat the paver just enough so there is no ice that forms. Something we call the building raincoat, so for example it's a sunny day, it can adapt and provide more shade. If there is rain it can adapt to those conditions. Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals. There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead? Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-61f469baa68d4f05a94541e2bcd9f95e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-1M21-JBH6-C32R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

So around 18 months ago, when we heard that Google offshoot Sidewalk Labs was to take over an area of Toronto to build, from scratch, an entirely tech-first neighbourhood, well, we hightailed it over there to find out more - and excitement was in the air. The streets will come alive with the vitality that we expect from the greatest urban environments, in a way that has never actually been seen before. </p><p>Ever since, it's fair to say that things have not gone entirely to plan. Marc Cieslak has been back to Toronto to get the latest on the project. Toronto, Canada's largest city. Its waterfront is undergoing redevelopment. Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the sister company to tech giant Google, has partnered with Waterfront Toronto, an agency set up by local government to manage the whole redevelopment. Sidewalk originally had plans to build a so-called \"Smart City\", on a 12 acre site in the rebuilt area. 307 is Sidewalk's test facility where ideas for this new development are prototyped. So what you're looking at right here is a prototype for a new paving system for our streets. This one is actually a permeable paper, here the water goes into the paver down into the ground itself. Up here you see a solar panel, testing the integration of lights into the pavers themselves. Jesse Schapins is the director of urban design at Sidewalk Labs, he's showing off some of the tech that it's testing before the company begins construction on the Quayside project. This one is testing a heating system embedded in the pavers, and we then heat the paver just enough so there is no ice that forms. Something we call the building raincoat, so for example it's a sunny day, it can adapt and provide more shade. If there is rain it can adapt to those conditions. Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals. There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead? Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data.

Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals. There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead? Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-4897389c6c0543dd9a66934b73cd4e5e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-1M21-JBH6-C341-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The streets will come alive with the vitality that we expect from the greatest urban environments, in a way that has never actually been seen before. Ever since, it's fair to say that things have not gone entirely to plan. Marc Cieslak has been back to Toronto to get the latest on the project. </p><p>Toronto, Canada's largest city. Its waterfront is undergoing redevelopment. Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the sister company to tech giant Google, has partnered with Waterfront Toronto, an agency set up by local government to manage the whole redevelopment. Sidewalk originally had plans to build a so-called \"Smart City\", on a 12 acre site in the rebuilt area. 307 is Sidewalk's test facility where ideas for this new development are prototyped. So what you're looking at right here is a prototype for a new paving system for our streets. This one is actually a permeable paper, here the water goes into the paver down into the ground itself. Up here you see a solar panel, testing the integration of lights into the pavers themselves. Jesse Schapins is the director of urban design at Sidewalk Labs, he's showing off some of the tech that it's testing before the company begins construction on the Quayside project. This one is testing a heating system embedded in the pavers, and we then heat the paver just enough so there is no ice that forms. Something we call the building raincoat, so for example it's a sunny day, it can adapt and provide more shade. If there is rain it can adapt to those conditions. Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals.

Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there.

The streets will come alive with the vitality that we expect from the greatest urban environments, in a way that has never actually been seen before. Ever since, it's fair to say that things have not gone entirely to plan. Marc Cieslak has been back to Toronto to get the latest on the project. </p><p>Toronto, Canada's largest city. Its waterfront is undergoing redevelopment. Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the sister company to tech giant Google, has partnered with Waterfront Toronto, an agency set up by local government to manage the whole redevelopment. Sidewalk originally had plans to build a so-called \"Smart City\", on a 12 acre site in the rebuilt area. 307 is Sidewalk's test facility where ideas for this new development are prototyped. So what you're looking at right here is a prototype for a new paving system for our streets. This one is actually a permeable paper, here the water goes into the paver down into the ground itself. Up here you see a solar panel, testing the integration of lights into the pavers themselves. Jesse Schapins is the director of urban design at Sidewalk Labs, he's showing off some of the tech that it's testing before the company begins construction on the Quayside project. This one is testing a heating system embedded in the pavers, and we then heat the paver just enough so there is no ice that forms. Something we call the building raincoat, so for example it's a sunny day, it can adapt and provide more shade. If there is rain it can adapt to those conditions. Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals. There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead? Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WA-e772915bd8f0462cbe18657e921118c7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-1M21-JBH6-C330-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402024</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

So around 18 months ago, when we heard that Google offshoot Sidewalk Labs was to take over an area of Toronto to build, from scratch, an entirely tech-first neighbourhood, well, we hightailed it over there to find out more - and excitement was in the air. The streets will come alive with the vitality that we expect from the greatest urban environments, in a way that has never actually been seen before. </p><p>Ever since, it's fair to say that things have not gone entirely to plan. Marc Cieslak has been back to Toronto to get the latest on the project. Toronto, Canada's largest city. Its waterfront is undergoing redevelopment. Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the sister company to tech giant Google, has partnered with Waterfront Toronto, an agency set up by local government to manage the whole redevelopment. Sidewalk originally had plans to build a so-called \"Smart City\", on a 12 acre site in the rebuilt area. 307 is Sidewalk's test facility where ideas for this new development are prototyped. So what you're looking at right here is a prototype for a new paving system for our streets. This one is actually a permeable paper, here the water goes into the paver down into the ground itself. Up here you see a solar panel, testing the integration of lights into the pavers themselves. Jesse Schapins is the director of urban design at Sidewalk Labs, he's showing off some of the tech that it's testing before the company begins construction on the Quayside project. This one is testing a heating system embedded in the pavers, and we then heat the paver just enough so there is no ice that forms. Something we call the building raincoat, so for example it's a sunny day, it can adapt and provide more shade. If there is rain it can adapt to those conditions. Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals. There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead? Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data.

Something we call the building raincoat, so for example it's a sunny day, it can adapt and provide more shade. If there is rain it can adapt to those conditions. Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals. There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead? Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YN-58de763867064c76a70a8e6156445194</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-1M21-JBH6-C346-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402030</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The streets will come alive with the vitality that we expect from the greatest urban environments, in a way that has never actually been seen before. Ever since, it's fair to say that things have not gone entirely to plan. Marc Cieslak has been back to Toronto to get the latest on the project. </p><p>Toronto, Canada's largest city. Its waterfront is undergoing redevelopment. Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the sister company to tech giant Google, has partnered with Waterfront Toronto, an agency set up by local government to manage the whole redevelopment. Sidewalk originally had plans to build a so-called \"Smart City\", on a 12 acre site in the rebuilt area. 307 is Sidewalk's test facility where ideas for this new development are prototyped. So what you're looking at right here is a prototype for a new paving system for our streets. This one is actually a permeable paper, here the water goes into the paver down into the ground itself. Up here you see a solar panel, testing the integration of lights into the pavers themselves. Jesse Schapins is the director of urban design at Sidewalk Labs, he's showing off some of the tech that it's testing before the company begins construction on the Quayside project. This one is testing a heating system embedded in the pavers, and we then heat the paver just enough so there is no ice that forms. Something we call the building raincoat, so for example it's a sunny day, it can adapt and provide more shade. If there is rain it can adapt to those conditions. Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals. There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead? Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development.

The streets will come alive with the vitality that we expect from the greatest urban environments, in a way that has never actually been seen before. Ever since, it's fair to say that things have not gone entirely to plan. Marc Cieslak has been back to Toronto to get the latest on the project. </p><p>Toronto, Canada's largest city. Its waterfront is undergoing redevelopment. Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the sister company to tech giant Google, has partnered with Waterfront Toronto, an agency set up by local government to manage the whole redevelopment. Sidewalk originally had plans to build a so-called \"Smart City\", on a 12 acre site in the rebuilt area. 307 is Sidewalk's test facility where ideas for this new development are prototyped. So what you're looking at right here is a prototype for a new paving system for our streets. This one is actually a permeable paper, here the water goes into the paver down into the ground itself. Up here you see a solar panel, testing the integration of lights into the pavers themselves. Jesse Schapins is the director of urban design at Sidewalk Labs, he's showing off some of the tech that it's testing before the company begins construction on the Quayside project. This one is testing a heating system embedded in the pavers, and we then heat the paver just enough so there is no ice that forms. Something we call the building raincoat, so for example it's a sunny day, it can adapt and provide more shade. If there is rain it can adapt to those conditions. Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals. There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead? Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YL-773640d0ad0447c1b2a009a1c539c84c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-1M21-JBH6-C34J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400425</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The streets will come alive with the vitality that we expect from the greatest urban environments, in a way that has never actually been seen before. Ever since, it's fair to say that things have not gone entirely to plan. Marc Cieslak has been back to Toronto to get the latest on the project. </p><p>Toronto, Canada's largest city. Its waterfront is undergoing redevelopment. Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the sister company to tech giant Google, has partnered with Waterfront Toronto, an agency set up by local government to manage the whole redevelopment. Sidewalk originally had plans to build a so-called \"Smart City\", on a 12 acre site in the rebuilt area. 307 is Sidewalk's test facility where ideas for this new development are prototyped. So what you're looking at right here is a prototype for a new paving system for our streets. This one is actually a permeable paper, here the water goes into the paver down into the ground itself. Up here you see a solar panel, testing the integration of lights into the pavers themselves. Jesse Schapins is the director of urban design at Sidewalk Labs, he's showing off some of the tech that it's testing before the company begins construction on the Quayside project. This one is testing a heating system embedded in the pavers, and we then heat the paver just enough so there is no ice that forms. Something we call the building raincoat, so for example it's a sunny day, it can adapt and provide more shade. If there is rain it can adapt to those conditions. Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals. There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead? Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-2020f1f1cff94490a602b5fe33728579</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-1M21-JBH6-C34K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

This week, we have a ringside seat for a tussle in Toronto. Tablets versus teachers in Malawi, and it's a tech TKO down the gym. We all love a smart city. </p><p>So around 18 months ago, when we heard that Google offshoot Sidewalk Labs was to take over an area of Toronto to build, from scratch, an entirely tech-first neighbourhood, well, we hightailed it over there to find out more - and excitement was in the air. The streets will come alive with the vitality that we expect from the greatest urban environments, in a way that has never actually been seen before. Ever since, it's fair to say that things have not gone entirely to plan. Marc Cieslak has been back to Toronto to get the latest on the project. Toronto, Canada's largest city. Its waterfront is undergoing redevelopment. Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the sister company to tech giant Google, has partnered with Waterfront Toronto, an agency set up by local government to manage the whole redevelopment. Sidewalk originally had plans to build a so-called \"Smart City\", on a 12 acre site in the rebuilt area. 307 is Sidewalk's test facility where ideas for this new development are prototyped. So what you're looking at right here is a prototype for a new paving system for our streets. This one is actually a permeable paper, here the water goes into the paver down into the ground itself. Up here you see a solar panel, testing the integration of lights into the pavers themselves. Jesse Schapins is the director of urban design at Sidewalk Labs, he's showing off some of the tech that it's testing before the company begins construction on the Quayside project. This one is testing a heating system embedded in the pavers, and we then heat the paver just enough so there is no ice that forms. Something we call the building raincoat, so for example it's a sunny day, it can adapt and provide more shade. If there is rain it can adapt to those conditions. Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals. There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead? Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SC-579f0ea2ec6747ad884150deca080647</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-1M21-JBH6-C2YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"708\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data about what happens to it, who is going to manage it. </p><p>Governance, who has oversight of that data? What I would say is that this project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it's built on the established laws we already have in Canada. So it's not us actually that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, is actually proposed that it's an independent non-profit public sector entity, we have called an urban data trust, that will take responsibility for managing and using the collection of data in this place. Sidewalk Labs has just submitted its thousand-page long master plan document, that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto will need to closely examine the paperwork, and it says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm - timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfits, and how it's used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city projects around the world. That was Marc. Big tech companies offering services for free in return for data. It's a familiar theme from Toronto to Timbuktu. Originating in Silicon Valley, for some, this type of business transaction has come to define the age we live in, and its consequences, good and bad, are only just beginning to shake down. Jen Copestake has been looking at some of the most influential thinking in what is being described as \"surveillance capitalism\". We freely give out our personal data every day through the apps on our phones, conversations with smart home assistants or other so-called smart devices like toothbrushes and vacuums. It seems like an inevitable and perhaps even cheap price to pay for living in a digitally connected world, giving us access to free services, like Google's Search and Maps, and social media sites like Facebook. But the data we are giving away for free about our everyday lives is very valuable, and its exploitation is the basis of a new economic paradigm which author Shoshana Zuboff calls \"surveillance capitalism.\" She presented her book in Cambridge, also known as the UK's Silicon Valley. What surveillance capitalism does, is it claims private human experience, private human experience is unilaterally claimed to be brought into the marketplace, where it's translated into behavioural data. This behavioural data is combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence to create predictions of what people are going to do with their day, and what they might buy. Professor Zuboff detail how this capability to make money from behavioural data was first discovered by Google when the company was struggling in the wake of the dot com crash at the turn of the millennium. To boost ad revenue, Google mined its own exclusive data logs for the digital exhaust of people's online search behaviour. Google worked out that this extraneous data was valuable, and with the ability to process large amounts of data came the ability to discern trends in people's behaviour. This led to the development of highly tailored online advertising. Everyone is familiar with this. You go online and you search for tennis shoes, and then the next day you have ads for tennis shoes all over your pages. Those advertisers are buying Google's predictions about what we're going to do in the future. Professor Zuboff says these predictions have opened up a world where companies are even able to experiment with modifying human behaviour without our knowledge. In 2016 Google's spinoff Niantic created the wildly successful augmented reality game Pokemon Go, where people would run around collecting different</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SC-89e1ea14f1704ab0b9f2f755fa4b8fb8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-1M21-JBH6-C2WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought.

Interesting you use this phrase, of information tech and the internet being a weapon. Who is to blame for that the tech giants, and of course in the Western world there are the big five, which includes Microsoft, companies that ruthlessly exploited technology to dominate the marketplace. Looking back, do you think that was actually a mistake, the attitude that was brought to the table by Microsoft?</p><p> We made more than our share of mistakes. And I think it is an interesting story, because we had to learn. Part of what we had to learn was to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves, but as the way other people saw us. We had to learn to connect with the world. We needed to assume more responsibility. We needed to compromise and accept regulation as it was imposed on us, and in that story, I do think there are parallels for the tech sector as a whole today. Because it was tempting, of course, this was personified perhaps by Bill Gates more than anybody else, tempting to see this sort of geeky, extraordinarily smart business leader in a new enterprise, tech-oriented, who really was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge. But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-117846a122944fccb23bbe621bacf2db</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3X-MCM1-DY08-31S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"537\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead?</p><p> Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data about what happens to it, who is going to manage it. Governance, who has oversight of that data? What I would say is that this project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it's built on the established laws we already have in Canada. So it's not us actually that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, is actually proposed that it's an independent non-profit public sector entity, we have called an urban data trust, that will take responsibility for managing and using the collection of data in this place. Sidewalk Labs has just submitted its thousand-page long master plan document, that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto will need to closely examine the paperwork, and it says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm - timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfits, and how it's used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city projects around the world. That was Marc. Big tech companies offering services for free in return for data. It's a familiar theme from Toronto to Timbuktu. Originating in Silicon Valley, for some, this type of business transaction has come to define the age we live in, and its consequences, good and bad, are only just beginning to shake down. Jen Copestake has been looking at some of the most influential thinking in what is being described as \"surveillance capitalism\".

Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people.

The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data about what happens to it, who is going to manage it. Governance, who has oversight of that data? What I would say is that this project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it's built on the established laws we already have in Canada. So it's not us actually that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, is actually proposed that it's an independent non-profit public sector entity, we have called an urban data trust, that will take responsibility for managing and using the collection of data in this place. Sidewalk Labs has just submitted its thousand-page long master plan document, that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto will need to closely examine the paperwork, and it says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm - timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfits, and how it's used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city projects around the world.

But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data about what happens to it, who is going to manage it. Governance, who has oversight of that data? What I would say is that this project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it's built on the established laws we already have in Canada. So it's not us actually that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, is actually proposed that it's an independent non-profit public sector entity, we have called an urban data trust, that will take responsibility for managing and using the collection of data in this place. Sidewalk Labs has just submitted its thousand-page long master plan document, that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto will need to closely examine the paperwork, and it says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm - timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfits, and how it's used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city projects around the world. That was Marc. Big tech companies offering services for free in return for data. It's a familiar theme from Toronto to Timbuktu. Originating in Silicon Valley, for some, this type of business transaction has come to define the age we live in, and its consequences, good and bad, are only just beginning to shake down.

There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead?</p><p> Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data about what happens to it, who is going to manage it. Governance, who has oversight of that data? What I would say is that this project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it's built on the established laws we already have in Canada. So it's not us actually that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, is actually proposed that it's an independent non-profit public sector entity, we have called an urban data trust, that will take responsibility for managing and using the collection of data in this place. Sidewalk Labs has just submitted its thousand-page long master plan document, that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto will need to closely examine the paperwork, and it says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm - timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfits, and how it's used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city projects around the world. That was Marc. Big tech companies offering services for free in return for data. It's a familiar theme from Toronto to Timbuktu. Originating in Silicon Valley, for some, this type of business transaction has come to define the age we live in, and its consequences, good and bad, are only just beginning to shake down.

Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data about what happens to it, who is going to manage it. Governance, who has oversight of that data? What I would say is that this project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it's built on the established laws we already have in Canada. So it's not us actually that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, is actually proposed that it's an independent non-profit public sector entity, we have called an urban data trust, that will take responsibility for managing and using the collection of data in this place. Sidewalk Labs has just submitted its thousand-page long master plan document, that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto will need to closely examine the paperwork, and it says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm - timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfits, and how it's used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city projects around the world.

But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data about what happens to it, who is going to manage it. Governance, who has oversight of that data? What I would say is that this project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it's built on the established laws we already have in Canada. So it's not us actually that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, is actually proposed that it's an independent non-profit public sector entity, we have called an urban data trust, that will take responsibility for managing and using the collection of data in this place. Sidewalk Labs has just submitted its thousand-page long master plan document, that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto will need to closely examine the paperwork, and it says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm - timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfits, and how it's used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city projects around the world.

There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead?</p><p> Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data about what happens to it, who is going to manage it. Governance, who has oversight of that data? What I would say is that this project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it's built on the established laws we already have in Canada. So it's not us actually that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, is actually proposed that it's an independent non-profit public sector entity, we have called an urban data trust, that will take responsibility for managing and using the collection of data in this place. Sidewalk Labs has just submitted its thousand-page long master plan document, that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto will need to closely examine the paperwork, and it says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm - timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfits, and how it's used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city projects around the world. That was Marc. Big tech companies offering services for free in return for data. It's a familiar theme from Toronto to Timbuktu. Originating in Silicon Valley, for some, this type of business transaction has come to define the age we live in, and its consequences, good and bad, are only just beginning to shake down. Jen Copestake has been looking at some of the most influential thinking in what is being described as \"surveillance capitalism\".

We needed to assume more responsibility. We needed to compromise and accept regulation as it was imposed on us, and in that story, I do think there are parallels for the tech sector as a whole today. </p><p>Because it was tempting, of course, this was personified perhaps by Bill Gates more than anybody else, tempting to see this sort of geeky, extraordinarily smart business leader in a new enterprise, tech-oriented, who really was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge. But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data. Goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and our laptops and our tablets to acquire and use information, and thereby to also provide information about ourselves to tech companies such as yours.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WA-39092a41b3cb4c6888a5cda00039f432</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X44-KJS1-JBH6-C193-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402024</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data.
