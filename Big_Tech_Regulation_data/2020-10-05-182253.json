Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solarpanel options for his two-storey home in Mount Tabor, N.J., 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw an ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"US$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found some of these ads directed people to solarenergy websites that listed the same address - a mailbox in Carlsbad, Calif. - that had been used by a firm once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. In 2012, FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company - Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 dough - for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a US$1-million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4d Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings. Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business.</p><p>Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers.</p><p>Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc.</p><p>The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers, Marinello said. \"That's how this whole process plays out.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist.</p><p>While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn't make that information available for other ads until Thursday, when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address - a mailbox in Carlsbad, California - that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency.

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist.</p><p>While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.apnews.com/3d2dde3338924c9faaf08b05af65f06e\">launched a searchable database</url> that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn't make that information available for other ads until Thursday, when it       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/a-better-way-to-learn-about-ads/\">announced</url> it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ads.twitter.com/transparency\">database</url> of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/library?hl=en\">archive</url> for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov.

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist.</p><p>While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn't make that information available for other ads until Thursday, when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address - a mailbox in Carlsbad, California - that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company - then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough - for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine.

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor \u2014 and sometimes President Donald Trump \u2014 to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p> Those incentives don't exist.</p><p> While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly \u2014 and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads \u2014 they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p> The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections \u2014 and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation \u2014 loom.</p><p> \"This is definitely concerning \u2014 definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p> Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p> This screenshot shows a website re-directed from ads on Facebook promising big state tax incentives. (Solar Rebate via AP)</p><p> Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn't make that information available for other ads until Thursday, when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p> The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p> \"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p> In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p> \"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p> Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p> Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p> After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p> \"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p> The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address \u2014 a mailbox in Carlsbad, California \u2014 that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company \u2014 then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough \u2014 for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p> Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings.</p><p> Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business.</p><p> Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers.</p><p> Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello, vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc.</p><p> The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers, Marinello said. \"That's how this whole process plays out.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTN-fbf887577899aac8f3e55068834fe4ef967eb8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289CA52CE0BF85 NWBKTN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT3-0WC1-JBCN-409M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401981</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"951\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Local TV LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist.</p><p>While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn't make that information available for other ads until Thursday, when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address - a mailbox in Carlsbad, California - that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company - then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough - for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings.</p><p>Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business.</p><p>Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers.</p><p>Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello, vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc.</p><p>The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers, Marinello said. \"That's how this whole process plays out.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press investigative researcher Randy Herschaft contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-8cf28e6863c043e2acced0ed7979efb6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT1-P2N1-JC65-51V1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"931\"/><timeReceived>10:52 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist.</p><p>While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn't make that information available for other ads until Thursday, when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address - a mailbox in Carlsbad, California - that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company - then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough - for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings.</p><p>Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business.</p><p>Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers.</p><p>Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello, vice-president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc.</p><p>The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers, Marinello said. \"That's how this whole process plays out.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press investigative researcher Randy Herschaft contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-8cf28e6863c043e2acced0ed7979efb6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTH-V8F1-DY9S-T0B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"931\"/><timeReceived>06:52 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

There was just one catch: None of it was true. The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor and sometimes President Donald Trump to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p>Those incentives don\u2019t exist.</p><p>   While the ads didn\u2019t aim to bilk people of money directly  and it wasn\u2019t possible to buy solar panels through these ads  they led towebsites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future comeons,  both scammy and legitimate. It\u2019s not clear that the data was actually  used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn\u2019t take action until notified by state-government  officials who noticed the ads. The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation  for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing  misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections  and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation  loom.</p><p>   \u2018\u2018This is definitely concerning  definitely, it\u2019s misinformation,\u2019\u2019said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \u2018\u2018I keep telling people: We don\u2019t have any basis to regulate such a thing.\u2019\u2019</p><p>   Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>   Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn\u2019t make that information available for other ads until Thursday,  when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKWI-20190403A07art3xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28969EBB989C43 NWBKWI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT4-4MB1-DXVP-V48B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409764</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"357\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Conley Publishing Group Ltd.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Sixteen months later, here's how that turned out.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The streets of Davos, Switzerland, were iced over on the night of January 25, 2018, which added a slight element of danger to the prospect of trekking to the Hotel Seehof for George Soros' annual banquet. The aged financier has a tradition of hosting a dinner at the World Economic Forum, where he regales tycoons, ministers, and journalists with his thoughts about the state of the world. That night he began by warning in his quiet, shaking Hungarian accent about nuclear war and climate change. Then he shifted to his next idea of a global menace: Google and Facebook. \"Mining and oil companies exploit the physical environment; social media companies exploit the social environment,\" he said. \"The owners of the platform giants consider themselves the masters of the universe, but in fact they are slaves to preserving their dominant position ... Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered.\"</p><p>Across town, a group of senior Facebook executives, including COO Sheryl Sandberg and vice president of global communications Elliot Schrage, had set up a temporary headquarters near the base of the mountain where Thomas Mann put his fictional sanatorium. The world's biggest companies often establish receiving rooms at the world's biggest elite confab, but this year Facebook's pavilion wasn't the usual scene of airy bonhomie. It was more like a bunker-one that saw a succession of tense meetings with the same tycoons, ministers, and journalists who had nodded along to Soros' broadside.</p><p>Over the previous year Facebook's stock had gone up as usual, but its reputation was rapidly sinking toward junk bond status. The world had learned how Russian intelligence operatives used the platform to manipulate US voters. Genocidal monks in Myanmar and a despot in the Philippines had taken a liking to the platform. Mid-level employees at the company were getting both crankier and more empowered, and critics everywhere were arguing that Facebook's tools fostered tribalism and outrage. That argument gained credence with every utterance of Donald Trump, who had arrived in Davos that morning, the outrageous tribalist skunk at the globalists' garden party.</p><p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg had recently pledged to spend 2018 trying to fix Facebook. But even the company's nascent attempts to reform itself were being scrutinized as a possible declaration of war on the institutions of democracy. Earlier that month Facebook had unveiled a major change to its News Feed rankings to favor what the company called \"meaningful social interactions.\" News Feed is the core of Facebook-the central stream through which flow baby pictures, press reports, New Age koans, and Russian-made memes showing Satan endorsing Hillary Clinton. The changes would favor interactions between friends, which meant, among other things, that they would disfavor stories published by media companies. The company promised, though, that the blow would be softened somewhat for local news and publications that scored high on a user-driven metric of \"trustworthiness.\"</p><p>Davos provided a first chance for many media executives to confront Facebook's leaders about these changes. And so, one by one, testy publishers and editors trudged down Davos Platz to Facebook's headquarters throughout the week, ice cleats attached to their boots, seeking clarity. Facebook had become a capricious, godlike force in the lives of news organizations; it fed them about a third of their referral traffic while devouring a greater and greater share of the advertising revenue the media industry relies on. And now this. Why? Why would a company beset by fake news stick a knife into real news? And what would Facebook's algorithm deem trustworthy? Would the media executives even get to see their own scores?</p><p>Facebook didn't have ready answers to all of these questions; certainly not ones it wanted to give. The last one in particular-about trustworthiness scores-quickly inspired a heated debate among the company's executives at Davos and their colleagues in Menlo Park. Some leaders, including Schrage, wanted to tell publishers their scores. It was only fair. Also in agreement was Campbell Brown, the company's chief liaison with news publishers, whose job description includes absorbing some of the impact when Facebook and the news industry crash into one another.</p><p>But the engineers and product managers back at home in California said it was folly. Adam Mosseri, then head of News Feed, argued in emails that publishers would game the system if they knew their scores. Plus, they were too unsophisticated to understand the methodology, and the scores would constantly change anyway. To make matters worse, the company didn't yet have a reliable measure of trustworthiness at hand.</p><p>Heated emails flew back and forth between Switzerland and Menlo Park. Solutions were proposed and shot down. It was a classic Facebook dilemma. The company's algorithms embraid choices so complex and interdependent that it's hard for any human to get a handle on it all. If you explain some of what is happening, people get confused. They also tend to obsess over tiny factors in huge equations. So in this case, as in so many others over the years, Facebook chose opacity. Nothing would be revealed in Davos, and nothing would be revealed afterward. The media execs would walk away unsatisfied.</p><p>After Soros' speech that Thursday night, those same editors and publishers headed back to their hotels, many to write, edit, or at least read all the news pouring out about the billionaire's tirade. The words \"their days are numbered\" appeared in article after article. The next day, Sandberg sent an email to Schrage asking if he knew whether Soros had shorted Facebook's stock.</p><p>Far from Davos, meanwhile, Facebook's product engineers got down to the precise, algorithmic business of implementing Zuckerberg's vision. If you want to promote trustworthy news for billions of people, you first have to specify what is trustworthy and what is news. Facebook was having a hard time with both. To define trustworthiness, the company was testing how people responded to surveys about their impressions of different publishers. To define news, the engineers pulled a classification system left over from a previous project-one that pegged the category as stories involving \"politics, crime, or tragedy.\"</p><p>That particular choice, which meant the algorithm would be less kind to all kinds of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">other</emphasis> news-from health and science to technology and sports-wasn't something Facebook execs discussed with media leaders in Davos. And though it went through reviews with senior managers, not everyone at the company knew about it either. When one Facebook executive learned about it recently in a briefing with a lower-level engineer, they say they \"nearly fell on the fucking floor.\"</p><p>The confusing rollout of meaningful social interactions-marked by internal dissent, blistering external criticism, genuine efforts at reform, and foolish mistakes-set the stage for Facebook's 2018. This is the story of that annus horribilis, based on interviews with 65 current and former employees. It's ultimately a story about the biggest shifts ever to take place inside the world's biggest social network. But it's also about a company trapped by its own pathologies and, perversely, by the inexorable logic of its own recipe for success.</p><p>Facebook's powerful network effects have kept advertisers from fleeing, and overall user numbers remain healthy if you include people on Instagram, which Facebook owns. But the company's original culture and mission kept creating a set of brutal debts that came due with regularity over the past 16 months. The company floundered, dissembled, and apologized. Even when it told the truth, people didn't believe it. Critics appeared on all sides, demanding changes that ranged from the essential to the contradictory to the impossible. As crises multiplied and diverged, even the company's own solutions began to cannibalize each other.</p><p>And the most crucial episode in this story-the crisis that cut the deepest-began not long after Davos, when some reporters from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Guardian</emphasis>, and Britain's Channel 4 News came calling. They'd learned some troubling things about a shady British company called Cambridge Analytica, and they had some questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">II.</emphasis></p><p>It was, in some ways, an old story. Back in 2014, a young academic at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan built a personality questionnaire app called thisisyourdigitallife. A few hundred thousand people signed up, giving Kogan access not only to their Facebook data but also-because of Facebook's loose privacy policies at the time-to that of up to 87 million people in their combined friend networks. Rather than simply use all of that data for research purposes, which he had permission to do, Kogan passed the trove on to Cambridge Analytica, a strategic consulting firm that talked a big game about its ability to model and manipulate human behavior for political clients. In December 2015, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Guardian</emphasis> reported that Cambridge Analytica had used this data to help Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, at which point Facebook demanded the data be deleted.</p><p>This much Facebook knew in the early months of 2018. The company also knew-because everyone knew-that Cambridge Analytica had gone on to work with the Trump campaign after Ted Cruz dropped out of the race. And some people at Facebook worried that the story of their company's relationship with Cambridge Analytica was not over. One former Facebook communications official remembers being warned by a manager in the summer of 2017 that unresolved elements of the Cambridge Analytica story remained a grave vulnerability. No one at Facebook, however, knew exactly when or where the unexploded ordnance would go off. \"The company doesn't know yet what it doesn't know yet,\" the manager said. (The manager now denies saying so.)</p><p>The company first heard in late February that the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Guardian</emphasis> had a story coming, but the department in charge of formulating a response was a house divided. In the fall, Facebook had hired a brilliant but fiery veteran of tech industry PR named Rachel Whetstone. She'd come over from Uber to run communications for Facebook's WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. Soon she was traveling with Zuckerberg for public events, joining Sandberg's senior management meetings, and making decisions-like picking which outside public relations firms to cut or retain-that normally would have rested with those officially in charge of Facebook's 300-person communications shop. The staff quickly sorted into fans and haters.</p><p>And so it was that a confused and fractious communications team huddled with management to debate how to respond to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Guardian</emphasis> reporters. The standard approach would have been to correct misinformation or errors and spin the company's side of the story. Facebook ultimately chose another tack. It would front-run the press: dump a bunch of information out in public on the eve of the stories' publication, hoping to upstage them. It's a tactic with a short-term benefit but a long-term cost. Investigative journalists are like pit bulls. Kick them once and they'll never trust you again.</p><p>Facebook's decision to take that risk, according to multiple people involved, was a close call. But on the night of Friday, March 16, the company announced it was suspending Cambridge Analytica from its platform. This was a fateful choice. \"It's why the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times</emphasis> hates us,\" one senior executive says. Another communications official says, \"For the last year, I've had to talk to reporters worried that we were going to front-run them. It's the worst. Whatever the calculus, it wasn't worth it.\"</p><p>The tactic also didn't work. The next day the story-focused on a charismatic whistle-blower with pink hair named Christopher Wylie-exploded in Europe and the United States. Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, was claiming that the company had not deleted the data it had taken from Facebook and that it may have used that data to swing the American presidential election. The first sentence of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Guardian</emphasis>'s reporting blared that this was \"one of the tech giant's biggest ever data breaches\" and that Cambridge Analytica had used the data \"to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.\"</p><p>The story was a witch's brew of Russian operatives, privacy violations, confusing data, and Donald Trump. It touched on nearly all the fraught issues of the moment. Politicians called for regulation; users called for boycotts. In a day, Facebook lost $36 billion in its market cap. Because many of its employees were compensated based on the stock's performance, the drop did not go unnoticed in Menlo Park.</p><p>To this emotional story, Facebook had a programmer's rational response. Nearly every fact in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Guardian</emphasis>'s opening paragraph was misleading, its leaders believed. The company hadn't been breached-an academic had fairly downloaded data with permission and then unfairly handed it off. And the software that Cambridge Analytica built was not powerful, nor could it predict or influence choices at the ballot box.</p><p>But none of that mattered. When a Facebook executive named Alex Stamos tried on Twitter to argue that the word <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">breach</emphasis> was being misused, he was swatted down. He soon deleted his tweets. His position was right, but who cares? If someone points a gun at you and holds up a sign that says HAND'S UP, you shouldn't worry about the apostrophe. The story was the first of many to illuminate one of the central ironies of Facebook's struggles. The company's algorithms helped sustain a news ecosystem that prioritizes outrage, and that news ecosystem was learning to direct outrage at Facebook.</p><p>As the story spread, the company started melting down. Former employees remember scenes of chaos, with exhausted executives slipping in and out of Zuckerberg's private conference room, known as the Aquarium, and Sandberg's conference room, whose name, Only Good News, seemed increasingly incongruous. One employee remembers cans and snack wrappers everywhere; the door to the Aquarium would crack open and you could see people with their heads in their hands and feel the warmth from all the body heat. After saying too much before the story ran, the company said too little afterward. Senior managers begged Sandberg and Zuckerberg to publicly confront the issue. Both remained publicly silent.</p><p>\"We had hundreds of reporters flooding our inboxes, and we had nothing to tell them,\" says a member of the communications staff at the time. \"I remember walking to one of the cafeterias and overhearing other Facebookers say, 'Why aren't we saying anything? Why is nothing happening?' \"</p><p>According to numerous people who were involved, many factors contributed to Facebook's baffling decision to stay mute for five days. Executives didn't want a repeat of Zuckerberg's ignominious performance after the 2016 election when, mostly off the cuff, he had proclaimed it \"a pretty crazy idea\" to think fake news had affected the result. And they continued to believe people would figure out that Cambridge Analytica's data had been useless. According to one executive, \"You can just buy all this fucking stuff, all this data, from the third-party ad networks that are tracking you all over the planet. You can get way, way, way more privacy-violating data from all these data brokers than you could by stealing it from Facebook.\"</p><p>\"Those five days were very, very long,\" says Sandberg, who now acknowledges the delay was a mistake. The company became paralyzed, she says, because it didn't know all the facts; it thought Cambridge Analytica had deleted the data. And it didn't have a specific problem to fix. The loose privacy policies that allowed Kogan to collect so much data had been tightened years before. \"We didn't know how to respond in a system of imperfect information,\" she says.</p><p>Facebook's other problem was that it didn't understand the wealth of antipathy that had built up against it over the previous two years. Its prime decisionmakers had run the same playbook successfully for a decade and a half: Do what they thought was best for the platform's growth (often at the expense of user privacy), apologize if someone complained, and keep pushing forward. Or, as the old slogan went: Move fast and break things. Now the public thought Facebook had broken Western democracy. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This</emphasis> privacy violation-unlike the many others before it-wasn't one that people would simply get over.</p><p>Finally, on Wednesday, the company decided Zuckerberg should give a television interview. After snubbing CBS and PBS, the company summoned a CNN reporter who the communications staff trusted to be reasonably kind. The network's camera crews were treated like potential spies, and one communications official remembers being required to monitor them even when they went to the bathroom. (Facebook now says this was not company protocol.) In the interview itself, Zuckerberg apologized. But he was also specific: There would be audits and much more restrictive rules for anyone wanting access to Facebook data. Facebook would build a tool to let users know if their data had ended up with Cambridge Analytica. And he pledged that Facebook would make sure this kind of debacle never happened again.</p><p>A flurry of other interviews followed. That Wednesday, WIRED was given a quiet heads-up that we'd get to chat with Zuckerberg in the late afternoon. At about 4:45 pm, his communications chief rang to say he would be calling at 5. In that interview, Zuckerberg apologized again. But he brightened when he turned to one of the topics that, according to people close to him, truly engaged his imagination: using AI to keep humans from polluting Facebook. This was less a response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal than to the backlog of accusations, gathering since 2016, that Facebook had become a cesspool of toxic virality, but it was a problem he actually enjoyed figuring out how to solve. He didn't think that AI could completely eliminate hate speech or nudity or spam, but it could get close. \"My understanding with food safety is there's a certain amount of dust that can get into the chicken as it's going through the processing, and it's not a large amount-it needs to be a very small amount,\" he told WIRED.</p><p>The interviews were just the warmup for Zuckerberg's next gauntlet: A set of public, televised appearances in April before three congressional committees to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and months of other scandals. Congresspeople had been calling on him to testify for about a year, and he'd successfully avoided them. Now it was game time, and much of Facebook was terrified about how it would go.</p><p>As it turned out, most of the lawmakers proved astonishingly uninformed, and the CEO spent most of the day ably swatting back soft pitches. Back home, some Facebook employees stood in their cubicles and cheered. When a plodding Senator Orrin Hatch asked how, exactly, Facebook made money while offering its services for free, Zuckerberg responded confidently, \"Senator, we run ads,\" a phrase that was soon emblazoned on T-shirts in Menlo Park.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">III.</emphasis></p><p>The Saturday after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Sandberg told Molly Cutler, a top lawyer at Facebook, to create a crisis response team. Make sure we never have a delay responding to big issues like that again, Sandberg said. She put Cutler's new desk next to hers, to guarantee Cutler would have no problem convincing division heads to work with her. \"I started the role that Monday,\" Cutler says. \"I never made it back to my old desk. After a couple of weeks someone on the legal team messaged me and said, 'You want us to pack up your things? It seems like you are not coming back.' \"</p><p>Then Sandberg and Zuckerberg began making a huge show of hiring humans to keep watch over the platform. Soon you couldn't listen to a briefing or meet an executive without being told about the tens of thousands of content moderators who had joined the company. By the end of 2018, about 30,000 people were working on safety and security, which is roughly the number of newsroom employees at all the newspapers in the United States. Of those, about 15,000 are content reviewers, mostly contractors, employed at more than 20 giant review factories around the world.</p><p>Facebook was also working hard to create clear rules for enforcing its basic policies, effectively writing a constitution for the 1.5 billion daily users of the platform. The instructions for moderating hate speech alone run to more than 200 pages. Moderators must undergo 80 hours of training before they can start. Among other things, they must be fluent in emoji; they study, for example, a document showing that a crown, roses, and dollar signs might mean a pimp is offering up prostitutes. About 100 people across the company meet every other Tuesday to review the policies. A similar group meets every Friday to review content policy enforcement screwups, like when, as happened in early July, the company flagged the Declaration of Independence as hate speech.</p><p>The company hired all of these people in no small part because of pressure from its critics. It was also the company's fate, however, that the same critics discovered that moderating content on Facebook can be a miserable, soul-scorching job. As Casey Newton reported in an investigation for the Verge, the average content moderator in a Facebook contractor's outpost in Arizona makes $28,000 per year, and many of them say they have developed PTSD-like symptoms due to their work. Others have spent so much time looking through conspiracy theories that they've become believers themselves.</p><p>Ultimately, Facebook knows that the job will have to be done primarily by machines-which is the company's preference anyway. Machines can browse porn all day without flatlining, and they haven't learned to unionize yet. And so simultaneously the company mounted a huge effort, led by CTO Mike Schroepfer, to create artificial intelligence systems that can, at scale, identify the content that Facebook wants to zap from its platform, including spam, nudes, hate speech, ISIS propaganda, and videos of children being put in washing machines. An even trickier goal was to identify the stuff that Facebook wants to demote but not eliminate-like misleading clickbait crap. Over the past several years, the core AI team at Facebook has doubled in size annually.</p><p>By the time the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger were already worried that Zuckerberg was souring on them.</emphasis></p><p>Even a basic machine-learning system can pretty reliably identify and block pornography or images of graphic violence. Hate speech is much harder. A sentence can be hateful or prideful depending on who says it. \"You not my bitch, then bitch you are done,\" could be a death threat, an inspiration, or a lyric from Cardi B. Imagine trying to decode a similarly complex line in Spanish, Mandarin, or Burmese. False news is equally tricky. Facebook doesn't want lies or bull on the platform. But it knows that truth can be a kaleidoscope. Well-meaning people get things wrong on the internet; malevolent actors sometimes get things right.</p><p>Schroepfer's job was to get Facebook's AI up to snuff on catching even these devilishly ambiguous forms of content. With each category the tools and the success rate vary. But the basic technique is roughly the same: You need a collection of data that has been categorized, and then you need to train the machines on it. For spam and nudity these databases already exist, created by hand in more innocent days when the threats online were fake Viagra and Goatse memes, not Vladimir Putin and Nazis. In the other categories you need to construct the labeled data sets yourself-ideally without hiring an army of humans to do so.</p><p>One idea Schroepfer discussed enthusiastically with WIRED involved starting off with just a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">few</emphasis> examples of content identified by humans as hate speech and then using AI to generate similar content and simultaneously label it. Like a scientist bioengineering both rodents and rat terriers, this approach would use software to both create and identify ever-more-complex slurs, insults, and racist crap. Eventually the terriers, specially trained on superpowered rats, could be set loose across all of Facebook.</p><p>The company's efforts in AI that screens content were nowhere roughly three years ago. But Facebook quickly found success in classifying spam and posts supporting terror. Now more than 99 percent of content created in those categories is identified before any human on the platform flags it. Sex, as in the rest of human life, is more complicated. The success rate for identifying nudity is 96 percent. Hate speech is even tougher: Facebook finds just 52 percent before users do.</p><p>These are the kinds of problems that Facebook executives love to talk about. They involve math and logic, and the people who work at the company are some of the most logical you'll ever meet. But Cambridge Analytica was mostly a privacy scandal. Facebook's most visible response to it was to amp up content moderation aimed at keeping the platform safe and civil. Yet sometimes the two big values involved-privacy and civility-come into opposition. If you give people ways to keep their data completely secret, you also create secret tunnels where rats can scurry around undetected.</p><p>In other words, every choice involves a trade-off, and every trade-off means some value has been spurned. And every value that you spurn-particularly when you're Facebook in 2018-means that a hammer is going to come down on your head.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IV.</emphasis></p><p>Crises offer opportunities. They force you to make some changes, but they also provide cover for the changes you've long wanted to make. And four weeks after Zuckerberg's testimony before Congress, the company initiated the biggest reshuffle in its history. About a dozen executives shifted chairs. Most important, Chris Cox, longtime head of Facebook's core product-known internally as the Blue App-would now oversee WhatsApp and Instagram too. Cox was perhaps Zuckerberg's closest and most trusted confidant, and it seemed like succession planning. Adam Mosseri moved over to run product at Instagram.</p><p>Instagram, which was founded in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, had been acquired by Facebook in 2012 for $1 billion. The price at the time seemed ludicrously high: That much money for a company with 13 employees? Soon the price would seem ludicrously low: A mere billion dollars for the fastest-growing social network in the world? Internally, Facebook at first watched Instagram's relentless growth with pride. But, according to some, pride turned to suspicion as the pupil's success matched and then surpassed the professor's.</p><p>Systrom's glowing press coverage didn't help. In 2014, according to someone directly involved, Zuckerberg ordered that no other executives should sit for magazine profiles without his or Sandberg's approval. Some people involved remember this as a move to make it harder for rivals to find employees to poach; others remember it as a direct effort to contain Systrom. Top executives at Facebook also believed that Instagram's growth was cannibalizing the Blue App. In 2017, Cox's team showed data to senior executives suggesting that people were sharing less inside the Blue App in part because of Instagram. To some people, this sounded like they were simply presenting a problem to solve. Others were stunned and took it as a sign that management at Facebook cared more about the product they had birthed than one they had adopted.</p><p>Most of Instagram-and some of Facebook too-hated the idea that the growth of the photo-sharing app could be seen, in any way, as trouble. Yes, people were using the Blue App less and Instagram more. But that didn't mean Instagram was poaching users. Maybe people leaving the Blue App would have spent their time on Snapchat or watching Netflix or mowing their lawns. And if Instagram was growing quickly, maybe it was because the product was good? Instagram had its problems-bullying, shaming, FOMO, propaganda, corrupt micro-influencers-but its internal architecture had helped it avoid some of the demons that haunted the industry. Posts are hard to reshare, which slows virality. External links are harder to embed, which keeps the fake-news providers away. Minimalist design also minimized problems. For years, Systrom and Krieger took pride in keeping Instagram free of hamburgers: icons made of three horizontal lines in the corner of a screen that open a menu. Facebook has hamburgers, and other menus, all over the place.</p><p>Systrom and Krieger had also seemingly anticipated the techlash ahead of their colleagues up the road in Menlo Park. Even before Trump's election, Instagram had made fighting toxic comments its top priority, and it had rolled out an AI filtering system in June 2017. By the spring of 2018, the company was working on a product to alert users that \"you're all caught up\" when they'd seen all the new posts in their feed. In other words, \"put your damn phone down and talk to your friends.\" That may be a counterintuitive way to grow, but earning goodwill does help over the long run. And sacrificing growth for other goals wasn't Facebook's style at all.</p><p>By the time the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit, Systrom and Krieger, according to people familiar with their thinking, were already worried that Zuckerberg was souring on them. They had been allowed to run their company reasonably independently for six years, but now Zuckerberg was exerting more control and making more requests. When conversations about the reorganization began, the Instagram founders pushed to bring in Mosseri. They liked him, and they viewed him as the most trustworthy member of Zuckerberg's inner circle. He had a design background and a mathematical mind. They were losing autonomy, so they might as well get the most trusted emissary from the mothership. Or as Lyndon Johnson said about J. Edgar Hoover, \"It's probably better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the founders of WhatsApp, Brian Acton and Jan Koum, had moved outside of Facebook's tent and commenced fire. Zuckerberg had bought the encrypted messaging platform in 2014 for $19 billion, but the cultures had never entirely meshed. The two sides couldn't agree on how to make money-WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption wasn't originally designed to support targeted ads-and they had other differences as well. WhatsApp insisted on having its own conference rooms, and, in the perfect metaphor for the two companies' diverging attitudes over privacy, WhatsApp employees had special bathroom stalls designed with doors that went down to the floor, unlike the standard ones used by the rest of Facebook.</p><p>Eventually the battles became too much for Acton and Koum, who had also come to believe that Facebook no longer intended to leave them alone. Acton quit and started funding a competing messaging platform called Signal. During the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he tweeted, \"It is time. #deletefacebook.\" Soon afterward, Koum, who held a seat on Facebook's board, announced that he too was quitting, to play more Ultimate Frisbee and work on his collection of air-cooled Porsches.</p><p>The departure of the WhatsApp founders created a brief spasm of bad press. But now Acton and Koum were gone, Mosseri was in place, and Cox was running all three messaging platforms. And that meant Facebook could truly pursue its most ambitious and important idea of 2018: bringing all those platforms together into something new.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">V.</emphasis></p><p>By the late spring, news organizations-even as they jockeyed for scoops about the latest meltdown in Menlo Park-were starting to buckle under the pain caused by Facebook's algorithmic changes. Back in May of 2017, according to Parse.ly, Facebook drove about 40 percent of all outside traffic to news publishers. A year later it was down to 25 percent. Publishers that weren't in the category \"politics, crime, or tragedy\" were hit much harder.</p><p>At WIRED, the month after an image of a bruised Zuckerberg appeared on the cover, the numbers were even more stark. One day, traffic from Facebook suddenly dropped by 90 percent, and for four weeks it stayed there. After protestations, emails, and a raised eyebrow or two about the coincidence, Facebook finally got to the bottom of it. An ad run by a liquor advertiser, targeted at WIRED readers, had been mistakenly categorized as engagement bait by the platform. In response, the algorithm had let all the air out of WIRED's tires. The publication could post whatever it wanted, but few would read it. Once the error was identified, traffic soared back. It was a reminder that journalists are just sharecroppers on Facebook's giant farm. And sometimes conditions on the farm can change without warning.</p><p>Inside Facebook, of course, it was not surprising that traffic to publishers went down after the pivot to \"meaningful social interactions.\" That outcome was the point. It meant people would be spending more time on posts created by their friends and family, the genuinely unique content that Facebook offers. According to multiple Facebook employees, a handful of executives considered it a small plus, too, that the news industry was feeling a little pain after all its negative coverage. The company denies this-\"no one at Facebook is rooting against the news industry,\" says Anne Kornblut, the company's director of news partnerships-but, in any case, by early May the pain seemed to have become perhaps excessive. A number of stories appeared in the press about the damage done by the algorithmic changes. And so Sheryl Sandberg, who colleagues say often responds with agitation to negative news stories, sent an email on May 7 calling a meeting of her top lieutenants.</p><p>That kicked off a wide-ranging conversation that ensued over the next two months. The key question was whether the company should introduce new factors into its algorithm to help serious publications. The product team working on news wanted Facebook to increase the amount of public content-things shared by news organizations, businesses, celebrities-allowed in News Feed. They also wanted the company to provide stronger boosts to publishers deemed trustworthy, and they suggested the company hire a large team of human curators to elevate the highest-quality news inside of News Feed. The company discussed setting up a new section on the app entirely for news and directed a team to quietly work on developing it; one of the team's ambitions was to try to build a competitor to Apple News.</p><p>Some of the company's most senior execs, notably Chris Cox, agreed that Facebook needed to give serious publishers a leg up. Others pushed back, especially Joel Kaplan, a former deputy chief of staff to George W. Bush who was now Facebook's vice president of global public policy. Supporting high-quality outlets would inevitably make it look like the platform was supporting liberals, which could lead to trouble in Washington, a town run mainly by conservatives. Breitbart and the Daily Caller, Kaplan argued, deserved protections too. At the end of the climactic meeting, on July 9, Zuckerberg sided with Kaplan and announced that he was tabling the decision about adding ways to boost publishers, effectively killing the plan. To one person involved in the meeting, it seemed like a sign of shifting power. Cox had lost and Kaplan had won. Either way, Facebook's overall traffic to news organizations continued to plummet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VI.</emphasis></p><p>That same evening, Donald Trump announced that he had a new pick for the Supreme Court: Brett Kavanaugh. As the choice was announced, Joel Kaplan stood in the background at the White House, smiling. Kaplan and Kavanaugh had become friends in the Bush White House, and their families had become intertwined. They had taken part in each other's weddings; their wives were best friends; their kids rode bikes together. No one at Facebook seemed to really notice or care, and a tweet pointing out Kaplan's attendance was retweeted a mere 13 times.</p><p>Meanwhile, the dynamics inside the communications department had gotten even worse. Elliot Schrage had announced that he was going to leave his post as VP of global communications. So the company had begun looking for his replacement; it focused on interviewing candidates from the political world, including Denis McDonough and Lisa Monaco, former senior officials in the Obama administration. But Rachel Whetstone also declared that she wanted the job. At least two other executives said they would quit if she got it.</p><p>The need for leadership in communications only became more apparent on July 11, when John Hegeman, the new head of News Feed, was asked in an interview why the company didn't ban Alex Jones' InfoWars from the platform. The honest answer would probably have been to just admit that Facebook gives a rather wide berth to the far right because it's so worried about being called liberal. Hegeman, though, went with the following: \"We created Facebook to be a place where different people can have a voice. And different publishers have very different points of view.\"</p><p>This, predictably, didn't go over well with the segments of the news media that actually try to tell the truth and that have never, as Alex Jones has done, reported that the children massacred at Sandy Hook were actors. Public fury ensued. Most of Facebook didn't want to respond. But Whetstone decided it was worth a try. She took to the @facebook account-which one executive involved in the decision called \"a big fucking marshmallow we shouldn't ever use like this\"-and started tweeting at the company's critics.</p><p>\"Sorry you feel that way,\" she typed to one, and explained that, instead of banning pages that peddle false information, Facebook demotes them. The tweet was very quickly ratioed, a Twitter term of art for a statement that no one likes and that receives more comments than retweets. Whetstone, as @facebook, also declared that just as many pages on the left pump out misinformation as on the right. That tweet got badly ratioed too.</p><p>Five days later, Zuckerberg sat down for an interview with Kara Swisher, the influential editor of Recode. Whetstone was in charge of prep. Before Zuckerberg headed to the microphone, Whetstone supplied him with a list of rough talking points, including one that inexplicably violated the first rule of American civic discourse: Don't invoke the Holocaust while trying to make a nuanced point.</p><p>About 20 minutes into the interview, while ambling through his answer to a question about Alex Jones, Zuckerberg declared, \"I'm Jewish, and there's a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened. I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down, because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong.\" Sometimes, Zuckerberg added, he himself makes errors in public statements.</p><p>The comment was absurd: People who deny that the Holocaust happened generally aren't just slipping up in the midst of a good-faith intellectual disagreement. They're spreading anti-Semitic hate-intentionally. Soon the company announced that it had taken a closer look at Jones' activity on the platform and had finally chosen to ban him. His past sins, Facebook decided, had crossed into the domain of standards violations.</p><p>Eventually another candidate for the top PR job was brought into the headquarters in Menlo Park: Nick Clegg, former deputy prime minister of the UK. Perhaps in an effort to disguise himself-or perhaps because he had decided to go aggressively Silicon Valley casual-he showed up in jeans, sneakers, and an untucked shirt. His interviews must have gone better than his disguise, though, as he was hired over the luminaries from Washington. \"What makes him incredibly well qualified,\" said Caryn Marooney, the company's VP of communications, \"is that he helped run a country.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VII.</emphasis></p><p>At the end of July, facebook was scheduled to report its quarterly earnings in a call to investors. The numbers were not going to be good; Facebook's user base had grown more slowly than ever, and revenue growth was taking a huge hit from the company's investments in hardening the platform against abuse. But in advance of the call, the company's leaders were nursing an additional concern: how to put Instagram in its place. According to someone who saw the relevant communications, Zuckerberg and his closest lieutenants were debating via email whether to say, essentially, that Instagram owed its spectacular growth not primarily to its founders and vision but to its relationship with Facebook.</p><p>Zuckerberg wanted to include a line to this effect in his script for the call. Whetstone counseled him not to, or at least to temper it with praise for Instagram's founding team. In the end, Zuckerberg's script declared, \"We believe Instagram has been able to use Facebook's infrastructure to grow more than twice as quickly as it would have on its own. A big congratulations to the Instagram team-and to all the teams across our company that have contributed to this success.\"</p><p>After the call-with its payload of bad news about growth and investment-Facebook's stock dropped by nearly 20 percent. But Zuckerberg didn't forget about Instagram. A few days later he asked his head of growth, Javier Olivan, to draw up a list of all the ways Facebook supported Instagram: running ads for it on the Blue App; including link-backs when someone posted a photo on Instagram and then cross-published it in Facebook News Feed; allowing Instagram to access a new user's Facebook connections in order to recommend people to follow. Once he had the list, Zuckerberg conveyed to Instagram's leaders that he was pulling away the supports. Facebook had given Instagram servers, health insurance, and the best engineers in the world. Now Instagram was just being asked to give a little back-and to help seal off the vents that were allowing people to leak away from the Blue App.</p><p>Systrom soon posted a memo to his entire staff explaining Zuckerberg's decision to turn off supports for traffic to Instagram. He disagreed with the move, but he was committed to the changes and was telling his staff that they had to go along. The memo \"was like a flame going up inside the company,\" a former senior manager says. The document also enraged Facebook, which was terrified it would leak. Systrom soon departed on paternity leave.</p><p>The tensions didn't let up. In the middle of August, Facebook prototyped a location-tracking service inside of Instagram, the kind of privacy intrusion that Instagram's management team had long resisted. In August, a hamburger menu appeared. \"It felt very personal,\" says a senior Instagram employee who spent the month implementing the changes. It felt particularly wrong, the employee says, because Facebook is a data-driven company, and the data strongly suggested that Instagram's growth was good for everyone.</p><p>Friends of Systrom and Krieger say the strife was wearing on the founders too. According to someone who heard the conversation, Systrom openly wondered whether Zuckerberg was treating him the way Donald Trump was treating Jeff Sessions: making life miserable in hopes that he'd quit without having to be fired. Instagram's managers also believed that Facebook was being miserly about their budget. In past years they had been able to almost double their number of engineers. In the summer of 2018 they were told that their growth rate would drop to less than half of that.</p><p>When it was time for Systrom to return from paternity leave, the two founders decided to make the leave permanent. They made the decision quickly, but it was far from impulsive. According to someone familiar with their thinking, their unhappiness with Facebook stemmed from tensions that had brewed over many years and had boiled over in the past six months.</p><p>And so, on a Monday morning, Systrom and Krieger went into Chris Cox's office and told him the news. Systrom and Krieger then notified their team about the decision. Somehow the information reached Mike Isaac, a reporter at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis>, before it reached the communications teams for either Facebook or Instagram. The story appeared online a few hours later, as Instagram's head of communications was on a flight circling above New York City.</p><p>After the announcement, Systrom and Krieger decided to play nice. Soon there was a lovely photograph of the two founders smiling next to Mosseri, the obvious choice to replace them. And then they headed off into the unknown to take time off, decompress, and figure out what comes next. Systrom and Krieger told friends they both wanted to get back into coding after so many years away from it. If you need a new job, it's good to learn how to code.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VIII.</emphasis></p><p>Just a few days after systrom and Krieger quit, Joel Kaplan roared into the news. His dear friend Brett Kavanaugh was now not just a conservative appellate judge with Federalist Society views on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Roe v. Wade</emphasis>; he had become an alleged sexual assailant, purported gang rapist, and national symbol of toxic masculinity to somewhere between 49 and 51 percent of the country. As the charges multiplied, Kaplan's wife, Laura Cox Kaplan, became one of the most prominent women defending him: She appeared on Fox News and asked, \"What does it mean for men in the future? It's very serious and very troubling.\" She also spoke at an #IStandWithBrett press conference that was livestreamed on Breitbart.</p><p>On September 27, Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee after four hours of wrenching recollections by his primary accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. Laura Cox Kaplan sat right behind him as the hearing descended into rage and recrimination. Joel Kaplan sat one row back, stoic and thoughtful, directly in view of the cameras broadcasting the scene to the world.</p><p>Kaplan isn't widely known outside of Facebook. But he's not anonymous, and he wasn't wearing a fake mustache. As Kavanaugh testified, journalists started tweeting a screenshot of the tableau. At a meeting in Menlo Park, executives passed around a phone showing one of these tweets and stared, mouths agape. None of them knew Kaplan was going to be there. The man who was supposed to smooth over Facebook's political dramas had inserted the company right into the middle of one.</p><p>Kaplan had long been friends with Sandberg; they'd even dated as undergraduates at Harvard. But despite rumors to the contrary, he had told neither her nor Zuckerberg that he would be at the hearing, much less that he would be sitting in the gallery of supporters behind the star witness. \"He's too smart to do that,\" one executive who works with him says. \"That way, Joel gets to go. Facebook gets to remind people that it employs Republicans. Sheryl gets to be shocked. And Mark gets to denounce it.\"</p><p>If that was the plan, it worked to perfection. Soon Facebook's internal message boards were lighting up with employees mortified at what Kaplan had done. Management's initial response was limp and lame: A communications officer told the staff that Kaplan attended the hearing as part of a planned day off in his personal capacity. That wasn't a good move. Someone visited the human resources portal and noted that he hadn't filed to take the day off.</p><p>The hearings were on a Thursday. A week and a day later, Facebook called an all-hands to discuss what had happened. The giant cafeteria in Facebook's headquarters was cleared to create space for a town hall. Hundreds of chairs were arranged with three aisles to accommodate people with questions and comments. Most of them were from women who came forward to recount their own experiences of sexual assault, harassment, and abuse.</p><p>Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and other members of management were standing on the right side of the stage, facing the audience and the moderator. Whenever a question was asked of one of them, they would stand up and take the mic. Kaplan appeared via video conference looking, according to one viewer, like a hostage trying to smile while his captors stood just offscreen. Another participant described him as \"looking like someone had just shot his dog in the face.\" This participant added, \"I don't think there was a single male participant, except for Zuckerberg looking down and sad onstage and Kaplan looking dumbfounded on the screen.\"</p><p>Employees who watched expressed different emotions. Some felt empowered and moved by the voices of women in a company where top management is overwhelmingly male. Another said, \"My eyes rolled to the back of my head\" watching people make specific personnel demands of Zuckerberg, including that Kaplan undergo sensitivity training. For much of the staff, it was cathartic. Facebook was finally reckoning, in a way, with the #MeToo movement and the profound bias toward men in Silicon Valley. For others it all seemed ludicrous, narcissistic, and emblematic of the liberal, politically correct bubble that the company occupies. A guy had sat in silence to support his best friend who had been nominated to the Supreme Court; as a consequence, he needed to be publicly flogged?</p><p>In the days after the hearings, Facebook organized small group discussions, led by managers, in which 10 or so people got together to discuss the issue. There were tears, grievances, emotions, debate. \"It was a really bizarre confluence of a lot of issues that were popped in the zit that was the SCOTUS hearing,\" one participant says. Kaplan, though, seemed to have moved on. The day after his appearance on the conference call, he hosted a party to celebrate Kavanaugh's lifetime appointment. Some colleagues were aghast. According to one who had taken his side during the town hall, this was a step too far. That was \"just spiking the football,\" they said. Sandberg was more forgiving. \"It's his house,\" she told WIRED. \"That is a very different decision than sitting at a public hearing.\"</p><p>In a year during which Facebook made endless errors, Kaplan's insertion of the company into a political maelstrom seemed like one of the clumsiest. But in retrospect, Facebook executives aren't sure that Kaplan did lasting harm. His blunder opened up a series of useful conversations in a workplace that had long focused more on coding than inclusion. Also, according to another executive, the episode and the press that followed surely helped appease the company's would-be regulators. It's useful to remind the Republicans who run most of Washington that Facebook isn't staffed entirely by snowflakes and libs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">One of Facebook's superpowers in 2018 was the ability to turn any critic,</emphasis> no matter how absurd, into a media hero.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IX.</emphasis></p><p>That summer and early fall weren't kind to the team at Facebook charged with managing the company's relationship with the news industry. At least two product managers on the team quit, telling colleagues they had done so because of the company's cavalier attitude toward the media. In August, a jet-lagged Campbell Brown gave a presentation to publishers in Australia in which she declared that they could either work together to create new digital business models or not. If they didn't, well, she'd be unfortunately holding hands with their dying business, like in a hospice. Her off-the-record comments were put on the record by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Australian</emphasis>, a publication owned by Rupert Murdoch, a canny and persistent antagonist of Facebook.</p><p>In September, however, the news team managed to convince Zuckerberg to start administering ice water to the parched executives of the news industry. That month, Tom Alison, one of the team's leaders, circulated a document to most of Facebook's senior managers; it began by proclaiming that, on news, \"we lack clear strategy and alignment.\"</p><p>Then, at a meeting of the company's leaders, Alison made a series of recommendations, including that Facebook should expand its definition of news-and its algorithmic boosts-beyond just the category of \"politics, crime, or tragedy.\" Stories about politics were bound to do well in the Trump era, no matter how Facebook tweaked its algorithm. But the company could tell that the changes it had introduced at the beginning of the year hadn't had the intended effect of slowing the political venom pulsing through the platform. In fact, by giving a slight tailwind to politics, tragedy, and crime, Facebook had helped build a news ecosystem that resembled the front pages of a tempestuous tabloid. Or, for that matter, the front page of FoxNews.com. That fall, Fox was netting more engagement on Facebook than any other English-language publisher; its list of most-shared stories was a goulash of politics, crime, and tragedy. (The network's three most-shared posts that month were an article alleging that China was burning bibles, another about a Bill Clinton rape accuser, and a third that featured Laura Cox Kaplan and #IStandWithBrett.)</p><p>That September meeting was a moment when Facebook decided to start paying indulgences to make up for some of its sins against journalism. It decided to put hundreds of millions of dollars toward supporting local news, the sector of the industry most disrupted by Silicon Valley; Brown would lead the effort, which would involve helping to find sustainable new business models for journalism. Alison proposed that the company move ahead with the plan hatched in June to create an entirely new section on the Facebook app for news. And, crucially, the company committed to developing new classifiers that would expand the definition of news beyond \"politics, crime, or tragedy.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg didn't sign off on everything all at once. But people left the room feeling like he had subscribed. Facebook had spent much of the year holding the media industry upside down by the feet. Now Facebook was setting it down and handing it a wad of cash.</p><p>As Facebook veered from crisis to crisis, something else was starting to happen: The tools the company had built were beginning to work. The three biggest initiatives for the year had been integrating WhatsApp, Instagram, and the Blue App into a more seamless entity; eliminating toxic content; and refocusing News Feed on meaningful social interactions. The company was making progress on all fronts. The apps were becoming a family, partly through divorce and arranged marriage but a family nonetheless. Toxic content was indeed disappearing from the platform. In September, economists at Stanford and New York University revealed research estimating that user interactions with fake news on the platform had declined by 65 percent from their peak in December 2016 to the summer of 2018. On Twitter, meanwhile, the number had climbed.</p><p>There wasn't much time, however, for anyone to absorb the good news. Right after the Kavanaugh hearings, the company announced that, for the first time, it had been badly breached. In an <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ocean's 11</emphasis>-style heist, hackers had figured out an ingenious way to take control of user accounts through a quirk in a feature that makes it easier for people to play Happy Birthday videos for their friends. The breach was both serious and absurd, and it pointed to a deep problem with Facebook. By adding so many features to boost engagement, it had created vectors for intrusion. One virtue of simple products is that they are simpler to defend.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">X.</emphasis></p><p>Given the sheer number of people who accused Facebook of breaking democracy in 2016, the company approached the November 2018 US midterm elections with trepidation. It worried that the tools of the platform made it easier for candidates to suppress votes than get them out. And it knew that Russian operatives were studying AI as closely as the engineers on Mike Schroepfer's team.</p><p>So in preparation for Brazil's October 28 presidential election and the US midterms nine days later, the company created what it called \"election war rooms\"-a term despised by at least some of the actual combat veterans at the company. The rooms were partly a media prop, but still, three dozen people worked nearly around the clock inside of them to minimize false news and other integrity issues across the platform. Ultimately the elections passed with little incident, perhaps because Facebook did a good job, perhaps because a US Cyber Command operation temporarily knocked Russia's primary troll farm offline.</p><p>Facebook got a boost of good press from the effort, but the company in 2018 was like a football team that follows every hard-fought victory with a butt fumble and a 30-point loss. In mid-November, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis> published an impressively reported stem-winder about trouble at the company. The most damning revelation was that Facebook had hired an opposition research firm called Definers to investigate, among other things, whether George Soros was funding groups critical of the company. Definers was also directly connected to a dubious news operation whose stories were often picked up by Breitbart.</p><p>After the story broke, Zuckerberg plausibly declared that he knew nothing about Definers. Sandberg, less plausibly, did the same. Numerous people inside the company were convinced that she entirely understood what Definers did, though she strongly maintains that she did not. Meanwhile, Schrage, who had announced his resignation but never actually left, decided to take the fall. He declared that the Definers project was his fault; it was his communications department that had hired the firm, he said. But several Facebook employees who spoke with WIRED believe that Schrage's assumption of responsibility was just a way to gain favor with Sandberg.</p><p>Inside Facebook, people were furious at Sandberg, believing she had asked them to dissemble on her behalf with her Definers denials. Sandberg, like everyone, is human. She's brilliant, inspirational, and more organized than Marie Kondo. Once, on a cross-country plane ride back from a conference, a former Facebook executive watched her quietly spend five hours sending thank-you notes to everyone she'd met at the event-while everyone else was chatting and drinking. But Sandberg also has a temper, an ego, and a detailed memory for subordinates she thinks have made mistakes. For years, no one had a negative word to say about her. She was a highly successful feminist icon, the best-selling author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lean In</emphasis>, running operations at one of the most powerful companies in the world. And she had done so under immense personal strain since her husband died in 2015.</p><p>But resentment had been building for years, and after the Definers mess the dam collapsed. She was pummeled in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times</emphasis>, in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Washington Post</emphasis>, on Breitbart, and in WIRED. Former employees who had refrained from criticizing her in interviews conducted with WIRED in 2017 relayed anecdotes about her intimidation tactics and penchant for retribution in 2018. She was slammed after a speech in Munich. She even got dinged by Michelle Obama, who told a sold-out crowd at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 1, \"It's not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesn't work all the time.\"</p><p>Everywhere, in fact, it was becoming harder to be a Facebook employee. Attrition increased from 2017, though Facebook says it was still below the industry norm, and people stopped broadcasting their place of employment. The company's head of cybersecurity policy was swatted in his Palo Alto home. \"When I joined Facebook in 2016, my mom was so proud of me, and I could walk around with my Facebook backpack all over the world and people would stop and say, 'It's so cool that you worked for Facebook.' That's not the case anymore,\" a former product manager says. \"It made it hard to go home for Thanksgiving.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XI.</emphasis></p><p>By the holidays in 2018, facebook was beginning to seem like Monty Python's Black Knight: hacked down to a torso hopping on one leg but still filled with confidence. The Alex Jones, Holocaust, Kaplan, hack, and Definers scandals had all happened in four months. The heads of WhatsApp and Instagram had quit. The stock price was at its lowest level in nearly two years. In the middle of that, Facebook chose to launch a video chat service called Portal. Reviewers thought it was great, except for the fact that Facebook had designed it, which made them fear it was essentially a spycam for people's houses. Even internal tests at Facebook had shown that people responded to a description of the product better when they didn't know who had made it.</p><p>Two weeks later, the Black Knight lost his other leg. A British member of parliament named Damian Collins had obtained hundreds of pages of internal Facebook emails from 2012 through 2015. Ironically, his committee had gotten them from a sleazy company that helped people search for photos of Facebook users in bikinis. But one of Facebook's superpowers in 2018 was the ability to turn any critic, no matter how absurd, into a media hero. And so, without much warning, Collins released them to the world.</p><p>The emails, many of them between Zuckerberg and top executives, lent a brutally concrete validation to the idea that Facebook promoted growth at the expense of almost any other value. In one message from 2015, an employee acknowledged that collecting the call logs of Android users is a \"pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective.\" He said he could imagine the news stories about Facebook invading people's private lives \"in ever more terrifying ways.\" But, he added, \"it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it.\" (It did.)</p><p>Perhaps the most telling email is a message from a then executive named Sam Lessin to Zuckerberg that epitomizes Facebook's penchant for self-justification. The company, Lessin wrote, could be ruthless <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and</emphasis> committed to social good at the same time, because they are essentially the same thing: \"Our mission is to make the world more open and connected and the only way we can do that is with the best people and the best infrastructure, which requires that we make a lot of money / be very profitable.\"</p><p>The message also highlighted another of the company's original sins: its assertion that if you just give people better tools for sharing, the world will be a better place. That's just false. Sometimes Facebook makes the world more open and connected; sometimes it makes it more closed and disaffected. Despots and demagogues have proven to be just as adept at using Facebook as democrats and dreamers. Like the communications innovations before it-the printing press, the telephone, the internet itself-Facebook is a revolutionary tool. But human nature has stayed the same.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XII.</emphasis></p><p>Perhaps the oddest single day in Facebook's recent history came on January 30, 2019. A story had just appeared on TechCrunch reporting yet another apparent sin against privacy: For two years, Facebook had been conducting market research with an app that paid you in return for sucking private data from your phone. Facebook could read your social media posts, your emoji sexts, and your browser history. Your soul, or at least whatever part of it you put into your phone, was worth up to $20 a month.</p><p>Other big tech companies do research of this sort as well. But the program sounded creepy, particularly with the revelation that people as young as 13 could join with a parent's permission. Worse, Facebook seemed to have deployed the app while wearing a ski mask and gloves to hide its fingerprints. Apple had banned such research apps from its main App Store, but Facebook had fashioned a workaround: Apple allows companies to develop their own in-house iPhone apps for use solely by employees-for booking conference rooms, testing beta versions of products, and the like. Facebook used one of these internal apps to disseminate its market research tool to the public.</p><p>Apple cares a lot about privacy, and it cares that you know it cares about privacy. It also likes to ensure that people honor its rules. So shortly after the story was published, Apple responded by shutting down all of Facebook's in-house iPhone apps. By the middle of that Wednesday afternoon, parts of Facebook's campus stopped functioning. Applications that enabled employees to book meetings, see cafeteria menus, and catch the right shuttle bus flickered out. Employees around the world suddenly couldn't communicate via messenger with each other on their phones. The mood internally shifted between outraged and amused-with employees joking that they had missed their meetings because of Tim Cook. Facebook's cavalier approach to privacy had now poltergeisted itself on the company's own lunch menus.</p><p>But then something else happened. A few hours after Facebook's engineers wandered back from their mystery meals, Facebook held an earnings call. Profits, after a months-long slump, had hit a new record. The number of daily users in Canada and the US, after stagnating for three quarters, had risen slightly. The stock surged, and suddenly all seemed well in the world. Inside a conference room called Relativity, Zuckerberg smiled and told research analysts about all the company's success. At the same table sat Caryn Marooney, the company's head of communications. \"It felt like the old Mark,\" she said. \"This sense of 'We're going to fix a lot of things and build a lot of things.' \" Employees couldn't get their shuttle bus schedules, but within 24 hours the company was worth about $50 billion more than it had been worth the day before.</p><p>Less than a week after the boffo earnings call, the company gathered for another all-hands. The heads of security and ads spoke about their work and the pride they take in it. Nick Clegg told everyone that they had to start seeing themselves the way the world sees them, not the way they would like to be perceived. It seemed to observers as though management actually had its act together after a long time of looking like a man in lead boots trying to cross a lightly frozen lake. \"It was a combination of realistic and optimistic that we hadn't gotten right in two years,\" one executive says.</p><p>Soon it was back to bedlam, though. Shortly after the all-hands, a parliamentary committee in the UK published a report calling the company a bunch of \"digital gangsters.\" A German regulatory authority cracked down on a significant portion of the company's ad business. And news broke that the FTC in Washington was negotiating with the company and reportedly considering a multibillion-dollar fine due in part to Cambridge Analytica. Later, Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren published a proposal to break Facebook apart. She promoted her idea with ads on Facebook, using a modified version of the company's logo-an act specifically banned by Facebook's terms of service. Naturally, the company spotted the violation and took the ads down. Warren quickly denounced the move as censorship, even as Facebook restored the ads.</p><p>It was the perfect Facebook moment for a new year. By enforcing its own rules, the company had created an outrage cycle about Facebook-inside of a larger outrage cycle about Facebook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XIII.</emphasis></p><p>This January, George Soros gave another speech on a freezing night in Davos. This time he described a different menace to the world: China. The most populous country on earth, he said, is building AI systems that could become tools for totalitarian control. \"For open societies,\" he said, \"they pose a mortal threat.\" He described the world as in the midst of a cold war. Afterward, one of the authors of this article asked him which side Facebook and Google are on. \"Facebook and the others are on the side of their own profits,\" the financier answered.</p><p>The response epitomized one of the most common critiques of the company now: Everything it does is based on its own interests and enrichment. The massive efforts at reform are cynical and deceptive. Yes, the company's privacy settings are much clearer now than a year ago, and certain advertisers can no longer target users based on their age, gender, or race, but those changes were made at gunpoint. The company's AI filters help, sure, but they exist to placate advertisers who don't want their detergent ads next to jihadist videos. The company says it has abandoned \"Move fast and break things\" as its motto, but the guest Wi-Fi password at headquarters remains \"M0vefast.\" Sandberg and Zuckerberg continue to apologize, but the apologies seem practiced and insincere.</p><p>At a deeper level, critics note that Facebook continues to pay for its original sin of ignoring privacy and fixating on growth. And then there's the existential question of whether the company's business model is even compatible with its stated mission: The idea of Facebook is to bring people together, but the business model only works by slicing and dicing users into small groups for the sake of ad targeting. Is it possible to have those two things work simultaneously?</p><p>To its credit, though, Facebook has addressed some of its deepest issues. For years, smart critics have bemoaned the perverse incentives created by Facebook's annual bonus program, which pays people in large part based on the company hitting growth targets. In February, that policy was changed. Everyone is now given bonuses based on how well the company achieves its goals on a metric of social good.</p><p>Another deep critique is that Facebook simply sped up the flow of information to a point where society couldn't handle it. Now the company has started to slow it down. The company's fake-news fighters focus on information that's going viral. WhatsApp has been reengineered to limit the number of people with whom any message can be shared. And internally, according to several employees, people communicate better than they did a year ago. The world might not be getting more open and connected, but at least Facebook's internal operations are.</p><p>In early March, Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would, from then on, follow an entirely different philosophy. He published a 3,200-word treatise explaining that the company that had spent more than a decade playing fast and loose with privacy would now prioritize it. Messages would be encrypted end to end. Servers would not be located in authoritarian countries. And much of this would happen with a further integration of Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Rather than WhatsApp becoming more like Facebook, it sounded like Facebook was going to become more like WhatsApp. When asked by WIRED how hard it would be to reorganize the company around the new vision, Zuckerberg said, \"You have no idea how hard it is.\"</p><p>Just how hard it was became clear the next week. As Facebook knows well, every choice involves a trade-off, and every trade-off involves a cost. The decision to prioritize encryption and interoperability meant, in some ways, a decision to deprioritize safety and civility. According to people involved in the decision, Chris Cox, long Zuckerberg's most trusted lieutenant, disagreed with the direction. The company was finally figuring out how to combat hate speech and false news; it was breaking bread with the media after years of hostility. Now Facebook was setting itself up to both solve and create all kinds of new problems. And so in the middle of March, Cox announced that he was leaving. A few hours after the news broke, a shooter in New Zealand livestreamed on Facebook his murderous attack on a mosque.</p><p>Sandberg says that much of her job these days involves harm prevention; she's also overseeing the various audits and investigations of the company's missteps. \"It's going to take real time to go backwards,\" she told WIRED, \"and figure out everything that could have happened.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg, meanwhile, remains obsessed with moving forward. In a note to his followers to start the year, he said one of his goals was to host a series of conversations about technology: \"I'm going to put myself out there more.\" The first such event, a conversation with the internet law scholar Jonathan Zittrain, took place at Harvard Law School in late winter. Near the end of their exchange, Zittrain asked Zuckerberg what Facebook might look like 10 or so years from now. The CEO mused about developing a device that would allow humans to type by thinking. It sounded incredibly cool at first. But by the time he was done, it sounded like he was describing a tool that would allow Facebook to read people's minds. Zittrain cut in dryly: \"The Fifth Amendment implications are staggering.\" Zuckerberg suddenly appeared to understand that perhaps mind-reading technology is the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">last</emphasis> thing the CEO of Facebook should be talking about right now. \"Presumably this would be something someone would choose to use,\" he said, before adding, \"I don't know how we got onto this.\"</p><h>15 Months of Hell at Facebook</h><p>In a volatile year of scandals, resignations, and platform overhauls, the company's stock soared to a record $217 a share and slumped to $124, with wild swings in between.<br/>-Zak Jason</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">January 11</emphasis><br/>Facebook alters its News Feed to favor \"meaningful social interactions,\" hampering traffic to news publishers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">April 30</emphasis><br/>Jan Koum resigns, following fellow WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton, who had recently told the world to #deletefacebook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">September 24</emphasis><br/>Instagram cofounders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger resign.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">September 27</emphasis><br/>Joel Kaplan, a Facebook VP, sits behind his friend Brett Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on sexual assault allegations against the future Supreme Court justice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">January 30</emphasis><br/>Facebook announces record profits, even as TechCrunch reports that the company broke Apple's rules to siphon data from the phones of users as young as 13.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">March 17</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Guardian</emphasis> reveals that Cambridge Analytica secretly acquired data for at least 50 million Facebook users before it joined forces with the Trump campaign.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">April 10</emphasis><br/>Zuckerberg testifies before Congress about Cambridge Analytica and explains the company's business to confused legislators: \"Senator, we run ads.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">July 25</emphasis><br/>Facebook reports meager second-quarter earnings and warns that revenue growth will be slow through 2019; the stock plunges 19 percent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">November 15</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis> reveals that Facebook commissioned opposition research on its critic George Soros.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">March 6</emphasis><br/>Zuckerberg publishes a 3,200-word Facebook post on the \"privacy-focused\" future of the platform.</p><h>What Facebook Fears</h><p>In some ways, the world's largest social network is stronger than ever, with record revenue of $55.8 billion in 2018.

In 2018, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation forced Facebook to allow users to access and delete more of their data.

According to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis>, federal prosecutors have also begun a criminal investigation into Facebook's data-sharing deals with other technology companies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">User Exodus</emphasis></p><p>Although a fifth of the globe uses Facebook every day, the number of adult users in the US has largely stagnated.

And now Mr. Trump is furious this is all leaked out. Later where live for you in Washington.</p><p>Hello, and welcome. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi where the time is 7 o'clock in the evening.</p><p>Pressure is mounting on Facebook and on the U.K. data firm, Cambridge Analytica. They are both at the center of a growing storm over what some are calling the exploitation of millions of Facebook users personal information. Facebook now agreeing to speak to Congress. Lawmakers want answers to how those details were used to target users for political adverts.</p><p>The scientists at the center of this says, Facebook is making them a scapegoat. Aleksandr Kogan tells CNN he had virtually no idea what the data was going to be used for.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALEKSANDR KOGAN, SCIENTIST AT THE CENTER OF FACEBOOK BREACH: We did collect 50 million people, my side. But we only gave CL/Cambridge Analytica 30 million people that we could confirm were from the United States.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR, ANDERSON COOPER 360: And what kind of information about those 30 million people where you provided?</p><p>Kogan: Yes, so it was basically their public profile. Things like name, age, gender and location. And then these really noisy personality predictions and that was like almost for everybody I was basically at.</p><p>COOPER: Well, when you are offering your data to Cambridge Analytica you knew who Cambridge Analytica -- I mean, you knew what they -- did you know what they were going to do with it? Did you know what their interest was?</p><p>KOGAN: No. I mean, that's the thing. I was pretty heavily siloed as far as -- anything as far as funders or clients. I found out about Donald Trump just like everybody else, through the news.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON: All right, well, that's his line. Meanwhile, in London a parliamentary committee continues its probe into the role of fake news in recent elections. Sandy Parakilas, a former platform operations manager at Facebook is set to appear before them this hour.</p><p>CNN's Brian Stelter standing by in New York for a lot more on this. First let's get you to our senior international correspondent, Nick Payton Walsh, who is in London. This thing, Nick, is snowballing. What's the latest where you are?</p><p>NICK PAYTON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we've had actually from the British Prime Minister herself, Theresa May, calling recent allegations about Facebook potentially allowing harvested data into the wrong hands. Quote, very concerning. In this sort of adds really to the official clamor on this side of the Atlantic amongst European powers to get to the bottom of exactly who was given what, when and why.</p><p>Now, the Cambridge Analytica front, Alexander Nix, their CEO, has been suspended by the company itself, board of directors. Pending an independent investigation. That's their bid really to try and move on to some degree and detained their brand. Obviously, Alexander Nix was the man filmed undercover by Channel 4 news suggesting Ukrainian prostitutes or perhaps corruption stings can be used to discredit a position candidate. He also with his colleague, Mark Turnbull, talked about how they had met Mr. Trump many times and were seminal frankly, to assisting his electoral victory in 2016.</p><p>I should point out that separately they say there's conversations taken out of context. Particularly the ones suggesting the use of corruption. And also, too that they didn't get the data about the Trump election campaign, potential electors, until it was too late to for that to be of success.</p><p>But the Cambridge Analytica noise is basically bolstered by a move by the information commission here. Kind of a data protection watchdog in the U.K. to get a warrant, to get access to Cambridge Analytica's servers and work out what they got from who, when. We don't know quite when that warrant will be served.</p><p>[11:05:00] But we do know the same commissioner asked Facebook, what it was to get out of Cambridge Analytica, so they can get on with their work unimpeded. But the broader issue here is when really does this stop. Effectively the spotlight has been shown now on what Cambridge Analytica alleged to have done. Although, they have their very specific less damning version of it. They still got rid of their CEO none the same.</p><p>The question is when does this ball stop rolling for Facebook? And the more broadly, Becky, you know, this is a social media platform used by about a billion people globally. I think possibly now many are beginning to question exactly what they do with their data on it, what Facebook has been doing with that data since they been using it. And quite how they feel in the future moving forward with their privacy and their state of trust, frankly, where so many people turn to many times a day -- Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Company will say it's closer to 2 billion users on a regular basis. Brian, thank you. Nick, stand by. Brian, Mark Zuckerberg has been conspicuously silent, absent since these allegations have grown. Like it or not he is Facebook. The company's being hammered. Where is he? And why hasn't he spoken out at this point?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN, SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: According to the company is working around the clock trying to get to the bottom of this. Figuring out what the facts are and what to do about it. But you're right, it is very unusual that Zuckerberg and COO's Sheryl Sandberg have remained silent. After all, they have Facebook pages. They can logon any time and post a status update just like all of us can. And comment on the situation.</p><p>Look, I think Facebook tried to get out ahead of this on Friday by suspending Cambridge Analytica. They tried to preempt the investigations by the \"New York Times\" and the \"Guardian.\" But clearly that didn't work. Facebook stock is down for a third day in a row. More than $50 billion in value has been wiped off the books. And users and lawmakers have a lot of questions about whether they can trust the company.</p><p>So, I would suspect we will hear from Zuckerberg sometime today or tomorrow. It is kind of baffling that he hasn't spoken out yet. And I've got a wonder how investors feel about his silence.</p><p>ANDERSON: Another thorn in the side for Facebook and other big tech firms like it, and Google. The EU moving aggressively to raise billions more in taxes from these companies. One interim measure slapping a three percent tax on revenue generated from digital activities. And the European Commission, Brian, estimates that could raise a healthy $6.1 billion a year to the coffers of member countries. Look, this is happening coincidentally at the same time.</p><p>But let's concentrate on this scandal. Is this of Facebook's own making? And now, talk of taxes, talk of regulation, we are looking at what looks like a whole new world potentially. And many say about time too so far as these tech giants are concerned.</p><p>STELTER: It's all a part of a reevaluation of these companies' roles in society and in all of our lives. And I agree with you. It's a long overdue reevaluation. You know, you think about Facebook when it launched first at Harvard and other colleges in the U.S., it was essentially a way for friends to meet up, for people to date, for people to chat. I don't think users initially imagined that these companies would have billions of users and would affect wars and would affect elections all around the world. So, there is very much a reevaluation happening.</p><p>And this EU proposal for higher taxes is one piece of that. The EU is further along on this than the U.S. or other countries I might add. You know, in the U.S. lawmakers are starting to talk about possible regulatory steps. But has shown a possible way forward in terms of regulation and taxation.</p><p>ANDERSON: Brian Stelter is in New York. Nick Payton Walsh on the story out of London for you. To you both, thank you.</p><p>And to Austin, Texas where police say the serial bomber who terrorized the city for nearly three weeks is dead. The 24-year-old suspect was killed inside his car when he detonated explosives as law enforcement closed in. One officer was wounded in the blast. Source tells CNN the suspect is named Mark Anthony Conditt. Let's get you to CNN's Ed Lavandera. He is in Round Rock, Texas just outside of Austin. What can you tell us at this point?</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Becky. Well, investigators are still here working the scene just across the highway. You can see from me this is where the surreal and to this frantic search for the suspect in this serial bombing case that has really kind of just brought a chill over the city of Austin. Many people anxious to see this all come to an end and it did in the overnight hours here. We were told by investigators that a number of investigative leads that have been worked over the last 48 hours really brought them to ahead here and close to the suspect. One of the things that they were able to do was they had gotten a pretty good indication of who they thought this person might be was they used cell phone triangulation to pinpoint him to a parking lot of the hotel here just a few feet up the road.</p><p>[11:10:05] But it was also the big clue came a couple of days ago when this suspect -- and we can show you these images -- delivered two packages to a FedEx drop-off location in the city. Rather far from where we are here. But those surveillance images really kind of were able to paint a picture who this person was, how he was operating. In those images you can see the young man, 24-year-old Mark Conditt, wearing a blonde wig, a hat and gloves on those packages. Clearly, looking very suspicious and that kind of dress here. And that is what led them beginning the investigative process to lead them here.</p><p>When they arrived just late last night, and they were surveying him and keeping an ion him, they were waiting for a tactical unit to show up so that they could move in and arrest him. But before that team could make it here Conditt, we're told by investigators, started driving away from that scene. Eventually driving the car into a ditch just in that area over there where you see those trucks behind me. A SWAT team approached the vehicle and that's when investigators say Conditt had a bomb inside of his car and essentially blew himself up right there on the spot.</p><p>We are starting to piece together a few things about Conditt's life. He lives not too far from where this search ended and where he died. We have spoken with his grandmother who said, this is just horrible. Stunned by the news, they describe Conditt as very kind, loving person. But they could see no signs that he was violent. And that he came from a family that works hard to raise their children correctly. So, right now investigators are at the home of where this suspect lived, not too far from here, also, (INAUDIBLE) his parents. And really know the search continues for information leading to what the motive behind here all of this was. And that's what investigators are focused on right now -- Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Very confusing. Ed, appreciate it, thanks.</p><p>Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories that are on our radar right now. At least 29 people were killed, and dozens were wounded by a suicide blast in Kabul, in Afghanistan. Police say security forces stop the bomber from reaching a shrine where Shiites and others were gathered to celebrate the Persian new year. There's been no claim of responsibility.</p><p>The White House says the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are strengthening their relationship. President Donald Trump met with Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salam, on Tuesday. They talked about new business deals, Saudi Arabia's economic reforms and the conflict in Yemen.</p><p>The Islamic militant group, Boko Haram, has returned most of the schoolgirls it kidnapped last month in the town of Dapchi. According to Nigerian officials 104 of the 110 girls were dropped off near their hometown early on Wednesday. They say the girls release was unconditional.</p><p>Many U.S. government offices closed as Washington and other parts of the northeastern United States are hit by a potentially record-breaking snowstorm. This is the fourth major storm in three weeks. So, more than 4,000 flights have already been canceled. Ryan Nobles joining us now from Washington. And Ryan, we're looking at pictures of -- well, it looks cold, sir. What's going on? What's the forecast at this point? How long is this going to last?</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you know, Becky, interestingly enough it's not as cold as you might think when you see all of this snow. And actually, the fact that the temperatures were a little bit higher, Becky, this snowstorm came in a little bit later than what we were expecting. In fact, around 6 o'clock this morning on the East Coast this was all green grass here on the National Mall. A couple hours later the capitol dome behind me, normally you can see that without a problem, and right now it is completely covered by snow.</p><p>The snow has been at a pretty steady clip here now for the last three or four hours. And it's expected to come down now for the next several hours. And so, that means that travel in this part of the country is very difficult. So, basically, everything in Washington is shut down. The House and Senate are in session, but the rest of the federal government is completely shut down. Washington DC's government is shut down, and many of the local school districts. In fact, all the local public-school districts in the city of Washington DC, of Maryland, Northern Virginia, they're all shut down as well.</p><p>And I'm going to tell you a little bit about the snow that we're dealing with here, Becky. This is a very thick heavy wet snow. And that actually makes for a pretty good snow day. Right? Because it's not, you know, bitterly cold. The temperatures are right around 32, 33 degrees. It's not that windy. You can get outside and have some fun. Right? So, we built this snowman here on the National Mall. I'm from Western New York I honestly think I probably should have done a better job putting this guy together. He actually already fell down once. He's trying to take my job as you can see. He's got the CNN white flag there.</p><p>[11:15:00] But you know, it's that kind of day where you can actually get out and enjoy it. There isn't anywhere to go because everything is shut down. So, that's what a lot of people here in Washington DC and along the East Coast are doing -- Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: And Ryan, if there are people looking to get in and out of Washington, as far as flights are concerned, what's the schedule? What do we know it this point?</p><p>NOBLES: Yes, I mean, that is a major concern. You know, Amtrak has shut down a lot of the trains that travel between here and Boston and New York City. And there's been many flights that have been canceled or delayed. The airports are completely shut down. It's not that big of a storm, at least not yet. But there had been some delays. So, it is pretty smart if you're traveling to this part of the world, it would be smart to check to see what your flight schedule is and if it's been change or if there's the opportunity to switch your flight. Because at the very least it might be a headache. Things aren't completely shut down, Becky. But it's definitely more difficult than it would be on a normal day.</p><p>ANDERSON: There is a little fellow behind you. There is a dog behind you. It looks as if he wants to play with you in that snow. So, go find him. Thank you, Ryan.</p><p>NOBLES: Getting cold.</p><p>ANDERSON: See if you can find that fella. There you go. Brian nobles in Washington, thank you.</p><p>Still to come tonight is U.K./Russia relations continue to struggle under the weight of the Salisbury poisoning. We are live in Britain and in Moscow for you after this.</p><p>ANDERSON: Welcome back at 20 past seven or just shy of. You're watching CNN. This is CONNECT THE WORLD with me Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi for you.</p><p>The U.K. and Russia continue to spar over the poisoning of a Russian double agent. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found poisoned in Salisbury on March 4. Foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, now suggest the attack was linked to Russia's presidential election on Sunday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITAIN FOREIGN SECRETARY: I think the timing was probably more closely connected with the recent election in Russia. As many known democratic figures do when facing an election or facing some critical political moment, it is often attractive to conjure up in the public imagination the notion of an enemy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[11:20:04] ANDERSON: Well, that's Boris Johnson speaking. A Russian Foreign Ministry official has accused Britain of orchestrating the attack. Now the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says it's team will need 2 to 3 weeks, more weeks, to analyze the nerve agent used in the Salisbury. For more Phil Black is there in Salisbury. Matthew Chance joining us from Moscow. And Phil, let's start with you. The Foreign Minister, I'm not holding back, making quite some allegations. Evidence- based at this point?</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER: Not really, no. But yes, again pointing the finger very firmly at Russia. To paraphrase, Becky, did Russia do it? Yes, says Boris Johnson. Did the orders come from the top of the Kremlin? Yes. Why use such a specific and rare nerve agent, as the British government alleges? Well, Boris Johnson's theory and it's been said by other parliamentarians here is that it puts a very specific Russian signature on the deed. And acts a warning to Russians and former Russian agents everywhere that it's impossible to avoid the long arm of Russian revenge. And as you heard him say there, he was asked about the timing, and he pointed about the recent Russian presidential election. All of this really just theory and in his own words some degree of speculation.</p><p>On the timing issue and the issue of the election well it's also worth noting that a spokesman for President Putin's campaign think the British government for helping bolster voter turnout for President Putin on the day of the vote itself. But no hard evidence yet. The efforts to gather evidence continue here in Salisbury. Two prongs, one the police investigation to try and determine where and how the alleged use of this nerve agent took place. And were told by the police bats likely to take some months. And as you touched on there as well, there is also now this effort from experts at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons who are on the ground here in Salisbury looking to confirm, if you like, this independent body will be looking to confirm or otherwise the British governments allegations that this was a highly specific and rare Russian nerve agent. And their work is likely to take 2 to 3 weeks, as they say.</p><p>So, it is unlikely that the British government is going to have more evidence to pull out of its hip pocket as it continues to point the finger at Russia in the near future. That at a time when Russia is increasing its calls for the British government and British officials to produce evidence to back up its claims -- Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: OK. Well, let's get to Moscow then. Phil, just alluding to the fact that Russia or certainly Moscow wants to hear more. They want evidence. What's the perspective from where you are, Matthew?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, certainly some of the diplomats I've been speaking to are saying that look, the problem with, you know, putting out evidence that would demonstrate without any doubt that the Russians were behind this. It's because there is a police investigation on the way on one hand, but also the country, Britain is reluctant to reveal its intelligence gathering methods. And so, we may not, not see for some time, if ever the kind of conclusive proof that Russia is demanding that Britain present.</p><p>But you know, at the same time, look, I mean, the point that's being made very strongly hereby various diplomats is that Russia has the intent and importantly that the track record of carrying out these kinds of assassinations or attacks in this case against its perceived opponents.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHANCE (voice-over): He was one of the Kremlin's most ruthless enemies. An Arab jihadist called Khattab. Notorious for executing Russian troops during the brutal Chechen wars. When Russia's security services finally announced his assassination, this special operation in March 2002, they released this video to prove it. Showing Khattab laid out dead with no visible wounds. Russian state media and the rebels both said he died after opening a poison letter. To us it seems quite literally a message from the Kremlin.</p><p>There have been other alleged messages from Moscow too. In 2004 the pro- Western Ukrainian presidential hopeful, Viktor Yushchenko, who went on to lead the country, was badly disfigured after a severe dioxin poisoning. He told me back then he's push for Ukraine to join the European Union and NATO. It made him enemies at home and in Moscow.</p><p>VIKTOR YUSHCHENKO, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UKRAINE (through translator): We started dinner at about 10 o'clock and finished around 3:30 in the morning. While driving back home the first thing I felt was a terrible headache. I had never felt anything like it before.</p><p>[11:25:00] When I got home my wife kissed my lips. She said she could taste something metallic. I asked her for some medication. But the pain was aggravated. Only then I said to myself, Viktor, you're in trouble.</p><p>CHANCE: For others that trouble prove deadly. The radioactive killing of former KGB agent, Alexander Litvinenko, in London in 2006 foreshadowed the recent Skripal newer nerve agent attack. Both were former members of the Russian secret services, were poisoned with chemicals said by Britain to be Russian and seen as traitors by the Kremlin.</p><p>(on camera): There has been, in other words, a growing list of people. This Kremlin sees its opponents and long before the poisoning of the Skripals in Britain, who have met painful and untimely deaths. All of course were poisoned, one of Russia's main opposition figures, Boris Nemtsov, was shot dead in 2015 right here on this bridge. Of course, the Kremlin denies any involvement and rejects the allegation it could've ordered the Skripal nerve agent attack as unthinkable.</p><p>And as this poison father and daughter, Sergei and Yulia Skripal, fight for their lives in intensive care. The Kremlin insists Britain should apologize for the serious allegations it has made or present proof of Russia's hand.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHANCE: Well, the Russian Foreign Ministry called an urgent meeting today of all the foreign ambassadors in Moscow. It wanted to take the opportunity to explain its position about the attack in Salisbury and about the poisoning of the Skripals. But not many of the -- certainly the Western ambassadors turned up. The United States, the British, the French, the Germans, they stayed away. Apparently, the Chinese stayed away as well. And so, you know, Russia is not exactly getting international support for its claim at the moment that it had nothing to do with this.</p><p>ANDERSON: Matthew Chance is in Moscow for you. Thank you, Matt.</p><p>Just ahead, you're about to see a video from the cockpit of an Israeli fighter jet that was kept secret for more than a decade. Israel admitting to bombing a Syrian nuclear reactor. Why tell the world now? We are live in Jerusalem for that.</p><p>[11:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>Welcome back. Half past seven in the UAE. I'm sure you can work out what time it is wherever you are watching in world, but welcome.</p><p>For the first time ever, Israel has admitted to bombing a Syrian nuclear facility in 2007, a decade ago. The world quickly found out about an Israeli air strike in the Syrian desert, the nature of it remained secret. Both Israel and Syria stayed quiet. Well, more than a decade later, tensions in the region as you are well aware are still high. So why has Israel decided to release its footage now? Let's bring in Oren Liebermann who's in Jerusalem. Oren, we should tell our viewers that Israeli military censors I reviewed CNN and other media reports under strict committee rules on the material that they provided. Correct?</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Correct. And that's how sensitive this was to the Israeli military whom polls this censorship on this entire story and the information for the last seven years. The interesting question is what you pointed out, why release this now? Pretty much everybody here in Israel and most around the world who have heard of this knew it was the Israeli air force who had carried out this strike, even though as you point out, both Israel and Syria were relatively quiet in the days and months and years after the strike.</p><p>Why now? It a very different Middle East these days, Syria is a fractured country so perhaps the target audience is Iran.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LIEBERMANN: In the crosshairs of an Israeli fighter jet, a secret Syrian nuclear reactor, mere months away from completion, in this never before released footage, you see the reactor as it was in the early morning hours on September 6, 2007 as precision guided Israeli bombs bore down on their target. After the strike, Israel's nuclear worry shifting from Syria to Iran.</p><p>AARON DAVID MILLER, WILSON CENTER: I mean Israel is not only trying to designate deterrence, but to make it unmistakably clear that they would strike again, make it unmistakably clear to Russia and to the Assad regime and with respect to the Iranian nuclear program, should the Iranians accelerate enrichment and seek to breakout, that the Israelis are prepared to act against Iran as well.</p><p>LIEBERMANN: Israel has never fully acknowledged the strike against Syria. The video held by military censors who reviewed this story and enforced strict rules on media before publication, these pictures released by the U.S. in early 2008 they say were taken inside the facility, show the core of the reactor under construction. The U.S. said the gas cooled graphite moderated reactor was built with North Korean assistance. The only other country to have built such a plant in decades. Syria has never acknowledged building a nuclear reactor at the site, instead insisting it was a missile facility.</p><p>BASHAR JAAFARI, SYRIAN AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS: Syria builds many buildings all over the country, does that mean that any building we build should be a project or designed to be a nuclear reactor building?</p><p>LIEBERMANN: IAEA inspectors found traces of uranium at the site, the CIA said the reactor could not produce electricity and was not for peaceful purposes. For years Israel stayed quiet believing silence could prevent escalation with Syria. Israel had been collecting top secret intelligence on Syrian President Bashar Al Assad and his nuclear ambitions. Their conclusion in 2007, Syria was at least a year away from an operational nuclear reactor. If completing the facility would've made Syria the first Arab nuclear state.</p><p>A quarter century earlier, Israeli fighter jets struck the nuclear facility in Iraq, crippling our country's nuclear program. It established Israel's policy that it would carry out pre-emptive strikes against weapons of mass destruction it considered a threat like it did in Syria.</p><p>[11:35:00] MILLER: Whether or not the United States is prepared to take the lead, Israel has agency and it's prepared in anticipation of any of their neighbors who presumed to develop a nuclear program to weaponize that the Israelis are prepared to act well in advance of that weapon becoming operational.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LIEBERMANN: If you look at regional politics today, Israel is waging an all-out lobbying campaign against both Iran and the nuclear deal, working essentially with Donald Trump has he threatens to cancel it, Israel has very clearly urged him to fix it or nix it. Meanwhile Iran has an increasing presence, increasing influence in Syria right across the border as Israel tries to keep Iran as far away from that border as possible. Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Oren Liebermann is in Jerusalem. Still to come tonight, remember Donald Trump promised during his campaign to sue all the women accusing him of sexual misconduct. Well he didn't, and now one of those women is suing him. We'll look at what appeared to be his growing legal troubles up next.</p><p>ANDERSON: Not one, not two, but three women are now pressing ahead with legal action against the U.S. President Donald Trump. You no doubt have heard about the porn star Stormy Daniels, but now a former Playboy Playmate and a former reality TV contestant are also taking their grievances to court. Abby Phillips looks at how Trump's personal legal challenges are piling up, at the same time he's trying to fight off pressure from Special Counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ABBY PHILLIPS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Accusations about President Trump's alleged past sexual exploits now developing on three different fronts. The lawyer for adult film star Stormy Daniels releasing this photograph and the results of a 2011 polygraph test about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump. The results indicate that Daniels was being honest when she said she had unprotected sex with the President in 2006. Mr. Trump has denied the affair. Polygraphs are generally inadmissible in court, but Daniels' lawyer paid $25,000 for the rights to the footage.</p><p>MICHAEL AVENATTI, ATTORNEY FOR STORMY DANIELS: We want the public to know the facts, to know my client's story. I'm confident that after they view that interview and after they view this evidence they are going to conclude that what they have been told by Mr. Cohen, and the denials if you can call them denials from the White House are simply baseless and the false.</p><p>PHILLIPS: President Trump's legal woes don't stop there, on Tuesday, a New York judge denied a motion by the president's lawyers to dismiss a defamation lawsuit from former \"Apprentice\" contestant Summer Zervos.</p><p>[11:40:00] Weeks before the 2016 election Zervos accused Mr. Trump of sexually assaulting her in 2007.</p><p>SUMMER ZERVOS, TRUMP ACCUSER: He came to me and started kissing me open mouthed as he was pulling me towards him. He put me in an embrace and I try to push them away. I pushed his chest, put space between us and I said, come on, man, get real. He repeated my words back to me, get real, as he began thrusting his genitals.</p><p>PHILLIPS: The president denied her claims saying I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. Zervos' lawsuit claims Trump damaged her reputation by essentially calling her a liar. Then there's former model Karen McDougall who claims she had an affair with the President in 2006. McDougall is suing a media company to be released from a 2016 agreement preventing her from discussing the alleged relationship with Trump. These lawsuits come as sources tell CNN that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigations continue to agitate Mr. Trump. President Trump facing scrutiny over his reluctance to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I had a call with President Putin. And congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory.</p><p>PHILLIPS: \"The Washington Post\" reports that President Trump ignored warnings from his national security advisors, including a note in his briefing materials that read in capital letters, do not congratulate. A White House official tells CNN that President Trump did not read the notes from his advisors before speaking with Putin, who's sweeping reelection has been widely condemned as a sham.</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We don't get to dictate how other countries operate. What we do know is that Putin has been elected in their country and that's not something we can dictate to them how they operate.</p><p>PHILLIPS: \"The Post\" reports that Mr. Trump also overruled guidance to condemn the nerve agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the U.K. Instead, the White House emphasizing that the purpose of the call was to discuss shared interests with Russia on Iran and North Korea.</p><p>TRUMP: We had a very good call and I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not too distant future.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, that's Mr. Trump, he clearly is under fire today on several fronts and let's bring in our White House reporter and regular guest on the show, Stephen Collinson. Don't congratulate him they said but President Trump didn't follow that advice, did he? What he didn't do is bring up Russia's election meddling during this phone call with Putin, prompting a rebuke from Senator John McCain and this link to the \"The Washington Post\" and he is furious, Steven?</p><p>STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes, we're hearing this morning that the President is very angry about this, there is an investigation going on in the White House to find out who leaked the President's briefing papers to the press. But that sort of hunt for who's responsible, I think is somewhat overshadowing the gravity of this. The President spoke to Vladimir Putin at a time when the issue of Russian election meddling, interference with American democracy is dominating Washington.</p><p>It's also, soon after that attack, using a nerve agent on the soil of America's closest the NATO ally, Britain. The fact that neither of these issues were brought up by the President, the really most crucial issues in the relationship between Russia and the West right now just goes into this whole conceit about why the President is so deferential towards Vladimir Putin. Why is he so solicitous of him?</p><p>People who believe that the Russians have some compromising material on Donald Trump and that's behind the whole collusion issue, that Robert Mueller is investigating, they think this is more evidence of that. Others believe that the President is so sensitive about Russia just because the issue of the probe and collusion seems to delegitimize his election and he's doing it for that reason. But it just brings up all these questions about the President's very puzzling relationship with Vladimir Putin all over again.</p><p>ANDERSON: If you were providing a defense for him and Sarah Sanders did at the press briefing yesterday, she says, he just wants to move on this investigation into Russia. She says, has taken too long and the Trump administration just wants to get on with it.</p><p>COLLINSON: Yes, and, you know, that's, I guess a fair point for many of Trump's supporters. The flip side to that is that Robert Mueller has been methodically moving forward in this investigation, he's indicted a number of people who are former close associates of Donald Trump. So, to argue that there is nothing there, that this investigation as the President does is just a hoax and a political distraction is not quite accurate.</p><p>[11:45:00] The other part of this of course is that the President by his is constant personal attacks now on Mueller, on the idea, the fact that he's not really admitted in public or it took a long time for him to admit that there was election meddling that taken place is prolonging this. Because it makes it look like he's got something to hide. He's clearly trying to if not to obstruct justice in the investigation, sort of attack the probe itself and make it more difficult for Mueller to his job. So, that's a piece of political spin from the White House but is not really grounded in an awful lot of merit I don't think.</p><p>ANDERSON: That is the political atmosphere, the Russia investigation clouding what Donald Trump says is his efforts to get on a make America great again. Behind the scenes he has personal problems. This is a man who would tell you himself, I'm sure, that he loves a lawsuit. Well there? And what might the consequences be? Are three women now effectively turning the tables on him? How significant is all of this be?</p><p>COLLINSON: Well, it's turning into a legal morass and of course there could be political implications for this down the road. But I think the legal situation is getting quite -- must be quite a concern for people in the White House. Simply because one of the cases with Summer Zervos that was allowed to go ahead by a judge on Tuesday, this is someone who's suing him for defamation. After he said that her claims that he inappropriately touched her that she was lying. So, this is a defamation suit.</p><p>Now this is going on through the court process, that means there's going to be a period of discovery, of the parties finding evidence. There's going to be court proceedings, that are obviously going to be covered by the media. There's the potential that the President could be forced to do a deposition in this case. And that is sort of very dodgy political ground and legal ground for the President, especially for someone who's known not to be always completely truthful. He could get himself into all sorts of legal problem there.</p><p>And then there's the question that the fact that these three cases going on, we know there are other women who have basically said that the President treated them inappropriately. They could now think well if anyone especially is going to get a legal remedy, maybe I'll come and start a legal case. So, this is a really slippery legal slope the President I think.</p><p>ANDERSON: Stephen Collison, as I say, a regular guest on this show and appreciate it Stephen, thank you. He was a pleasure.</p><p>Live from Abu Dhabi. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD.

And to make their point, some British fishermen dumped crates of haddock into the River Thames. Confused? Well, are Nic Robertson has this for you from London.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Fishermen are frustrated at is latest round of Brexit talks in Brussels. Fishermen here in Britain have always been frustrated with the European Union. Cutting their fishing quotas have been some of the strongest people supporting Brexit. Now they're saying the way the talks are going under the British government it seems to be getting a weaker hand on quota negotiations. That's what they're angry about. That's what's bringing them out of the water right now.</p><p>(voice-over): And out to support them, Prime Minister Theresa May's own MPs, critics of hers and of Brussels.</p><p>JACOB REES-MOGG, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE MP: Now that's what we want to see.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Do you tell us what are you doing here today?</p><p>REES-MOGG: Just supporting the fishing communities up and down the United Kingdom that are going to lose out by the delay in our leaving the common fishing policies. It's a really serious matter for those. The risk with fish is that in the last year under EU control, there may be a change in the approach to quotas that could be ruinous for our fishing communities.</p><p>ROBERTSON: He wasn't, however going to join the fishermen.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you us not to schedule debate by the Prime Minister?</p><p>REES-MOGG: No, of course not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought you were (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>REES-MOGG: Look the boat is in here.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): As it was, the boat didn't actually have permission to dock and pick him up, which was perhaps just as well. It said he wasn't a fish thrower. Another well-known Brexit leader turned up to do that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Throwing a few fish in the river</p><p>ROBERTSON (on camera): Political theater, the real drama takes place in Brussels at the negotiations there. That's where Theresa May will be headed to later this week. Good news for her, she got a concession, if you will, from the European Union on transition. An agreement that there will be a transition, not as long as she wanted, she got 21 months, not the 24 she wanted. But there was a concession on the rights of the EU workers. That was something that she hadn't planned for. Also, the thorny issue of Northern Ireland still to be decided.</p><p>ROBERTSON: What's your message for the government over the border with Northern Ireland?</p><p>REES-MOGG: The message on the border over Northern Ireland is that the government will stick steady to its course of saying that there will be no hard border, but it needs to define what a hard border is. And that the government should (INAUDIBLE) of actually and not bullied by the European Union.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Between politicians, fishermen and EU negotiators, the Prime Minister still far from home on delivering Brexit.</p><p>Easy enough for this little boat to navigate the relatively calm waters of the Thames here, but with so many tough issues ahead left in Brussels, the Northern Ireland border, security, fishers, stormy waters can be expected ahead. Nic Robertson, CNN London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON: The parting shots tonight, my team and I brought the show here to Abu Dhabi four years ago almost to the day. So, we thought we would explore what is the rich history of what is now our second home, the United Arab Emirates. Which has been the home of this show, as I say, for four years. It's an incredible multitiered nation, and that in just a few decades has transformed from desert to a world metropolis. And one photographer has had a front seat view of that change.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON (voice-over): Ramesh Shukla has had a career unlike any other. Witnessing the history of a new young nation through the viewfinder of his camera.</p><p>(on camera): And this I believe is the camera that you use. You were given this camera at 15 years old.</p><p>RAMESH SHUKLA, PHOTOGRAPHER: As I focus.</p><p>ANDERSON (voice-over): And now at 80, Shukla is looking back on his career as the UAE's most celebrated Royal photographer. Unveiling never before seen photos, the country's founding father, Sheikh Zayed, born a century ago.</p><p>(on camera): And this is one of 22 new images that you are releasing here. Why?</p><p>NEEL SHUKLA, SON OF RAMESH SHUKLA: My father has an archive of thousands of images and for the past 50 years this archive has been in pretty much filing cabinets, in there are the negatives have been there. But I had to restore them, bring them to life, touch them up and see exactly what the content is and, in these images, -- and this particular one you can see him in full form.</p><p>[11:55:00] ANDERSON (voice-over): Taken in the 1960s, it's one of many photos that Shukla captured of the late Sheikh, including one that's arguably the most important moment in the UAE history. When Sheikh Zayed signed the very document that's formed the country on a hot December day in 1971.</p><p>SHUKLA: A unique man, dancing, education, on very same par.</p><p>ANDERSON: They first met during a camel race that shook the cycle to years earlier. Crossing the desert some 30 kilometers or 18 miles with his camera before developing the pictures in his home, which didn't have electricity or running water. It was a simple life, but Shukla never asked Zayed for money. Only wanting him to sign the photo. An approach that over the years gave Shukla the unique access to the leader.</p><p>(on camera): You were there when your father took this. Tell us about how he took it.</p><p>NEEL SHUKLA: The is Sheikh Zayed. My father would always start to look for the shot, the angle. So, he climbed up and I would fight with him. I go, what are you doing? You're going to fall, you're going break your legs, stop. And he would do the impossible. And he injured himself many times. He fell from trucks. He fell off of buildings. He has, to capture the shot. So that would not happen if there was no heart.</p><p>ANDERSON (voice-over): A witness to history capturing precious moments that was once sleepy Bedouin society transformed into a modern country.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON: I'm Becky Anderson. That was CONNECT THE WORLD from Abu Dhabi. Thanks for watching.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018032101cbk29</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S76-6X71-JB20-G1VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is Friday, the 24th of July.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, for a substitution.  FIFA's sponsors make their loudest call  yet for change at the top.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon amazes investors and becomes the world's most valuable  retailer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a trillion-dollar tech deal a long time in the making.  I will ask  the head of the WTO if your tech goods are about to get a whole lot  cheaper.  </p><p>I'm Poppy Harlow and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Good evening, welcome to the program.  Tonight, FIFA admits that it's  having trouble getting new sponsors, and the ones it already has, well,  they want a meeting.  The current situation doesn't help, said the FIFA  secretary general, referring to the massive corruption and bribery scandal  that has rocked the football world since May.</p><p>The organization has not signed a single new sponsor since the last  World Cup, and the secretary general of FIFA is not expecting any new  partnership until FIFA president Sepp Blatter is finally out of office.  He  says that the current sponsors are not happy either, and he called for a  summit for next month to help try to quell the concerns.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME VALCKE, SECRETARY GENERAL, FIFA:  Clearly, yes, there were a  number of sponsors, mainly three, I would say, and it's three, in fact.   It's Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Visa, who have expressed and sent letter to  FIFA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  And also you will remember this scene from Monday during FIFA  president Sepp Blatter's press conference.  The British comedian on the  stage, jumping on stage, showering him cash.  The comedian trying to make a  point about alleged rampant bribery within FIFA, and now sponsors are  piling on the pressure for the football's governing body to, frankly, shape  up.</p><p>In his earnings call, the CEO of Visa called FIFA's response to the  scandal, quote, \"wholly inadequate,\" and demanded a fully-independent  commission to oversee reforms there.  He said officials don't seem to be  aware of how serious this problem is.  And meaningful changes cannot be  made until, he says, new leadership takes over.</p><p>A few hours ago, Budweiser's parent company, InBev, joined that call,  saying that FIFA should empower an independent commission, quote, \"without  delay.\"  And earlier this week, Coca-Cola said an independent commission  would help FIFA, quote, \"build back the trust that it has lost.\"</p><p>Also, McDonald's, another huge sponsor, said it is not satisfied, and  will not be without the transparency of an independent commission.  And  that leaves Adidas, Hyundai, and Gazprom as key sponsors of FIFA who are,  frankly, yet to speak up.  All of this pressure from sponsors seems to be  ruffling FIFA secretary general's feathers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALCKE:  I love your questions.  They are so friendly, so positive, so  nice.  You want me to resign, you want me to think about my future, you  want to know if I'm traveling.  What else?  What I had for lunch or  breakfast this morning?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  So, joining me in the C Suite is Sir Martin Sorrell, the CEO  --</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL, CEO, WPP:  -- Poppy Quest.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW:  -- of WPP.  It is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it's Poppy in the hot  seat trying to fill Richard's large shoes, which is --</p><p>SORRELL:  Big shoes to fill.</p><p>HARLOW:  -- pretty impossible, but I am happy to be here.  So happy to  have you.  </p><p>SORRELL:  Good.</p><p>HARLOW:  Who better to talk about this.  When you look at FIFA,  targeting $6 billion in revenue --</p><p>SORRELL:  Yes.</p><p>HARLOW:  -- from the 2018 tournament.</p><p>SORRELL:  Yes.  From that core, from that four-year period, yes.</p><p>HARLOW:  Right.  And you looked at --</p><p>SORRELL:  Actually, less than -- less on an average basis than Formula  1.  Formula 1 is about $1.7 billion a year.  Interestingly, World Cup is  about $1.5 billion.  So, interesting.</p><p>HARLOW:  Still quite a lot, right?</p><p>SORRELL:  Yes, quite a lot, but it could be more, actually, if  properly run, I think.</p><p>HARLOW:  So, it has a lot of upside potential --</p><p>SORRELL:  Yes.</p><p>HARLOW:  -- but we just went through the list.  Visa chastising FIFA  for a lack of awareness.</p><p>SORRELL:  Coca-Cola --</p><p>HARLOW:  McDonald's, Coca-Cola. You work with all of these firms.</p><p>SORRELL:  Yes.  InBev as well, now.</p><p>HARLOW:  What do you think the long-term fallout is going to be?</p><p>SORRELL:  I think long term, as long as there's reform, and this is --  you could look at this as an opportunity, it's not dissimilar -- it's not  as bad, obviously -- with the IOC a few years ago after Salt Lake City and  Atlanta and everything.  There was change.  </p><p>Juan Samaranch was the first IOC president to change the institution.   That was followed by Jacques Rogge, and now by Thomas Bach, who's taken a  very strong position on a number of major issues.  There's going to be the  IOCcongress in Kuala Lumpur on August the 1st.</p><p>And what's interesting is it's so -- it was a similar situation, but  of smaller scale and smaller magnitude.  But same thing:  reform, reform is  necessary.  And it has to be neutral reform.  There's no -- maybe this is a  little bit aggressive to say -- but lunatics can't be judge of the asylum.</p><p>They've got to change.  And what's interesting about what Visa and  Coca-Cola and McDonald's, and now InBev as well, are saying is that they  have to change, and there has to be a neutral, independent commission --</p><p>[16:05:01]  HARLOW:  But --</p><p>SORRELL:  -- that initiates.  It's no good the same group of people --</p><p>HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>SORRELL:  -- reelecting somebody --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW:  And they -- they're all --</p><p>SORRELL:  -- from that same group.</p><p>HARLOW:  It's one thing to have a new leader in place and figurehead.</p><p>SORRELL:  Yes.</p><p>HARLOW:  It's another thing to change culture and practice.  And it's  not just one person.  So, you have this meeting next month with FIFA, with  McDonald's, with Coca-Cola.</p><p>SORRELL:  With all due respect, it is about leadership.  Sepp Blatter  said he can't be held responsible for all this.  Well, whether he likes it  or not --</p><p>HARLOW:  You are.</p><p>SORRELL:  -- he has -- you are responsible.</p><p>HARLOW:  But how do they prove it?  How do they prove to the sponsors  things are different?</p><p>SORRELL:  Well, it's a question about the quality of the people that - - if it's an independent commission or whoever the next leader is going to  be.  Electing another leader from the same group who would be tarred or  tainted with a similar approach -- maybe of a different scale, but a  similar approach -- is not going to solve the problem.</p><p>The World Cup is the premier global sporting event.  It is the premier  live sporting event.  After that, you have the Olympics close to it.  And  then you have Formula 1, which I'm a non-executive director of.  So, those  are the three events that are global sporting events that appeal to global  audiences.</p><p>HARLOW:  Let me ask you this.  I believe -- I'm of the millennial  generation.  I'm in the old end, but I am.</p><p>SORRELL:  I am not, unfortunately.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW:  That's OK.  We'll forgive you.  But --</p><p>SORRELL:  I'm an aging Millennial.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW:  But what we know, what the studies bear out, is that  Millennials care deeply about the companies that they buy products from --</p><p>SORRELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW:  -- and what those companies stand for.</p><p>SORRELL:  And the employees, moreover.</p><p>HARLOW:  And employees want to work for a company that live by those  creeds.</p><p>SORRELL:  And that's why the sponsors are taking such a strong  position.</p><p>HARLOW:  That's why I'm wondering is why we're seeing all of these  storied companies coming out and being so vocal.  Is it because the young  buyers --</p><p>SORRELL:  Well, there's -- </p><p>HARLOW:  -- expect it?</p><p>SORRELL:  It's a very difficult position, because you have a legal  contract.  Nothing is proven as yet.  There are a lot of suggestions.  A  lot of arrests have been made, but there is a series of cases that are in  the process of development.  So, you have to be very careful what you say.</p><p>But what is now happening -- and I think, remember that Blatter was  reelected in Zurich and with a lower majority than he thought and other  people thought he was going to get, but he was reelected.  Within 24, 48  hours, he was gone.  He resigned.</p><p>Where did that pressure come from?  My guess is, it came from the  sponsors.  They were restricted from what they could do by virtue of their  legal contracts, but you're now seeing the pressure that they can exert. </p><p>What they're saying is, having a meeting in a few-months time to elect  another leader from the same group of people may not be sufficient in their  view.  And you're absolutely right.  Sustainability, purpose, is at the  center of all the clients we do, and you're absolutely right that consumers  buy products and services from companies that they admire.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>SORRELL:  And people go to work and stay at work and are motivated to  work at companies they admire.  So, this issue is extremely important.</p><p>Having said that, do I think that this is a disaster from which FIFA  or World Cup football will never recover?  No.  The sport is so powerful,  it's so important, you see the impact that it's had in American when the  women's team won the Women's World Cup and the positive impact that will  have.  And I think that will build further grass roots for soccer or  football here in this country.</p><p>HARLOW:  It really is a changing business environment, and the  business of business is no longer just business.</p><p>SORRELL:  Doing good is good business.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>SORRELL:  John Brown, who was the CEO of BP many years ago said at  Stanford Business School in 1997, doing good is good business.  We over  intellectualize all this stuff.  It's very simple.  If you're in business  for the long term -- that's the critical determinant -- you will -- doing  good is good business.  It's good for your consumers, it's good for your  customers, it's good for your people.</p><p>HARLOW:  It's interesting.  In the earnings call from Starbucks  yesterday, the chief executive, Howard Schultz, said part of the reason for  the record earnings, he thought, was the investment in their employees.</p><p>SORRELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW:  And in their partners.</p><p>SORRELL:  Well --</p><p>HARLOW:  And spending more money on them resulted in --</p><p>SORRELL:  We have the tenth anniversary of our brand valuation  actually.  One of the clear, clear lessons is that companies that have  purpose at the center of their strategy --</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>SORRELL:  -- have sustainability as part of that purpose. </p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>SORRELL:  Doing good is good business.  It does, ironically, it does  pay off.  And it doesn't pay off in the context of a FIFA.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.  And it's no longer --</p><p>SORRELL:  Well, certainly not in the long term.  It might have paid  off in the short term.</p><p>HARLOW:  -- you're no longer just sort of corporate speak.  It's  actually --</p><p>SORRELL:  That's right.</p><p>HARLOW:  -- needing to be played out.</p><p>SORRELL:  That's right.</p><p>HARLOW:  Sir Martin Sorrell, thank you very much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SORRELL:  Thank you very much, indeed.</p><p>HARLOW:  Have a lovely weekend.  We appreciate it.</p><p>SORRELL:  And you filled Richard boots --</p><p>HARLOW:  I try, I try.</p><p>SORRELL:  -- more than amply.</p><p>HARLOW:  I try.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW:  Thank you, my friend.  </p><p>Amazon.  Amazon is really having quite a run.  At the top of the heap,  the online shopping giant replacing Walmart as the world's most valuable  retailer.  How did this happen?  Overnight?  We'll show you.</p><p>[16:09:51]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW:  The day has come, and Amazon is now worth more than Walmart.   We told you yesterday on the program how Amazon's stellar results could be  enough to make it the most valuable retailer in the world.  Well now, that  is indeed official.</p><p>Amazon shares up about 10 percent in Friday's closing, closing over  $530 a share.  That pushes the online retailers market value past brick- and-mortar giant Walmart by about, eh, just $20 billion.  The closing share  price puts Amazon's worth at around $250 billion.  Walmart is valued at  $230 billion.</p><p>Let's talk about it with Samuel Burke, CNN business correspondent.   You know, last time you were here talking about Amazon --</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Uh-oh.</p><p>HARLOW:  -- you were talking about Prime Day --</p><p>BURKE:  Oh.</p><p>HARLOW:  -- and how it was such a flop.  And?  Amazon sort of had the  last laugh on that one.  They said those sales topped Black Friday.</p><p>BURKE:  I'm still a bit dubious of those.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURKE:  I think I might have the last laugh, because Amazon is growing  constantly, so I'm not -- I wouldn't be surprised if every day is better  than Black Friday.  I still had a very hard time finding anybody on Twitter  saying, ooh, I just found a great deal.</p><p>But you're right.  In the call last night, the CFO of Amazon says we  were thrilled with Amazon Prime Day, and that they had huge sales,  especially in terms of the number of people who signed up for Prime.  So,  they're touting it.  And clearly the stock market likes it, up 10 percent.   But I still have to point out one more thing.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>BURKE:  Here we are, we are all gushing, analysts and whatnot, about  Apple -- about Amazon.  </p><p>HARLOW:  And Apple.</p><p>BURKE:  And Apple.  But Amazon barely had any profit, just barely, and  their stock is way up.  Apple had this amazing profit and their stock is  down 8 percent over -- in this past week.  So, it is quite incredible.</p><p>HARLOW:  It's a good point, because we were talking about surprise  profit, surprise profit.  But we're not talking about that much here.  The  strength in the Cloud business and third-party marketplaces.</p><p>BURKE:  Absolutely incredible.  Amazon web services is the part of  Amazon that you rarely ever see.  It's kind of the invisible thing that  runs websites and applications where people store their documents, up 81  percent in terms of sales, up more than 400 percent --</p><p>HARLOW:  Wow.</p><p>BURKE:  -- in terms of pure profit.  And for a long time, they didn't  break out those numbers, so a lot of us were very suspicious, thinking,  well, they must have something to hide.  And clearly, they have nothing to  hide.</p><p>HARLOW:  When you look at all of that, and you look at Jeff Bezos, a  man, by the way, according to Bloomberg now, worth $43 billion as of  yesterday, making him the seventh richest man in the world.  But this is  someone who is really, it just seems, at the beginning of the evolution of  Amazon.  Thrones -- where do we go from here?</p><p>BURKE:  But I think the thing that you have to really credit him with  is Amazon Prime, that $99 a year subscription.  He got the idea from  Costco, and in case you're overseas and you don't shop at Costco as much as  we do here in the United States, think about the pure profit behind that,  $99 a year just, like at Costco.  That's -- it's just a membership, that's  it.</p><p>So, that type of genius in terms of saying how can I replicate what  Costco did in stores and bring that to my website?  The truth is, Amazon  products get to you almost as fast whether you have prime or not.  So that  is just profit, profit.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW:  But I love seeing that I don't have to pay for the shipping.</p><p>BURKE:  Yes, well, OK.</p><p>HARLOW:  You know, we kind of love that.</p><p>BURKE:  He loves that, too.  It's making him rich and it's really  business genius. </p><p>HARLOW:  Because we're paying for it in many other ways.  Samuel  Burke, thank you so much, have a great weekend.</p><p>Well, turning to another very serious story, the CEO of Nikkei Group  is promising to respect the editorial independence of the \"Financial  Times.\"  The declaration coming just a day after the Japanese media giant  announced it was snapping up the business broad sheet for $1.3.  Top Nikkei  executives telling reporters their group can learn a lot from the FT.</p><p>[16:15:06]  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAOTOSHI OKADA, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NIKKEI (through translator):  The  digital strategy, whether it is the system or whether it is the service  development or the customer management, I would say that FT is a step ahead  of us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  However, some have concerns, and they've raised them, about  the FT's new ownership and just how independent the paper can be in Japan.   QUEST MEANS BUSINESS has been reaching out to the FT today for comment.  We  have not heard back yet.</p><p>We do want to bring in one man who knows a lot about the country's  corporate culture.  That is Michael Woodford.  He is the former chief  executive of Japanese tech giant Olympus.  </p><p>He was ousted from the company after he blew the whistle on a cover-up  of $1.7 billion in losses at the firm.  He took that story directly to the  \"Financial Times,\" which helped expose the fraud.  He joins me live from  London.  Thank you for being here, sir.</p><p>MICHAEL WOODFORD, FORMER CEO, OLYMPUS:  Hello, Poppy, nice to see you.</p><p>HARLOW:  You are being very vocal about this sale.  You don't like it.</p><p>WOODFORD:  It's -- \"don't like it\" seems very simplistic.  I care  passionately for Japan, and journalism is important.  And in my case, I  experienced firsthand what the Japanese media is like.  </p><p>And frankly, it's self-censoring and very deferential, if not  reverential, to the powerful forces, including much of corporate Japan.   And that troubles me that the \"Financial Times\" is going to be owned by  that type of organization.</p><p>HARLOW:  To be fair and balanced here, I do want to play you some  sound from the CEO of Nikkei and what they said addressing some of the  concerns earlier today.  Let's roll it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OKADA (through translator):  Nikkei has no intention whatsoever to  force \"Financial Times\" to do the editing and reporting as exactly as  Nikkei is doing.  Nikkei and \"Financial Times\" are totally separate in  terms of following their respective editorial procedure and policy, and how  the articles are to be formulated are independently to be figured out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  So, let's assume the best here.</p><p>WOODFORD:  That --</p><p>HARLOW:  Let's assume the best here.  They're keeping the FT where it  is, same location, everything.  Is there any sort of independent body,  commission, anything that can come in that you think can help maintain that  integrity, since there are some concerns?</p><p>WOODFORD:  I think the Nikkei has a notorious reputation in Japan, and  investors know this, that they have what's called \"quarterly reviews,\"  which companies use to leak price-sensitive information.  It's a cozy,  comfortable organization with corporate Japan. </p><p>Very different to the \"Financial Times.\"  And I think the problem lies  that if you can imagine in my case, it's the Enron of Japan, nearly a $2  billion fraud.  </p><p>I wouldn't now go to the \"Financial Times\" because while I think their  independence will remain, I think to run the story which they did within a  matter of hours of meeting their bureau chief in Tokyo, it was on their  website and the front page of their newspaper the following day.</p><p>Now, if you are attacking a major Japanese corporation, because of the  Nikkei link, I think the journalists would be more cautious, they would go  back to London for approval, they would be more cautious, and it would take  more time.  And in those type of scenarios, time is everything.</p><p>HARLOW:  It's interesting, you point out that you brought, as you  said, your story there when you were ousted, they put it up on the page.   I'm wondering if you think that some of this concern will hurt the FT's  chances at all of getting some of these biggest scoops.  Because you wrote  that you would've taken your story to, say, \"The New York Times\" if the FT  at the time were owned by Nikkei.</p><p>WOODFORD:  Absolutely.  I think -- Nikkei itself is an organization  which should be under scrutiny, and how does the \"Financial Times,\" which  has done many stories on Nikkei, about its weakness in covering the Olympus  and other scandals, about the way this phenomena in Japan of leaking price- sensitive information.  </p><p>How does a journalist in the Tokyo bureau in particular start to write  critical articles?  Now, I'm sure there'll be some, but I think they will  be written in a different way.  People are human.  Lionel Barber, I have a  great respect for his intellect --</p><p>HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>WOODFORD:  He's been the editor for ten years.  But who appoints the  new editor?  Who appoints the new editor?  That will be the gentlemen, the  German and the CEO we saw at today's news conference.  And their  journalistic are totally different than western organizations. </p><p>And it's not because it's foreign.  I don't mind who owns a chocolate  company or a car company.  And I wouldn't mind if the \"Financial Times\" had  gone to a German company or a Canadian or an American company or an  Australian. </p><p>But Japan's media is, and it's known to be, self-censoring.  And that  sort of mixing into the DNA, you said there was going to be layoffs, and  that's true, but the president of the Nikkei said today that they may share  the same buildings in some of the bureaus.</p><p>[16:20:05]  And that type of -- again, you're a journalist, the flavor  and the feel and the independence -- and it might not be this month, it  might be not next year.</p><p>HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>WOODFORD:  But when there's a big critical story in Japan, I think the  way the \"Financial Times\" covers it will be affected.</p><p>HARLOW:  So, we will watch, we will see.  But I have a potential idea  from one journalist.  Maybe you pen an op-ed about this in the \"Financial  Times\"?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOODFORD:  I'm sure they'd be happy to do that.  Today they were  quoting me.  But the trouble for the world is Japan is the third-largest  economy.  It's -- so much is going on, we have Abenomics, we've got  quantitative easing, and you want accurate, probing questions, journalists  turning the stones.  </p><p>That's not the way the media works in Japan, and that will some --  over time, I'm sure, influence the way the FT works in Japan.</p><p>HARLOW:  I hope it is not the case.  Michael Woodford, thank you very  much for being with me, sir.</p><p>WOODFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW:  All right.  Well, it kills hundreds of thousands every year.   And now, scientists could be on the verge of killing malaria for good.  And  extraordinary update for you, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW:  Well, scientists have come one step closer to wiping out one  of the world's deadliest viruses.  The first ever malaria vaccine has just  cleared a major hurdle in the approval process. </p><p>Keep in mind, the virus killed more than half a million people in 2013  alone.  Almost all of the deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.  And most of the  victims were children under the age of five.  Isa Soares has more on the  potential breakthrough in this fight against this deadly disease.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  After  almost 30 years of research and millions of dollars, malaria may soon get a  final shot in the arm.  European regulators have now given the green light  to the vaccine known as Mosquirix, or RTS,S.  A drug developed by  GlaxoSmithKline, partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p><p>RAMIL BURDEN, VP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ASIA AND EXTERNAL AFFAIRS  AFRICA, GLAXOSMITHKLINE:  The trials are being conducted in seven different  countries in sub-Saharan Africa and involve 13,000 children.  The children  in the trial would have, for example, they would sleep under bed nets and  they would have access to the best health care if they got sick.  So, the  vaccine is really an additional tool on the gold standard of care.</p><p>SOARES:  The vaccine works by stopping the malaria parasite maturing  and multiplying in the liver, after which it would normally enter the  patient's bloodstream and trigger the disease's symptoms.</p><p>But the trials are already raising questions over the drug's  effectiveness.  Results show the vaccine was most effective in children  between 5 and 17 months, cutting the number of malaria cases by nearly  half.</p><p>In babies up to 3 months, though, that drops by 27 percent, with the  protection wearing off over time, and with the need for booster shots.</p><p>DAVID CONWAY, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND TROPICAL  MEDICINE:  It is only a quarter of the people or a third of the people will  be protected.  So, that -- will that benefit be enough, is the question.   And the booster doses could be done, but will they be cost-effective in  particular different situations in order to reduce malaria?  Or will other  tools against malaria be more cost-effective?</p><p>[16:24:49]  SOARES:  This is, nevertheless, a first big step towards a  vaccine, and this could be a game changer in Africa, where there have been  198 million cases of malaria, and an estimated 584,000 deaths in 2013,  mostly among children.  Now, it's up to the World Health Organization to  give its stamp of approval.</p><p>BURDEN:  We believe that this is an additional tool.  It's not the  only answer, but it's an additional tool to help tackle one of the world's  biggest killers and infectious diseases.</p><p>SOARES:  Isa Soares, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW:  My next guest leads a global advocacy group to stop the  spread of preventable diseases, like malaria.  Michael Elliott is the  president and CEO of ONE.  He joins me live this evening from Washington.  </p><p>Michael, when you look at the numbers, it is stunning, 584,000 people  dying in 2013, 90 percent of them in sub-Saharan Africa, 1,197 children  dying every -- day from malaria, 30 years of research, how big is this?</p><p>MICHAEL ELLIOTT, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ONE:  I think it's very big,  Poppy, and I thought your report just now was absolutely terrific.  It kind  of set out why this could possibly put us over the edge in really looking  for something that does whip malaria.  And some of the pitfalls and some of  the challenges still to go.</p><p>The numbers that you've just given, we can kind of boil those down for  the viewers.  Pretty much one child dies a minute of malaria, one a minute.</p><p>HARLOW:  Wow.</p><p>ELLIOTT:  Six hundred thousand or so --</p><p>(COUGHS)</p><p>ELLIOTT:  Excuse me.  Six hundred thousand or so, as you said, die  every year, one child every minute.  So, as we know, as your report just  said, the World Health Organization still has to give the final approval of  this.  </p><p>But when you put this together with bed nets and with other forms of  treatment, it's a big deal.  And the people at GSK who developed it through  our friends at the Gates Foundation --</p><p>HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>ELLIOTT:  -- who put this program together, it's a very significant  step.</p><p>HARLOW:  Now, at the same time, individual countries have to give the  vaccine final approval before it can be administered to children.  And we  know in some communities, there is a resistance to Western medicine, there  is a resistance to, perhaps, giving something to a very young child.  Are  you concerned about that?</p><p>ELLIOTT:  Well, I think one of the things that we've discovered over  the last 10 or 15 years is that there is no more effective health  intervention in the world in terms of saving lives, in terms of saving  children's lives and making sure that people have a healthy and productive  life, than vaccinations.</p><p>Vaccinations are as close to a silver bullet for many of our -- of the  world's health issues as you can ever possibly get.  So of course, there  have been kind of cultural issues over vaccinations around the world.  But  I think we now have a really solid record that vaccinations change lives,  change communities, change countries for the better.  </p><p>And today's news, tackling really one of the kind of main killers out  there, 600,000 a year, is just another indication of what vaccines can do.</p><p>HARLOW:  Michael, at the same time, we saw what happened with Ebola  and the limited availability of Z-map.  But I know this isn't that same  situation, but I just wonder how you make sure that it can be monitored,  that it isn't controlled solely by one entity, that it can get widely  distributed at an affordable price.</p><p>ELLIOTT:  Great questions, Poppy.  And all of those are kind of really  good public policy questions that we and many other groups address and  should address, because all these are questions that need to be asked, need  to be answered.  </p><p>Who's profiting?  Is the distribution done well?  Is the good data --  absolutely key point, kind of sounds really dull -- but is there really  good data on who's taking the drugs so that one can measure the  effectiveness and ensure that the benefits that we claim for them are  actually being delivered?  Or do you somehow need to re-calibrate the  program so that you -- get bigger and better gain?</p><p>So, all of these are questions of public policy, which absolutely need  to be addressed and taken seriously.  The important thing that's happened  today, I think, is a recognition that the science is moving in really  productive and exciting ways such that we can kind of see that, as I say,  we can kind of push malaria over the edge.</p><p>We can push the fight against malaria over the edge and really move  into a situation where this extraordinary killer disease, is genuinely,  genuinely, in retreat.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>ELLIOTT:  I mean, it's already in retreat.</p><p>HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>ELLIOTT:  We've reduced malaria deaths by half in 15 years.  But we  can do even more.</p><p>HARLOW:  Michael Elliott with ONE.  Thank you very much.  An exciting  day for the world, frankly.  Thank you, sir.</p><p>ELLIOTT:  Thanks, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW:  Chrysler recalls nearly 1.5 million cars after startling  video.  You know what this video shows?

First though, these are the top headlines we are following this hour.</p><p>Police in Louisiana say the gunman who opened fire in a crowded  theater Thursday appears to have acted alone.  They say 59-year-old John  Russel Houser killed two people and wounded nine before turning the gun on  himself.  He had been treated in the past for mental health issues,  institutionalized and police say they're still trying to figure out what  his motive was.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>COLONEL MICHAEL EDMONSON, LOUISIANA STATE POLICE:  The thing (ph) that  I seek from the men and women that make up the Lafayette Police Department  is trying to find a motive, trying to find a motive, trying to find a goal,  trying to find something that says why did he walk in that theater.  </p><p>Why'd he fire at least 13 times?  Why did he turn around and go back  in there?  Why'd he leave his car outside the keys on top of the tire?  Why  was he living in a Motel 8?  Why did he have wigs in there and little  glasses and all those types of things?  Any little thing - that's what  those DNA scientists are doing inside that theater right now.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  U.S. President Barack Obama has arrived in his father's  homeland of Kenya.  His half-sister greeted him at the Nairobi Airport  along with Kenyan - Kenya's president.  Also Kenyans lined the streets of  the capital to catch a glimpse of President Obama's motorcade.  It is the  first time that a sitting U.S. president has made a visit to Kenya.  </p><p>And the president of Burundi has won a highly-contested third term as  leader.  The election commission announcing a decision on Friday after a  vote marred by violent protests in opposition, boycotts also coup attempt.   Officials say Pierre Nkurunziza got nearly 70 percent of the vote in the  African nation.  The opposition maintains that term limits made his  candidacy unconstitutional.  </p><p>And Turkey says it is opening up some of its airbases in order to  crack down on terrorism in the region.  The country has announced that U.S.  and coalition forces can use some of those bases to launch airstrikes  against ISIS.  This comes after Turkish jets carried out their own strikes  against ISIS positions in Syria earlier in the day on Friday.</p><p>And FIFA has admitted its massive corruption scandal is indeed hurting  its business, specifically its sponsorship deals.

The recall comes after a really shocking video was  released this week.  Look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ANDY GREENBERG, REPORTER, \"WIRED\" MAGAZINE:  All right, all the -  something just turned on all the fans and a/c and stuff - I didn't do that.   The trip started -- </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  That is hackers demonstrating how with the laptop from far  away they can remotely control the Jeep that is driving.  Laurie Segall, of  course she spoke with the hackers.  She always gets the scoop on this.  And  they showed her how they did this.  This is the new reality - cars are  computers.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT FOR CNNMONEY:  Yes.   Absolutely.  I mean, cars are computers and because of that, they have  never been more vulnerable.  Companies seemed to start taking that  seriously.  That's why they're doing this research, Poppy.  </p><p>I want to first of all pull up a list - </p><p>HARLOW:  Right, so we can see which ones.  </p><p>SEGALL:  -- out of all the makes and models Chryslers' recalling  because it's quite a few.  Take a look - see if you're on there.  And I  will say this now -- Chrysler's upgraded its network.  They said they can  no longer prevent remote hacking, but I spoke to one of the hackers just a  couple of minutes ago before I came up here, and he said you're absolutely  right, you can't remotely hack anymore.  But he did say if I am near your  car, I can still exploit a Wi-Fi hotspot, potentially to get in.</p><p>So he says if those - if your car was on that list, go to your  dealership.  They're going to give a USB stick and they will help update  that - they will help patch it.  So very, very important to do, Poppy.  </p><p>You've got to remember that these cars are connected to the internet.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Right.  </p><p>SEGALL:  You've got to remember that they're scanning the internet  looking for vulnerabilities.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Right.  Maybe this is a reason to bike, I don't know. </p><p>SEGALL:  (LAUGHTER).</p><p>HARLOW:  Look, let's talk more about the hacker that you spoke with.   I think you have some sound, right?  From what he said.</p><p>SEGALL:  Yes.  I absolutely didn't remember I spoke to these guys  years ago and they were demonstrating their first very high-profile hack  for me.  So I was able to catch up with one of them again and I said what's  different?  And before they'd been able to hack but only from inside the  car.</p><p>So I asked what is different.  Listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CHRIS VALASEK, DIRECTOR OF VEHICLE SECURITY RESEARCH IOACTIVE:  Now we  don't have to be in the car, we don't have to be connected.  We don't even  have to be in the same state.  So we can reach any car in the United States  and potentially North America. </p><p>SEGALL:  What were you able to do?  </p><p>VALASEK:  We were able to do almost everything we were the last time  we did this - steering, braking, lock and unlock the doors, turn on the  high-beams, basically anything that car was controllable over the in-car  network, we were able to do.</p><p>SEGALL:  What do you want people to kind of take away from this?</p><p>VALASEK:  The statement I reiterate is we're the good guys.  Bad guys  don't you about what's wrong.  They keep to themselves and use it for  whatever they want to use it for.  You know, we're out there to let people  know the risk exposure and help manufacturers get things fixed.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SEGALL:  Now if only the companies would hire these guys so they don't  have to go - </p><p>HARLOW:  Some of them do.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>HARLOW:  Ford told me that they employ hackers.  </p><p>SEGALL:  They need - I think this kind of research shows that they  need to be doing what Ford is doing - they need to hire more security and  researchers.  And when I spoke to Charlie, one of the other hackers  involved, what he said was these companies need to treat security like  companies that house secured data.  They need to be constantly testing  themselves, constantly to break in to their own networks which are more  connected than ever. </p><p>And @Charlie Miller - he said this on Twitter - he's one of the  hackers and I think he said it best.  He said, \"I wonder what's cheaper -  designing secured cars or doing recalls.\"  </p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.  </p><p>SEGALL:  These guys are going to have more companies investing now --  slowly.  </p><p>HARLOW:   Right.  Laurie Segall, fascinating stuff.  I'm going to keep  biking, all right, thank you.</p><p>SEGALL:  (LAUGHTER).</p><p>HARLOW:  Have a great weekend.  More than a trillion dollars' worth of  tech products - everything from video games to semiconductors could be a  whole lot cheaper for you.  That is because of a $1 trillion deal - yes,  trillion with a 't.\"  </p><p>After more than a decade of talks and back and forth and negotiations,  the World Trade Organization has reached a deal to get rid of tariffs on  tech products traded around the world on more than 200 products.</p><p>I asked the director general Roberto Azevedo if this move could really  help boost GDP.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROBERTO AZEVEDO, DIRECTOR GENERAL, WTO:  We have many statistics I  think at this point in time.  Some are pointing to something close to $200  billion per year.  It's a big deal.  </p><p>HARLOW:  What do you expect that this will do for jobs?  Because that  is such a focus herein the United States, across Europe, etc.  What does  this do for jobs?</p><p>AZEVEDO:  We're expecting a big bump in terms of economic output.  So  we - because this is not a deal that affects only the products like that  201 products that is on the list - that are on the list.  </p><p>This is going to affect other sectors as well.  So we should expect  increased demand for example because the prices for consumers are going  down.  </p><p>[16:40:01] This is going to help other areas of the industry that use  these products as components to lower their costs as well.  </p><p>Services which use these products for example in hospitals or in  telecom - all these things are going to be cheaper to the consumer and to  the producers.  So the overall effect should be one of a positive stimulus,  therefore job creation.</p><p>HARLOW:  Are you confident that some of these savings will be passed  on to consumers?  </p><p>AZEVEDO:  Absolutely.  You're talking about a deal which is about 7 -  more than 7 percent of total global trade.  For something like this to  happen that you're suggesting where producers pocket all the benefits, you  would require an extremely coordinated effort on the part of all producers  to do that.  </p><p>Because all it takes is that a few of them decide to share the  benefits with the consumer to get more market share, to be more competitive  and the deal is over.  Everybody's competing.  This is a very, very  competitive market.  I can't see how the producers are going to pocket this  and not share the benefits with the consumers.  </p><p>HARLOW:  This deal has been more than decade in the making.  Now  you've got it inked - freshly inked.  Do you think that deals like this -  our - the best way to stimulate trade in this global economy right now when  there is such an urgent need for more investment.  Is this the best way? </p><p>AZEVEDO:  This is one of the good ways to do it.  I hope that we can  use this to inspire negotiations even here in the WTO.  In less than two  years we had two major agreements - we had the Trade Facilitation Agreement  in Bali which is worth about $1 trillion a year and this one which is going  to inject an additional stimulus of an order of magnitude of about $200  billion a year.  </p><p>These are very big agreements and they're different in nature.  While  in Bali the Trade Facilitation Agreement the commitments were flexible but  the membership was everybody.  This one is different.  This one is the  commitment to very strict, very uniform.  But the signatories vary.  It's  more - it's more flexible in terms of accessions.  </p><p>So these are different agreements.  We can play with those things and  make sure that we keep delivering.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  Well the secretary general of the WTO there.  Well the chief  executive of drinks company, Pernod Ricard, is hoping to spot the next big  tech sensation.  </p><p>Alexandre Ricard is one of four judges who will give $1 million to a  startup entrepreneur who wins this.  It's called \"The Venture,\" and it pits  16 social entrepreneurs and their ideas against one another.  Those  startups are trying to make a positive impact while also of course turning  a profit.  </p><p>Also on the panel, Adrian Grenier known for portraying the character  Vinnie Chase from \"Entourage.\"  A little star power there.  Alexandre  Ricard joins me now from San Francisco.  </p><p>Thank you for being with me, sir.  I appreciate it very much.  Let's  talk about - </p><p>ALEXANDRE RICARD, CEO, PERNOD RICARD:  A pleasure.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Thank you.  OK, let's talk about why you're doing this.  Is  it because you want to get these smart folks into your fold at the company  or is this a pure advertising, marketing play?</p><p>RICARD:  You know, at the end of the day, the challenge I've put in  front of the Chivas Regal brand team was how can you bring to life the  Chivas brand values in a pioneering and in an innovative way.  And they  went and did a lot of digging into the Chivas history going back to the two  brothers, the Chivas brothers - James and John in 1801, and they were  social entrepreneurs.  </p><p>So basically they came up with that idea to do what would have these  two brothers done in today's world given the global nature of the world and  given the technology.  That's point one.</p><p>And point two I believe both from a talent attraction retention point  of view and a consumer point of view, the new generations are extremely  sensitive to a better world.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.  </p><p>RICARD:  So I think it's the best of two worlds.  </p><p>HARLOW:  It's a great point.  I was just talking to Sir Martin Sorrell  of WPP at the beginning of the show about exactly that - I mean,  millennials are demanding that companies stand for something good.  You  know, alcohol companies - any kind of company - they want it to stand for  some social good.  </p><p>Outside of your sector, I'm interested in where you think the most  innovation is needed.  Pharma?  Tech?  What do you look at? </p><p>RICARD:  Well listen, I'll tell you -- based on the 16 finalists which  means they come from 16 different countries and they made the cut from over  1,000 entries which is to tell you how many people around the world are so  eager to make a change.</p><p>[16:45:06] And we see willingness to change climate.  Environment is  something which is big.  And we have seen a few projects, one of them being  how to save water, how to make agricultural more efficient from a water  usage point of view.  Recycling as well is big.  </p><p>So that's from a climate point of view, but you also have disease and  health - how to track animals around the world and identify anomalies  through small chips and satellites tracking.  That's another domain again.   Disabled as well - that's something which is important or the elderly.  And  finally, poverty - how to give access to poor households to affordable  homes, how to prevent - you know - shack fires in emerging markets.  So  quite a few domains.</p><p>And people - these young generations - are extremely passionate about  it, they have a lot of drive and commitment and I have to say it's - for  people like - it is inspiring.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes, they certainly are demanding a new way to have business  operate.  So I thank you so much for joining me on what looks like an  absolutely beautiful day there in San Francisco, sir.  Appreciate it.</p><p>RICARD:  Thank you very much. </p><p>HARLOW:  Coming up, it is the moment many Kenyans had been waiting  for.  President Obama makes a historic visit to his ancestral homeland.  We  are live in Nairobi next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW:  U.S. President Barack Obama has touched down in his ancestral  homeland for the first time ever since entering the Oval Office.  The U.S.  president is in Kenya as part of a tour aimed at strengthening diplomatic  relations in the region.  </p><p>A huge security operation is underway amid concern about terror from  al Shahab militants.  The President due to meet with the Kenyan president  on Saturday before becoming the first sitting U.S. president in history to  visit neighboring Ethiopia.  </p><p>Barack Obama's trip is also designed to bolster economic ties between  the U.S. and Kenya.  He is due to attend a U.S.-sponsored entrepreneurship  summit there in Nairobi. </p><p>That is where we find our Jim Acosta - in the Kenyan capital joining  me.  So obviously he was in East Africa and he was talking about - talking  about - the economy, etc. and business.  But he's also spending some really  quality, frankly, family time.  </p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  That's right,  Poppy.  President Obama has arrived in Africa.  He's here in Kenya, he's on  the ground in Nairobi landing in his father's homeland earlier this  evening.  The president was greeted at the airport by Kenya's president  Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr. Obama's half-sister, Auma.  </p><p>And shortly after that greeting at the airport, the President along  with some of his relatives went out to dinner here in the Kenyan capital.   So he is getting in touch with his family once again.  </p><p>[16:45:03] The President will spend the next few days focusing on  efforts to boost Africa's economy and security with a speech at that  entrepreneurial summit that you mentioned, Poppy.  </p><p>And then there's going to be a major address to the African people on  Sunday here in Kenya.  He's going to be talking about his Kenyan roots at  that point.  </p><p>But we should point out - and this is a - I think that it's a little  bit disappointing to the White House -- for logistical and security  reasons, he's not going to be going to his ancestral village of Kogelo  where his father is from.  Instead those relatives will be coming in and  out of Nairobi.  </p><p>But also a big topic of discussion here for this president will be the  fight against terrorist groups in this part of the world, namely al  Shabaab, which as you know has carried out terrorist attacks here in Kenya.   That has resulted in a massive security presence here, and I can just tell  you, Poppy, from being out on the streets earlier today here in Nairobi, it  was eerily quiet.</p><p>I mean, these - I was told by people on the streets that these avenues  and boulevards should be jam-packed with people, especially when somebody  like Barack Obama is coming back to this country of his father.  </p><p>But because of the security precautions that have been taken here, a  lot of people have just decided to stay home and watch this on television  although we should point out when he was making his way through the streets  of Nairobi, they were pretty full at that point -- a lot of people waving  and cheering - a lot of pride in this African-American president -- </p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.  </p><p>ACOSTA:  -- and somebody that they consider to be person who is very  much a part of Africa.  Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW:  Absolutely.  Really nice to see that embrace with his half- sister there right when he got off the plane.  Jim Acosta, enjoy the trip.  </p><p>ACOSTA:  Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW:  I'm sure it's fascinating to be on the ground there.  Thank  you very much.  </p><p>Next - switching gears in a major way - Taylor Swift heading to China  later this year.  It is great news for her fans there.  However, Chinese  censors may take issue with her merchandise.  We'll tell you why next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW:  Taylor Swift may find herself the object of a little bit of  unwanted scrutiny.  The pop star's world tour is due to visit Shanghai in  November.  There's just one problem.  Unfortunately for Taylor, it is the  name of her tour - 1989.  </p><p>Now that is just the name of her album and the year she was born.  She  is quite young.  Combine that with her initial T.S., and it could look like  a reference to Tiananmen Square and the bloody crackdown there on pro- democracy protests.  Will Ripley looks at the brewing controversy from  Beijing.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC CLIP FROM TAYLOR SWIFT'S SONG, \"SHAKE IT OFF\")</p><p>--Gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake</p><p>I shake it off, I shake it off.</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  One of the biggest hits  from Taylor Swift's album \"1989\" is all about shaking it off, a skill  that'll come in handy in China where the superstar's exploding popularity  brings potential pitfalls.  </p><p>Taylor Swift's initials, T.S., could be mistaken as a reference for  Tiananmen Square where I'm standing right now. And her album \"1989,\" the  year she was born, is also the year when hundreds of pro-democracy  protestors died in a government crackdown here.</p><p>This issue is so sensitive here in China, we could actually be  detained just for reporting in this location.  </p><p>Taken out of context, the pop star's clothing line could be  politically combustible says University of Denver professor and China  expert Jing Sun.  </p><p>PROFESSOR JING SUN, UNIVERSITY OF DENVER:  If it turns out you have a  group of people that will be wearing such problematic (tashas) and they  gather together -- if that is the scenario the government encounters -- I'm  sure the government will do something about it.  </p><p>So far, state-authorized search engines are not censoring T.S.1989  merchandise.  </p><p>SUN:  If the government tries to take a heavy-hand approach on that,  it could backfire.  And I think (inaudible).</p><p>[16:55:04] RIPLEY:  Sun says the bigger obstacle facing Swift is  places like this.  This is Beijing's famous silk market.  You can see  busloads of people come here, a lot of them Western tourists.  They come by  the millions each year for counterfeit versions of the world's biggest  brands - openly sold for a fraction of the price.  </p><p>There are so many people here, it's incredible and even though most of  what's being sold is fake, this place brings in so much money - the  authorities, the market supervisors - they just look the other way.  </p><p>Taylor Swift's clothing line hasn't even launched yet in China, but  knockoffs are already big sellers online.  </p><p>SUN:  That is one thing Taylor Swift can be sure about.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  Sun says it's a part of doing business in the world's  counterfeiting super power.  How big of a threat is the counterfeit issue  to artists like Taylor Swift?</p><p>SUN:  In fact it will be far more of fabricated items than authentic  ones that will be circulating in the Chinese market.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  He says Swift still stands to make massive profits, teaming  up with Chinese e-commerce giants JD and Alibaba, China's insatiable  appetite for American pop culture is a gold mine for the highest-paid woman  in music, meaning Swift will likely be 'shaking it off' all the way to the  bank.  Will Ripley, CNN Beijing.</p><p>HARLOW:  We will be right back with more \"Quest Means Business\" in  just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW:  The heavy selling continues for U.S. stock.  For the second  day in a row we saw triple-digit loss on the Dow.  We actually started the  week well above 18,000, now that index has lost around 500 points in the  space of just a few days.  Falling commodity prices are partly to blame.  </p><p>Also in corporate news, the biggest media merger of the year just  getting a green light from U.S. regulators.  AT&amp;T is going buy DirecTV in a  deal worth $49 billion.  </p><p>And that is \"Quest Means Business.\"  I'm Poppy Harlow.  Thanks so much  for being with us.

It is Friday, the 24th of July.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, for a substitution. FIFA's sponsors make their loudest call yet for change at the top.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon amazes investors and becomes the world's most valuable retailer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a trillion-dollar tech deal a long time in the making. I will ask the head of the WTO if your tech goods are about to get a whole lot cheaper.</p><p>I'm Poppy Harlow and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Good evening, welcome to the program. Tonight, FIFA admits that it's having trouble getting new sponsors, and the ones it already has, well, they want a meeting. The current situation doesn't help, said the FIFA secretary general, referring to the massive corruption and bribery scandal that has rocked the football world since May.</p><p>The organization has not signed a single new sponsor since the last World Cup, and the secretary general of FIFA is not expecting any new partnership until FIFA president Sepp Blatter is finally out of office. He says that the current sponsors are not happy either, and he called for a summit for next month to help try to quell the concerns.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME VALCKE, SECRETARY GENERAL, FIFA: Clearly, yes, there were a number of sponsors, mainly three, I would say, and it's three, in fact. It's Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Visa, who have expressed and sent letter to FIFA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: And also you will remember this scene from Monday during FIFA president Sepp Blatter's press conference. The British comedian on the stage, jumping on stage, showering him cash. The comedian trying to make a point about alleged rampant bribery within FIFA, and now sponsors are piling on the pressure for the football's governing body to, frankly, shape up.</p><p>In his earnings call, the CEO of Visa called FIFA's response to the scandal, quote, \"wholly inadequate,\" and demanded a fully-independent commission to oversee reforms there. He said officials don't seem to be aware of how serious this problem is. And meaningful changes cannot be made until, he says, new leadership takes over.</p><p>A few hours ago, Budweiser's parent company, InBev, joined that call, saying that FIFA should empower an independent commission, quote, \"without delay.\" And earlier this week, Coca-Cola said an independent commission would help FIFA, quote, \"build back the trust that it has lost.\"</p><p>Also, McDonald's, another huge sponsor, said it is not satisfied, and will not be without the transparency of an independent commission. And that leaves Adidas, Hyundai, and Gazprom as key sponsors of FIFA who are, frankly, yet to speak up. All of this pressure from sponsors seems to be ruffling FIFA secretary general's feathers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALCKE: I love your questions. They are so friendly, so positive, so nice. You want me to resign, you want me to think about my future, you want to know if I'm traveling. What else? What I had for lunch or breakfast this morning?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: So, joining me in the C Suite is Sir Martin Sorrell, the CEO --</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL, CEO, WPP: -- Poppy Quest.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW: -- of WPP. It is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it's Poppy in the hot seat trying to fill Richard's large shoes, which is --</p><p>SORRELL: Big shoes to fill.</p><p>HARLOW: -- pretty impossible, but I am happy to be here. So happy to have you.</p><p>SORRELL: Good.</p><p>HARLOW: Who better to talk about this. When you look at FIFA, targeting $6 billion in revenue --</p><p>SORRELL: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: -- from the 2018 tournament.</p><p>SORRELL: Yes. From that core, from that four-year period, yes.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. And you looked at --</p><p>SORRELL: Actually, less than -- less on an average basis than Formula 1. Formula 1 is about $1.7 billion a year. Interestingly, World Cup is about $1.5 billion. So, interesting.</p><p>HARLOW: Still quite a lot, right?</p><p>SORRELL: Yes, quite a lot, but it could be more, actually, if properly run, I think.</p><p>HARLOW: So, it has a lot of upside potential --</p><p>SORRELL: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: -- but we just went through the list. Visa chastising FIFA for a lack of awareness.</p><p>SORRELL: Coca-Cola --</p><p>HARLOW: McDonald's, Coca-Cola. You work with all of these firms.</p><p>SORRELL: Yes. InBev as well, now.</p><p>HARLOW: What do you think the long-term fallout is going to be?</p><p>SORRELL: I think long term, as long as there's reform, and this is -- you could look at this as an opportunity, it's not dissimilar -- it's not as bad, obviously -- with the IOC a few years ago after Salt Lake City and Atlanta and everything. There was change.</p><p>Juan Samaranch was the first IOC president to change the institution. That was followed by Jacques Rogge, and now by Thomas Bach, who's taken a very strong position on a number of major issues. There's going to be the IOCcongress in Kuala Lumpur on August the 1st.</p><p>And what's interesting is it's so -- it was a similar situation, but of smaller scale and smaller magnitude. But same thing: reform, reform is necessary. And it has to be neutral reform. There's no -- maybe this is a little bit aggressive to say -- but lunatics can't be judge of the asylum.</p><p>They've got to change. And what's interesting about what Visa and Coca-Cola and McDonald's, and now InBev as well, are saying is that they have to change, and there has to be a neutral, independent commission --</p><p>[16:05:01] HARLOW: But --</p><p>SORRELL: -- that initiates. It's no good the same group of people --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>SORRELL: -- reelecting somebody --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW: And they -- they're all --</p><p>SORRELL: -- from that same group.</p><p>HARLOW: It's one thing to have a new leader in place and figurehead.</p><p>SORRELL: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: It's another thing to change culture and practice. And it's not just one person. So, you have this meeting next month with FIFA, with McDonald's, with Coca-Cola.</p><p>SORRELL: With all due respect, it is about leadership. Sepp Blatter said he can't be held responsible for all this. Well, whether he likes it or not --</p><p>HARLOW: You are.</p><p>SORRELL: -- he has -- you are responsible.</p><p>HARLOW: But how do they prove it? How do they prove to the sponsors things are different?</p><p>SORRELL: Well, it's a question about the quality of the people that - - if it's an independent commission or whoever the next leader is going to be. Electing another leader from the same group who would be tarred or tainted with a similar approach -- maybe of a different scale, but a similar approach -- is not going to solve the problem.</p><p>The World Cup is the premier global sporting event. It is the premier live sporting event. After that, you have the Olympics close to it. And then you have Formula 1, which I'm a non-executive director of. So, those are the three events that are global sporting events that appeal to global audiences.</p><p>HARLOW: Let me ask you this. I believe -- I'm of the millennial generation. I'm in the old end, but I am.</p><p>SORRELL: I am not, unfortunately.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW: That's OK. We'll forgive you. But --</p><p>SORRELL: I'm an aging Millennial.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW: But what we know, what the studies bear out, is that Millennials care deeply about the companies that they buy products from --</p><p>SORRELL: Absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW: -- and what those companies stand for.</p><p>SORRELL: And the employees, moreover.</p><p>HARLOW: And employees want to work for a company that live by those creeds.</p><p>SORRELL: And that's why the sponsors are taking such a strong position.</p><p>HARLOW: That's why I'm wondering is why we're seeing all of these storied companies coming out and being so vocal. Is it because the young buyers --</p><p>SORRELL: Well, there's --</p><p>HARLOW: -- expect it?</p><p>SORRELL: It's a very difficult position, because you have a legal contract. Nothing is proven as yet. There are a lot of suggestions. A lot of arrests have been made, but there is a series of cases that are in the process of development. So, you have to be very careful what you say.</p><p>But what is now happening -- and I think, remember that Blatter was reelected in Zurich and with a lower majority than he thought and other people thought he was going to get, but he was reelected. Within 24, 48 hours, he was gone. He resigned.</p><p>Where did that pressure come from? My guess is, it came from the sponsors. They were restricted from what they could do by virtue of their legal contracts, but you're now seeing the pressure that they can exert.</p><p>What they're saying is, having a meeting in a few-months time to elect another leader from the same group of people may not be sufficient in their view. And you're absolutely right. Sustainability, purpose, is at the center of all the clients we do, and you're absolutely right that consumers buy products and services from companies that they admire.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SORRELL: And people go to work and stay at work and are motivated to work at companies they admire. So, this issue is extremely important.</p><p>Having said that, do I think that this is a disaster from which FIFA or World Cup football will never recover? No. The sport is so powerful, it's so important, you see the impact that it's had in American when the women's team won the Women's World Cup and the positive impact that will have. And I think that will build further grass roots for soccer or football here in this country.</p><p>HARLOW: It really is a changing business environment, and the business of business is no longer just business.</p><p>SORRELL: Doing good is good business.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SORRELL: John Brown, who was the CEO of BP many years ago said at Stanford Business School in 1997, doing good is good business. We over intellectualize all this stuff. It's very simple. If you're in business for the long term -- that's the critical determinant -- you will -- doing good is good business. It's good for your consumers, it's good for your customers, it's good for your people.</p><p>HARLOW: It's interesting. In the earnings call from Starbucks yesterday, the chief executive, Howard Schultz, said part of the reason for the record earnings, he thought, was the investment in their employees.</p><p>SORRELL: Absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW: And in their partners.</p><p>SORRELL: Well --</p><p>HARLOW: And spending more money on them resulted in --</p><p>SORRELL: We have the tenth anniversary of our brand valuation actually. One of the clear, clear lessons is that companies that have purpose at the center of their strategy --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SORRELL: -- have sustainability as part of that purpose.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SORRELL: Doing good is good business. It does, ironically, it does pay off. And it doesn't pay off in the context of a FIFA.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. And it's no longer --</p><p>SORRELL: Well, certainly not in the long term. It might have paid off in the short term.</p><p>HARLOW: -- you're no longer just sort of corporate speak. It's actually --</p><p>SORRELL: That's right.</p><p>HARLOW: -- needing to be played out.</p><p>SORRELL: That's right.</p><p>HARLOW: Sir Martin Sorrell, thank you very much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SORRELL: Thank you very much, indeed.</p><p>HARLOW: Have a lovely weekend. We appreciate it.</p><p>SORRELL: And you filled Richard boots --</p><p>HARLOW: I try, I try.</p><p>SORRELL: -- more than amply.</p><p>HARLOW: I try.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you, my friend.</p><p>Amazon. Amazon is really having quite a run. At the top of the heap, the online shopping giant replacing Walmart as the world's most valuable retailer. How did this happen? Overnight? We'll show you.</p><p>[16:09:51] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: The day has come, and Amazon is now worth more than Walmart. We told you yesterday on the program how Amazon's stellar results could be enough to make it the most valuable retailer in the world. Well now, that is indeed official.</p><p>Amazon shares up about 10 percent in Friday's closing, closing over $530 a share. That pushes the online retailers market value past brick- and-mortar giant Walmart by about, eh, just $20 billion. The closing share price puts Amazon's worth at around $250 billion. Walmart is valued at $230 billion.</p><p>Let's talk about it with Samuel Burke, CNN business correspondent. You know, last time you were here talking about Amazon --</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Uh-oh.</p><p>HARLOW: -- you were talking about Prime Day --</p><p>BURKE: Oh.</p><p>HARLOW: -- and how it was such a flop. And? Amazon sort of had the last laugh on that one. They said those sales topped Black Friday.</p><p>BURKE: I'm still a bit dubious of those.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURKE: I think I might have the last laugh, because Amazon is growing constantly, so I'm not -- I wouldn't be surprised if every day is better than Black Friday. I still had a very hard time finding anybody on Twitter saying, ooh, I just found a great deal.</p><p>But you're right. In the call last night, the CFO of Amazon says we were thrilled with Amazon Prime Day, and that they had huge sales, especially in terms of the number of people who signed up for Prime. So, they're touting it. And clearly the stock market likes it, up 10 percent. But I still have to point out one more thing.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>BURKE: Here we are, we are all gushing, analysts and whatnot, about Apple -- about Amazon.</p><p>HARLOW: And Apple.</p><p>BURKE: And Apple. But Amazon barely had any profit, just barely, and their stock is way up. Apple had this amazing profit and their stock is down 8 percent over -- in this past week. So, it is quite incredible.</p><p>HARLOW: It's a good point, because we were talking about surprise profit, surprise profit. But we're not talking about that much here. The strength in the Cloud business and third-party marketplaces.</p><p>BURKE: Absolutely incredible. Amazon web services is the part of Amazon that you rarely ever see. It's kind of the invisible thing that runs websites and applications where people store their documents, up 81 percent in terms of sales, up more than 400 percent --</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>BURKE: -- in terms of pure profit. And for a long time, they didn't break out those numbers, so a lot of us were very suspicious, thinking, well, they must have something to hide. And clearly, they have nothing to hide.</p><p>HARLOW: When you look at all of that, and you look at Jeff Bezos, a man, by the way, according to Bloomberg now, worth $43 billion as of yesterday, making him the seventh richest man in the world. But this is someone who is really, it just seems, at the beginning of the evolution of Amazon. Thrones -- where do we go from here?</p><p>BURKE: But I think the thing that you have to really credit him with is Amazon Prime, that $99 a year subscription. He got the idea from Costco, and in case you're overseas and you don't shop at Costco as much as we do here in the United States, think about the pure profit behind that, $99 a year just, like at Costco. That's -- it's just a membership, that's it.</p><p>So, that type of genius in terms of saying how can I replicate what Costco did in stores and bring that to my website? The truth is, Amazon products get to you almost as fast whether you have prime or not. So that is just profit, profit.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW: But I love seeing that I don't have to pay for the shipping.</p><p>BURKE: Yes, well, OK.</p><p>HARLOW: You know, we kind of love that.</p><p>BURKE: He loves that, too. It's making him rich and it's really business genius.</p><p>HARLOW: Because we're paying for it in many other ways. Samuel Burke, thank you so much, have a great weekend.</p><p>Well, turning to another very serious story, the CEO of Nikkei Group is promising to respect the editorial independence of the \"Financial Times.\" The declaration coming just a day after the Japanese media giant announced it was snapping up the business broad sheet for $1.3. Top Nikkei executives telling reporters their group can learn a lot from the FT.</p><p>[16:15:06] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAOTOSHI OKADA, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NIKKEI (through translator): The digital strategy, whether it is the system or whether it is the service development or the customer management, I would say that FT is a step ahead of us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: However, some have concerns, and they've raised them, about the FT's new ownership and just how independent the paper can be in Japan. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS has been reaching out to the FT today for comment. We have not heard back yet.</p><p>We do want to bring in one man who knows a lot about the country's corporate culture. That is Michael Woodford. He is the former chief executive of Japanese tech giant Olympus.</p><p>He was ousted from the company after he blew the whistle on a cover-up of $1.7 billion in losses at the firm. He took that story directly to the \"Financial Times,\" which helped expose the fraud. He joins me live from London. Thank you for being here, sir.</p><p>MICHAEL WOODFORD, FORMER CEO, OLYMPUS: Hello, Poppy, nice to see you.</p><p>HARLOW: You are being very vocal about this sale. You don't like it.</p><p>WOODFORD: It's -- \"don't like it\" seems very simplistic. I care passionately for Japan, and journalism is important. And in my case, I experienced firsthand what the Japanese media is like.</p><p>And frankly, it's self-censoring and very deferential, if not reverential, to the powerful forces, including much of corporate Japan. And that troubles me that the \"Financial Times\" is going to be owned by that type of organization.</p><p>HARLOW: To be fair and balanced here, I do want to play you some sound from the CEO of Nikkei and what they said addressing some of the concerns earlier today. Let's roll it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OKADA (through translator): Nikkei has no intention whatsoever to force \"Financial Times\" to do the editing and reporting as exactly as Nikkei is doing. Nikkei and \"Financial Times\" are totally separate in terms of following their respective editorial procedure and policy, and how the articles are to be formulated are independently to be figured out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: So, let's assume the best here.</p><p>WOODFORD: That --</p><p>HARLOW: Let's assume the best here. They're keeping the FT where it is, same location, everything. Is there any sort of independent body, commission, anything that can come in that you think can help maintain that integrity, since there are some concerns?</p><p>WOODFORD: I think the Nikkei has a notorious reputation in Japan, and investors know this, that they have what's called \"quarterly reviews,\" which companies use to leak price-sensitive information. It's a cozy, comfortable organization with corporate Japan.</p><p>Very different to the \"Financial Times.\" And I think the problem lies that if you can imagine in my case, it's the Enron of Japan, nearly a $2 billion fraud.</p><p>I wouldn't now go to the \"Financial Times\" because while I think their independence will remain, I think to run the story which they did within a matter of hours of meeting their bureau chief in Tokyo, it was on their website and the front page of their newspaper the following day.</p><p>Now, if you are attacking a major Japanese corporation, because of the Nikkei link, I think the journalists would be more cautious, they would go back to London for approval, they would be more cautious, and it would take more time. And in those type of scenarios, time is everything.</p><p>HARLOW: It's interesting, you point out that you brought, as you said, your story there when you were ousted, they put it up on the page. I'm wondering if you think that some of this concern will hurt the FT's chances at all of getting some of these biggest scoops. Because you wrote that you would've taken your story to, say, \"The New York Times\" if the FT at the time were owned by Nikkei.</p><p>WOODFORD: Absolutely. I think -- Nikkei itself is an organization which should be under scrutiny, and how does the \"Financial Times,\" which has done many stories on Nikkei, about its weakness in covering the Olympus and other scandals, about the way this phenomena in Japan of leaking price- sensitive information.</p><p>How does a journalist in the Tokyo bureau in particular start to write critical articles? Now, I'm sure there'll be some, but I think they will be written in a different way. People are human. Lionel Barber, I have a great respect for his intellect --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>WOODFORD: He's been the editor for ten years. But who appoints the new editor? Who appoints the new editor? That will be the gentlemen, the German and the CEO we saw at today's news conference. And their journalistic are totally different than western organizations.</p><p>And it's not because it's foreign. I don't mind who owns a chocolate company or a car company. And I wouldn't mind if the \"Financial Times\" had gone to a German company or a Canadian or an American company or an Australian.</p><p>But Japan's media is, and it's known to be, self-censoring. And that sort of mixing into the DNA, you said there was going to be layoffs, and that's true, but the president of the Nikkei said today that they may share the same buildings in some of the bureaus.</p><p>[16:20:05] And that type of -- again, you're a journalist, the flavor and the feel and the independence -- and it might not be this month, it might be not next year.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>WOODFORD: But when there's a big critical story in Japan, I think the way the \"Financial Times\" covers it will be affected.</p><p>HARLOW: So, we will watch, we will see. But I have a potential idea from one journalist. Maybe you pen an op-ed about this in the \"Financial Times\"?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOODFORD: I'm sure they'd be happy to do that. Today they were quoting me. But the trouble for the world is Japan is the third-largest economy. It's -- so much is going on, we have Abenomics, we've got quantitative easing, and you want accurate, probing questions, journalists turning the stones.</p><p>That's not the way the media works in Japan, and that will some -- over time, I'm sure, influence the way the FT works in Japan.</p><p>HARLOW: I hope it is not the case. Michael Woodford, thank you very much for being with me, sir.</p><p>WOODFORD: Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: All right. Well, it kills hundreds of thousands every year. And now, scientists could be on the verge of killing malaria for good. And extraordinary update for you, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: Well, scientists have come one step closer to wiping out one of the world's deadliest viruses. The first ever malaria vaccine has just cleared a major hurdle in the approval process.</p><p>Keep in mind, the virus killed more than half a million people in 2013 alone. Almost all of the deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. And most of the victims were children under the age of five. Isa Soares has more on the potential breakthrough in this fight against this deadly disease.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After almost 30 years of research and millions of dollars, malaria may soon get a final shot in the arm. European regulators have now given the green light to the vaccine known as Mosquirix, or RTS,S. A drug developed by GlaxoSmithKline, partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p><p>RAMIL BURDEN, VP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ASIA AND EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AFRICA, GLAXOSMITHKLINE: The trials are being conducted in seven different countries in sub-Saharan Africa and involve 13,000 children. The children in the trial would have, for example, they would sleep under bed nets and they would have access to the best health care if they got sick. So, the vaccine is really an additional tool on the gold standard of care.</p><p>SOARES: The vaccine works by stopping the malaria parasite maturing and multiplying in the liver, after which it would normally enter the patient's bloodstream and trigger the disease's symptoms.</p><p>But the trials are already raising questions over the drug's effectiveness. Results show the vaccine was most effective in children between 5 and 17 months, cutting the number of malaria cases by nearly half.</p><p>In babies up to 3 months, though, that drops by 27 percent, with the protection wearing off over time, and with the need for booster shots.</p><p>DAVID CONWAY, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND TROPICAL MEDICINE: It is only a quarter of the people or a third of the people will be protected. So, that -- will that benefit be enough, is the question. And the booster doses could be done, but will they be cost-effective in particular different situations in order to reduce malaria? Or will other tools against malaria be more cost-effective?</p><p>[16:24:49] SOARES: This is, nevertheless, a first big step towards a vaccine, and this could be a game changer in Africa, where there have been 198 million cases of malaria, and an estimated 584,000 deaths in 2013, mostly among children. Now, it's up to the World Health Organization to give its stamp of approval.</p><p>BURDEN: We believe that this is an additional tool. It's not the only answer, but it's an additional tool to help tackle one of the world's biggest killers and infectious diseases.</p><p>SOARES: Isa Soares, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: My next guest leads a global advocacy group to stop the spread of preventable diseases, like malaria. Michael Elliott is the president and CEO of ONE. He joins me live this evening from Washington.</p><p>Michael, when you look at the numbers, it is stunning, 584,000 people dying in 2013, 90 percent of them in sub-Saharan Africa, 1,197 children dying every -- day from malaria, 30 years of research, how big is this?</p><p>MICHAEL ELLIOTT, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ONE: I think it's very big, Poppy, and I thought your report just now was absolutely terrific. It kind of set out why this could possibly put us over the edge in really looking for something that does whip malaria. And some of the pitfalls and some of the challenges still to go.</p><p>The numbers that you've just given, we can kind of boil those down for the viewers. Pretty much one child dies a minute of malaria, one a minute.</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>ELLIOTT: Six hundred thousand or so --</p><p>(COUGHS)</p><p>ELLIOTT: Excuse me. Six hundred thousand or so, as you said, die every year, one child every minute. So, as we know, as your report just said, the World Health Organization still has to give the final approval of this.</p><p>But when you put this together with bed nets and with other forms of treatment, it's a big deal. And the people at GSK who developed it through our friends at the Gates Foundation --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>ELLIOTT: -- who put this program together, it's a very significant step.</p><p>HARLOW: Now, at the same time, individual countries have to give the vaccine final approval before it can be administered to children. And we know in some communities, there is a resistance to Western medicine, there is a resistance to, perhaps, giving something to a very young child. Are you concerned about that?</p><p>ELLIOTT: Well, I think one of the things that we've discovered over the last 10 or 15 years is that there is no more effective health intervention in the world in terms of saving lives, in terms of saving children's lives and making sure that people have a healthy and productive life, than vaccinations.</p><p>Vaccinations are as close to a silver bullet for many of our -- of the world's health issues as you can ever possibly get. So of course, there have been kind of cultural issues over vaccinations around the world. But I think we now have a really solid record that vaccinations change lives, change communities, change countries for the better.</p><p>And today's news, tackling really one of the kind of main killers out there, 600,000 a year, is just another indication of what vaccines can do.</p><p>HARLOW: Michael, at the same time, we saw what happened with Ebola and the limited availability of Z-map. But I know this isn't that same situation, but I just wonder how you make sure that it can be monitored, that it isn't controlled solely by one entity, that it can get widely distributed at an affordable price.</p><p>ELLIOTT: Great questions, Poppy. And all of those are kind of really good public policy questions that we and many other groups address and should address, because all these are questions that need to be asked, need to be answered.</p><p>Who's profiting? Is the distribution done well? Is the good data -- absolutely key point, kind of sounds really dull -- but is there really good data on who's taking the drugs so that one can measure the effectiveness and ensure that the benefits that we claim for them are actually being delivered? Or do you somehow need to re-calibrate the program so that you -- get bigger and better gain?</p><p>So, all of these are questions of public policy, which absolutely need to be addressed and taken seriously. The important thing that's happened today, I think, is a recognition that the science is moving in really productive and exciting ways such that we can kind of see that, as I say, we can kind of push malaria over the edge.</p><p>We can push the fight against malaria over the edge and really move into a situation where this extraordinary killer disease, is genuinely, genuinely, in retreat.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ELLIOTT: I mean, it's already in retreat.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>ELLIOTT: We've reduced malaria deaths by half in 15 years. But we can do even more.</p><p>HARLOW: Michael Elliott with ONE. Thank you very much. An exciting day for the world, frankly. Thank you, sir.</p><p>ELLIOTT: Thanks, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Chrysler recalls nearly 1.5 million cars after startling video. You know what this video shows? It shows hackers taking control of a Jeep via the internet. We will show you how this happened next.</p><p>[16:30:02] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:00:00] (COMMERCIALS)</p><p>HARLOW: Hello, I'm Poppy Harlow. Coming up on the next hour of \"Quest Means Business,\" the WTO director-general tells me about a trillion- dollar deal that took more than a decade to pull off.</p><p>Also the CEO of Pernod Ricard teams up with \"Vinnie Chase\" from, you know, that great show \"Entourage,\" to find the next start-up sensation. First though, these are the top headlines we are following this hour.</p><p>Police in Louisiana say the gunman who opened fire in a crowded theater Thursday appears to have acted alone. They say 59-year-old John Russel Houser killed two people and wounded nine before turning the gun on himself. He had been treated in the past for mental health issues, institutionalized and police say they're still trying to figure out what his motive was.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>COLONEL MICHAEL EDMONSON, LOUISIANA STATE POLICE: The thing (ph) that I seek from the men and women that make up the Lafayette Police Department is trying to find a motive, trying to find a motive, trying to find a goal, trying to find something that says why did he walk in that theater.</p><p>Why'd he fire at least 13 times? Why did he turn around and go back in there? Why'd he leave his car outside the keys on top of the tire? Why was he living in a Motel 8? Why did he have wigs in there and little glasses and all those types of things? Any little thing - that's what those DNA scientists are doing inside that theater right now.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: U.S. President Barack Obama has arrived in his father's homeland of Kenya. His half-sister greeted him at the Nairobi Airport along with Kenyan - Kenya's president. Also Kenyans lined the streets of the capital to catch a glimpse of President Obama's motorcade. It is the first time that a sitting U.S. president has made a visit to Kenya.</p><p>And the president of Burundi has won a highly-contested third term as leader. The election commission announcing a decision on Friday after a vote marred by violent protests in opposition, boycotts also coup attempt. Officials say Pierre Nkurunziza got nearly 70 percent of the vote in the African nation. The opposition maintains that term limits made his candidacy unconstitutional.</p><p>And Turkey says it is opening up some of its airbases in order to crack down on terrorism in the region. The country has announced that U.S. and coalition forces can use some of those bases to launch airstrikes against ISIS. This comes after Turkish jets carried out their own strikes against ISIS positions in Syria earlier in the day on Friday.</p><p>And FIFA has admitted its massive corruption scandal is indeed hurting its business, specifically its sponsorship deals. Visa has called FIFA's response wholly inadequate and joined key other sponsors in saying it wants an independent commission to oversee reforms.</p><p>The FIFA secretary-general explained why FIFA has not signed any new sponsors since the last World Cup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:35:01] JEROME VALCKE, FIFA SECRETARY GENERAL: Definitely the current situation does not help to finalize any new agreement. That is a fact and I'm sure that until the next election - until the 26th of February - there will be not be major announcements.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Chrysler is recalling 1.4 million vehicles that are vulnerable to hackers. The recall comes after a really shocking video was released this week. Look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ANDY GREENBERG, REPORTER, \"WIRED\" MAGAZINE: All right, all the - something just turned on all the fans and a/c and stuff - I didn't do that. The trip started --</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: That is hackers demonstrating how with the laptop from far away they can remotely control the Jeep that is driving. Laurie Segall, of course she spoke with the hackers. She always gets the scoop on this. And they showed her how they did this. This is the new reality - cars are computers.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT FOR CNNMONEY: Yes. Absolutely. I mean, cars are computers and because of that, they have never been more vulnerable. Companies seemed to start taking that seriously. That's why they're doing this research, Poppy.</p><p>I want to first of all pull up a list -</p><p>HARLOW: Right, so we can see which ones.</p><p>SEGALL: -- out of all the makes and models Chryslers' recalling because it's quite a few. Take a look - see if you're on there. And I will say this now -- Chrysler's upgraded its network. They said they can no longer prevent remote hacking, but I spoke to one of the hackers just a couple of minutes ago before I came up here, and he said you're absolutely right, you can't remotely hack anymore. But he did say if I am near your car, I can still exploit a Wi-Fi hotspot, potentially to get in.</p><p>So he says if those - if your car was on that list, go to your dealership. They're going to give a USB stick and they will help update that - they will help patch it. So very, very important to do, Poppy.</p><p>You've got to remember that these cars are connected to the internet.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>SEGALL: You've got to remember that they're scanning the internet looking for vulnerabilities.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. Maybe this is a reason to bike, I don't know.</p><p>SEGALL: (LAUGHTER).</p><p>HARLOW: Look, let's talk more about the hacker that you spoke with. I think you have some sound, right? From what he said.</p><p>SEGALL: Yes. I absolutely didn't remember I spoke to these guys years ago and they were demonstrating their first very high-profile hack for me. So I was able to catch up with one of them again and I said what's different? And before they'd been able to hack but only from inside the car.</p><p>So I asked what is different. Listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CHRIS VALASEK, DIRECTOR OF VEHICLE SECURITY RESEARCH IOACTIVE: Now we don't have to be in the car, we don't have to be connected. We don't even have to be in the same state. So we can reach any car in the United States and potentially North America.</p><p>SEGALL: What were you able to do?</p><p>VALASEK: We were able to do almost everything we were the last time we did this - steering, braking, lock and unlock the doors, turn on the high-beams, basically anything that car was controllable over the in-car network, we were able to do.</p><p>SEGALL: What do you want people to kind of take away from this?</p><p>VALASEK: The statement I reiterate is we're the good guys. Bad guys don't you about what's wrong. They keep to themselves and use it for whatever they want to use it for. You know, we're out there to let people know the risk exposure and help manufacturers get things fixed.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SEGALL: Now if only the companies would hire these guys so they don't have to go -</p><p>HARLOW: Some of them do.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>HARLOW: Ford told me that they employ hackers.</p><p>SEGALL: They need - I think this kind of research shows that they need to be doing what Ford is doing - they need to hire more security and researchers. And when I spoke to Charlie, one of the other hackers involved, what he said was these companies need to treat security like companies that house secured data. They need to be constantly testing themselves, constantly to break in to their own networks which are more connected than ever.</p><p>And @Charlie Miller - he said this on Twitter - he's one of the hackers and I think he said it best. He said, \"I wonder what's cheaper - designing secured cars or doing recalls.\"</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SEGALL: These guys are going to have more companies investing now -- slowly.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. Laurie Segall, fascinating stuff. I'm going to keep biking, all right, thank you.</p><p>SEGALL: (LAUGHTER).</p><p>HARLOW: Have a great weekend. More than a trillion dollars' worth of tech products - everything from video games to semiconductors could be a whole lot cheaper for you. That is because of a $1 trillion deal - yes, trillion with a 't.\"</p><p>After more than a decade of talks and back and forth and negotiations, the World Trade Organization has reached a deal to get rid of tariffs on tech products traded around the world on more than 200 products.</p><p>I asked the director general Roberto Azevedo if this move could really help boost GDP.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROBERTO AZEVEDO, DIRECTOR GENERAL, WTO: We have many statistics I think at this point in time. Some are pointing to something close to $200 billion per year. It's a big deal.</p><p>HARLOW: What do you expect that this will do for jobs? Because that is such a focus herein the United States, across Europe, etc. What does this do for jobs?</p><p>AZEVEDO: We're expecting a big bump in terms of economic output. So we - because this is not a deal that affects only the products like that 201 products that is on the list - that are on the list.</p><p>This is going to affect other sectors as well. So we should expect increased demand for example because the prices for consumers are going down.</p><p>[16:40:01] This is going to help other areas of the industry that use these products as components to lower their costs as well.</p><p>Services which use these products for example in hospitals or in telecom - all these things are going to be cheaper to the consumer and to the producers. So the overall effect should be one of a positive stimulus, therefore job creation.</p><p>HARLOW: Are you confident that some of these savings will be passed on to consumers?</p><p>AZEVEDO: Absolutely. You're talking about a deal which is about 7 - more than 7 percent of total global trade. For something like this to happen that you're suggesting where producers pocket all the benefits, you would require an extremely coordinated effort on the part of all producers to do that.</p><p>Because all it takes is that a few of them decide to share the benefits with the consumer to get more market share, to be more competitive and the deal is over. Everybody's competing. This is a very, very competitive market. I can't see how the producers are going to pocket this and not share the benefits with the consumers.</p><p>HARLOW: This deal has been more than decade in the making. Now you've got it inked - freshly inked. Do you think that deals like this - our - the best way to stimulate trade in this global economy right now when there is such an urgent need for more investment. Is this the best way?</p><p>AZEVEDO: This is one of the good ways to do it. I hope that we can use this to inspire negotiations even here in the WTO. In less than two years we had two major agreements - we had the Trade Facilitation Agreement in Bali which is worth about $1 trillion a year and this one which is going to inject an additional stimulus of an order of magnitude of about $200 billion a year.</p><p>These are very big agreements and they're different in nature. While in Bali the Trade Facilitation Agreement the commitments were flexible but the membership was everybody. This one is different. This one is the commitment to very strict, very uniform. But the signatories vary. It's more - it's more flexible in terms of accessions.</p><p>So these are different agreements. We can play with those things and make sure that we keep delivering.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Well the secretary general of the WTO there. Well the chief executive of drinks company, Pernod Ricard, is hoping to spot the next big tech sensation.</p><p>Alexandre Ricard is one of four judges who will give $1 million to a startup entrepreneur who wins this. It's called \"The Venture,\" and it pits 16 social entrepreneurs and their ideas against one another. Those startups are trying to make a positive impact while also of course turning a profit.</p><p>Also on the panel, Adrian Grenier known for portraying the character Vinnie Chase from \"Entourage.\" A little star power there. Alexandre Ricard joins me now from San Francisco.</p><p>Thank you for being with me, sir. I appreciate it very much. Let's talk about -</p><p>ALEXANDRE RICARD, CEO, PERNOD RICARD: A pleasure.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you. OK, let's talk about why you're doing this. Is it because you want to get these smart folks into your fold at the company or is this a pure advertising, marketing play?</p><p>RICARD: You know, at the end of the day, the challenge I've put in front of the Chivas Regal brand team was how can you bring to life the Chivas brand values in a pioneering and in an innovative way. And they went and did a lot of digging into the Chivas history going back to the two brothers, the Chivas brothers - James and John in 1801, and they were social entrepreneurs.</p><p>So basically they came up with that idea to do what would have these two brothers done in today's world given the global nature of the world and given the technology. That's point one.</p><p>And point two I believe both from a talent attraction retention point of view and a consumer point of view, the new generations are extremely sensitive to a better world.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>RICARD: So I think it's the best of two worlds.</p><p>HARLOW: It's a great point. I was just talking to Sir Martin Sorrell of WPP at the beginning of the show about exactly that - I mean, millennials are demanding that companies stand for something good. You know, alcohol companies - any kind of company - they want it to stand for some social good.</p><p>Outside of your sector, I'm interested in where you think the most innovation is needed. Pharma? Tech? What do you look at?</p><p>RICARD: Well listen, I'll tell you -- based on the 16 finalists which means they come from 16 different countries and they made the cut from over 1,000 entries which is to tell you how many people around the world are so eager to make a change.</p><p>[16:45:06] And we see willingness to change climate. Environment is something which is big. And we have seen a few projects, one of them being how to save water, how to make agricultural more efficient from a water usage point of view. Recycling as well is big.</p><p>So that's from a climate point of view, but you also have disease and health - how to track animals around the world and identify anomalies through small chips and satellites tracking. That's another domain again. Disabled as well - that's something which is important or the elderly. And finally, poverty - how to give access to poor households to affordable homes, how to prevent - you know - shack fires in emerging markets. So quite a few domains.</p><p>And people - these young generations - are extremely passionate about it, they have a lot of drive and commitment and I have to say it's - for people like - it is inspiring.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, they certainly are demanding a new way to have business operate. So I thank you so much for joining me on what looks like an absolutely beautiful day there in San Francisco, sir. Appreciate it.</p><p>RICARD: Thank you very much.</p><p>HARLOW: Coming up, it is the moment many Kenyans had been waiting for. President Obama makes a historic visit to his ancestral homeland. We are live in Nairobi next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: U.S. President Barack Obama has touched down in his ancestral homeland for the first time ever since entering the Oval Office. The U.S. president is in Kenya as part of a tour aimed at strengthening diplomatic relations in the region.</p><p>A huge security operation is underway amid concern about terror from al Shahab militants. The President due to meet with the Kenyan president on Saturday before becoming the first sitting U.S. president in history to visit neighboring Ethiopia.</p><p>Barack Obama's trip is also designed to bolster economic ties between the U.S. and Kenya. He is due to attend a U.S.-sponsored entrepreneurship summit there in Nairobi.</p><p>That is where we find our Jim Acosta - in the Kenyan capital joining me. So obviously he was in East Africa and he was talking about - talking about - the economy, etc. and business. But he's also spending some really quality, frankly, family time.</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Poppy. President Obama has arrived in Africa. He's here in Kenya, he's on the ground in Nairobi landing in his father's homeland earlier this evening. The president was greeted at the airport by Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr. Obama's half-sister, Auma.</p><p>And shortly after that greeting at the airport, the President along with some of his relatives went out to dinner here in the Kenyan capital. So he is getting in touch with his family once again.</p><p>[16:45:03] The President will spend the next few days focusing on efforts to boost Africa's economy and security with a speech at that entrepreneurial summit that you mentioned, Poppy.</p><p>And then there's going to be a major address to the African people on Sunday here in Kenya. He's going to be talking about his Kenyan roots at that point.</p><p>But we should point out - and this is a - I think that it's a little bit disappointing to the White House -- for logistical and security reasons, he's not going to be going to his ancestral village of Kogelo where his father is from. Instead those relatives will be coming in and out of Nairobi.</p><p>But also a big topic of discussion here for this president will be the fight against terrorist groups in this part of the world, namely al Shabaab, which as you know has carried out terrorist attacks here in Kenya. That has resulted in a massive security presence here, and I can just tell you, Poppy, from being out on the streets earlier today here in Nairobi, it was eerily quiet.</p><p>I mean, these - I was told by people on the streets that these avenues and boulevards should be jam-packed with people, especially when somebody like Barack Obama is coming back to this country of his father.</p><p>But because of the security precautions that have been taken here, a lot of people have just decided to stay home and watch this on television although we should point out when he was making his way through the streets of Nairobi, they were pretty full at that point -- a lot of people waving and cheering - a lot of pride in this African-American president --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ACOSTA: -- and somebody that they consider to be person who is very much a part of Africa. Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Absolutely. Really nice to see that embrace with his half- sister there right when he got off the plane. Jim Acosta, enjoy the trip.</p><p>ACOSTA: Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: I'm sure it's fascinating to be on the ground there. Thank you very much.</p><p>Next - switching gears in a major way - Taylor Swift heading to China later this year. It is great news for her fans there. However, Chinese censors may take issue with her merchandise. We'll tell you why next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: Taylor Swift may find herself the object of a little bit of unwanted scrutiny. The pop star's world tour is due to visit Shanghai in November. There's just one problem. Unfortunately for Taylor, it is the name of her tour - 1989.</p><p>Now that is just the name of her album and the year she was born. She is quite young. Combine that with her initial T.S., and it could look like a reference to Tiananmen Square and the bloody crackdown there on pro- democracy protests. Will Ripley looks at the brewing controversy from Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC CLIP FROM TAYLOR SWIFT'S SONG, \"SHAKE IT OFF\")</p><p>--Gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake</p><p>I shake it off, I shake it off.</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: One of the biggest hits from Taylor Swift's album \"1989\" is all about shaking it off, a skill that'll come in handy in China where the superstar's exploding popularity brings potential pitfalls.</p><p>Taylor Swift's initials, T.S., could be mistaken as a reference for Tiananmen Square where I'm standing right now. And her album \"1989,\" the year she was born, is also the year when hundreds of pro-democracy protestors died in a government crackdown here.</p><p>This issue is so sensitive here in China, we could actually be detained just for reporting in this location.</p><p>Taken out of context, the pop star's clothing line could be politically combustible says University of Denver professor and China expert Jing Sun.</p><p>PROFESSOR JING SUN, UNIVERSITY OF DENVER: If it turns out you have a group of people that will be wearing such problematic (tashas) and they gather together -- if that is the scenario the government encounters -- I'm sure the government will do something about it.</p><p>So far, state-authorized search engines are not censoring T.S.1989 merchandise.</p><p>SUN: If the government tries to take a heavy-hand approach on that, it could backfire. And I think (inaudible).</p><p>[16:55:04] RIPLEY: Sun says the bigger obstacle facing Swift is places like this. This is Beijing's famous silk market. You can see busloads of people come here, a lot of them Western tourists. They come by the millions each year for counterfeit versions of the world's biggest brands - openly sold for a fraction of the price.</p><p>There are so many people here, it's incredible and even though most of what's being sold is fake, this place brings in so much money - the authorities, the market supervisors - they just look the other way.</p><p>Taylor Swift's clothing line hasn't even launched yet in China, but knockoffs are already big sellers online.</p><p>SUN: That is one thing Taylor Swift can be sure about.</p><p>RIPLEY: Sun says it's a part of doing business in the world's counterfeiting super power. How big of a threat is the counterfeit issue to artists like Taylor Swift?</p><p>SUN: In fact it will be far more of fabricated items than authentic ones that will be circulating in the Chinese market.</p><p>RIPLEY: He says Swift still stands to make massive profits, teaming up with Chinese e-commerce giants JD and Alibaba, China's insatiable appetite for American pop culture is a gold mine for the highest-paid woman in music, meaning Swift will likely be 'shaking it off' all the way to the bank. Will Ripley, CNN Beijing.</p><p>HARLOW: We will be right back with more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: The heavy selling continues for U.S. stock. For the second day in a row we saw triple-digit loss on the Dow. We actually started the week well above 18,000, now that index has lost around 500 points in the space of just a few days. Falling commodity prices are partly to blame.</p><p>Also in corporate news, the biggest media merger of the year just getting a green light from U.S. regulators. AT&amp;T is going buy DirecTV in a deal worth $49 billion.</p><p>And that is \"Quest Means Business.\" I'm Poppy Harlow. Thanks so much for being with us.

I will ask the head of the WTO if your tech goods are about to get a whole lot cheaper.</p><p>I'm Poppy Harlow and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Good evening, welcome to the program. Tonight, FIFA admits that it's having trouble getting new sponsors, and the ones it already has, well, they want a meeting. The current situation doesn't help, said the FIFA secretary general, referring to the massive corruption and bribery scandal that has rocked the football world since May.</p><p>The organization has not signed a single new sponsor since the last World Cup, and the secretary general of FIFA is not expecting any new partnership until FIFA president Sepp Blatter is finally out of office. He says that the current sponsors are not happy either, and he called for a summit for next month to help try to quell the concerns.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME VALCKE, SECRETARY GENERAL, FIFA: Clearly, yes, there were a number of sponsors, mainly three, I would say, and it's three, in fact. It's Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Visa, who have expressed and sent letter to FIFA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: And also you will remember this scene from Monday during FIFA president Sepp Blatter's press conference. The British comedian on the stage, jumping on stage, showering him cash. The comedian trying to make a point about alleged rampant bribery within FIFA, and now sponsors are piling on the pressure for the football's governing body to, frankly, shape up.</p><p>In his earnings call, the CEO of Visa called FIFA's response to the scandal, quote, \"wholly inadequate,\" and demanded a fully-independent commission to oversee reforms there. He said officials don't seem to be aware of how serious this problem is. And meaningful changes cannot be made until, he says, new leadership takes over.</p><p>A few hours ago, Budweiser's parent company, InBev, joined that call, saying that FIFA should empower an independent commission, quote, \"without delay.\" And earlier this week, Coca-Cola said an independent commission would help FIFA, quote, \"build back the trust that it has lost.\"</p><p>Also, McDonald's, another huge sponsor, said it is not satisfied, and will not be without the transparency of an independent commission. And that leaves Adidas, Hyundai, and Gazprom as key sponsors of FIFA who are, frankly, yet to speak up. All of this pressure from sponsors seems to be ruffling FIFA secretary general's feathers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALCKE: I love your questions. They are so friendly, so positive, so nice. You want me to resign, you want me to think about my future, you want to know if I'm traveling. What else? What I had for lunch or breakfast this morning?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: So, joining me in the C Suite is Sir Martin Sorrell, the CEO --</p><p>MARTIN SORRELL, CEO, WPP: -- Poppy Quest.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW: -- of WPP. It is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it's Poppy in the hot seat trying to fill Richard's large shoes, which is --</p><p>SORRELL: Big shoes to fill.</p><p>HARLOW: -- pretty impossible, but I am happy to be here. So happy to have you.</p><p>SORRELL: Good.</p><p>HARLOW: Who better to talk about this. When you look at FIFA, targeting $6 billion in revenue --</p><p>SORRELL: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: -- from the 2018 tournament.</p><p>SORRELL: Yes. From that core, from that four-year period, yes.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. And you looked at --</p><p>SORRELL: Actually, less than -- less on an average basis than Formula 1. Formula 1 is about $1.7 billion a year. Interestingly, World Cup is about $1.5 billion. So, interesting.</p><p>HARLOW: Still quite a lot, right?</p><p>SORRELL: Yes, quite a lot, but it could be more, actually, if properly run, I think.</p><p>HARLOW: So, it has a lot of upside potential --</p><p>SORRELL: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: -- but we just went through the list. Visa chastising FIFA for a lack of awareness.</p><p>SORRELL: Coca-Cola --</p><p>HARLOW: McDonald's, Coca-Cola. You work with all of these firms.</p><p>SORRELL: Yes. InBev as well, now.</p><p>HARLOW: What do you think the long-term fallout is going to be?</p><p>SORRELL: I think long term, as long as there's reform, and this is -- you could look at this as an opportunity, it's not dissimilar -- it's not as bad, obviously -- with the IOC a few years ago after Salt Lake City and Atlanta and everything. There was change.</p><p>Juan Samaranch was the first IOC president to change the institution. That was followed by Jacques Rogge, and now by Thomas Bach, who's taken a very strong position on a number of major issues. There's going to be the IOCcongress in Kuala Lumpur on August the 1st.</p><p>And what's interesting is it's so -- it was a similar situation, but of smaller scale and smaller magnitude. But same thing: reform, reform is necessary. And it has to be neutral reform. There's no -- maybe this is a little bit aggressive to say -- but lunatics can't be judge of the asylum.</p><p>They've got to change. And what's interesting about what Visa and Coca-Cola and McDonald's, and now InBev as well, are saying is that they have to change, and there has to be a neutral, independent commission --</p><p>[16:05:01] HARLOW: But --</p><p>SORRELL: -- that initiates. It's no good the same group of people --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>SORRELL: -- reelecting somebody --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW: And they -- they're all --</p><p>SORRELL: -- from that same group.</p><p>HARLOW: It's one thing to have a new leader in place and figurehead.</p><p>SORRELL: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: It's another thing to change culture and practice. And it's not just one person. So, you have this meeting next month with FIFA, with McDonald's, with Coca-Cola.</p><p>SORRELL: With all due respect, it is about leadership. Sepp Blatter said he can't be held responsible for all this. Well, whether he likes it or not --</p><p>HARLOW: You are.</p><p>SORRELL: -- he has -- you are responsible.</p><p>HARLOW: But how do they prove it? How do they prove to the sponsors things are different?</p><p>SORRELL: Well, it's a question about the quality of the people that - - if it's an independent commission or whoever the next leader is going to be. Electing another leader from the same group who would be tarred or tainted with a similar approach -- maybe of a different scale, but a similar approach -- is not going to solve the problem.</p><p>The World Cup is the premier global sporting event. It is the premier live sporting event. After that, you have the Olympics close to it. And then you have Formula 1, which I'm a non-executive director of. So, those are the three events that are global sporting events that appeal to global audiences.</p><p>HARLOW: Let me ask you this. I believe -- I'm of the millennial generation. I'm in the old end, but I am.</p><p>SORRELL: I am not, unfortunately.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW: That's OK. We'll forgive you. But --</p><p>SORRELL: I'm an aging Millennial.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW: But what we know, what the studies bear out, is that Millennials care deeply about the companies that they buy products from --</p><p>SORRELL: Absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW: -- and what those companies stand for.</p><p>SORRELL: And the employees, moreover.</p><p>HARLOW: And employees want to work for a company that live by those creeds.</p><p>SORRELL: And that's why the sponsors are taking such a strong position.</p><p>HARLOW: That's why I'm wondering is why we're seeing all of these storied companies coming out and being so vocal. Is it because the young buyers --</p><p>SORRELL: Well, there's --</p><p>HARLOW: -- expect it?</p><p>SORRELL: It's a very difficult position, because you have a legal contract. Nothing is proven as yet. There are a lot of suggestions. A lot of arrests have been made, but there is a series of cases that are in the process of development. So, you have to be very careful what you say.</p><p>But what is now happening -- and I think, remember that Blatter was reelected in Zurich and with a lower majority than he thought and other people thought he was going to get, but he was reelected. Within 24, 48 hours, he was gone. He resigned.</p><p>Where did that pressure come from? My guess is, it came from the sponsors. They were restricted from what they could do by virtue of their legal contracts, but you're now seeing the pressure that they can exert.</p><p>What they're saying is, having a meeting in a few-months time to elect another leader from the same group of people may not be sufficient in their view. And you're absolutely right. Sustainability, purpose, is at the center of all the clients we do, and you're absolutely right that consumers buy products and services from companies that they admire.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SORRELL: And people go to work and stay at work and are motivated to work at companies they admire. So, this issue is extremely important.</p><p>Having said that, do I think that this is a disaster from which FIFA or World Cup football will never recover? No. The sport is so powerful, it's so important, you see the impact that it's had in American when the women's team won the Women's World Cup and the positive impact that will have. And I think that will build further grass roots for soccer or football here in this country.</p><p>HARLOW: It really is a changing business environment, and the business of business is no longer just business.</p><p>SORRELL: Doing good is good business.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SORRELL: John Brown, who was the CEO of BP many years ago said at Stanford Business School in 1997, doing good is good business. We over intellectualize all this stuff. It's very simple. If you're in business for the long term -- that's the critical determinant -- you will -- doing good is good business. It's good for your consumers, it's good for your customers, it's good for your people.</p><p>HARLOW: It's interesting. In the earnings call from Starbucks yesterday, the chief executive, Howard Schultz, said part of the reason for the record earnings, he thought, was the investment in their employees.</p><p>SORRELL: Absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW: And in their partners.</p><p>SORRELL: Well --</p><p>HARLOW: And spending more money on them resulted in --</p><p>SORRELL: We have the tenth anniversary of our brand valuation actually. One of the clear, clear lessons is that companies that have purpose at the center of their strategy --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SORRELL: -- have sustainability as part of that purpose.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SORRELL: Doing good is good business. It does, ironically, it does pay off. And it doesn't pay off in the context of a FIFA.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. And it's no longer --</p><p>SORRELL: Well, certainly not in the long term. It might have paid off in the short term.</p><p>HARLOW: -- you're no longer just sort of corporate speak. It's actually --</p><p>SORRELL: That's right.</p><p>HARLOW: -- needing to be played out.</p><p>SORRELL: That's right.</p><p>HARLOW: Sir Martin Sorrell, thank you very much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SORRELL: Thank you very much, indeed.</p><p>HARLOW: Have a lovely weekend. We appreciate it.</p><p>SORRELL: And you filled Richard boots --</p><p>HARLOW: I try, I try.</p><p>SORRELL: -- more than amply.</p><p>HARLOW: I try.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you, my friend.</p><p>Amazon. Amazon is really having quite a run. At the top of the heap, the online shopping giant replacing Walmart as the world's most valuable retailer. How did this happen? Overnight? We'll show you.</p><p>[16:09:51] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: The day has come, and Amazon is now worth more than Walmart. We told you yesterday on the program how Amazon's stellar results could be enough to make it the most valuable retailer in the world. Well now, that is indeed official.</p><p>Amazon shares up about 10 percent in Friday's closing, closing over $530 a share. That pushes the online retailers market value past brick- and-mortar giant Walmart by about, eh, just $20 billion. The closing share price puts Amazon's worth at around $250 billion. Walmart is valued at $230 billion.</p><p>Let's talk about it with Samuel Burke, CNN business correspondent. You know, last time you were here talking about Amazon --</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Uh-oh.</p><p>HARLOW: -- you were talking about Prime Day --</p><p>BURKE: Oh.</p><p>HARLOW: -- and how it was such a flop. And? Amazon sort of had the last laugh on that one. They said those sales topped Black Friday.</p><p>BURKE: I'm still a bit dubious of those.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURKE: I think I might have the last laugh, because Amazon is growing constantly, so I'm not -- I wouldn't be surprised if every day is better than Black Friday. I still had a very hard time finding anybody on Twitter saying, ooh, I just found a great deal.</p><p>But you're right. In the call last night, the CFO of Amazon says we were thrilled with Amazon Prime Day, and that they had huge sales, especially in terms of the number of people who signed up for Prime. So, they're touting it. And clearly the stock market likes it, up 10 percent. But I still have to point out one more thing.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>BURKE: Here we are, we are all gushing, analysts and whatnot, about Apple -- about Amazon.</p><p>HARLOW: And Apple.</p><p>BURKE: And Apple. But Amazon barely had any profit, just barely, and their stock is way up. Apple had this amazing profit and their stock is down 8 percent over -- in this past week. So, it is quite incredible.</p><p>HARLOW: It's a good point, because we were talking about surprise profit, surprise profit. But we're not talking about that much here. The strength in the Cloud business and third-party marketplaces.</p><p>BURKE: Absolutely incredible. Amazon web services is the part of Amazon that you rarely ever see. It's kind of the invisible thing that runs websites and applications where people store their documents, up 81 percent in terms of sales, up more than 400 percent --</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>BURKE: -- in terms of pure profit. And for a long time, they didn't break out those numbers, so a lot of us were very suspicious, thinking, well, they must have something to hide. And clearly, they have nothing to hide.</p><p>HARLOW: When you look at all of that, and you look at Jeff Bezos, a man, by the way, according to Bloomberg now, worth $43 billion as of yesterday, making him the seventh richest man in the world. But this is someone who is really, it just seems, at the beginning of the evolution of Amazon. Thrones -- where do we go from here?</p><p>BURKE: But I think the thing that you have to really credit him with is Amazon Prime, that $99 a year subscription. He got the idea from Costco, and in case you're overseas and you don't shop at Costco as much as we do here in the United States, think about the pure profit behind that, $99 a year just, like at Costco. That's -- it's just a membership, that's it.</p><p>So, that type of genius in terms of saying how can I replicate what Costco did in stores and bring that to my website? The truth is, Amazon products get to you almost as fast whether you have prime or not. So that is just profit, profit.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW: But I love seeing that I don't have to pay for the shipping.</p><p>BURKE: Yes, well, OK.</p><p>HARLOW: You know, we kind of love that.</p><p>BURKE: He loves that, too. It's making him rich and it's really business genius.</p><p>HARLOW: Because we're paying for it in many other ways. Samuel Burke, thank you so much, have a great weekend.</p><p>Well, turning to another very serious story, the CEO of Nikkei Group is promising to respect the editorial independence of the \"Financial Times.\" The declaration coming just a day after the Japanese media giant announced it was snapping up the business broad sheet for $1.3. Top Nikkei executives telling reporters their group can learn a lot from the FT.</p><p>[16:15:06] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAOTOSHI OKADA, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NIKKEI (through translator): The digital strategy, whether it is the system or whether it is the service development or the customer management, I would say that FT is a step ahead of us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: However, some have concerns, and they've raised them, about the FT's new ownership and just how independent the paper can be in Japan. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS has been reaching out to the FT today for comment. We have not heard back yet.</p><p>We do want to bring in one man who knows a lot about the country's corporate culture. That is Michael Woodford. He is the former chief executive of Japanese tech giant Olympus.</p><p>He was ousted from the company after he blew the whistle on a cover-up of $1.7 billion in losses at the firm. He took that story directly to the \"Financial Times,\" which helped expose the fraud. He joins me live from London. Thank you for being here, sir.</p><p>MICHAEL WOODFORD, FORMER CEO, OLYMPUS: Hello, Poppy, nice to see you.</p><p>HARLOW: You are being very vocal about this sale. You don't like it.</p><p>WOODFORD: It's -- \"don't like it\" seems very simplistic. I care passionately for Japan, and journalism is important. And in my case, I experienced firsthand what the Japanese media is like.</p><p>And frankly, it's self-censoring and very deferential, if not reverential, to the powerful forces, including much of corporate Japan. And that troubles me that the \"Financial Times\" is going to be owned by that type of organization.</p><p>HARLOW: To be fair and balanced here, I do want to play you some sound from the CEO of Nikkei and what they said addressing some of the concerns earlier today. Let's roll it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OKADA (through translator): Nikkei has no intention whatsoever to force \"Financial Times\" to do the editing and reporting as exactly as Nikkei is doing. Nikkei and \"Financial Times\" are totally separate in terms of following their respective editorial procedure and policy, and how the articles are to be formulated are independently to be figured out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: So, let's assume the best here.</p><p>WOODFORD: That --</p><p>HARLOW: Let's assume the best here. They're keeping the FT where it is, same location, everything. Is there any sort of independent body, commission, anything that can come in that you think can help maintain that integrity, since there are some concerns?</p><p>WOODFORD: I think the Nikkei has a notorious reputation in Japan, and investors know this, that they have what's called \"quarterly reviews,\" which companies use to leak price-sensitive information. It's a cozy, comfortable organization with corporate Japan.</p><p>Very different to the \"Financial Times.\" And I think the problem lies that if you can imagine in my case, it's the Enron of Japan, nearly a $2 billion fraud.</p><p>I wouldn't now go to the \"Financial Times\" because while I think their independence will remain, I think to run the story which they did within a matter of hours of meeting their bureau chief in Tokyo, it was on their website and the front page of their newspaper the following day.</p><p>Now, if you are attacking a major Japanese corporation, because of the Nikkei link, I think the journalists would be more cautious, they would go back to London for approval, they would be more cautious, and it would take more time. And in those type of scenarios, time is everything.</p><p>HARLOW: It's interesting, you point out that you brought, as you said, your story there when you were ousted, they put it up on the page. I'm wondering if you think that some of this concern will hurt the FT's chances at all of getting some of these biggest scoops. Because you wrote that you would've taken your story to, say, \"The New York Times\" if the FT at the time were owned by Nikkei.</p><p>WOODFORD: Absolutely. I think -- Nikkei itself is an organization which should be under scrutiny, and how does the \"Financial Times,\" which has done many stories on Nikkei, about its weakness in covering the Olympus and other scandals, about the way this phenomena in Japan of leaking price- sensitive information.</p><p>How does a journalist in the Tokyo bureau in particular start to write critical articles? Now, I'm sure there'll be some, but I think they will be written in a different way. People are human. Lionel Barber, I have a great respect for his intellect --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>WOODFORD: He's been the editor for ten years. But who appoints the new editor? Who appoints the new editor? That will be the gentlemen, the German and the CEO we saw at today's news conference. And their journalistic are totally different than western organizations.</p><p>And it's not because it's foreign. I don't mind who owns a chocolate company or a car company. And I wouldn't mind if the \"Financial Times\" had gone to a German company or a Canadian or an American company or an Australian.</p><p>But Japan's media is, and it's known to be, self-censoring. And that sort of mixing into the DNA, you said there was going to be layoffs, and that's true, but the president of the Nikkei said today that they may share the same buildings in some of the bureaus.</p><p>[16:20:05] And that type of -- again, you're a journalist, the flavor and the feel and the independence -- and it might not be this month, it might be not next year.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>WOODFORD: But when there's a big critical story in Japan, I think the way the \"Financial Times\" covers it will be affected.</p><p>HARLOW: So, we will watch, we will see. But I have a potential idea from one journalist. Maybe you pen an op-ed about this in the \"Financial Times\"?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOODFORD: I'm sure they'd be happy to do that. Today they were quoting me. But the trouble for the world is Japan is the third-largest economy. It's -- so much is going on, we have Abenomics, we've got quantitative easing, and you want accurate, probing questions, journalists turning the stones.</p><p>That's not the way the media works in Japan, and that will some -- over time, I'm sure, influence the way the FT works in Japan.</p><p>HARLOW: I hope it is not the case. Michael Woodford, thank you very much for being with me, sir.</p><p>WOODFORD: Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: All right. Well, it kills hundreds of thousands every year. And now, scientists could be on the verge of killing malaria for good. And extraordinary update for you, next.</p><p>HARLOW: Well, scientists have come one step closer to wiping out one of the world's deadliest viruses. The first ever malaria vaccine has just cleared a major hurdle in the approval process.</p><p>Keep in mind, the virus killed more than half a million people in 2013 alone. Almost all of the deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. And most of the victims were children under the age of five. Isa Soares has more on the potential breakthrough in this fight against this deadly disease.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After almost 30 years of research and millions of dollars, malaria may soon get a final shot in the arm. European regulators have now given the green light to the vaccine known as Mosquirix, or RTS,S. A drug developed by GlaxoSmithKline, partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p><p>RAMIL BURDEN, VP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ASIA AND EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AFRICA, GLAXOSMITHKLINE: The trials are being conducted in seven different countries in sub-Saharan Africa and involve 13,000 children. The children in the trial would have, for example, they would sleep under bed nets and they would have access to the best health care if they got sick. So, the vaccine is really an additional tool on the gold standard of care.</p><p>SOARES: The vaccine works by stopping the malaria parasite maturing and multiplying in the liver, after which it would normally enter the patient's bloodstream and trigger the disease's symptoms.</p><p>But the trials are already raising questions over the drug's effectiveness. Results show the vaccine was most effective in children between 5 and 17 months, cutting the number of malaria cases by nearly half.</p><p>In babies up to 3 months, though, that drops by 27 percent, with the protection wearing off over time, and with the need for booster shots.</p><p>DAVID CONWAY, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND TROPICAL MEDICINE: It is only a quarter of the people or a third of the people will be protected. So, that -- will that benefit be enough, is the question. And the booster doses could be done, but will they be cost-effective in particular different situations in order to reduce malaria? Or will other tools against malaria be more cost-effective?</p><p>[16:24:49] SOARES: This is, nevertheless, a first big step towards a vaccine, and this could be a game changer in Africa, where there have been 198 million cases of malaria, and an estimated 584,000 deaths in 2013, mostly among children. Now, it's up to the World Health Organization to give its stamp of approval.</p><p>BURDEN: We believe that this is an additional tool. It's not the only answer, but it's an additional tool to help tackle one of the world's biggest killers and infectious diseases.</p><p>SOARES: Isa Soares, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: My next guest leads a global advocacy group to stop the spread of preventable diseases, like malaria. Michael Elliott is the president and CEO of ONE. He joins me live this evening from Washington.</p><p>Michael, when you look at the numbers, it is stunning, 584,000 people dying in 2013, 90 percent of them in sub-Saharan Africa, 1,197 children dying every -- day from malaria, 30 years of research, how big is this?</p><p>MICHAEL ELLIOTT, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ONE: I think it's very big, Poppy, and I thought your report just now was absolutely terrific. It kind of set out why this could possibly put us over the edge in really looking for something that does whip malaria. And some of the pitfalls and some of the challenges still to go.</p><p>The numbers that you've just given, we can kind of boil those down for the viewers. Pretty much one child dies a minute of malaria, one a minute.</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>ELLIOTT: Six hundred thousand or so --</p><p>(COUGHS)</p><p>ELLIOTT: Excuse me. Six hundred thousand or so, as you said, die every year, one child every minute. So, as we know, as your report just said, the World Health Organization still has to give the final approval of this.</p><p>But when you put this together with bed nets and with other forms of treatment, it's a big deal. And the people at GSK who developed it through our friends at the Gates Foundation --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>ELLIOTT: -- who put this program together, it's a very significant step.</p><p>HARLOW: Now, at the same time, individual countries have to give the vaccine final approval before it can be administered to children. And we know in some communities, there is a resistance to Western medicine, there is a resistance to, perhaps, giving something to a very young child. Are you concerned about that?</p><p>ELLIOTT: Well, I think one of the things that we've discovered over the last 10 or 15 years is that there is no more effective health intervention in the world in terms of saving lives, in terms of saving children's lives and making sure that people have a healthy and productive life, than vaccinations.</p><p>Vaccinations are as close to a silver bullet for many of our -- of the world's health issues as you can ever possibly get. So of course, there have been kind of cultural issues over vaccinations around the world. But I think we now have a really solid record that vaccinations change lives, change communities, change countries for the better.</p><p>And today's news, tackling really one of the kind of main killers out there, 600,000 a year, is just another indication of what vaccines can do.</p><p>HARLOW: Michael, at the same time, we saw what happened with Ebola and the limited availability of Z-map. But I know this isn't that same situation, but I just wonder how you make sure that it can be monitored, that it isn't controlled solely by one entity, that it can get widely distributed at an affordable price.</p><p>ELLIOTT: Great questions, Poppy. And all of those are kind of really good public policy questions that we and many other groups address and should address, because all these are questions that need to be asked, need to be answered.</p><p>Who's profiting? Is the distribution done well? Is the good data -- absolutely key point, kind of sounds really dull -- but is there really good data on who's taking the drugs so that one can measure the effectiveness and ensure that the benefits that we claim for them are actually being delivered? Or do you somehow need to re-calibrate the program so that you -- get bigger and better gain?</p><p>So, all of these are questions of public policy, which absolutely need to be addressed and taken seriously. The important thing that's happened today, I think, is a recognition that the science is moving in really productive and exciting ways such that we can kind of see that, as I say, we can kind of push malaria over the edge.</p><p>We can push the fight against malaria over the edge and really move into a situation where this extraordinary killer disease, is genuinely, genuinely, in retreat.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ELLIOTT: I mean, it's already in retreat.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>ELLIOTT: We've reduced malaria deaths by half in 15 years. But we can do even more.</p><p>HARLOW: Michael Elliott with ONE. Thank you very much. An exciting day for the world, frankly. Thank you, sir.</p><p>ELLIOTT: Thanks, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Chrysler recalls nearly 1.5 million cars after startling video. You know what this video shows? It shows hackers taking control of a Jeep via the internet. We will show you how this happened next.</p><p>[16:30:02] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:00:00] (COMMERCIALS)</p><p>HARLOW: Hello, I'm Poppy Harlow. Coming up on the next hour of \"Quest Means Business,\" the WTO director-general tells me about a trillion- dollar deal that took more than a decade to pull off.</p><p>Also the CEO of Pernod Ricard teams up with \"Vinnie Chase\" from, you know, that great show \"Entourage,\" to find the next start-up sensation. First though, these are the top headlines we are following this hour.</p><p>Police in Louisiana say the gunman who opened fire in a crowded theater Thursday appears to have acted alone. They say 59-year-old John Russel Houser killed two people and wounded nine before turning the gun on himself. He had been treated in the past for mental health issues, institutionalized and police say they're still trying to figure out what his motive was.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>COLONEL MICHAEL EDMONSON, LOUISIANA STATE POLICE: The thing (ph) that I seek from the men and women that make up the Lafayette Police Department is trying to find a motive, trying to find a motive, trying to find a goal, trying to find something that says why did he walk in that theater.</p><p>Why'd he fire at least 13 times? Why did he turn around and go back in there? Why'd he leave his car outside the keys on top of the tire? Why was he living in a Motel 8? Why did he have wigs in there and little glasses and all those types of things? Any little thing - that's what those DNA scientists are doing inside that theater right now.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: U.S. President Barack Obama has arrived in his father's homeland of Kenya. His half-sister greeted him at the Nairobi Airport along with Kenyan - Kenya's president. Also Kenyans lined the streets of the capital to catch a glimpse of President Obama's motorcade. It is the first time that a sitting U.S. president has made a visit to Kenya.</p><p>And the president of Burundi has won a highly-contested third term as leader. The election commission announcing a decision on Friday after a vote marred by violent protests in opposition, boycotts also coup attempt. Officials say Pierre Nkurunziza got nearly 70 percent of the vote in the African nation. The opposition maintains that term limits made his candidacy unconstitutional.</p><p>And Turkey says it is opening up some of its airbases in order to crack down on terrorism in the region. The country has announced that U.S. and coalition forces can use some of those bases to launch airstrikes against ISIS. This comes after Turkish jets carried out their own strikes against ISIS positions in Syria earlier in the day on Friday.</p><p>And FIFA has admitted its massive corruption scandal is indeed hurting its business, specifically its sponsorship deals. Visa has called FIFA's response wholly inadequate and joined key other sponsors in saying it wants an independent commission to oversee reforms.</p><p>The FIFA secretary-general explained why FIFA has not signed any new sponsors since the last World Cup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:35:01] JEROME VALCKE, FIFA SECRETARY GENERAL: Definitely the current situation does not help to finalize any new agreement. That is a fact and I'm sure that until the next election - until the 26th of February - there will be not be major announcements.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Chrysler is recalling 1.4 million vehicles that are vulnerable to hackers. The recall comes after a really shocking video was released this week. Look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ANDY GREENBERG, REPORTER, \"WIRED\" MAGAZINE: All right, all the - something just turned on all the fans and a/c and stuff - I didn't do that. The trip started --</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: That is hackers demonstrating how with the laptop from far away they can remotely control the Jeep that is driving. Laurie Segall, of course she spoke with the hackers. She always gets the scoop on this. And they showed her how they did this. This is the new reality - cars are computers.</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT FOR CNNMONEY: Yes. Absolutely. I mean, cars are computers and because of that, they have never been more vulnerable. Companies seemed to start taking that seriously. That's why they're doing this research, Poppy.</p><p>I want to first of all pull up a list -</p><p>HARLOW: Right, so we can see which ones.</p><p>SEGALL: -- out of all the makes and models Chryslers' recalling because it's quite a few. Take a look - see if you're on there. And I will say this now -- Chrysler's upgraded its network. They said they can no longer prevent remote hacking, but I spoke to one of the hackers just a couple of minutes ago before I came up here, and he said you're absolutely right, you can't remotely hack anymore. But he did say if I am near your car, I can still exploit a Wi-Fi hotspot, potentially to get in.</p><p>So he says if those - if your car was on that list, go to your dealership. They're going to give a USB stick and they will help update that - they will help patch it. So very, very important to do, Poppy.</p><p>You've got to remember that these cars are connected to the internet.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>SEGALL: You've got to remember that they're scanning the internet looking for vulnerabilities.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. Maybe this is a reason to bike, I don't know.</p><p>SEGALL: (LAUGHTER).</p><p>HARLOW: Look, let's talk more about the hacker that you spoke with. I think you have some sound, right? From what he said.</p><p>SEGALL: Yes. I absolutely didn't remember I spoke to these guys years ago and they were demonstrating their first very high-profile hack for me. So I was able to catch up with one of them again and I said what's different? And before they'd been able to hack but only from inside the car.</p><p>So I asked what is different. Listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CHRIS VALASEK, DIRECTOR OF VEHICLE SECURITY RESEARCH IOACTIVE: Now we don't have to be in the car, we don't have to be connected. We don't even have to be in the same state. So we can reach any car in the United States and potentially North America.</p><p>SEGALL: What were you able to do?</p><p>VALASEK: We were able to do almost everything we were the last time we did this - steering, braking, lock and unlock the doors, turn on the high-beams, basically anything that car was controllable over the in-car network, we were able to do.</p><p>SEGALL: What do you want people to kind of take away from this?</p><p>VALASEK: The statement I reiterate is we're the good guys. Bad guys don't you about what's wrong. They keep to themselves and use it for whatever they want to use it for. You know, we're out there to let people know the risk exposure and help manufacturers get things fixed.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SEGALL: Now if only the companies would hire these guys so they don't have to go -</p><p>HARLOW: Some of them do.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>HARLOW: Ford told me that they employ hackers.</p><p>SEGALL: They need - I think this kind of research shows that they need to be doing what Ford is doing - they need to hire more security and researchers. And when I spoke to Charlie, one of the other hackers involved, what he said was these companies need to treat security like companies that house secured data. They need to be constantly testing themselves, constantly to break in to their own networks which are more connected than ever.</p><p>And @Charlie Miller - he said this on Twitter - he's one of the hackers and I think he said it best. He said, \"I wonder what's cheaper - designing secured cars or doing recalls.\"</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SEGALL: These guys are going to have more companies investing now -- slowly.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. Laurie Segall, fascinating stuff. I'm going to keep biking, all right, thank you.</p><p>SEGALL: (LAUGHTER).</p><p>HARLOW: Have a great weekend. More than a trillion dollars' worth of tech products - everything from video games to semiconductors could be a whole lot cheaper for you. That is because of a $1 trillion deal - yes, trillion with a 't.\"</p><p>After more than a decade of talks and back and forth and negotiations, the World Trade Organization has reached a deal to get rid of tariffs on tech products traded around the world on more than 200 products.</p><p>I asked the director general Roberto Azevedo if this move could really help boost GDP.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROBERTO AZEVEDO, DIRECTOR GENERAL, WTO: We have many statistics I think at this point in time. Some are pointing to something close to $200 billion per year. It's a big deal.</p><p>HARLOW: What do you expect that this will do for jobs? Because that is such a focus herein the United States, across Europe, etc. What does this do for jobs?</p><p>AZEVEDO: We're expecting a big bump in terms of economic output. So we - because this is not a deal that affects only the products like that 201 products that is on the list - that are on the list.</p><p>This is going to affect other sectors as well. So we should expect increased demand for example because the prices for consumers are going down.</p><p>[16:40:01] This is going to help other areas of the industry that use these products as components to lower their costs as well.</p><p>Services which use these products for example in hospitals or in telecom - all these things are going to be cheaper to the consumer and to the producers. So the overall effect should be one of a positive stimulus, therefore job creation.</p><p>HARLOW: Are you confident that some of these savings will be passed on to consumers?</p><p>AZEVEDO: Absolutely. You're talking about a deal which is about 7 - more than 7 percent of total global trade. For something like this to happen that you're suggesting where producers pocket all the benefits, you would require an extremely coordinated effort on the part of all producers to do that.</p><p>Because all it takes is that a few of them decide to share the benefits with the consumer to get more market share, to be more competitive and the deal is over. Everybody's competing. This is a very, very competitive market. I can't see how the producers are going to pocket this and not share the benefits with the consumers.</p><p>HARLOW: This deal has been more than decade in the making. Now you've got it inked - freshly inked. Do you think that deals like this - our - the best way to stimulate trade in this global economy right now when there is such an urgent need for more investment. Is this the best way?</p><p>AZEVEDO: This is one of the good ways to do it. I hope that we can use this to inspire negotiations even here in the WTO. In less than two years we had two major agreements - we had the Trade Facilitation Agreement in Bali which is worth about $1 trillion a year and this one which is going to inject an additional stimulus of an order of magnitude of about $200 billion a year.</p><p>These are very big agreements and they're different in nature. While in Bali the Trade Facilitation Agreement the commitments were flexible but the membership was everybody. This one is different. This one is the commitment to very strict, very uniform. But the signatories vary. It's more - it's more flexible in terms of accessions.</p><p>So these are different agreements. We can play with those things and make sure that we keep delivering.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Well the secretary general of the WTO there. Well the chief executive of drinks company, Pernod Ricard, is hoping to spot the next big tech sensation.</p><p>Alexandre Ricard is one of four judges who will give $1 million to a startup entrepreneur who wins this. It's called \"The Venture,\" and it pits 16 social entrepreneurs and their ideas against one another. Those startups are trying to make a positive impact while also of course turning a profit.</p><p>Also on the panel, Adrian Grenier known for portraying the character Vinnie Chase from \"Entourage.\" A little star power there. Alexandre Ricard joins me now from San Francisco.</p><p>Thank you for being with me, sir. I appreciate it very much. Let's talk about -</p><p>ALEXANDRE RICARD, CEO, PERNOD RICARD: A pleasure.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you. OK, let's talk about why you're doing this. Is it because you want to get these smart folks into your fold at the company or is this a pure advertising, marketing play?</p><p>RICARD: You know, at the end of the day, the challenge I've put in front of the Chivas Regal brand team was how can you bring to life the Chivas brand values in a pioneering and in an innovative way. And they went and did a lot of digging into the Chivas history going back to the two brothers, the Chivas brothers - James and John in 1801, and they were social entrepreneurs.</p><p>So basically they came up with that idea to do what would have these two brothers done in today's world given the global nature of the world and given the technology. That's point one.</p><p>And point two I believe both from a talent attraction retention point of view and a consumer point of view, the new generations are extremely sensitive to a better world.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>RICARD: So I think it's the best of two worlds.</p><p>HARLOW: It's a great point. I was just talking to Sir Martin Sorrell of WPP at the beginning of the show about exactly that - I mean, millennials are demanding that companies stand for something good. You know, alcohol companies - any kind of company - they want it to stand for some social good.</p><p>Outside of your sector, I'm interested in where you think the most innovation is needed. Pharma? Tech? What do you look at?</p><p>RICARD: Well listen, I'll tell you -- based on the 16 finalists which means they come from 16 different countries and they made the cut from over 1,000 entries which is to tell you how many people around the world are so eager to make a change.</p><p>[16:45:06] And we see willingness to change climate. Environment is something which is big. And we have seen a few projects, one of them being how to save water, how to make agricultural more efficient from a water usage point of view. Recycling as well is big.</p><p>So that's from a climate point of view, but you also have disease and health - how to track animals around the world and identify anomalies through small chips and satellites tracking. That's another domain again. Disabled as well - that's something which is important or the elderly. And finally, poverty - how to give access to poor households to affordable homes, how to prevent - you know - shack fires in emerging markets. So quite a few domains.</p><p>And people - these young generations - are extremely passionate about it, they have a lot of drive and commitment and I have to say it's - for people like - it is inspiring.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, they certainly are demanding a new way to have business operate. So I thank you so much for joining me on what looks like an absolutely beautiful day there in San Francisco, sir. Appreciate it.</p><p>RICARD: Thank you very much.</p><p>HARLOW: Coming up, it is the moment many Kenyans had been waiting for. President Obama makes a historic visit to his ancestral homeland. We are live in Nairobi next.</p><p>HARLOW: U.S. President Barack Obama has touched down in his ancestral homeland for the first time ever since entering the Oval Office. The U.S. president is in Kenya as part of a tour aimed at strengthening diplomatic relations in the region.</p><p>A huge security operation is underway amid concern about terror from al Shahab militants. The President due to meet with the Kenyan president on Saturday before becoming the first sitting U.S. president in history to visit neighboring Ethiopia.</p><p>Barack Obama's trip is also designed to bolster economic ties between the U.S. and Kenya. He is due to attend a U.S.-sponsored entrepreneurship summit there in Nairobi.</p><p>That is where we find our Jim Acosta - in the Kenyan capital joining me. So obviously he was in East Africa and he was talking about - talking about - the economy, etc. and business. But he's also spending some really quality, frankly, family time.</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Poppy. President Obama has arrived in Africa. He's here in Kenya, he's on the ground in Nairobi landing in his father's homeland earlier this evening. The president was greeted at the airport by Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr. Obama's half-sister, Auma.</p><p>And shortly after that greeting at the airport, the President along with some of his relatives went out to dinner here in the Kenyan capital. So he is getting in touch with his family once again.</p><p>[16:45:03] The President will spend the next few days focusing on efforts to boost Africa's economy and security with a speech at that entrepreneurial summit that you mentioned, Poppy.</p><p>And then there's going to be a major address to the African people on Sunday here in Kenya. He's going to be talking about his Kenyan roots at that point.</p><p>But we should point out - and this is a - I think that it's a little bit disappointing to the White House -- for logistical and security reasons, he's not going to be going to his ancestral village of Kogelo where his father is from. Instead those relatives will be coming in and out of Nairobi.</p><p>But also a big topic of discussion here for this president will be the fight against terrorist groups in this part of the world, namely al Shabaab, which as you know has carried out terrorist attacks here in Kenya. That has resulted in a massive security presence here, and I can just tell you, Poppy, from being out on the streets earlier today here in Nairobi, it was eerily quiet.</p><p>I mean, these - I was told by people on the streets that these avenues and boulevards should be jam-packed with people, especially when somebody like Barack Obama is coming back to this country of his father.</p><p>But because of the security precautions that have been taken here, a lot of people have just decided to stay home and watch this on television although we should point out when he was making his way through the streets of Nairobi, they were pretty full at that point -- a lot of people waving and cheering - a lot of pride in this African-American president --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ACOSTA: -- and somebody that they consider to be person who is very much a part of Africa. Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Absolutely. Really nice to see that embrace with his half- sister there right when he got off the plane. Jim Acosta, enjoy the trip.</p><p>ACOSTA: Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: I'm sure it's fascinating to be on the ground there. Thank you very much.</p><p>Next - switching gears in a major way - Taylor Swift heading to China later this year. It is great news for her fans there.

And I think (inaudible).</p><p>[16:55:04] RIPLEY: Sun says the bigger obstacle facing Swift is places like this. This is Beijing's famous silk market. You can see busloads of people come here, a lot of them Western tourists. They come by the millions each year for counterfeit versions of the world's biggest brands - openly sold for a fraction of the price.</p><p>There are so many people here, it's incredible and even though most of what's being sold is fake, this place brings in so much money - the authorities, the market supervisors - they just look the other way.</p><p>Taylor Swift's clothing line hasn't even launched yet in China, but knockoffs are already big sellers online.</p><p>SUN: That is one thing Taylor Swift can be sure about.</p><p>RIPLEY: Sun says it's a part of doing business in the world's counterfeiting super power. How big of a threat is the counterfeit issue to artists like Taylor Swift?</p><p>SUN: In fact it will be far more of fabricated items than authentic ones that will be circulating in the Chinese market.</p><p>RIPLEY: He says Swift still stands to make massive profits, teaming up with Chinese e-commerce giants JD and Alibaba, China's insatiable appetite for American pop culture is a gold mine for the highest-paid woman in music, meaning Swift will likely be 'shaking it off' all the way to the bank. Will Ripley, CNN Beijing.</p><p>HARLOW: We will be right back with more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment.</p><p>HARLOW: The heavy selling continues for U.S. stock. For the second day in a row we saw triple-digit loss on the Dow. We actually started the week well above 18,000, now that index has lost around 500 points in the space of just a few days. Falling commodity prices are partly to blame.</p><p>Also in corporate news, the biggest media merger of the year just getting a green light from U.S. regulators. AT&amp;T is going buy DirecTV in a deal worth $49 billion.</p><p>And that is \"Quest Means Business.\" I'm Poppy Harlow. Thanks so much for being with us. Have a great weekend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2015072401cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GHK-FP31-DXH2-643D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8458\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>July 24, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002IVU</classCode><className>ANHEUSER-BUSCH COS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002GTT</classCode><className>OAO GAZPROM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000984V</classCode><className>ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV NV/SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>NAICS332431 METAL CAN MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>NAICS327213 GLASS CONTAINER MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>NAICS312120 BREWERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>NAICS111199 ALL OTHER GRAIN FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS486210 PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION OF NATURAL GAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS221210 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS213112 SUPPORT ACTIVITIES FOR OIL &amp;

Josh Hawley an ardent critic of both big tech and Beijing will chair a hearing to examine, among other things, TikTok s collection of U.S. consumer data. And last Friday, reports <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-cfius-exclusive/exclusive-us-opens-national-security-investigation-into-tiktok-sources-idUSKBN1XB4IL\"> surfaced </url> that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is probing the company s 2017 acquisition by Chinese tech company ByteDance. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers are concerned about the app s potential to block content deemed dangerous by Beijing s political censors. TikTok is one of the first major apps to ban political content by American users, a move many believe was driven by the Chinese government. </p><p>But a separate fear revolves around the notion that TikTok, which currently boasts around 26.5 million active users in the U.S., may be funneling sensitive consumer data to Beijing for an unknown but likely nefarious purpose.</p><p> If you ve got a Chinese company that is operating here, and is making major inroads in the American market, and is scooping up user data ... all the user data that American companies routinely gather on their users, and then taking that back to China, you worry,  What are they doing with this?   Hawley said.  Are they building profiles on Americans? </p><p>Several of Hawley s colleagues share his fears, including fellow Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p>But outside of TikTok s ownership by a Chinese company, there s not much evidence to indicate a direct threat to U.S. consumers or at least, a threat that s substantively different from the privacy and security risks posed by Facebook, Google, or other U.S. firms. </p><p>Hawley and other TikTok skeptics compare the threat posed by the video app to that posed by Huawei, the massive Chinese telecommunications firm banned from operating within U.S. borders earlier this year. As with Huawei, they say, the establishment of TikTok s parent company within Chinese borders compels the company to cooperate with Beijing s every demand.</p><p>While there s no hard evidence that either TikTok or Huawei have been compromised, with Huawei the threat vector is clear. Once plugged into U.S. networks, Huawei equipment could contain inactive hardware or, more likely, be updated via software to eavesdrop on sensitive U.S. communications. </p><p>A similar threat vector doesn t seem to exist when it comes to Beijing s use of TikTok data. The company says it now stores U.S. user data on servers in Virginia and Singapore, outside of China s jurisdiction. And even if the data were stored in China, it s not clear how it could be weaponized against Americans.</p><p>Robert Daly, the director of the Wilson Center s Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, said the greatest potential threat posed by TikTok to American citizens  sound[s] like a paranoid-fringe kind of concern.</p><p> If you have all of this data of about 1.3 billion users worldwide including a number of American young people can you use that, together with AI capacity and facial recognition, 10 to 15 years hence, when you take a quick shot of crowds demonstrating against China here on the National Mall, and you know who they are?  Daly said to a group of journalists last week.</p><p> Given what s actually on TikTok, which is mostly goofs of various kinds, that seems far-fetched,  he said.  It is technologically feasible. So it s part of the bigger question about how worried you are about China and its intentions. </p><p>Like so much else in Washington, TikTok s Chinese ownership seems to be the main concern particularly for the bipartisan cadre of China hawks in the Senate. </p><p>But it s not clear whether Chinese ownership is enough, by itself, to convince other lawmakers of the need for a crackdown. When asked last week about the threat posed by TikTok, Sen. Brian Schatz suggested he d need to see more evidence than its Chinese ownership before making that determination.</p><p>That evidence may not be immediately forthcoming. Douglas Brush, vice president of cybersecurity services at U.S. consulting firm Special Counsel, was hired earlier this year by ByteDance to audit TikTok s data-collection practices. In a review spanning July to October, Brush said his team found no evidence that U.S. user data stored by TikTok was being funneled to China or accessed by engineers within its borders. </p><p> There s really nothing nefarious that we really found,  Brush said.  It just tends to be the typical type of data that you would see in a social-media app. </p><p>Brush couldn t speak to the company s data practices before this summer. And earlier this year David Carroll, a professor with Parsons School of Design at The New School, <url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-chinese-cambridge-analytica-data-133006727.html\"> pushed </url> TikTok into admitting some U.S. user data  may have been processed in China  before a policy change in February 2019.</p><p> The people who were early adopters [of TikTok] their data, it should be assumed, is in the hands of the government,  Carroll told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis>.</p><p>Like Daly, Carroll couldn t quite articulate what immediate threat that collection posed.  It s really hard to know, because we only have a vague sense of what data is being collected,  he said. </p><p>But, Carroll added, the unique nature of TikTok s algorithm means Chinese engineers may know more than users would be comfortable with about their video preferences; Brush also couldn t speak to whether engineers in China were involved in examining those preferences for the purposes of perfecting TikTok s algorithm. And it s not clear whether users from jurisdictions with tougher privacy rules, such as Europe or California, will be able to exercise their rights. </p><p>Those problems aren t so different from the privacy concerns surrounding Facebook or other U.S. companies. But when coupled with escalating suspicions around China, Carroll expects it will give ByteDance an incentive to spin off TikTok as a truly separate company before federal scrutiny intensifies.</p><p> It s all the same concerns, plus the additional ones,  Carroll said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-702407</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF5-NKJ1-DY4X-T18V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1018\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

But at their heart, they were about much more: the growth of these technology companies to a scale and power neither the platforms nor Congress really understand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter all agreed with the assessment of Democrat Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, that the companies have responsibilities beyond simply providing a forum for users to share content. This admission may seem minor, but it represents a sea change in how these companies think of themselves. They're no longer fighting to be seen only as neutral platforms disengaged from the questions raised by the material their users choose to post.</p><p>Those who advocate that technology companies do more to combat disinformation and misbehaviour often argue that they should be seen as media organisations with editorial control. But Facebook, Google and Twitter have consistently rejected this idea.</p><p>While the companies have now accepted some responsibility for the material on their platforms, it's not clear what form they see that responsibility taking. Many of the hearings' most revealing exchanges put this confusion on full display as members of Congress and technology representatives struggled to understand one another.</p><p>At one point, Republican Senator Trey Gowdy quizzed Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch: \"Do you think the constitution protects intentionally false statements?\" \"We're trying to provide a platform for authenticity,\" Stretch answered, explaining that \"on Facebook, our job is not to decide whether content is true or false\". The reason Facebook froze Russian accounts distributing divisive political advertisements, he said, was not that those ads contained false information, but that the accounts were \"inauthentic\" - fakes.</p><p>\"For the life of me,\" Gowdy said, \"I do not understand how a republic is served by provably, intentionally false information.\"</p><p>The exchange was dizzying. Gowdy posed a question of constitutional law, which controls the government's behaviour. Stretch responded by asserting Facebook's role as a \"platform\", not a government, bound by its terms of service - which prohibit fake accounts but take no position on truth or falsehood. Then Gowdy's closing remark pivoted back to the question of how Facebook shapes American society, as though the company was quasi-governmental.</p><p>Other lawmakers expressed astonishment that Facebook stores more information on US citizens 'Facebook itself shapes our behaviour by showing us what it thinks we are wanting to click on' than the federal government does. They questioned whether the company should understand itself as loyal to the United States or as some kind of amorphous transnational entity.</p><p>Underlying all this confusion was a simple question to which no one seemed to have an answer: what exactly are these companies? They are not newspapers, but have made themselves into the place where millions of people go every day to read news and discuss politics. They are not governments, but enjoy enormous authority, reaching across borders and negotiating with governments. They are extraordinarily powerful but have so far evaded significant regulation - although that may change. They are not controlled by the constitutional limitations that bind US government, and yet have established themselves as the inadvertent custodians of the country's democracy.</p><p>This is how we end up with Republican Senator Marco Rubio asking the entirely reasonable yet wholly absurd question of whether Russian election meddling violated Twitter's terms of service.</p><p>(According to Twitter's acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, it did not.) Precisely because these companies - particularly Facebook - have such vast reach, any meaningful conversation about their influence over elections and the health of the republic has to extend beyond the issue of Russian ads. The much larger issue is how powerful social media companies stoke division by enabling users to live within curated political worlds, providing them separate realities to call home.</p><p>\"Everyone who shows up on Facebook is required to be their authentic self,\" Stretch said. Yet rather than allowing us to express our \"authentic selves,\" Facebook itself shapes our behaviour by showing us what it thinks we're most likely to click on. If the Russian propaganda was effective, it worked because it resonated with the selves we create in conjunction with Facebook: our ugliest fears and desires, our willingness to set aside truth when it becomes inconvenient.</p><p>All three companies said they were unsatisfied with their response to the 2016 election, but showed little understanding of what would have constituted a satisfactory response. The only proposed legislation focuses on mandating transparency for political ads online. Even if Russia leaves social media alone in 2018, we will still have to deal with ourselves, clicking and scrolling our way to the polls.

WASHINGTON: Google's tightening of its political ad policy could help reduce the spread of misinformation on election campaigns, but at a cost for lesser-known candidates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The move by Google placing restrictions on how advertisers can target specific groups of voters also adds to the pressure on Facebook to modify its hands-off policy on political ads. Google announced Wednesday it would not allow political advertisers to use \"microtargeting\" which can be based on user browsing data, political affiliation or other factors, for its ads, including on YouTube.</p><p> Instead it will limit targeting to general categories such as age, gender or postal code location. The changes will be enforced in Britain within a week and in the rest of the world starting in January.</p><p> Google also sought to clarify its policy by indicating it does not allow \"false claims\" in advertising, political or otherwise. \"There are no carve-outs,\" Google vice president Scott Spencer said.</p><p> \"It's against our policies for any advertiser to make a false claim -- whether it's a claim about the price of a chair or a claim that you can vote by text message, that election day is postponed, or that a candidate has died.\" The move follows a ban by Twitter on most kinds of political ads, and comes amid growing pressure on internet platforms to curb the spread of misinformation around political campaigns.</p><p>Facebook isolated Senator Ron Wyden welcomed the Google move, saying it could reduce the number of deceptive ads which are sent to small segments of users, including from foreign entities. \"Targeted influence campaigns are more effective and more cost-effective than blanket propaganda, and far harder to identify and expose,\" Wyden said.</p><p> \"Now that Google and Twitter have taken responsible steps to guard against shadowy political influence campaigns, Facebook should do the same.\" Karen Kornbluh, director of the digital innovation democracy initiative at the German Marshall Fund, called Google's move \"a critically important step in taking this political disinformation weapon off the table,\" but warned that the different rules for various platforms could lead to confusion.</p><p> Michelle Amazeen, a Boston University professor who follows political advertising, said Google's actions were \"small steps in the right direction that serve to chip away at the tsunami of disinformation fostered by the current architecture of digital-social media platforms.\" Analysts noted that Facebook, which has rejected efforts to fact-check political speech or ads, will be pressured to make a similar move that could have even more far-reaching consequences.</p><p>Facebook said in a tweet late Wednesday it was \"looking at different ways we might refine our approach to political ads,\" without elaborating. Shifting digital strategies But political strategists from both parties warned that the changes by Google are likely to help well-financed and incumbent candidates and may not have the intended effect.</p><p> \"This change won't curb disinformation, but it will hinder campaigns and others who are already working against the tide of bad actors to reach voters with facts,\" said Tara McGowan, founder of the progressive advocacy group ACRONYM which has launched a $75 million digital campaign. Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist, said new candidates will be hampered in their ability to raise funds and build voter lists -- a key element on online campaigns even before the \"persuasion\" phase.</p><p> \"The big disappointment on this is you're going to have campaign spending go to platforms that are less transparent that will allow you to target voters more narrowly. The dollars won't go away.</p><p>\" Mark Jablonowski, managing partner and chief technology officer of the digital consultancy DSPolitical, which works with Democrats, said Google's efforts create a patchwork of different rules that will favor incumbents. \"In the absence of sensible, implementable federal regulations, companies like Google have adopted misguided policies that will do little more than benefit incumbents, the wealthy, and those who rely on targeting largely monolithic Republican constituencies,\" he said.</p><p> President Donald Trump's campaign director Brad Parscale responded to the Google action by tweeting that \"political elites and Big Tech want to rig elections..</p><p> Won't stop until they control all digital political speech.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG22112019029568</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJR-R8D1-F00C-63D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It's good to see everybody, and welcome to this Capital Market Day for Schibsted and Adevinta. I'm Ole Jacob Sunde, and I have been Chairman of Schibsted since 2002, and I entered the board in 2000. And I also have the pleasure of being the Chair of the Tinius Trust, which controls the largest stake at -- in Schibsted. In my spare time -- can I say that -- I do, like most of you, run a wealth management company. I founded it in 2000, and we now manage about EUR 10 billion in Scandinavia.</p><p>It is interesting to see what an enormous change there has been in the last decades in the capital markets, but I assure you that the change of pace that we have seen in the capital markets, is nothing compared to the change of pace in the modern media industry, and that's one of the topics for today.</p><p>The change of pace in the media industry also reflects the history of Schibsted. Our history is about the introduction of technology and content and how to build sustainable growth. Our founder, Christian Schibsted, was an orphan. He started a printing shop in 1839 to publish books. And he had spare capacity and he thought, \"Well, I'll produce share -- sheet advertising.\" And to get people to read his sheet advertising, he needed editorial content, and that produced Aftenposten, who is still the largest newspaper in Norway. Following 5 generations of family ownership, Schibsted was listed on the Norwegian stock exchange in 1992.</p><p>Now what we should learn from this history is not only that he possessed the qualities of a first-rate publisher. Even if you do that too, you should learn that Schibsted was born and bred in the intersection between technology, information and trustworthiness. Our growth over the years has never been linked to only one of those dimensions. It has only been strong when they are brought together, interplayed together.</p><p>And looking back at the development of the company, it is the combination of content and technology and how we have created value through experimenting in new markets, always seeking market-leading positions. The ability to examine and exchange our output, our methods, our assets does not mean that we compromise on our corporate values, our growth ambitions, nor our profitability.</p><p>Only by understanding our customers can we understand our markets. And by analyzing our data, we can reduce the costs, find the opportunities and avoid mistakes. And by fostering a culture of independence, entrepreneurship and willingness to commit to rapidly dominating the markets, we can build further growth on the foundations on those competences that we already possess.</p><p>This picture shows an array of our corporate assets, some highly successful and some yet to prove themselves. I can assure you, there is also a long list of initiatives that are not shown here because they simply didn't make the cut. We have left linear TV. Some of you might remember the search engine Sesam. We had the social site Nettby, the biggest in Norway, that we let fade away.</p><p>A history of a successful company is rarely a history of unmitigated and continuous success. It is the history of trying. It's a history of having the strength to sustain experiments and also to hold your horses.</p><p>At the end of 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis, Schibsted was valued at about NOK 6 billion. And as you can see today, we are valued at about NOK 80 billion. Even if the entire market has experienced a significant lift in that period, that has not happened to the News Media where we originated, so I guess that we must have done something right.</p><p>One of the things that I think that we have done right is to ensure that Schibsted has available capital. The earnings from our news brands that we were able to develop a growth company for more than the first decade after our listing to the stock exchange without ever accessing capital markets for additional funds and mind you, still paying a dividend. But since 2005, we have raised more than NOK 6.5 billion in equity to fund our growth. These infusions have been investments that have been very wise by our shareholders.</p><p>The founder of Schibsted, Tinius Nagell-Erichsen, of the Tinius Trust I should say, not Schibsted -- -- Tinius Trust is Tinius Nagell-Erichsen. He once said that the newspaper who is not profitable cannot retain its independence. This is still true today, and it is not only applicable to the news business. It's applicable to every company in the Schibsted portfolio.</p><p>Each investment should be profitable by itself and contribute at the same time to the whole. Our investment logic builds on existing competences, market positions and platform. And it should also make sense in financial terms with profitability, growth potential and capital strength.</p><p>During the last decade and despite the capital commitment of our owners, we have several times been compelled to build partnerships in order to control the growth initiatives because capital has been a constraint for us. We have formed good and solid partnerships that had developed well, both with Telenor and with Naspers and with several other companies. But this experience has taught us that even when a company has supportive and strong shareholders, it will always be subject to market forces outside their own control. And it takes financial strength and strategic commitment to ensure that you can develop the company and the interests of itself and its shareholders and not to become reliant on beneficial intent of others.</p><p>The industry -- The Tinius Trust, is a long-term industrial owner of Schibsted. That is enshrined in its bylaws and is outside the choice of either itself or Schibsted to choose whether to be a shareholder or not.</p><p>There are many different forms of trust, I could say and you all know. Some are tax vehicles, some are merely holding companies for families. The Tinius Trust and its investment company, Blommenholm Industrier, is neither. It is the -- it is there for perpetuity, and it is committed to upholding the key values and independence in Schibsted by firmly committing to the idea that only by pursuing a path of maximizing profit can this goal be ensured. The Tinius Trust has no family nor shareholders we can turn to for additional funds. It is the wealth created by the success of Schibsted that is its source of funds.</p><p>This is why in 2015, the B shares were introduced. And any lack of financial strength in the trust should never be a hindrance for Schibsted to raise capital in order to reach its corporate goals. Through 2 subsequent equity issues, this has proven correct.</p><p>I believe a strong, predictable, profit-seeking anchor investor has been a key to the success of Schibsted. This system will pattern in hundreds of companies throughout the world. It ensures long-term thinking in the asset allocation, the willingness to take appropriate risk and the culture where you can learn both from our successes and from our mistakes.</p><p>Unlike other shareholders, we are free to vote with their feet and seek returns elsewhere. The commitment of industrial owners is to stay put and just fix it. We must take risks. We must be able to -- we must understand risk, but we must also have the ability, based on our resources, to take risks. Over the years, we have invested millions in ideas that did not succeed but will also earn billions from that made success.</p><p>Such an owner also has to know when to step away, and the story of the listing of Adevinta as a separate company is part of that story. You have seen the company grow enormously in an industry that will keep growing but where the market forces require both concentration, consolidation and capital flexibility.</p><p>The pop artist Sting sings that if you love somebody, you have to let them go. Releasing Adevinta into a sub-listing does not mean that we no longer believe in the future of the company. On the contrary, we believe it will be a highly profitable value-creating company for years ahead, and that is one of the reasons for Schibsted to holding on a significant stake of the company.</p><p>Another reason is our belief -- experience from a multitude of other companies that we have been invested in that a company can benefit from a strong owner, especially in an industry with strong consolidation forces. Strong owners can produce and protect the control premium of the company on behalf of all its shareholders, and it can ensure that a company setting out to manage on its own has a supportive cornerstone investor.</p><p>Adevinta, as you know, is characterized by very strong margins and a healthy growth. But make no mistake, Schibsted will continue to be a growth company with solid margins and a number of opportunities also after Adevinta has been spun off.</p><p>It's important to stress that Adevinta will act and trade as any other company. While the company initially will have both A and B shares, Schibsted is committed to ensure a collapse of the share classes based on an appropriate valuation over a period of time. And then like Schibsted, Adevinta will have no ownership restrictions.</p><p>All these changes are supported by the trust, which will receive Adevinta shares as any other shareholders and which considers the Adevinta holdings as a financial investment. In a short while, shareholders in Schibsted will become shareholders in 2 companies. They have grown from the same base, and they share important corporate values.</p><p>The fact that the company is for-profit does not mean that it is without values. Schibsted Adevinta is here for a purpose. We have created wealth for our shareholders, jobs from the right place but we have also created information and access to knowledge for our customers.</p><p>At the core of what we do is the trust of our customers. We have served individuals for 180 years, and this has built the respect of the individuals into our corporate culture, including the personal data that you leave with us. Where others may see access to customer data merely as advertising opportunity, we consider the trust to be a trademark. We shall be perceived as reliable and trustworthy not because we are promoting it but because we walk the talk.</p><p>We shall help customers make well-informed decisions on issues that make a difference in their lives. We shall make consumers better informed but also ease the transition to a more sustainable living, help reducing waste over time and resources and increase the general pool of knowledge in the societies in which we participate.</p><p>In our times, no company can run away from its commitment in protecting information, ensuring diversity, working for equal treatment, independent of sex and religion nor the obligation or simply telling the truth and paying your taxes.</p><p>Our purpose is important because it drives long-term profitability. It builds a deep, mutual and long-term relationship to our millions of users. It forms the foundation for the trust embedded in our many leading brands where purpose helps us to attract and retain excellent leaders and talent. And it also helps us to give credibility in our discussions with governments that shape our competitive environment.</p><p>This brings me to my final slide, showing you all the wonderful people at Schibsted. On the Schibsted side, I will soon be leaving the floor to Kristin Skogen Lund, who is our new CEO. Over the last few months, she has put together a strong management team.</p><p>Kristin came to us 3, 4 months ago. She has a very strong background from the Norwegian business environment. She has held positions in Telenor, in the Coca-Cola Company, in the Norwegian Confederation of Enterprises and she has even a long track record in Schibsted. So I'm very glad that she is here today and can guide us through the coming years.</p><p>On the Adevinta side, there is a familiar face to you, Rolv Erik Ryssdal, known to many of you, and I'm happy that now he is now taking charge of Adevinta as the first CEO of the listed company.</p><p>I think that you know most of the management teams in both companies. I will not go through them in detail. They will be presented throughout today. All I can say is that I am very proud and happy that we have such excellent management teams. One person I would like to present to you is my counterpart in Adevinta, Orla Noonan, who is the Chair of Adevinta going forward.</p><p>Now I have the pleasure to turn the attention to Kristin. But before I do so, I say that we have never failed the future. We report on it. We live preparing for it and we enter it confident in our ability to grow, to change and to maintain leadership positions based on the strong corporate culture and commitment to trustworthiness and an obligation to remain a technology front-runner. Kristin, the floor is yours.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND, CEO &amp; COUNTRY MANAGER FOR NORWAY, SCHIBSTED ASA: Thank you. Thank you, Ole Jacob, and thank you all for coming here, so many of you today, and also to those of you following us through the webcast. It is a great opportunity for us to tell our story. And while we definitely have a lot to be proud of from our past, I hope that during the day, we'll be able to convey to you why we also believe that we will be able to create exciting new value opportunities in the future.</p><p>And I will today focus on the Schibsted -- I will focus on the Schibsted business areas today. But of course, we will remain an important owner of Adevinta. And later in our presentation, our CFO, Trond, he will present and talk about more in depth how we will execute that ownership.</p><p>So our long history of purpose-driven adaptation to constantly changing and new customer needs is really what has now shaped the Schibsted that we see today. We have different businesses. We have different brands from which we meet those consumer needs, but we share a lot of things as well as you will see during the day. And we have decided then to divide this business into these 3 areas.</p><p>We have the Nordic Marketplaces. We have the strong brands of FINN, Blocket and Tori covering Norway, Sweden and Finland. We have the News Media business where we have the strong franchise concepts of these very iconic brands that we have and also, importantly, that they are the prime news destinations in the Norwegian and Swedish market. And then we have -- in NEXT, we organize a number of new initiatives, and maybe most interestingly there now, we have a new financial services offering with Lendo being the most important asset.</p><p>And managing these business areas and keep growing them through business development, through individual initiatives in each business will be very important going forward. But there are also a lot of synergies to be extracted across our businesses that we will come back to.</p><p>And of course, having these positions is a fantastic starting point for creating new business and be able to constantly solve new customer problems.</p><p>Some 15 years ago, our online media business was absolutely essential to have the competence to build the Online Classifieds business, which we have now been able to expand across the globe. And some 8 years ago, both the digital news business and the Online Classifieds were instrumental in building up Lendo, which we're now able to expand internationally.</p><p>And I think as Ole Jacob pointed out, we have certainly made our mistakes in the past, and we will keep making them, but we are confident that we will be able to use this system to make new successes and that those successes will outweigh those who will not make it also going forward.</p><p>So what is our success formula? We have put up very simple strategic model. In the middle of it, we have the different businesses that we want to grow. They are different, but they share a common purpose, a common aspiration of being close to the customer, helping them make informed decision and thereby empowering them in their daily lives. And at the bottom of all of this, these businesses share a common foundation, and that is the Schibsted Group. We share capital, we share people and we share technology. So I would like to take you through these 3 layers, and we start at the top.</p><p>Solving problems for people and also broadening the scope of the type of problems that we can solve is absolutely essential to Schibsted's success. And by doing this, we believe we can also increase our value creation to the benefit of the shareholders but also to the benefit of our societies.</p><p>In Marketplaces, the whole point is to facilitate the transaction between buyer and seller. And by facilitating that, we are also helping the economy to be more efficient, more circular and more sustainable. In our News Media, growth is all about making sure that we manage to engage and entertain our readers, and we need to make sure that they're willing to pay for those services so that we have a healthy business within media going forward.</p><p>And then it is absolutely essential that we manage to maintain the trust that these readers have in us. So we need to keep up the high quality, our editorial integrity and truth worthiness (sic) [trustworthiness] in all of our reportings. And I have to say that in these days of fake news and manipulation, I think this task is more important than ever, and we simply need to succeed doing this. It's very, very important.</p><p>And then finally, for our financial and price comparison services, it's all about helping customers make the good deal. And by doing that, we also help society by making markets more transparent and more competitive. And on a final note on this one, let me also say that in today's labor market, if you don't have a trustworthy and credible purpose, you simply don't get the best people to work for you. So this goes beyond idealism. We really depend upon this to keep being good at what we do.</p><p>Let me then go down to the business layer and to our 3 business areas. They're strong in their own right. And as you can see here, we have nearly 800 million monthly site visits, which is an absolutely fantastic starting point for detecting and solving more and more customer problems.</p><p>In Marketplaces, it's all about getting stronger and stronger also in the verticals where we're not that strong today. In the News Media, it's all about continuing our success of digitalizing that business. And in NEXT, it is about -- make sure we have the right initiatives that we can spot, scale and then expand going forward. It has been very important for us, and it will be important as well for the future.</p><p>So while these business areas operate different models, it's also very important for us to convey that they also reinforce each other. The most of this example is advertising. The fact that we have such a broad offering makes us able to service the market in a very holistic way, and it also enables us to excel at targeted advertising.</p><p>But then we also have some other examples. We have had great success sharing traffic. The thing is most -- a lot of the traffic on our -- it's called traffic machines -- are not always that high in value per visit, but when we then manage to channel that over to some of our NEXT initiatives, for example, as shown here with Aftonbladet and Lendo, we can monetize a lot better on that traffic when we manage to channel it into another concept.</p><p>And then there some other examples here which are maybe not that great in terms of monetization, at least not yet, but they're very good examples of these synergies. We have -- we control together with partners about 90% of the households in Norway with physical distribution through our newspaper delivery. We are at 90% of the households every single day. And we have expanded that into having like a last-mile delivery service for e-tailers.</p><p>And now what we do is that we integrate that into the [sub-category] at FINN. And then we solve a transportation problem for FINN's users. So now when they want to sell something, they can put it outside the door, it will be picked up and it will be safely delivered the next day. That way, we boost our distribution business, but we also improve the FINN offering.</p><p>A couple of other examples, and Anders will get more back to this later. But the Qasa-Blocket is a great example of how we can take an asset that we have acquired through our venture investments in NEXT. We boost that by integrating it into Blocket, so it really increases the value of Qasa, which is a rental -- a house rental, full-service offering, but it also improves the ARPU of Blocket when you integrate this type of service. So it's -- again, it's a win-win.</p><p>And then finally, we have the example here -- going back to FINN, we have the example of Blink because some of the most interesting targets on FINN are the ones who do not actively come to FINN to search for a new house or a new job. They are the passive ones. But by integrating our whole ecosystem, we can target those with ads on other platforms, and that makes FINN a more attractive partner for our business customers. Anders will get back to that later.</p><p>Okay. Then let's talk about growth. We have multiple growth opportunities within our business areas and also beyond the existing business areas. But succeeding growing in our core is obviously very critical going forward. And we have made this can model, I guess, a bit Obama inspired there. And it gives a guideline that about 70% of our efforts should be put into building our core business. But we will need to venture outside of that comfort zone, and we will need to also succeed in building adjacent business as well as new business.</p><p>And then we have, over time, used these different growth tools that you see there on the right in the green. We have used all of those very efficiently. I guess, FINN is our best example of organic disruptive growth. We have Lendo as a good example of a venture that we have then grown through our system and which is now ready for international expansion.</p><p>And I think going forward, we will keep using all these tools, although I guess, it's fair to say that there might not be that many acquisition opportunities within the News Media. And when it comes to international expansion, we find the obvious candidates for that within the NEXT portfolio.</p><p>And then I don't think we can talk about growth without also looking at the macro environment in which we operate because we are fortunate to be in the Nordic region defined by McKinsey as a digital front-runner region. We have the infrastructure. We have a digital population. And more and more rare these days, we actually have sound and digital governments (sic) [governance] in all of our markets.</p><p>And this has, of course, created a great environment for entrepreneurships. There are many brilliant examples of that. But an important feature here is that we're also able to make good industry institutions, a good example of it being Bank-ID. And operating in this type of environment, we have been able to make new concepts where you have fully integrated digital customer journeys, the example -- for example, with Lendo, and then we can be very good partners with our banks at home. And the fact that we know how to do this makes us a very attractive partner for banks and financial institutions in non-Nordic countries. And that is a great asset for us now that we want to expand abroad.</p><p>Let me then spend one slide talking about the final layer, the bottom layer, which is the Schibsted foundation. And while, of course, it is the individual businesses and brands that are known outside and that we will keep reporting to you for the financial market, they do share this common platform, and it is very important that, that platform is strong and solid for their continued success.</p><p>So within finance, it is very important that we keep managing capital -- good capital discipline and that we allocate capital where it is best put at use. When it comes to the people layer, we need to attract the best talent, and we need to put that talent to its best use. We need to make sure we have the most competent people. We need to have the right incentive systems. And we need to have a good culture where we collaborate, where we stimulate entrepreneurship and we -- where we make sure that people actually are able to spot these opportunities and take them further within our working environment.</p><p>And then finally but very importantly, we share common technology, common infrastructure and we have a common approach to how we manage traffic and data. And of course, it's not just about managing that. It's about making sure that we constantly manage to translate that into value also going forward.</p><p>I'll try to sum it up. On the left here, you have our best examples of these different growth avenues: FINN having -- being a great example of organic disruptive growth, VG being an example of how we're able to take an existing analog asset and having success in digitalizing it. And I can probably say this because I'm still so new, but it's 9 years since I left Schibsted. And I have to say, coming back and seeing how Schibsted has been able to digitalize and actually make sound business out of its media business is very, very impressive to me. I wouldn't have thought that it -- this was possible when I look 9 years back.</p><p>And then finally, Prisjakt. It's an example of a venture that we acquire where we used our system to grow it, and that could be a potential candidate for scaling further. And of course, as you see in the middle here, our biggest success in terms of value is Adevinta, originally built on the internationalization of the Blocket concept. As you know, we now think that it's the right thing to spin it off, and it will have better preconditions for growth on its own 2 feet, and you'll hear a lot more about Adevinta later.</p><p>And then drawing your attention to that green circle. I know some of you have been critical to our ability off divesting things as well, and maybe we have been too slow sometimes. But when you look at all the assets that are no longer with us, our portfolio looks very different now than it did a few years back. So we have actually also been quite good at divesting.</p><p>And then we've had our spectacular failures, as Ole Jacob mentioned, for sure, and we will keep having them. But as you said, we have lost millions and we have gained billions succeeding, and we will keep trying to follow that success formula.</p><p>And then on the right is a basket of our NEXT portfolio. Raoul will take you through this. But here, we already have some exciting candidates for further growth, but the point being that we will keep adding to this basket of potential by constantly being out there spotting new opportunities.</p><p>Finally, it's all about people and we believe we have put together a strong team, and our team rests on the strength of all of those in the rest of our group. You will hear from many of them today. We have Anders Skoe. He heads up Nordic Marketplaces. He's also the CEO of FINN. He's been that for about 3 years now, and he has a background from Google in the U.S.</p><p>We have Siv Juvik Tveitnes. She heads up our News Media division, and she has made her way -- working her way up through that division, having several management positions throughout the year. We have our Swedish alibi, Raoul Gr\u00c3\u00bcnthal. He's been with us for a long time now and had many responsibilities. He's headed our Swedish business. He's been in charge of media. And given the fact that this NEXT portfolio is going to be so important to us going forward, it's the right thing to entrust it with Raoul.</p><p>And given the importance of financial services within that, we have also brought with us Dan Ouchterlony, who will deep-dive into the financial services portfolio, so he works with Raoul. We have Trond, who most of you know, our CFO. And then we have 2 new members of the team. One is here today actually listening. That's Mette. She was with Schibsted before in HR. She'll now be in charge of People &amp; Corporate Affairs. And in the meantime, she has done a brilliant job of building Korn Ferry in Norway.</p><p>And finally, we have Sven Thaulow. He will be our new Chief Data and Technology Officer. He has a background from Telenor. And now lately, he has been, for the past few years, heading Cisco in Norway. So 2 great additions to the team. They'll both be onboard within only a couple of weeks' time, so we really look forward to having this team complete very soon now.</p><p>And on that note, I'm very happy, Anders, to give the word to you and listen to what you have to say about the Nordic Marketplaces.</p><p>ANDERS SKOE, EVP OF NORDIC MARKETPLACES, SCHIBSTED ASA: Thank you for that introduction, Kristin, and thank you for the opportunity to present the Nordic Marketplaces, which, I'm sure you will agree with me, has not been a phenomenal business historically but has a lot of potential for future growth.</p><p>The Nordic Marketplaces division comprises of 3 primary businesses: we have FINN in Norway, Blocket in Sweden and then Tori in Finland. In aggregate, in 2018, these 3 businesses generated approximately NOK 2.8 billion in revenue and close to NOK 1.3 billion in EBITDA.</p><p>It was also a year where we continued to maintain, if not strengthen, our #1 positions. And it was also a year where, in any given month, we had approximately 190 million visits across our 3 sites, which is not bad considering the population of these 3 countries is only about 21 million.</p><p>And then finally, we are very proud of the contribution we made to our environment through all the secondhand trade on these sites. In sum, we saved emissions of close to 1.5 million tons of CO2 in 2018.</p><p>There are 3, excuse me, 4 key takeaways I would like for you to have from this part of the presentation. The first is that we continue to have extremely strong leadership positions across all of the 3 marketplaces. The second is that because of this phenomenal starting point, we are also very well positioned to take additional -- capture additional market opportunities. And the third is that not only historically have we delivered very strong financial results, but we also expect to do so going forward. And finally, we believe that we, as Marketplaces, have an unfair competitive advantage by being part of the Schibsted ecosystem in the Nordics.</p><p>Looking at the 3 marketplaces, we see that FINN continues to hold an unrivaled #1 position within all of the key marketplace verticals in Norway. FINN is the clear #1 within general goods, within vehicles, within real estate and within jobs.</p><p>In Sweden, Blocket has a clear #1 within general goods as well as cars and vehicles, has a very solid position within jobs and then in real estate, a strong and evolving position.</p><p>Tori has a clear #1 within the general goods space, a solid #2 position within cars, obviously, if you look at listings, and then a nascent position within the real estate. But definitely, a very interesting starting point for capturing additional market share.</p><p>Looking at the financial development of this portfolio, I would say it's been very strong over a long period of time. FINN was launched right around -- officially launched, I should say, right around 2000 and has been profitable pretty much since the beginning. Blocket was acquired in 2003 and Tori was an organic launch in 2009.</p><p>On this graph, I would say that there are 2 key takeaways, one of them is obvious, the other one is not so obvious. The obvious one is that we have continued to maintain very high margins over a very long period of time. The other one that's not so obvious is what happens from around 2013 to 2015 time frame because what you're seeing here is kind of a flattish development in top line revenues.</p><p>And especially, if you look at FINN, I would say that there was a concern that, that point in time that FINN was a very mature player in a mature market in Norway. And there was some concern that FINN had reached kind of peak classifieds, but what we saw was that with the starting point we had, we had an opportunity to solve many more problems for both users and customers, and that has really provided the foundation for the increased growth trajectory you see ever since.</p><p>And examples of that are things like presenting financing options to users or consumers when they are looking to buy a car, and it's things like helping sellers of secondhand homes market their homes for sale in new ways through things like the Blink product. And what we have also done is become much more sophisticated when it comes to pricing and packaging during the last few years.</p><p>Moving on to then to a deep dive into FINN. FINN, as mentioned earlier, continues to hold clear #1 positions across all the key verticals. FINN is also a large enough player that it's meaningful to talk about revenue per capita and also business per capita. And FINN's brand recognition is also close to unrivaled with 98% of aided brand awareness, which is very unusual for any company.</p><p>FINN has continued to grow nicely over the last few years. CAGR over the last 2 years was 12%. In Q4 of 2018, FINN delivered a 17% year-over-year growth. So it's good to see that the business is solid and continuing to grow. FINN also has a nicely diversified revenue portfolio.</p><p>Diving then into the jobs vertical. Jobs crossed the NOK 0.5 billion revenue threshold in 2018, and is now the largest revenue contributor within FINN. The key drivers over the last few years have been: one, volume increases. The Norwegian economy is going pretty well, more companies are looking for talent. And the other driver is that we have made significant changes in our pricing and packaging setup.</p><p>Looking forward, we see that there's very substantial opportunities for our jobs vertical. Perhaps the most interesting one is to help employers looking for talent to get access to the more passive candidates. It is the case today that candidates actively looking for jobs will already be on FINN looking for a job, we want to help employers get in touch with the passive candidates as well.</p><p>We are also working on a product that will more automatically activate various types of upsell products when a job is particularly hard to staff, and then the third opportunity is really just to make our various upsell products easier to discover, understand and buy.</p><p>Moving on to the real estate vertical. We continue to see a nice growth in this portfolio as well. Pretty much all homes for sale are secondhand homes for sale in Norway are already on FINN, so there's not much volume growth here. A key driver for the revenue increase has been the launch of the Blink product, which I'll get back to later, but it's really an innovative marketing solution for those wanting to sell a home.</p><p>Looking forward, we see a number of interesting opportunities for growth. One of the ones that we are working very intensely on right now is one that involves new construction. We see that there is a need among developers to present their offerings more smartly, and we also see a demand among consumers who are potential buyers to get a better overview over the new construction market.</p><p>We also see that there is an opportunity in evolving the property rentals or long-term rentals space, and then we are continuing to roll out adjacent services such as financing solutions, insurance and other related products.</p><p>The motor vertical has also seen growth over the last couple of years. The key driver from 2016 to 2017 was an increase in volumes. Private leasing has become very popular in Norway, and the dealers saw a lot of leased cars returned, so -- and those leased cars were used, they have to be put on FINN and sold. And then the driver from 2017 to 2018 is primarily changes to the pricing and packaging structure.</p><p>Looking forward, we see a very interesting opportunity around what we call our digital purchase contract. And what this is, is we're now providing our customers the opportunity to sign a contract at the time of transaction. And this gives us an entry into very, very interesting point during the user journey, because the point at which you make that purchase is also when you need financing, you need insurance, you need to make a decision about who will service this vehicle, what are you going to do about storing the tires and so forth, so it's become this very interesting point of introducing various value-adding services.</p><p>And then the last opportunity here, which is Blink Motor, again, has to do with helping car dealers solve more of their advertising challenges.</p><p>Also a slide here on the travel vertical. The travel vertical is very interesting because it was launched some number of years ago now, but is already contributing well over NOK 100 million per year just in metasearch and [car supplies] revenue. On top of this, we have revenues from display advertising.</p><p>The drop here in ARPUs, really average revenue per account is not alarming, it just means that we have more smaller agents joining this platform. In addition to there existing a number of product or feature opportunities such as city packages and last-minute travels, there's another particularly interesting opportunity for FINN travel, and that is to create a white label version of the FINN travel platform and scale it initially into Sweden. So we are planning here within the next couple of months to launch a travel vertical in Sweden under the Blocket brand, built on the FINN platform. So it's a nice example of collaboration and also reusing the [technical] platform.</p><p>Moving on to Blocket. Blocket, as I mentioned earlier, continues to hold a very clear #1 position, particularly within general goods and cars or motors, and is also large enough that it's meaningful to talk about revenues per capita and visits per capita.</p><p>The financial performance of Blocket continues to be strong. However, we have seen a contraction in that business over the last year-or-so. There are 3 key drivers for that contraction. Number one is advertising; number two is motors; and number three is the general goods segment. The key reason for the contraction in advertising business is it not Blocket-specific, this has to do with the generally challenging advertising climate in the Swedish market.</p><p>And then I'll get back to the reasons for the contraction within motors and general goods. Blocket also has a very nicely diversified revenue portfolio, and delivers high and predictable cash levels.</p><p>Looking then at the motor vertical. This is the largest vertical within Blocket. It did see a slight contraction from '17 to '18. The main reason for that is that a number of the largest car dealers in Sweden decided to list their inventory exclusively on an industry-sponsored competitive website.</p><p>This obviously impacted volumes on Blocket. However, during the course of 2018, we've been able to resolve the situation. And as of the end of 2018, more than 90% of the car dealers have decided to go exclusively with the competitor, have now relisted their cars for sale on Blocket.</p><p>And here, at the beginning of 2018, we are seeing a positive listings development for -- within the professionals segment.</p><p>The other thing we've done throughout 2018 is we have become even better at listening to our customers within the motors segment, and rolled out a number of new product features that also makes it even more attractive to come back to Blocket. Looking forward, this improved climate between Blocket and the car dealers has provided a foundation for us to start discussing things like new pricing models, which is very, very exciting for us.</p><p>We also see an opportunity here to develop products closer to the actual transaction. And then finally, in Sweden, we see a particularly interesting opportunity in developing kind of the new markets marketplace. Blocket has a subbrand known as BytBil which we're developing into more of a new cars platform.</p><p>And then before I leave this slide, there's 1 particularly impressive statistic that I would like to share with you, and that is, that, in Sweden, 1 car is sold every minute through the Blocket platform, which is a very, very impressive effect statistic for a site like this.</p><p>Moving on to the general list goods vertical. I'll just start out again with a statistic that has to do with effect, 1/4 of all items listed on the Blocket general goods sites are sold within 24 hours. And there are very few sites of this type who can show these kinds of effect numbers. We also believe that because we deliver such strong effect, we are very well positioned to also capture value from this value we create for our customers.</p><p>The key reason that you see a little bit of a dip here is a reduction in volumes. Again, and this is primarily tied to the fact that this vertical Blocket is still in a paid listings model. We're starting to conduct experiments to see how dramatically this paid listing model affects volumes. We ran an experiment in November, December on certain categories where we reduced the price, not to 0, but to NOK 10 per listing, and by reducing the price to NOK 10 per listing, we increased the volumes in those categories by 100%.</p><p>And I mentioned this because we are planning to continue to involve the pricing and business model within this segment on Blocket, and you should expect us to continue to run experiments to see what is the best model going forward.</p><p>In addition to running experiments going forward, we also believe there is a good opportunity in increasing monetization among professional listers on this segment, and we are now also in the process of launching what we call Blocket [Resor], which is a bundle of delivery and insurance solutions for those wishing to sell through Blocket.</p><p>The jobs vertical in Blocket has now crossed NOK 100 million run rate, which is good, but we still believe there is a lot of potential to generate even more revenue from this vertical. Some of the key things we are now doing to increase revenues here are, not surprisingly, to continue to roll out more premium products. We're also looking at rolling out a marketplace for educational opportunities, which interestingly enough, is kind of anticyclical versus jobs, so would really benefit us if there was ever a significant change in the Swedish economy.</p><p>And then finally, we believe that the jobs vertical is a segment where there is opportunity for market consolidation in Sweden.</p><p>Looking at the real estate vertical in Sweden. Blocket is in not highly particularly strong position. These revenue levels are much, much lower than what we see in other markets. The main driver for that is that Hemnet is the clear #1 within the secondhand property space in Sweden.</p><p>That said, we believe that going forward, we have some particularly exciting opportunities for Blocket within real estate. The most exciting one which I'll do a deep dive on in a second, is the Qasa Blocket combination that Kristin alluded to earlier. We also see that there is an opening to become the de facto marketplace where people look for [haute] houses and rentals. And there's also an opportunity in Sweden to develop or launch a marketplace for new construction, likely in collaboration with them.</p><p>If we do a deep dive on the rentals opportunity, we just made an acquisition or closed an acquisition of Qasa. Qasa is a full-service rental offering. They have a very, very solid monetization model, but they don't have the inventory or the listings. Blocket, on the other hand, has all the listings but does not have a particularly solid monetization model.</p><p>And, yes, if you look at the numbers here, you see that this is really an interesting marriage, and we've already started the integration of Qasa into Blocket, and we see that the conversion levels are very, very strong and holds a lot of promise for us to develop this as a significant source of revenue going forward.</p><p>Moving on then to Tori in Finland. Tori's primary position is within the general goods segment, where they have a tremendous amount of traffic. And we believe there is opportunity going forward both in developing that general goods segment as well as using that as a springboard to further develop other positions.</p><p>Tori has been in a very good revenue growth trajectory. And 2018 was also the first year that the company turned EBITDA-positive, which is a big milestone in the history of Tori. If you look at the revenue distribution, you see that they are very heavily -- you see that Tori is very heavily relied upon advertising. This is not unusual given that it is primarily a general goods site today. But as we evolve that vertical as well as grow in other segments, you should expect this balance to shift.</p><p>And looking at Tori, some of the more interesting opportunities include: one, involving the cars category. Learning from both Blocket and FINN to see what has been successful there. We also think there are opportunities within the FINNish real estate market, not necessarily within the secondhand property, for sale segment, but within some of the other segments like what we saw in Sweden, including rentals.</p><p>And then we also believe there's a general opportunity in taking concepts that have already been proven in Norway and Sweden and scaling them to Finland as well as pursue selected M&amp;A opportunities in the FINNish market.</p><p>Starting then to wrap up a little bit. What we're looking at with the Nordic Marketplaces business is really a business that has delivered very strong financial results over a long period of time, but it doesn't end there, because when we look forward, we think that there are plenty of opportunities for increased monetization going forward. And as a key part of the playbook there are things like continuing to work on packaging and pricing as well as upsell products.</p><p>The second thing is, we will continue to do our product development to further strengthen our positions. We think that by doing so, we are also positioning ourselves very well for capturing even more of the value that we are generating for our users and customers. We will continue to launch new verticals either by scaling them from one geography into another or by establishing entirely new verticals such as a marketplace for educational opportunities. And then finally, we will look at selective M&amp;A within the Nordics.</p><p>To summarize the key takeaways. Again, within the Nordic market business, we have some phenomenal positions, we like to use the word unrivaled. And we believe these positions are a great springboard for capturing additional market opportunities, especially by moving or developing products closer to the transaction.</p><p>And these are businesses that have an impressive financial record that we expect to continue going into the future. And then finally, we think that we have, as Marketplaces, an unfair competitive advantage by being part of the Schibsted family, both because it gives an opportunity to share learnings across the 3 markets, but also because we have our sister businesses within News Media and within NEXT. And one particular example that is relevant is the Blink example, which really exemplifies why we are at such an advantage as Marketplaces being part of the Schibsted family.</p><p>The situation in Norway today is that if a potential buyer is actively looking for a home, they will be on FINN after we're looking for a home to buy. But in some situations, people might be willing to buy or bid in a particular home if just the right opportunity came up. And in that case, we have the opportunity now to actually take a classifieds listing and distribute it onto the VG news portal.</p><p>And the way that we do this is that we collect a lot of data on FINN about what kind of users are likely to be interested in a particular property. We can share some of that data with VG, we have developed machine learning algorithms such as collaborative filtering that allows to be very targeted then in terms of which listings we expose to a user, primarily on VG. And this is, as far as I know kind of one-in-a-kind example of how a company or companies have been able to leverage both the strength of classifieds and the strength of the media business within their reach and frequency to create additional value both for users and customers.</p><p>So with that, I thank you. I'm super excited about the Nordic Marketplaces business. It's been a great ride so far, and I think we have a lot of opportunity for growth going forward.</p><p>Thank you. And with that, we'll open up for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Thank you, Anders. So we'll take a couple of questions. Anybody? Yes, Henriette, you want to start?</p><p>HENRIETTE TRONDSEN, RESEARCH ANALYST, ARCTIC SECURITIES AS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Henriette Trondsen, Arctic. First, can you give some color on the expected growth rate for Blocket going forward? And also, in the car vertical, given that almost all your car dealers are now back on the Blocket platform, have you kept prices to get them back from Wayke?</p><p>ANDERS SKOE: So starting with the first part of it. Our expectations regarding Blocket and their trajectory going forward, Blocket shall become a growth company again. But in terms of more specific guiding, I think I'll leave that to Trond, to maybe cover that later on. In terms of what we have done in order to bring the car dealers back onto the Blocket platform, I would say that the pricing has not been a key element of that. The key learning was actually then that you have to talk to and listen to your customers and make sure that you develop the features and the products that they need in order to be successful on your platform. So that has really been the key reason why we are now in a much better position than what we were about a year ago.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: I can add that on Blocket, we believe within reasonable time, that we should be able to reach high single-digit growth numbers. Okay, it was one in the back there with the beard, I think that was your turn now.</p><p>ANDREW GEOFFREY ROSS, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Absolutely. It's Andrew Ross from Barclays, 2 for me. You talked about the potential to consolidate in jobs in Sweden. Could you give us a sense as to what the environment is like in real estate? And whether you could overcome that perhaps to do anything? I know there's been a history there. Second question, in the release this morning, you talked about 8% to 12% growth in the mid- to long-term for Nordic Marketplaces. Can you give us a sense as to how much of that is from M&amp;A if any? And how much is organic?</p><p>ANDERS SKOE: So I'll take the second part of your question first. When it comes to guiding, I will leave those questions to Trond, so let's park that and we'll come back to that later. When it comes to M&amp;A within, I believe, your question was related to the real estate vertical within Sweden. Yes, as you alluded to, we've been through one such process, we are aware of what the situation is around Hemnet, but in terms of our specific strategy relating to that, it is not something I wish to comment on.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: We'll have one final question. I think it was one -- yes, you there in the front. No, sorry, it was this guy. I'm trying to take it by turn.</p><p>MARTIN STENSHALL, SENIOR ANALYST, DANSKE BANK MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Martin Stenshall, Danske. A follow-up question regarding Blocket. You mentioned this experiment of putting the listing price down to NOK 10 with very high growth in volume. Back in 2014, I believe, we saw this figure modeled in FINN. Why aren't you trying to do kind of the same thing? Putting it down to 0? Because we have seen a tremendous growth in listing synergy and it was very cool to in FINN because when you look at the numbers for the generalist verticals in Blocket it's kind of dropping quite a lot. So I was just trying to pick your brain on how aggressive measures you're planning to improve the growth in Blocket in general?</p><p>ANDERS SKOE: So you're absolutely right, FINN went to a premium model a few years ago, and then one interesting detail about that decision was that FINN went freemium overnight across all of its categories. And what happened then, as you described, was that we saw a tremendous increase in volume almost overnight, whereas demand did not follow quite the same trajectory. It took us over 1 to 2 years to be back at the same liquidity or affect levels following that decision. And we'd like to learn from that experience. I don't think the right model for Blocket would be to go freemium overnight. I think the right model for Blocket would be to evolve that listings model. And also see -- and also acknowledge that on Blocket today, there is actually a fairly high willingness to pay, and we would like to find models that allow us to capture that willingness to pay instead of going freemium and then creating a big hurdle for additional monetization on board. But the key -- I think the key point here is you want to take learnings from what happened at FINN and we will continue to experiment with various models with Blocket going forward.</p><p>MARTIN STENSHALL: Just a short question on the travel experimental that's in launch from FINN through Blocket, could you please give a bit more color on that, how you expect that to ramp-up? And to what extent is that actually contributing to the growth guidance you're giving, was it 8% to 12%?</p><p>ANDERS SKOE: So we will launch Blocket Resor as a travel vertical in Blocket this spring. Again, we have an experimental approach to this, and I think it would be just unprofessional on me to be very specific about how we expect that to evolve, but we do think it is a great way to capitalize on the strong Blocket brand, and also help solve more problems for more users in the Swedish market.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Okay. We are out of time, but since I've kind of ditched Silvia in the back, I'll give you a chance to ask your question.</p><p>SILVIA CUNEO, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Silvia Cuneo from Deutsche Bank. Just a few quick ones. On the guidance for the Marketplace business, you talked about top line growth, but nothing about margin. While you did give guidance, what you did in the times there, so can you comment on margin for the Nordic Marketplaces as well? And then second, on your idea to launching for Blocket a product to go into the actual transaction, just wondering why you think it's a good opportunity? And what would be the economics? And then if there is time just on the different packages you offer for your customers, how does the pricing change for premium products?</p><p>ANDERS SKOE: So the first part of your question, regarding guiding, again I think I'll give those questions to Trond, so you can follow up on those more realistically later on. I'm not sure I caught the nuances of your other 2 questions.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: No, I didn't catch them either actually. It was very difficult to hear.</p><p>SILVIA CUNEO: The second one was about entering the actual car transaction business.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Oh, the car transaction business.</p><p>SILVIA CUNEO: What would be the economical lift after the results of the macroeconomy?</p><p>ANDERS SKOE: Sure. I think the most interesting thing we're doing around the actual car transaction is in Blocket where today we have a partnership with DNB, which actually allows you to buy a used vehicle through the Blocket platform. It's a 1-click solution. You actually buy used vehicles. But I think that in terms of those type -- that type of opportunity, we are more likely to partner with other companies rather than develop that sort of solution from scratch ourselves.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Thank you, Anders. Sorry, we're kind of out of time so I have to cut you up there. Thank you. I'm sure there are a lot of more questions for Anders, but he'll be around for the break and for lunch, so please look him up. And then now, it's my great pleasure to introduce Siv, who will take us through the News Media business.</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>SIV JUVIK TVEITNES, EVP OF NEWS MEDIA, SCHIBSTED ASA: Thank you very much, Kristin. It is a pleasure to be here. And as we all know, the traditional media is in the middle of a digital transformation with huge changes in consumer behavior and business models. And the industry has been characterized by customers. In Schibsted, we have transformed our traditional media house to be world-class digital brands and positions in our market.</p><p>And we now have a much more optimistic view of the future. And as already Kristin mentioned, the need for quality journalism had never been greater, when world leaders and global giants create doubts about what is true and what is false, what is right, what is wrong. And we are very proud of the role we play by informing citizens in driving the societal debate and being a fundamental force of the democracy in our society.</p><p>And our value proposition is to be a leading provider of independent quality journalism. And we have had -- and our strategy has been digital first for years already, resulting in a strong news business that is very well digitally positioned for the future. We have just finalized a great 2018 with growth in revenue and with a very strong EBITDA of more than NOK 680 million. So news is big business for us.</p><p>So what is the highlight for the News Media? Our portfolio consists of trusted digital and iconic media brands. They are amongst the most famous brands in our markets. And as traditional media, we have a good grip on the digital transformation by growing our digital recurring revenues, having a tight cost control. And for many of our brands, we can see a pure digital profitability within reach.</p><p>We have also invested in common product and tech capabilities, giving us an efficient and rapid product development to provide excellent user experience. So we are a very natural part in the new Schibsted, leveraging rich and customer insights to further grow and build our digital business.</p><p>In Norway and Sweden, we have high Internet penetration, and everyone has a smartphone. We're also wealthy people. And historically, we happen to be the most newspaper-reading people in the world. And this combination is most likely the explanation of why the willingness to pay for news is highest in Norway, Sweden and Finland.</p><p>But our media brands itself has also been an important driver for this development. We have pioneered this market, and we are in the forefront developing the digital subscription model for news.</p><p>Our focused digital strategy for years has resulted in a good growth rate for our digital revenues, and at average, it has been 17% over the last 12 to 15 years, and the growth is accelerating. Both by that we're strengthening our digital positions, and thereby, we are an attractive advertising channel in a brand-safe environment and by accelerating the digital subscribers.</p><p>And the growth rate within the digital subscription is impressive for all our brands. And we now see that this revenue stream is as important as advertising.</p><p>In our portfolio, we have -- to simplify, we have 2 types of news businesses. We have the primary news destination and we have the premium subscription brands. And let me introduce you for VG. VG has the unrivaled #1 position in Norway. And this unique market position make VG the go-to destination when it comes to all parts of news in Norway. And the best way to demonstrate the strong position of VG is the extremely high direct traffic coming to VG. More than 90% of the traffic coming to VG is direct, and less than 3% comes from Facebook. And this is, by international comparison, very, very high.</p><p>Last year, VG reached a very important milestone by having more pure digital revenues than revenues coming from print. And in 2018, VG had more than NOK 1 billion in pure digital revenues. And we can clearly see a pure digital profitability within reach for VG, with no dependency to the print economy.</p><p>And the success of VG is a story about a news company that has dared to challenge itself, and that has invested in new technology long before it has been commoditized. VG had its first copy out in 1945 after the war, and already in 1995, VG had its first online edition.</p><p>In 2002, it was the peak year of the paper copies and that was 7 years after we have been -- we went online for the first time, and this story has continued.</p><p>And a very important part of VG's strategy has been to establish new business areas such as VG mobile and VG TV, as separate companies outside of VG to make sure that this initiatives gets focus and speed in the start. And it also demonstrates the way that we have disrupted ourselves within the news business.</p><p>Big news is big business for us, and that's why we love this guy so much. This is the most famous Norwegian these days, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and I think you have seen him with a lot of coverage in this country today as well.</p><p>And when he was appointed as the interim manager of Manchester United, the news was actually breaking in VG. Our colleague, Erik, he loves his work. He was searching and investigating, and suddenly he found this story at the Manchester United's web page, where it was not published yet, so he published it. And very shortly after, our Prime Minister in Norway was tweeting a congratulations to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on his new job. And Manchester United immediately contacted the secretary of our Prime Minister and asked her to remove her tweet, and she had to do so.</p><p>And shortly after, the story became official, and it exploded in news media and in social media all over the world. And it has, of course, been one of the most important news stories for VG for the last month. And VG, when they cover these kinds of story, they cover it 360 degrees. Of course, being present in all their own channels, but also using Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, podcasts, because we really must be present with content tailored to the different audiences in different channels, even though our direct traffic is more than 90%.</p><p>And this is, in many ways, a good story, but this is still just an example of how VG discover and cover big news event and keep up their position as the unrivaled #1 position in Norway.</p><p>So being an early adopter and having a very clear digital strategy has given VG very good financial results. Last year, the digital growth rate was at 80%, driven by both online advertising and digital subscription revenues. And VG had a very strong EBITDA margin of 80% last year.</p><p>Moving over to Sweden, we have Aftonbladet. And Aftonbladet has the same history of early adoption and a digital first strategy, and has the #1 position in the Swedish market with almost as high traffic as VG.</p><p>And Aftonbladet has also, the majority of its revenue coming from the digital. Aftonbladet also sees growth in the digital revenues and the digital subscription revenue is becoming a more important part of the total revenue base. But as advertising was a bit slower in Sweden last year, that was also mentioned by Anders when [he] presented Blocket, and this has affected the EBITDA margin in 2018. However, Aftonbladet is in the middle of a digital transformation and have a very strong performance in the Swedish market</p><p>with both a high EBITDA margin and a high profitability, and it really confirms the strong position that Aftonbladet has in Sweden.</p><p>The rest of our portfolio is what we call premium subscription brand. And that's newspaper that have historically delivered home to our doors in the morning and that is high-quality content newspaper with a long history and a very proud culture. And these papers are also on their digital journey where the online recurring revenues is growing and are becoming a significant part of the revenue base.</p><p>In Norway, we have a clear #1 position with Aftenposten. In Sweden, we have a strong #2 position with Svenska Dagbladet. And in Norway, we also have 3 regional papers along the coast in Norway where they have a very clear #1 position in their local markets. And these newspapers -- and the business model for these newspaper have totally changed for the last 10 to 12 years.</p><p>And let me illustrate that with Aftenposten. 10 to 12 years ago, Aftenposten had a 70% of the revenues from advertising and 30% from the subscription. And today, this has turned around. So now 80% of the revenues are coming from the subscription base and with the digital part growing nearly 40% year by year. And all the digital subscription brand see the same trend.</p><p>And there is also 2 milestones or 2 highlights I would like to mention when it comes to these papers. For Aftenposten and Bergens Tidende, today, they have more pure digital subscribers than offline subscriber, which is a big milestone. And for all these newspapers together, they have an all-time high of paying customer due to the very good growth we have seen in the digital subscription, which is impressive. And this is not really what we just predicted a few years ago because the print revenues continued to decline.</p><p>However, our premium subscription brand has been able to deliver a good and stable EBITDA margin due to very tight cost control. All of the media operation has been streamlined and we have been building -- and we have been taking out the synergies by building common functions.</p><p>A key learning in building up the digital subscription model is that it is quality journalism that converts paying customers. And we have many examples. Here are 2 that have been converting thousands of paying customers. And a key learning in this is that it is a story that makes engagement, that is enlightening, and that is quality journalism that converts to paying customers.</p><p>Providing the best user experience is also a prerequisite to sustaining the digital #1 position for our news brand, and we have invested in product and tech capabilities. And we now have a standardized tech stack and a common product and tech organization across all these brands, and the aim is to build scale and work with product innovation in a cost-efficient way. And one example is the way we have been working with our new live studio that we have built, that we use for big news events and breaking news and has been a very important part of VG's coverage of the Ski World Cup that was finalized a few days ago in Austria. And this feature was built in one of our smaller newspapers, then it has been -- and step-by-step, it has been scaled and it is now used by all our publication. And this is the way of how we can build scale in efficient ways.</p><p>We also -- another example is our state-of-the-art content management system that we have built ourselves. And our journalists have, as far as we know, the best available tool to produce and to distribute digital journalistic content.</p><p>Product and tech capability has also been very important in the way we have succeeded with our advertising strategy. We sell inventory targeting across all Schibsted brands, also included marketplaces based on common Schibsted data. And Anders already explained you about the Blink product where we use the listing from VG and use the targeting advertising tool that we had on VG to create a great marketing and advertising product. And behind this is a shared advertising technology used by a common sales force. So in this way, we utilize the best from 2 worlds. We develop the technology centrally and together and then we use it by our local sales force that sell our inventory across all our brands.</p><p>The last product in tech feature I would like to mention is one that we also find very promising. Recently, Aftenposten switched to an automated and personalized front page to all its digital users. And this is a big milestone. And it is a very important feature of how we can provide a better user experience to provide a more relevant content to all of our users. And the way this work is that the model uses data from individual reading history combined with an editorial criteria and thereby, we present a personal front page. And this is still in a very early stage. But the result is promising and we see already a documented higher engagement with this kind of technology. And we will now rollout this technology to all our sites.</p><p>So we have digitalized our business in a very good way. In looking into the future, we also see future growth opportunities. We have already talked about the digital subscription and the impressive growth rate that they have had for the last year. And currently, the growth have been coming from increasing the value to recruit new customers. At some time, this will flatten out. But there is still a potential to developing the ARPU through a deeper and more extensive subscription relationship with all our user. And we will look into bundling the product development and pricing. So here, it is still a big potential.</p><p>Advertising will continue to grow and we still see a big potential in native advertising. And using data in a smarter way, we will be able to create better advertising products. We also believe that the trust and the brand-safe environment that we represent will be important in the future advertising industry.</p><p>We can also see a future potential in the voice and video. The voice is a very premature stage. But it will be interesting to following the changes in the traditional TV viewing and how that will affect the TV money. And with -- part of that will move to be digitally and we have already a very strong digital position with very good data-driven products. So this can be an interesting opportunity for us.</p><p>So to sum up. The News Media consists of trusted, digital, iconic brands that is managing the digital transformation in a very good way by increasing the online recurring revenues, having -- and having tight cost control and by investing in product and tech capabilities, making us able to deliver scalable product in a cost-efficient way. And this is confirming our position in Schibsted leveraging reach and customer insights to further grow the digital business of Schibsted.</p><p>The last thing I will mention is that the News Media has also been instrumental in building up many of our digital services. And you will later today hear about Lendo, the very successful story of Lendo. And the growth of Lendo has been accelerating also by Aftonbladet, the #1 acquisition in Sweden with very high traffic and using this as a marketing tool together with Blocket -- with the integration of Blocket has been an important part of that story. And Raoul and Dan will come back to that later.</p><p>Yes, that's for me. We are ready for...</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Great. Then we have time for a couple of questions for Siv as well before we go for a break. Anybody? Yes?</p><p>MARTIN STENSHALL: Siv, Martin Stenshall, Danske. Just a question regarding the Aftonbladet and VG. There's quite a difference in growth in online between the 2 papers. And obviously, advertising could be one reason for that. But is it one of the only reason or is that the only reason that the Swedish advertising market is softer than the Norwegian market?</p><p>SIV JUVIK TVEITNES: Yes. I think that's the main -- thank you for the good question. I think that's the main explanation. What we have also seen, the way VG has working with the digital subscription model is a bit more mature than Aftonbladet. But in a very short time, we will rebrand the Aftonbladet+, which is the digital subscription model for Aftonbladet. So we have been putting a lot of work into that, and we will rebrand that very shortly. And hopefully that will give us good revenue growth also when it comes to the digital revenue growth.</p><p>MARTIN STENSHALL: And you also mentioned selective Nordic M&amp;A. So what kind of M&amp;As would be attractive for you?</p><p>SIV JUVIK TVEITNES: Well, as I said in my presentation, the News Media is not the most obvious area of acquisitions for us. But there could be some select opportunities to make sure that we fulfill an even better ecosystem that could make sense to pursue. So I think that's where we are on that one.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Anybody else? Yes, in the middle there? She's coming the other way.</p><p>MARCUS DIEBEL, RESEARCH ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Marcus Diebel, JPMorgan. Two questions. Again a very impressive performance in online as you said. I have one question with regarding on pricing. And when I look at other publishers, the German publishers, there seems to be still a large gap between pricing in online and offline. Could you comment a little bit more how that has developed? And maybe the second question, related to that. If we look a bit more into the future, given the strong -- or the strength of the brands, we might see that these papers become very strong online-only businesses in the future. Do you feel that in terms of your cost base then, you would be able to sustain the quality, the editorials as they are now on an online-only business model in the far future?</p><p>SIV JUVIK TVEITNES: Yes. So let me start with the first one, which is the pricing opportunities. And I think we are on the very early age of how we can experiment with pricing when it comes to the digital subscription revenues. And I think there are various ways that we can increase the ARPU going forward. And I think an interesting case to look at is for example in New York Times and the way that they have presented their financial results in 2018. Because now, more than 50% of the digital growth is coming outside the core news product, and their ability to build different products and services around the digital subscription is very interesting for us and we are already experimenting with that in some of our smaller newspaper to see if we find model that is scalable. And the other question was -- can you...</p><p>MARCUS DIEBEL: Just in the future, if these brands potentially become online-only business models, do you believe that then the cost base part of the revenue opportunity will be enough to cover the cost base to also make sure the quality will continue to be as strong as it is today?</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: I think the way we have developed show that we can deliver on that, and the way we have been working with our cost base, yes. I think -- I tend to think of this, I often use this analogy about the movies and the popcorn, that cinemas don't make enough money from showing the movie, but they make quite a lot of money from selling popcorn and other things. And we make -- we need to do the same thing. I mean, we have the movie, right, in our editorial content and we need to get better at selling popcorn. And I think having very strong digital subscriber bases is a very good foundation for finding some of that popcorn in my analogy. And of course, at some point, but further down the road than we expected, we will not have the printing cost anymore. We will see what happens to distribution. We might be able to build that so strong based on other things that we might keep it, we'll have to see how that evolves. But the idea is that we have to make sustainable systems in the digital world so that, that business can live on its own and ensure enough editorial quality going forward. That's definitely our objective.</p><p>SIV JUVIK TVEITNES: And I think an also interesting note on this for many of our newspaper, we can see a pure digital profitability within reach. It's not like it was a few years ago that, that was impossible to understand how we will be there. So the follow of our brands, we are not...</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: And that's a positive note. So now we stop there and we take a break. And please be disciplined and be back at 10:55 please. And then we'll continue with NEXT.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>RAOUL GR\u00c3\u00bcNTHAL, EXECUTIVE VP OF NEXT &amp; COUNTRY MANAGER - SWEDEN, SCHIBSTED ASA: So welcome back. My name is Raoul Gr\u00c3\u00bcnthal and I'm not only next, I'm also heading NEXT, business area, NEXT. Very funny. And I will together with my friend, Dan Ouchterlony, talk to you a little bit about growth and financial services.</p><p>Let me begin with what Kristin said this morning. Kristin, you alluded to the fact that different parts of Schibsted together form a great foundation for growth. And our job within my team, the NEXT team, is to help great entrepreneurs and to find great products in order to really unleash that possibility of growth. Because if you look at Schibsted from an entrepreneur's point of view, it's quite interesting. Imagine that you could get access to the enormous marketing power that Siv just told us about. Imagine that you could get access to the marketing power and the conversion engine of marketplaces that Anders told us about before. And imagine also that you could get access to Schibsted's organization, the power of this organization and also all the knowledge of this organization. Of course, this would be very powerful for an entrepreneur with very limited resources. And I think that if I were an entrepreneur, I would look at Schibsted as a very interesting partner.</p><p>This is exactly what we do. We partner up with entrepreneurs. We connect the power of Schibsted to some of the greatest entrepreneurs in order to create value. We have the historical track record of incubating growth businesses. Since the acquisition of Blocket in 2003, ventures has been a method for us in order to take Schibsted to next level.</p><p>But mind you, we are not a venture founder. I wouldn't even describe us as a traditional corporate venture business. We are actually industrialists, using some of the tools and the methods of venture capitalists in order to continuously build a strong digital company as Schibsted. Sometimes, we enter business -- new business that may look different. We have done this with Financial Services, and now we are doing it with eHealth, but we always focus on strategic fit with Schibsted and we are always guided by Schibsted's overall mission.</p><p>So our basic idea is quite simple. We find great entrepreneurs with a great idea for great products. We create an environment where these entrepreneurs can prosper. When we are at our best, we manage to give them the power of a large media group that will let them be entrepreneurs, they can still build upon their culture, they don't really need to become one of us day one, and that's extremely important.</p><p>The perfect match most of the time is when we are able to acquire a company which is not really at its starting point. The best -- because we are not really a seed investor. The best match is when we find a company which has perhaps great products which is already proven, but still needs lots of marketing to gain a strong market share and perhaps it's also at the beginning of its monetization because that's where we can really help with the strong marketing power and help of monetization. So in these cases, we can really become kind of kingmaker, and we have done that several times.</p><p>And of course, if we succeed in building a strong position on our home market, then we export the concept to other countries like we have done already with Blocket, we are doing it with Lendo and we are starting to do it with Prisjakt. Yes, we have done this historically and we will do it again.</p><p>The first concept once again was Blocket. But we are not the one-hit wonder. We have, as you know, initiated Lendo and its expansion abroad. And our vision is to create new home runs later on. Prisjakt could be one of them, I will come back to that later on.</p><p>We're quite confident because we think that we have found so to say, modus operandi that really works. And it's all about capitalizing on the digital ecosystem that we have built in our home markets, the Nordic countries. And I think that Kristin earlier explained that in a quite good way how it works. But let me do that again. It works a little bit on 3 different levels. First of all, we have the massive traffic created not only by Siv and the News Media, but very much by the news medias, and that, of course, creates a huge opportunity to get display advertising for these new companies in a disproportionate way, I would say. That, of course, is very important for their brand building. But it's not only about digital advertising.</p><p>Most of the time, the integrations are even more important. Let's take Lendo as an example. Of course, Aftonbladet, as Siv said before, is very important to build the brand Lendo. But even more important is perhaps the integration of Lendo in Blocket. So for instance, if you buy a car in Blocket, you get an advertising where you are -- where you can make -- take a loan from Lendo and that of course create conversions that have huge value for Lendo. That's the integrations and the traffic.</p><p>And there's a third dimension, which is perhaps a little bit of an early stage, yes, but that really could be extremely interesting is about data. Anders mentioned an example earlier on which is Blink and I think that we'll have more and more good examples of how we use data across the group. And of course the great thing with data, is compared to display advertising, you just have one display advertising, then it's gone. But with data, you can reuse it. It's an infinite value.</p><p>Yes. And of course, our digital ecosystem is our main asset. And many of the great companies we have built have been built on that ecosystem. But we are also, with our position in Norway and Sweden, a company with different kind of infrastructures that are really interesting.</p><p>Let me just mention one that could be a start of new ecosystem, and actually already is, distribution. In Norway, we have a huge distribution power, and we have used that in order to create new companies and for instance, we have helthjem, which is a company that is expanding at a very high pace right now. And what it does is really that it's built upon the explosion of e-commerce.</p><p>And at the same time as the national post company is having trouble and perhaps is getting out there more and more seldom to the households, we still dominate the last miles, all the households in Norway. That really creates a very, very interesting position and I think that it could be one of our most interesting points of expansion in the coming years.</p><p>So all in all, we have, I would say, solid and diversified portfolio of ventures. The common denominator is that all these companies have synergies with other Schibsted assets. And we are happy to invest in different kind of verticals. It may be verticals or industries where we already have some important assets like Marketplaces or Financial Services or it may be emerging verticals like eHealth where we just made a new acquisition early this week, called Add Health Media. It's a small acquisition, but extremely -- I'm extremely excited about it. It's a very, very interesting small company. Sometimes, quite often actually, we want the majority because we think it's strategically very interesting, but sometimes we can also be happy with a minority stake.</p><p>We've already mentioned Prisjakt several times and there's a good reason for that, because it's a very exciting company. Prisjakt is our price comparison product. Or rather, I would call it our pre-shopping service because it's not only about price comparison, it's about all the information you need before you make a decision to buy something. But Prisjakt is not only a great product, it's also a company with margins, as you can see, around 30% and it has also double digit growth. The last 2 years, it has been around 20%. Right now, Prisjakt has a very strong position in Norway and Sweden. It's present in many different countries, but we have not really put much marketing into it yet. We're waiting for getting the traction and we'll see. I hope that we will be able to find some new markets with Prisjakt where to expand. And actually, you could try it. We are here in the U.K., it's called PriceSpy. So if you want to use the product, you can do that. It's great. I would really say that it's one of the best products in this price comparison industry in Europe.</p><p>Okay. In order to find the next new thing, we must, of course, make many bets. But we are still very selective and disciplined when it comes to investing in startups. We never compromise on the fact that we invest in companies with outstanding entrepreneurs and also that we invest in companies where we can find clear synergies with Schibsted. Also, we have so far avoided to taking too large risks when starting expanding abroad. So we are a bit cautious even if we -- of course, when we see that we get traction, put a lot of money into it.</p><p>And this has so far at least proven to be successful. The annual internal rate of return, the last 13 years, has actually been around 30%. And that does not include the Blocket investment, mind you. Of course, this is in many ways, thanks to home runs like Prisjakt or Lendo. But it's important to note that it's always, thanks to the fact that the losses we've made and we have of course, we have made some losses, this is venture business, are quite limited on the downside. As Ole Jacob pointed out before, it's all right to make losses of million if you can make gains of billions and that's in turn a little bit of what we're trying to do. So cut our losses and let our profits grow.</p><p>There are, as with other business area, many different ways of growing. Monetization and product development goes, of course, for every of our company. But also, we are continuing to invest in new ventures and we will further on.</p><p>I did not mention M&amp;A. Of course, that is perhaps not the most obvious thing for our business area, but I think later on as some of our businesses become more mature, M&amp;A may become a way of growing as well. And of course, geographical expansion, and I mentioned it with Lendo and Prisjakt. Of course, our ambition is to find new companies as well to expand abroad.</p><p>So to conclude, we have a proven ability to incubate future market leaders. We've done several times already. We have robust investment track record with a rate of return that is far above the industry average. We have some proven scalable platforms for international growth and we would like to have even a few more. And we have found a way of working where we can combine entrepreneurial spirit with the strength of the Schibsted platform. And that is something that many other media groups are trying to do, but it is actually quite difficult to manage to do it, and we have succeeded. But I think that our best showcase right now is probably our financial services business. And Dan Ouchterlony, who is leading this business, will now make a deep dive into this. So please, Dan, take it away.</p><p>DAN OUCHTERLONY, INVESTMENT AND BUSINESS AREA MANAGER, SCHIBSTED GROWTH: Thank you. Hi. Is the mic working? Yes. Pleasure to be here. It's been 15 years with Schibsted. I'm really excited to be presenting today. I'm excited because I'm going to talk about something I think is really interesting, which is what Schibsted has done in FinTech for the last decade.</p><p>We invested in Lendo about 10 years ago. And today, Lendo and 8 other assets has made up a new business unit. We already have some good numbers in the unit, over NOK 1 billion in revenue. I'm going to change the slide. Good margins, some really interesting established #1 positions and also some interesting growth options. So this is going to be an exciting ride.</p><p>I'm also proud of our partners. We have over 100 partners, banks, insurance companies. We love them. I think they love us back. At least they pay us. We have users, I mean, and they love us because they get true value from using our products. So with this in mind, I'm going to go through some of the highlights of financial services. First of all, we're taking advantage of the massive change happening in financial services overall. I mean, you know this. You're in the middle of it. It's not perhaps as massive as media, but it's getting there and all of that change is giving opportunities to focus players like ourselves, we like that.</p><p>Second, we think Lendo is in and of itself a highlight, and I'm going to talk about Lendo in detail in a minute.</p><p>Third, Lendo is not everything. There's other stuff in there which we think is perhaps just as exciting, but sort of in an earlier stage of development. So we'll get into a couple of case examples.</p><p>And last but not least, the Schibsted platform again gives us rich scale and access to some great people that we can leverage just right out the door.</p><p>So getting into the meat of the matter. Lendo. I'm going to start by showing you actually a movie. It's a TV commercial from the Swedish market. We put some English voiceover on it on the video, so you can sort of understand it and it really tries to get you in the shoes of the consumer using Lendo. Please play the video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>DAN OUCHTERLONY: Right. So comparing loans is not that new, is it? Well, we think we do it in a new way, and that's the interesting part. We take something that's supposed to be easy, comparing products, the rational consumer, you read about it in your textbooks. But it's hard. In financial services, it's hard, and we do it in a beautiful, delightful product that the users can really have an advantage versus quite complex marketplace.</p><p>The banks like us too because they get eager customers from the platform. They lower their onboarding costs and they only pay us once they get customers. The way we do it underneath the hood is to use quite a few different sources of data, integrating all of that into one beautiful product. It's consumer data, tax data, credit report data, all the regulatory data you need, AML, KYC, CFT, all these words. All that data is accessible in real-time on our APIs for our banking partners to submit bids. So they get the data, they look at the data, submit bids back to the platform and the user gets the offers in real-time in their inbox, it's a beautiful list view and they can in their due time, select whichever offer they think is the best, usually it's price, but not always actually.</p><p>That user is then transported to our banking partners and they get [productive] customer, they know everything about that customer already, they trust us to do that part of the process and they can just close the deal and get the new customer. We get the revenue once the deal is closed, about 5% of the loan value.</p><p>So is this working for consumers? We're tracking that quite often and quite in detail because it's our promise to empower people, that's the Schibsted promise. And there is some data I can share with you. We're giving users, on average, 6 offers. On average, the spread between the best and the worst offer is 10 percentage points interest rate. And since you all know your math, you know that's quite a big difference between the best and the worst offer. And if you're a random consumer on the street walking into bank asking for a loan, you could end up anywhere on that scale, basically. So we're proud of that part that really deliver value to our users.</p><p>So getting into a bit more detail on the NEXT part. We do think this is probably the leading consumer lending broker in Europe. Our arguments, we're #1 in a couple of really interesting markets, Sweden and Norway. We are #2 in Finland. We're just launching -- actually yesterday, we opened up Poland. We opened up Denmark and Austria earlier this year. So we're starting to expand. The business model is a digital native, so it's scalable. And we're starting to see that is building network effects. That's something quite interesting because it gives us that economic moat. That's important when competitors will start to come to the market. If we dig in a little bit to the underlying business of loans, these are some facts of our home markets.</p><p>I'm going to summarize. The Swedish market has grown quite steadily. It's the largest market, both for us and for loans. Sweden has been under regulation from the Swedish FSA for a number of years and under former license since 2015. I think this is a good thing because this eliminates bad actors and cleans up the marketplace. Because in Norway, explosive growth, some of you Norwegians know that, the market has grown radically, and this growth has actually moved Norway, in our view, into a more normal situation compared to the rest of Scandinavia and Europe because Norway used to be a credit card market and now it's a more balanced market between cards and loans. But, of course, this growth has attracted a lot of attention from competitors. Not all of them are as serious as one would like and also the regulator. So now growth is definitely slowing down as the regulator is moving in and trying to put some restrictions on that. Overall, we're definitely confident on the growth long term of Norway. We see some early signs of that and we have some really interesting measures being taken by the FSA and the players in the market themselves.</p><p>Last but not least, Finland, interesting market, more erratic growth which we are being a part of. We are building Lendo in Finland and we're quite confident long term that Finland will follow, develop and mature. On our positions in the market, we are #1 in Sweden by a wide margin. Just a note, there's no official statistics on loan brokerage market shares. There's no report you can buy. So this is our internal analysis. We're confident that in Sweden, we are the #1 and we're pretty sure that we are #1 by a wide margin. And we think we're growing the margin to #2. Norway, we're also #1. In the current flat market, I'm pretty sure that we're maintaining our market share and we're building the fort to keep growing when the market gets back to growth. That's the situation there.</p><p>We see some early signs of consolidation. The Norwegian market has been perhaps too bullish in terms of new actors coming in. But I just want to say, from a user perspective, there's still quite a bit of credit card debt that needs or should at least be refinanced to loans and comparing loans once every year or every second year is still a very smart thing to do if you're a consumer even though the overall loan market is not growing. Finland, we're #2. We're confident that we're growing faster than #1 and we're investing. We know that Lendo is a bit of a J curve business model.</p><p>I was talking about network effects earlier, so we believe it's worth to invest to it.</p><p>A bit more on detail of the J curve of Lendo, the network effects. It's all about spinning this flywheel of reinforcing positive network effects. As users come to the platform, banks come to the platform to get users. That's pretty natural. The second step is that as more banks come to the platform, the users can expect to get better offers on average. They are more likely to get approved, they're more likely to get good interest rates with good terms for that loan. And in the end, they're more likely to get the full amount they would like to get for the loan. That, in turn, improves the satisfaction of the user which, of course, spreads positive word that brings more users to the platform. So we see our job is to spin this flywheel of network effects and growth. And as you know, we do the marketing. We do more marketing in different segments. We do it by on-boarding more partners to get that competition going on the platform. We do it by developing the product, reducing friction for our users and for our partners, so that the marketplace liquidity increases and then back to more marketing. So that's how we grow and build the moat versus competition.</p><p>A further note on the partners of Lendo. We're proud of that. This is the panels of Sweden and Norway. And these are small, large, aggressive, not so aggressive banks. But they all are part of the Lendo community. And we have a quite intimate relationship with them because we're integrated into their processes. When we started, we used to receive offers by fax, 2009, remember? Now it's real-time APIs, data, the whole works.</p><p>Important note. We don't want to be dependent on one single partner because that would reduce competition in the platform and as is on the previous slide, reduce the likelihood of getting one good offer to the consumer in the end. So we try to keep #1 partner quite low. That competition is good for us. It's good for the consumer, and we also believe it's actually good for the banks because they will use Lendo to benchmark their own offers and improve their processes.</p><p>Just a quick note on the financials. It's been a good development, good growth, good margins. You can see the margins are going a little bit down last year. That's because we're investing in nationalization. Most of the profits are actually converted to cash. There's just a little bit of CapEx man-hours to develop the platform and a little bit of receivables that grow as the overall volume grow. That's a pretty good number in terms of converting to cash.</p><p>So with all this in mind, what would we do? Well, of course, we're Schibsted, there's some Viking blood in there, some history. We're going to go and try to make this international.</p><p>Norway was the first thing we did for Lendo. 2012, it took 2 years until breakeven. The second year of operation, we turned over NOK 50 million. So this is roughly what we're planning to do in the next set of countries. Our plan is to do breakeven within 3 to 4 years, and we're looking at Denmark, Austria and Poland. And this is one place where I'm really, really happy to be part of Schibsted. I mean, we have people that has done this before, not in terms of Lendo, but in terms of going abroad, entering new markets. What you look for when looking for markets. How does it actually work? I mean, Rolv Erik used to be my boss back in the day. I can call you. How does it work in country X? We're actually now partnering up with Willhaben in Austria. I think that's going to be a good partnership, looking forward to build on that.</p><p>We're going to follow these companies, look at the KPIs. We're not going to go with the 18-month plan and follow that one slavishly. We're going to go where we find traction. What we said is that for this year, we're investing NOK 7,200,000 in the rollout for these 3 countries. So that's the ambition level that what we're trying to achieve. We're also looking at new countries, of course, larger countries, countries outside Europe, et cetera. This is the plan we're executing on at the moment. And so far, I think we learned a lot.</p><p>Most importantly, we're looking for markets where this massive change that you know is happening in financial services, where that is seen, and where we can touch and feel that change and see that banks and consumers already get on to real-time platform for loans.</p><p>Denmark, we're not the first, but the low-key competition is something we think we can handle. In Austria and Poland, we believe we're pioneering this kind of low marketplace.</p><p>So taking a step back zooming out financial services. It's a little bit more than Lendo. I'll try to give you a bit of flavor before we close up.</p><p>When we entered financial services, we came in as a media company 10 years ago. We pioneered that aggregation comparison layer on top of the established providers. That was our first step in. Today, we're doing that and developing that, and that's our perhaps most interesting asset in the short to medium term. Today, we're moving into layer below, which is the actual provider layer. This is where we're investing in new ventures that actually provide the products themselves. So it's a slightly different approach, but it's still within the frame of financial services.</p><p>I just want to give a special mention to Bynk here. It's a new bank, much like Afton or Starling. It's founded by the same team that founded Lendo. A company that was founded in 2016. Excellent growth. It has NOK 1 billion in loans to consumers. We just closed the big round with them. It's a super interesting venture. Another case, example I want to bring up is Hypoteket. It means mortgage in Sweden, Swedish, basically. It's a model where we can deliver digital mortgages to consumers without being a bank ourselves. It's a super innovative model where we can use new regulation and new technology to basically shortcut mortgage value chain and connect asset managers, pension funds and consumers directly. Early venture launched in March last year, we just passed NOK 2.5 billion lent to consumers.</p><p>So this is the overall financial development over the last 10 years for these assets. As you can see, it's been consistent profitable growth. Margins have developed nicely as well. So this is quite inspiring, most of it scary because now we have to work super hard to keep that growth going. We're not out of options for growth. I think there's more options than there's people and energy at the moment. So that's a good thing.</p><p>So what we're trying to do is trying to focus. Right now, we're focusing on these 4 areas. First is winning Scandinavia with Lendo and the other concepts that I mentioned. That is perhaps in the short term, the most important growth driver. Second, we're doing a lot of product development. I mentioned a couple of new ventures, but also things like Lendo for small businesses. It's Lendo, but for small business loans. Why it shouldn't it work? We see that explosion of start-ups in that space, and we're giving them the place to find their customers on the Lendo platform. Third, new investments in M&amp;A. We're going to selectively look at M&amp;A to accelerate growth. It's not going to be a core focus, but we're going to keep eyes open. New ventures, we're definitely investing in new start-ups, new interesting products that we could bring into the Schibsted platform.</p><p>Last, but not least I mentioned geographic expansion for Lendo, super important. Three countries for this year, and who knows what's for next year?</p><p>So I'm going to sum up and say a couple of things, the highlights, again. First, financial services is a really, really exciting place to be for Schibsted. Two, the portfolio is really well positioned, both for the short term with Lendo, medium term, also for the long term with our world cases that I gave a few examples on. We believe Schibsted is a great owner and driver of these assets based on the synergies that we go through, but also with the mindset of going abroad and finding new growth. So that said, I'm going to close off. I think we have time for a few questions. And Raoul?</p><p>RAOUL GR\u00c3\u00bcNTHAL: Do we have time?</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Yes, we have 4 or 5 minutes.</p><p>RAOUL GR\u00c3\u00bcNTHAL: 4 or 5 minutes. Of course, we are a little bit over, I think, but...</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Five minutes.</p><p>RAOUL GR\u00c3\u00bcNTHAL: Okay, great. Yes?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You showed us this great growth with capital investments and the IRR for the portfolio. But would you be able to give us some take on the, let's say, success rate, whichever rate? How many assets have you closed down, let's say, over the past 5 years?</p><p>RAOUL GR\u00c3\u00bcNTHAL: I don't have the figures how many we have closed down. But as I said we have quite decent figures regarding our annual return. And I would say that because we had closed down things and -- but I don't have -- really have those figures. But I think that as we are not entering companies at a very, very early stage, I think that perhaps the rate of failures is perhaps a little bit lower that you could expect, perhaps. So it's -- we have been -- I think that annual returns have been good. I also think that the number of failures have been perhaps limited.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. Thank you. And maybe a question for you, Dan. Now with the financial expansion of Lendo, what do see as the most critical factors to succeed? What are the greatest risks you see?</p><p>DAN OUCHTERLONY: Yes. So success factors, I mean that's -- the key KPI we're looking for in the early stages is the number of people actually finding the platform and submitting an application to get a good comparison going. So that's the #1 factor. I guess underlying that factor is the number of banks we've signed up and the quality of those banks. I mean, we're nothing without our partners. We're a platform in the end. So those are probably 2 first. So we're looking for countries where we see users that are ready to start -- to handle their loans in this kind of more digital and perhaps more active way. And we see banks that are ready to integrate to real-time platform. I mean, not all banks, unfortunately, are ready to do that or perhaps willing. So we're looking to banks that perhaps we have a relationship already. So in Scandinavia, you mentioned, Christian, they look to us and say, \"Tell us what's happening in Scandinavia.\" We get meetings with banks when we go out to say, \"Can you just tell us what's happening? It's an interesting market. What can we learn?\" Well, our answer is get on the Lendo platform. That will automatically improve your processes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So the 5% take rate for Lendo, how's that calculated? Like who takes the hit there? Is that coming out of the bank's pocket or from the consumer? And if it's the latter, then how do you actually cement your sort of position within the process? So what's to stop consumers from finding the cheapest option, going straight to the banks, and so stopping your position to monetize the product?</p><p>DAN OUCHTERLONY: Yes, it's a good question. I mean, just first, the commission comes from the bank, period. There's no user payment upfront on the platform, zero. And you could say, \"Well isn't the bank raising prices to sort of capture the commission of the Lendo platform?\" And yes, perhaps there's some element of that happening. On the other hand, we believe that if you're a bank paying around -- I mean, it's -- first of all, it's varying across markets and it's varying across time, roughly 5%. But if you're a bank, 5% is a pretty good price for a signed preinvested customer with almost no OpEx for the bank. So that's sort of how we argue versus the bank to actually pay that kind of commission. If they would go and get customers in other channels, they would pay the TV and the SEM and whatever to get that bank or perhaps they're doing print ads. We think Lendo is more efficient way.</p><p>RAOUL GR\u00c3\u00bcNTHAL: We have time for one more, for one last.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Maybe one.</p><p>RAOUL GR\u00c3\u00bcNTHAL: Maybe one, a short one.</p><p>RAOUL GR\u00c3\u00bcNTHAL: A short one, is there one short...?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes. We learned so far that in Scandinavia new launches will benefit from the business that we have there, the publishing business, the established digital side. Don't necessarily have this in the new markets that you launched. Why are you so optimistic? Is it really the much better algorithm, the better product? Or is it really simply there's no meaningful player yet in those markets?</p><p>DAN OUCHTERLONY: Well, I would say that perhaps you would also say it because where we are really optimistic is about financial services for a bunch of reasons, I would say. So I think many of these financial services, this wave of products coming out is perhaps at the same level as classifieds 10 years ago. This is sort of on a high level. So there's an element of us being early and being good at what we do just because we have done it a little bit ahead of the other guys. I mean we see markets in Europe starting to develop local champions. So that's definitely one element. We're just early, and we think we have a good product. The second element is, I guess, the DNA and the skills that we've built in Schibsted, that we have that experience of rolling out products to new markets. With Blocket, that was a great concept in Sweden. We took it out into Europe without support of huge media companies. And I think that's some of what we're trying to do again with, of course, from some learnings from that journey. And I guess the last point is, when you look to these markets, we're not saying we're never going to partner up. So perhaps, we will see a partnership in the local market going forward. Perhaps, it's a partnership in the big market where we're going to sort of balance the risk. So that's definitely on the table. But right now, we're just trying to work really hard to prove that we can roll out Lendo stand-alone. Okay, over to you, Kristin.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Thank you. Thank you very much. And then we have last but absolutely not least, we have Trond, he will go through the financials. There will be another Q&amp;A after that before we wrap it up. So please, Trond.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>TROND BERGER, CFO &amp; EXECUTIVE VP, SCHIBSTED ASA: Thank you, Kristin.</p><p>Schibsted has proven a superior return to shareholders. If you look at the last 10 years, we have gone from around 50 up to about 300 in share price. There are these some key events in this period. First of all, Schibsted has been a growth company, investing organically M&amp;As. And we did that, of course, up to then 2011, '12, '13. Then we realized that we're ending up in a spending war with large competitors. Then we understood that in order to be able to have strength in this situation, you need a strong balance sheet. So what we did was actually that we teamed up with Telenor, created a JV. That actually gave us confidence in the negotiations that we later ended up with investors. And then we could actually do, so to say, in-market consolidation without having access to capital because that would mean it didn't have to be capital. But this just demonstrates the importance of being in a position to further give you consolidation and growth. And that was actually very quite value-accretive. And then, of course, we have continued to invest, and now we have decided to split the company and spin-off Adevinta and create 2 strong growth companies. So that's the journey. That has proven to be successful.</p><p>And looking at just the split of the P&amp;L and revenue. I think that for this, our figures just for Schibsted, excluding Adevinta. We have been able to manage the downturn, especially in the print, increasing the same time digital revenues. We have invested in new growth that then -- yes, in financial services, as an example. And at the same time, we also have been able to then develop the marketplace business in the Nordics. So it has been a growth in EBITDA. And at the same time, managing this digital transformation. So we are quite happy about that. If you have our scores 3, 4 years ago, we foresaw a more weak outlook, especially in the news part. But that has not been the case. So I think we're happy with what we have achieved.</p><p>And if we now look into the key figures again, I think that we will continue to do some investments. It will be a disciplined investments. It will first of all be within financial services. It will be adjacent businesses. And we will do some M&amp;As, first of all bolt-ons that we see in these different markets.</p><p>If we look at then the different reporting structure, this is a little bit technical for, first of all, analysts. But we will, of course, split the marketplace in the different markets like Norway, Sweden and others. And then in the news, it is important to split up the Aftonbladet, those are the 2 dominant, I would say, digital media companies in Norway and Sweden. And then, we have subscription newspapers growth. That includes, of course, Prisjakt, but also distribution. Distribution is something that we would like to utilize the strength, first of all, in the last line type of distribution. And that's why we have taken that apart from the growth. That includes also the newspaper distribution part, just to be aware of that.</p><p>And then, of course, we have the financial services with Lendo, et cetera. And when it comes to the headquarter and product and tech, we have said that it is likely to be slightly lower [headquarter] costs in the new Schibsted. And then, of course, it will be some increase in Adevinta, and we have given an estimate of NOK 50 million to NOK 100 million and the setup of this Barcelona headquarter, but with a slim head office as such in that context.</p><p>If we go to the financial targets for Schibsted. We have looked into the outlook for the Marketplaces business. We have seen, over the last years, good growth like in FINN with -- coming also from stronger position over many years. And then we have the Blocket that we now expect to come into growth models and we also see opportunities in this adjacent business around this position, and then Tori. So that has led us to come up with a target of 8% to 12% for the Marketplaces business.</p><p>And the News Media, again, we have the same target as we have had before. It is to manage the digital transformation, meaning that continuous decline in print. At the same time, quite promising growth in digital, and that leads to a flattish EBITDA going forward, as a guidance.</p><p>When it comes then to capital allocation, we will continue to pursue M&amp;A opportunities. Again, it will be, first of all, adjacent businesses around these 3 areas. First of all, in Nordic marketplaces and, of course, within financial services. But it could also be in some other interesting opportunities. It will be a disciplined bolt-on type of acquisitions. And we also see that there could be some further consolidation opportunities in parts of the marketplace positions that we see both in Sweden and in Norway -- in, first of all, in Finland.</p><p>The dividend policy, we will continue. We have the policy that we have had in Schibsted. That means stable to increasing dividend over time. And when it comes to the capital structure, we will also have a leverage policy which is a net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA between 1 to 3. And we have, of course, a strong cash generation. And we will do different measures in order to have an optimal capital structure over time. So that also may imply that we, of course, will over time could increase dividend or do buybacks in order to adjust, so to say, the right capital structure. But Schibsted has a history of being very prudent in the way that we also manage our business.</p><p>So if we then look at another element that we're being asked about, that goes both for Adevinta, that I'm sure that Rolv Erik and his team will elaborate on the LTI system there. We, in Schibsted, and going forward, will continue with the LTI system, which is the same as what we have had in Schibsted, including Adevinta. It means then that we will have a total shareholder return target in the LTI program. I think it will be linked then to the level of salary, and it's also then depending on the performance compared with peers in this sector.</p><p>And then there are scale or payout depending on that. There are also holding requirements. So if you're in the top management, it is between 2 to 4x salary. So there are some restrictions on the shares being granted over time in this program. But it's aligned with you as shareholders on a total shareholder turn, that's important to notice.</p><p>If we then go to the merger. The merger -- we have already said that Schibsted will distribute 35% to our shareholders. We -- in Adevinta, we will sell down 5%. And this divestment will, of course, be also something that the foundation have said that they will also consider to do a limited placing of their holdings in Adevinta. And because they have said that their financials, a lot more [knowledge] of Adevinta. And this will be, of course, subject to customary lockup, the way we'll do this transaction. And it will be something that is planned, of course, as we have said to take place now in April with a planned date of 10th of April.</p><p>If we then go to how we will manage our long-term ownership in Adevinta, that is important. We will then remain with 60% ownership in Adevinta, and we will still have a cooperation quite closely with the Adevinta marketplace activity. That goes also for Schibsted's marketplace activity. And we will have agreements on other also services in this transition period in order to make this to be a successful also for Adevinta. And it will be then a process that a board has already been set up, an interim board. And of course, it has been approved by the AGM recently, and it's an independent board. And it's Ole that was representative and she will share that board as we said before. And then Kristin, of course, will be on the board. And then we have other key members and it's an independent company. And we, at Schibsted, we support the best value creation for our ownership in Adevinta going forward for all shareholders, of course. So we've also been asked, why don't just spin off everything? I mean, we do believe that in order for value to be created to have a controlling stake in this Adevinta going forward, and also being able then to participate in further consolidation of further structural solutions that could be to the benefit for all shareholders. So that's the reason for this structure and the setup of this Adevinta. And it will create 2 growth companies: Adevinta, Schibsted. And we believe that is a good foundation for speed and focus and value creation in both these 2 companies going forward.</p><p>So with that, I just leave the word over to Q&amp;A. And for concluding remarks, Kristin.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: We'll do the Q&amp;A first, and then I'll round it off.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Okay, here we have [Christian]. It's good. I'll take you in the back there first.</p><p>ANDERS WENNBERG: Anders Wennberg from Catella. I just wanted you -- could you confirm a little bit on the headquarter cost? Did you say that they would go up by NOK 100 million to NOK 150 million because of the Barcelona headquarter? Or are you lowering it in the Schibsted side? What's the net change in the headquarter costs?</p><p>TROND BERGER: What I said is that Adevinta will establish their own headquarter out of Barcelona, an estimate of NOK 50 million to NOK 100 million extra. And if you're looking at the old Schibsted, that, of course, will come in addition. At the same time, of course, the new Schibsted will have some ambition to, over time, take down some costs in the headquarter that we have to come back to. So that's what we can say about that for the time being.</p><p>ANDERS WENNBERG: So short term is we'll go up NOK 50 million to NOK 100 million.</p><p>TROND BERGER: In short term in '19, you don't -- you shouldn't expect any significant changes in headquarter costs.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Okay, we'll do Henriette next then.</p><p>HENRIETTE TRONDSEN: Henriette Trondsen, Arctic. In your press release, you stated for Adevinta, 40% margins, about 40% margins longer-term. And what can we expect here for Nordics classifieds? And are there any structural differences expected at somewhat higher cost level maybe in the Nordics that they cannot reach the margins of your peer groups such as for Trade Me, Autotrader, and so on? That's 50% to 60% margins?</p><p>TROND BERGER: Well, I mean, on the margin, if we couldn't give that, we are not giving margin guidance. I think that we are happy with the margins, around 45% that you saw in the presentation here from [our list]. And I think that we have to be prepared to continue to develop in Finland. But if we look at then both Blocket and FINN, I think that we have the history of I think investing also in some attractive adjacent businesses. So if you look at the margin of the real estate, of the car vertical, those are much higher than the combined FINN, as an example. So I don't think it's a fair comparison either. But going forward, I think that we're happy with the levers that we are seeing today. But of course, we could have driven these margins much higher, if we think that was the right thing to do. But we don't think that is what we should do. We should continue to broaden our business and scope and have the growth that way.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Sorry I think we need to move on. Carnegie, please.</p><p>PREBEN RASCH-OLSEN, ANALYST OF CONSUMER GOODS AND CRUISE, CARNEGIE INVESTMENT BANK AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Preben Rasch-Olsen, Carnegie. A quick question on the capitalization, given your 5% sales in Adevinta, you should be at least cash neutral, maybe even cash positive. At the same time, you're saying you target net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA in the range of 1 to 3. So my question is should we expect a high extraordinary dividend this year? Or do you have a huge acquisition in sight already?</p><p>TROND BERGER: Well, first of all, we now have very conservative acquisitions. There is no immediate in the pipeline that is where we use the money for that, I can assure you. So I think that we will have a capital discipline. We will look for interesting bolt-on acquisitions. Of course, we will be well capitalized. And it also may be that we as we have always been slightly overcapitalize in certain periods. I think that we have to come back to the markets in order to help to adjust the capital structure. As I said, we have the target range, 1 to 3, and then there are different means or measures in order to adjust that over time. But too early to be precise on that.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Anyone else? Yes, I'll take you in the back. I won't call you the one with the beard anymore.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: First one's on cash conversion which has been a little bit impacted in the last couple of years by higher CapEx and restructuring charges. Can you give us a sense as to what you expect from that going forward in Schibsted? And then second one, just coming back to an earlier question on the 8% to 12% growth in other Marketplaces, is that an organic number or not?</p><p>TROND BERGER: (foreign language)</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: (foreign language) organic.</p><p>TROND BERGER: Yes. When it comes to the growth of 8% to 12%, that is actually organic growth, yes.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: What was your first question again? I heard it, but I forgot.</p><p>TROND BERGER: Speak up, the second question, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So first one's the cash conversion. So what do you expect the CapEx restructuring, anything else going through?</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Right.</p><p>TROND BERGER: Yes. Well, I think that when it comes to the CapEx, I think that we will have fairly low maintenance CapEx, first of all, in Schibsted and in Adevinta as well. And then we will have CapEx when it comes to the -- I mean for the tech. And that also, over time, is likely to grow some, I would say.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Okay. In the front.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I just wanted to follow up on the increase in the headquarter cost for Adevinta NOK 50 million to NOK 100 million, which is significant, I think. Could you please go in a bit more detail what this NOK 50 million to NOK 100 million...</p><p>TROND BERGER: Ole Sunde can be responsible for that. I mean he's -- so but he will come back to it, I'm sure. So but -- the way we see it, to answer it a little bit differently, is that if you benchmark the headquarter of unused setup, unused structure Adevinta, it will be as in head office. I will be, I would say, quite low headquarter compared with what you see in this kind of setup structure, that we can say.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And Ole, can you comment?</p><p>OLE JACOB SUNDE: Well, the big advantage there is I think I support general bit of -- Trond. I think we're going to have a surveillance set up. So it's going to (inaudible) support [Phoenician Airlines]. We get the low (inaudible) but otherwise I'll be based in Barcelona, most of the time but then also there's more background.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Aditya, please?</p><p>ADITYA BUDDHAVARAPU, RESEARCH ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Aditya Buddhavarapu. On the intrinsic value. I have just 2 questions. One again on the headquarter cost. Well, then maybe to help you out as well. Of that NOK 800 million which you used to report, about NOK 300 million was technology development with offices in London, for example. And I think you're closing those down. So can you give us the true headquarter cost, excluding those technology development, which are -- which probably are going to be disbanded. And then secondly, I see Shpock now in Schibsted. And I thought it was going to move to Adevinta. But in your slide, you say that Shpock is part of your assets. That's on Page 101. You say Shpock is part of Schibsted. So just want to make sure where Shpock now sits. Is it with you or Adevinta?</p><p>TROND BERGER: Yes, last one, Adevinta, Shpock. And so, of course, in the new Schibsted, we have the license for Shpock in -- like in Sweden as an example. But when it comes essentially to the headquarter, I mean, we have in '18 headquarter costs in Schibsted around NOK 300 million. And then we have profit after tax, profit after tax both for Adevinta and for Schibsted around NOK 500 million. And we have said that the profit after tax, we can split that in roughly 50-50. So what we are saying going forward for Schibsted is that the headquarter cost of around NOK 300 million is likely to go slightly down going forward, but we have to come back to that in order to have an optimal setup in the new Schibsted.</p><p>KRISTIN SKOGEN LUND: Any other questions before we wrap it up? No. Okay. Thank you, Trond. I'll just very briefly try to wrap it all up. I hope we have been able to convey to you that we have this fantastic history, 180 years, of continuously challenging and disrupting ourselves to ensure new growth and to meet our customers' new and changing needs. We will try to take good care of that inheritance and keep doing the same thing going forward. This history has led us to the 3 strong market areas that we now have. We will -- as you know, we have been through those in-depth. And from here going onwards, we have done several growth avenues. We believe that this portfolio is strong in itself, and our ability to monetize it will keep growing. We also hope to be able to expand the portfolio that we can continuously solve more customer problems and, thus, also create more value. We will selectively invest with partners. We will invest in entrepreneurs and build growth and value. That way, we will do some select M&amp;A, and we do have the opportunity to grow internationally the concepts that we managed to grow in the Nordics space. We have a few concrete examples at our hand as we speak, and we hope there will be more going forward.</p><p>And the final slide I want to leave you with is this one. So this is what Schibsted going forward is all about. Schibsted as a group is a platform, a unifying platform and foundation that enables all our different businesses to grow in the best possible way. Those business are different, but they do share a common purpose and a common aspiration of being close to the customer, solving more and more of their problems, helping them make informed decisions and, thus, empower them in their daily lives.</p><p>And this is a very -- it's an important purpose and aspiration. It's very motivational for us, and I hope that it will prove itself to also be very prosperous going forward.</p><p>So with that, thank you for listening so far. It's lunchtime. Please be back at 12:45, and then we will go into the Adevinta story. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL, CEO, MARKETPLACES INTERNATIONAL ASA: So warm welcome to this session after lunch. My name is Rolv Erik. It's -- I'm very happy to see you all here, and this is -- I hope that you have a good day so far. Now I look forward to telling you about the Adevinta story, together with my colleagues. This is, of course, the story of a pure-play international marketplace company.</p><p>This is an important day for me. I've been working at Schibsted for more than 25 years. I've been the CEO for almost 10 years. But I think in my period, this is the biggest milestone for the group. A milestone is one thing, but even more important, this is the exciting start of a new journey, I think, for all of us and also all of you here, for all stakeholders, actually, in Adevinta. We're taken [away] Adevinta, which, of course, signifies that we're advancing and it signifies new idea and new beginning. You can see here also on our logo, the delta there, we're going to change the classifieds world.</p><p>Right. So together with me, we'll have a host of presenters, a list of presenters here. So you get to know those very soon. First, I'd like to introduce those who are not -- those important persons who are on the management team but are not presenting today. But first, I'd like to just present our Chairman -- Chairwoman Orla Noonan. And then sitting next to her is, Laila Dahlen, who's the Head of Products, CPO.</p><p>LAILA DAHLEN: Hi, everyone.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Then we have [Nikki], please stand up. Nikki is the Head of HR and Communications. And then we have -- where is, [Uno]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Here, sorry.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: All right. [Uno] stand there. It says -- as our CTO.</p><p>All right. So this is the program we have for you. I'll start out with the beginning part.</p><p>Let me tell you about Adevinta. What we like to say internally is that Adevinta, we're matchmakers. Our mission is to ensure perfect matches between people looking for goods or services and people who are providing those goods or services and to do so in a trusted environment. So we believe that every house could be a home, every person has a role to play and every object can live a second or a third life. They only have to find their matching need. And if we're successful in doing that, we will make the everyday life of our users easier, we'll contribute to more sustainable society and we will create value for our shareholders.</p><p>So what does our company look like? Well, we are a leading player in the global marketplace context. You can see here, we're truly global. So we're present in 16 markets, covering a population of 800 million. We have a lot of monthly visits, 1.5 billion. I'd like to point out also the diversified nature of the company because we have diversification when it comes to geography, but we also have a diversification when it comes to income sources. And you can see the verticals contribute a bit more than 2/3 of our total revenues. Biggest one, of course, is real estate, followed by cars and then jobs. And then we have financial scale. So we have revenues of approximately EUR 600 million. We have an EBITDA margin of 25%, which has been going up. Get back to that later. And we are upholding our mid- to long-term revenue growth targets of 15% to 20%. So I'd say, in summary, our operations are large, diversified and globally significant in scope.</p><p>So here, you'll see the reporting segments going forward and also what we'll be going through here today. So Antoine is here to tell you about Leboncoin. This is our largest business segment, of course. And then Spain is our second biggest segment and Gianpa is here to tell you more about that. And then in joint venture, our main presence in Brazil is through the joint venture with Naspers-OLX. I'm very happy that Andries has flown in from his vacation to present that. And then we have also a diversified global portfolio, and Ovidiu will get more into that.</p><p>So this is what does our operation look like from a geographic point of view. As you can see from the slide, this is how it looks like with the operations, primarily leadership positions in key markets in Europe and in Latin America. I'd like to point out that we have been present in these markets for quite some time and, therefore, built up experience as we have built up our leadership positions. And important thing for me is that, currently, international nature of our portfolio helps us to learn from one market to the other. So if we have a test case or we have a case study in one market, we can apply the learnings from that market into other part. I think that's an important advantage that we have in Adevinta.</p><p>So if you look at our summary of where we are and the key investment highlights, I would say that we spent 20 years now of hard work in the online classifieds field and this has led us to where we are today. We operate within attractive geographies, where there's more growth opportunities, and we have a highly attractive business model with networking effects and scale and winner-takes-most characteristics.</p><p>And what differentiates us from many others is that we have leading brands in local markets that are backed by our global scale in product and technology, and therefore, this has translated into our rather long-standing track record of good revenue growth and also increasing EBITDA margins. Even more importantly, I believe that with the positions we have, with the assets we have and with the people we're having, then we are very well positioned to continue on that exciting journey in the years to come.</p><p>Now let me talk you through some of these different themes, and let me start by the market characteristics. So as we all know the markets is very -- the classifieds markets is very attractive place to be. You can see here that we have online -- classified market is predicted to grow close to 10% annually for a number of years. And I think importantly, here is that all the main segments, so real estate, cars and jobs, the prediction is that they will continue to grow either at high-single digit or at low single-digit numbers. And it's important for us to continue to develop the product. Of course, the user expectations are growing up. So we are working hard to develop our product and create safe and trusted marketplaces for our users.</p><p>Now if you look at the further growth potential, I think that I can point out here is that -- whereas this is predicted to be the overall market growth, we, in Adevinta, we believe we can grow stronger -- quicker than that. And the reason for that is that we're positioned in markets where there is a significant growth potential and also that we're continuously rolling out new products.</p><p>So looking at the potential for future growth. Here, we can see statistics, which shows the Internet ad spend per capita. And of course, you see, I would say, very developed market in the digital sense, U.S. and United Kingdom but also the Nordics. You can see that the Internet spend per capita is very high. Whereas many of the markets that we're present in is still at a much lower level. This is a signal to me that we have good growth potential. And you can also see it here that when it comes to the Internet penetration, some of these countries are still lagging quite a bit behind what we're seeing here in Sweden, Norway and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Now what's the attractiveness of the business model we have in online classifieds? Well, it's a very resilient model and favoring the market leader actually. So some of the features are it's a clear value proposition, it's win-win value proposition and developed working marketplace. It's a good place to meet for buyers and sellers, to get the job done. And then of course, you have the network effects, meaning that if you attract more sellers, you attract more buyers, et cetera, et cetera, and then you are on the leading -- then you have a great development if you're able to take that #1 spot, because that will then drive the further economics. That's why we say winner takes most, which is a defensible position, which is harder to attack from the competitors. And then what you continue to do is continue to develop the product and tech part of it, and then you can improve monetization and the user experience even more. And I would also like to point out that this model is relatively asset-light. So as opposed to an e-commerce company, which builds up large inventory and holds that, we are not doing that. We're the marketplace. We're matching the buyer and the seller.</p><p>Now let us have a look at some of the leadership positions that we have built up through the years. These are the biggest markets, and you can see that we have built up a strong position. So starting with France, so we are the #1 in generalists, started there and then went to the cars, where we also are the leader in these metrics, then into real estate, which is today our biggest business. And you can see on all these measures, which are traffics and ads and customers, that we are the leader in that field. And then more recently, we have started in jobs. And I think that with the development that we've seen so far and with the huge, I'd say, power that is in the Leboncoin brand and traffic machine, I think we're well positioned to develop also that position furthermore.</p><p>In Spain, we're #2 in generalist. And then in real estate, on some metrics, we're #1, such as the total ad listings and total number of customers. In some metrics, we're #2, so in traffic and, I believe also, revenue. We're developing well there, and I think that what we've seen the last couple of years is that we have been able to speed up our product development much more in Spain, which makes me confident for the future position of the real estate vertical in Spain. Looking at cars whereby we are the leader. I would still say it's a market that is going to -- that can be developed further. It's still at a relatively immature stage prior, compared to what we've done in other markets. And then in jobs, we are the strong leader in jobs. We've been that, and we continue to see a positive development for that side.</p><p>Now Brazil that you'll hear more about is a much newer story, but it was really kind of the same playbook to [launch of Oui], as in France. So it started by taking the generalist site and building that up to leadership position, then going into the car segment. Now we're in the real estate. We're not the #1, of course, in revenues but we are -- have taken the leadership position in traffic and we'll increase that. And then the jobs have also developed positively, relatively recent start.</p><p>Here, you can see the total growth profile. And you can see that during those last few years, we have grown among the top players in our industry. I think that is kind of testament to the diversified portfolio we have, where some are positioned in more established markets, still growing a lot, whereas we also have positions in higher growth, emerging markets.</p><p>Now I believe that this innovation -- to continue that growth, we really need to continue to innovate. That's the key to develop the product. You see that user demands are increasing. We have the scale to continue to develop. And so innovation is key if we're going to continue that growth. So how are we going to do that? Well, what we are doing is that we are developing a lot of our products locally, and then we have also a central staff, central product and tech that drove out a number of components. So in total, we have close to 1,400 developers in -- working with product and tech, and they represent more than 40 different nationalities.</p><p>Here are some of the products that we're -- have been developing, are developing. So global messaging is something that facilitates the interactions between buyer and seller, so meaning you can communicate across all platforms real-time, instant. Same thing with notifications. So if you have a saved search and you're looking for a flat in certain part of London, then we will immediately notify you when that comes available, we will, in Paris, I would say. And that -- those metrics, those components also help develop traffic and engagement. We're seeing that.</p><p>Trust and reputation, I mentioned we want to be entrusted -- a trusted player. So to develop good user profiles, we also allow ratings is something we're working hard on, will be rolled out in Leboncoin relatively soon.</p><p>Then we have the performance dashboards. Those are for our professional customers, so helping car dealers, real estate brokers to optimize how they get response on their ads. Why isn't this ad working perfectly here? Here is some -- here are some suggestions we have for you to improve it. And the good thing is with the professional users is, of course, that -- this is where the big monetization is and they are willing to pay for qualified leads. So I think everyone will tell you that they're working on product development, innovation. And why we're doing it? Well, of course, we do it to have better user experiences, and we develop these tools to be able to have better monetization.</p><p>Right. So here's what it's all about is, of course, to capture data and use them in the best meaningful manner about our customers. This is, for instance, image recognition. The more data you have to train your algorithm on, the better you are at predicting what kind of ads you want to insert, as an example.</p><p>So the data continues and to show you an example of that. This is something we aspire to do and we're working on as an example. So let's say this is a woman living in Marseille and then she finds a job in Paris using Leboncoin, of course. And when we know that, we know that, that person -- that she will need a place to live and we provide that, come up with some personalized examples for her. And when that is settled, we know that she would probably need to furbish (sic) [furnish] the house and do that, and then we also are going to come up with new offerings. So that's the degree of personalization. And takeaway the friction in the user journey is something that we're constantly working on. So that's about data and products.</p><p>How does that translate into top line and bottom line? Well, I think we are pretty happy with what we can show you there as well because we are among the fastest grower and you also see that in the revenue terms. This is for the 3-year period, where we have the 90% revenue development. And then the EBITDA margin has also gone up. And the reason the EBITDA margin goes up is we continue to grow our big sites, but also more of our sites are going into profitability. So the investment phase losses have gone down a lot. Then as I said, it's a relatively capital-light business we're running, so the CapEx is at a relatively stable level.</p><p>Now let me give you -- for those of you who've known us for a while, you know this story, but this is an example from Brazil and how you build the classifieds business. So what we do is to -- we invest a lot in attracting listings and brands in the first place. If you get the brand, you get top-of-mind situation and then you attract listing then attract buyers.</p><p>The first thing is -- we do is to build a leading generalist brand, because then, you can attract also the professionals. The professionals will typically come to where the privates are. So you typically attract private cars first, then the car dealers, et cetera. And then you move on to other verticals. Brazil follows then the same pattern where you go into different verticals, so real estate and then jobs. And if you're able then to provide the good experiences, then you can develop products for professional customers that are willing to pay for, and that will help them improve the offering and the total monetization.</p><p>So I think this next slide, I could ask you to spend some time reading through that, I won't do that, because it's a lot of -- very text heavy. But rather when you're back in your office, perhaps you'd like to study it. So let me just try to sum it up a little bit. So what we'll do is that we'll continue to build on our core functionality, and that is matchmaking, matching the buyer and seller, whether it's a good or a service. And then simultaneously, we will put a lot of effort on growing in the verticals, develop good tools for professional customers so that they get their leads and then we can develop the monetization. Where -- we talked -- Trond talked briefly about the M&amp;A, and I'll get back to it as well, but that has been part of our growth story. So when that one will make sense, then we'll continue to do that as well. And now I think from the separation, Adevinta will benefit from improved flexibility and even more speed and focus to execute even faster than we've been able to do previously.</p><p>Then the point again about diversification. So I think just to show you here that while all our markets are attractive, they are, of course, in diverse sometimes the majority -- maturity and match also our overall strategy. Online business, online marketplaces is a -- and local business and then we benefit from global scale, but that means that we have adapt -- tailor a strategy to every market. So in France, we started from scratch 12 years ago, built that position further and started with the generalist, et cetera, and you have the story, and developed that into what it is today with one strong brand covering the different verticals.</p><p>Spain is a different story, because here, the market looks somewhat different, and our journey there is mix of organic growth and acquisitions. So what we do there is that we have strong vertical brands and then we feed traffic into those verticals from the generalist there.</p><p>And then again Brazil, you'll hear more about, more the same stories in France, building from scratch, one focused brand going into different verticals. Early-stage market is still huge potential to transform offline to online, so a local business but we benefit from the global scale we're having.</p><p>All right. I talked about the monetization, and I just wanted to show you this illustration here because we heard Anders today previously talked about how are they doing in terms of monetization. Well, I have to say, Anders, where are you? I admire you very much because I haven't seen any other players being close to that level of monetization, and so I think it's fantastic. I think Sweden is also at a high level. And I don't think that our site needs to be at the Norwegian level in order to do well. But I think if we're able to continue to develop our product, then I'm sure that there's good long-term potential for growing even more in the years to come.</p><p>All right. I mentioned the portfolio and the -- and M&amp;A. This is, again, a slide with a lot of information. I won't take you through all of it. I just want to -- the important point with this is that we are active at portfolio management, and we have been that historically. We'll continue to do so. So historically, we have used M&amp;A as a way to pursue growth, both in existing markets but also in new markets and adjacent markets.</p><p>Recently, we've done bolt-on things in Spain and France, which fits very well into with what we're doing. I'd like to point out, we have also divested, and we needed to do that. So gone out of Asia, we have -- we closed down -- or we sold our operation in Belgium, didn't fit well enough, as examples. And then of course, we've also done bold moves like the joint venture with Naspers when that was -- it's a good thing to do. So my [single] here is that we will continue to monitor our portfolio and look at external opportunities.</p><p>Right. Then I'm nearly done, but there's one thing, important thing I'd like to point out. So this -- having the right product and having the right portfolio, it's also very important for us to have the best people and to be able to attract talent. And Adevinta is working hard to do that. I think we have international scale that will allow us to do it. And what I can see is that we are -- many of our sites are regularly awarded top 3 placement when it comes to great place to work.</p><p>We offer interesting career opportunities for many people. We have now slimmed down our tech hubs, so operations are in -- the central tech hubs are in Paris and Barcelona, and I believe we're very attractive there. And I've actually spoken to some of the engineers, and some of them come from -- that joined us, some of them have come from big tech giants. And what they said to me is that, it's interesting company, it's not too big, which meaning that it's still entrepreneurial spirit and, if you like, they have the ability to have some impact. And in addition to that, we're also trying to offer interesting career opportunities, rotation and development and placements internationally. So that point is something that is very top of the agenda in our internal discussions.</p><p>Right. So I think I'm nearing the end of my presentation. So let me just remind you then because why I'm so excited about the future of Adevinta. We spent 20 years at Schibsted building out knowledge, building out positions in these markets. We operate very attractive geographies, where we believe that there is continued high-growth potential.</p><p>We have a very attractive business model, where if we're successful, it's a winner takes most. It's relatively defensible. There's strong network effects. Our differentiating factor is that we have strong local positions, and those are backed by the central and global product and tech scale. And that's why we have a positive economic journey and a good development when it comes to revenue and profitability. And I'm confident that with the setup we have, we can continue that journey in the years to come.</p><p>So that was what I plan to say in my introduction. And now we get into the really interesting part because now we're going to look -- have a closer look at our operations. And the first one I'm very happy to welcome on stage is, of course, the man that many of you asked to meet and asked questions to. Well, today you're meeting him, and you can ask questions later. So please welcome Antoine. Antoine has been with Leboncoin for -- the senior management position for 10 years. He's been the top boss for the last 3 years.</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU, CEO - FRANCE, MARKETPLACES INTERNATIONAL ASA: Thank you very much, Rolv Erik. And thank you for the comparison with Norway, and we'll have the discussion with Anders later.</p><p>So I'm very happy today to present Leboncoin. I'm very proud of what we have done the last years. Leboncoin is a fantastic success story during the last 13 years. It's a generalist marketplace. We are leader in the consumer goods, on the real estate market, on the car market. We are a challenger on the job market, but I will explain how we'll be bigger later. So now, we have a very strong brand in France. Half of the French Internet population is using Leboncoin every month. So it's something we are very proud of it.</p><p>Step by step, the last years, we were verticalizing our experience in each market, and we will continue to do it mainly on the professional path. We are -- also, we build a very strong and profitable company in a very -- with a very strong competition market. In each market, we have strong competitors, and we become, step by step, a very strong leader.</p><p>And what we will do for the future, we will do a lot of things for our customers. On the professional part, we'll build a lot of data-driven product. I will come back to it for the future.</p><p>So if I come back to the history of Leboncoin, it's 13 years of a lot of launches of new products, new markets we have attacked. As you can see on this snake, there's a big change in 2009. I arrived in 2009 and then we have -- we see the acceleration. So we have started monetization of Leboncoin by the car market, as you remember in 2010, and then the real estate market and now the job market is improving a lot. So we've built the last 13 years a big, leading marketplace leader.</p><p>If I have to point out a few KPIs on Leboncoin, we have a few. It's a lot of big figures, but I think I will take 2. One is, of course, our audience. We have 28 -- around 28 million unique visitors per month, around 10 million per day, and we are -- around us, only GAFA company. The second is the impact of Leboncoin on the French economy, and I think this is what Leboncoin is bringing to the French economy. We are making 110 million transaction per year. It means more or less 1.2% GDP impact. It's a huge impact on Leboncoin on the French society. And what we are proud of it is where we are working with 0.5 million professional every day, recruiting on Leboncoin, selling goods on Leboncoin, buying on Leboncoin, but the professionals are using our platform to improve their business.</p><p>So I didn't build this company alone, of course. The beginning, we were 5, so doing everything. But now we are 900 with strong brand. And this company is a tech company. We have a lot of very good engineers, a lot of very good salespeople working hard every day, tough -- in a tough market to build the best product we can. And the best product we can is to be very good on the transaction path, to be free, of course, on -- for the private part, to be quick for selling your goods, to be safe for selling your goods. Our users, they are asking it, and we have building every day to develop this good product.</p><p>Based on it, we built a very strong brand, and I think this is an amazing achievement what we have done and we'll continue to reinforce it. But Leboncoin in France is one of the well-received brand, the well -- the more useful brand. As you can see, we are -- compared to SNCF, La Poste, that are very old brand, and we are a very young brand. We have only 14 years behind us. So I hope, step by step, we'll be on the podium.</p><p>During the last years, we have developed a very strong company, a steady growth on revenue, regular growth, but also a profitable company, Leboncoin is a very profitable company, and we will continue to increase this revenue. And I will explain to it [mainly] on our strategy.</p><p>So the strategy we have today is we want to enable all the strategies in the daily life of our users. It means that we are providing perfect matches between sellers and buyers, okay?</p><p>We have a very ambitious goal, we want to touch all the French people in their daily life during one year, it's a big ambition. And to do it, we have 3 pillars, you will see that, a lot of pillars a lot in this world.</p><p>The first pillar is we will continue to develop what we call our virtuous circle, our liquidity. What does it mean is the long-term -- [a lot of] products we have today, they are using Leboncoin to buy and sell, and we have to accelerate the transaction on this moment. And to do this, we launched some peer-to-peer payment system, some shipping system, to improve this velocity on selling.</p><p>Secondly, when we are good generalist at the marketplace, we will continue to develop our verticalization. It means on real estate, our first market, I will come back to it, on the car market, on the job market, but also on the professional equipment market, which is quite interesting with our subsidiary and beneficial. And to reinforce our leadership, we will launch a lot of professional tools to help the professional to have better leads and more leads.</p><p>And then what is next for Leboncoin? Step-by-step, we will continue to attack new markets. Now we are very interesting in the holiday rental market. It's a tough market but we are already quite -- we have already good KPIs on this market and we'll continue on this strategy. So next, we'll invest to conquer new market to test, to serve and to win also, but it's a very solid strategy. And it's based on very good teams, on product, on data, on sales. We have very strong team behind this strategic plan.</p><p>So our business model, as you understood, is based on 4 things, the 4 things most important thing for a marketplace is the first thing. The free listing is a basic of our audience, the basic of our liquidity. We have to accelerate the number of transactions every -- in the daily life of our users. This is very important for us. For this, we are launching a lot of features, transaction, shipping, to be sure that we'll be the best placed to sell and to buy.</p><p>On this, we can monetize on 3 different pillars, I love pillars. First is the freemium model. The freemium model is a way to monetize the free listing on the private content, okay? Step-by-step, we'll improve the monetization also on the transaction path. So the private content will be monetized by the premium model, but also -- so freemium model is you are buying from bump, you're buying for editing your ad or adding features like this.</p><p>Secondly, we'll continue to develop our verticalization. So monetization on professional, for introducing insertion fees, we have insertion fees and paid product on real estate, on car, on jobs, on professional equipment, and we'll continue to develop tools and new added product on this.</p><p>And third, when you are a good generalist with a strong audience, when you are able to verticalize a lot your content, you have a lot of data. So combining with your audience and the way that you are very good in providing leads, you will be able to monetize with advertising. And advertising is also a pillar of our strategy to monetize our audience.</p><p>So if you have a look of what we have done the last year and to show that, I will not detail one by one these features, but what we have done the last year is, as you can see, market-by-market, we are launching a lot of new product, a lot of new offers. And it's a way for us to monetize better one by one.</p><p>For example, on real estate, last year, thanks to our own analytic technology, we have launched a new construction site, which is very good with a very good start. On the car market, we are launching, well, it is called Pack Auto R\u00e9f\u00e9rence in French. It's a pack that it allows us to have more leads with your ad. On the job, we are attacking the white-collar market. We were a blue-collar content, but now, we are attacking the white-collar content. Advertising, we are bringing new-look offers like some banners in your app, targeting with your -- in your city something like this. So step-by-step, as you can see, we are accelerating on the product side.</p><p>But not only on the product side, Leboncoin is not alone in France. We build the portfolio around us, mainly to -- sometimes we consolidate our markets. Like on the real estate market, it was very useful and it is very useful to have Avendrealouer to propose to the market. Avendrealouer is a specialist on the general real estate market.</p><p>Step-by-step, we go up to the value chain expansion. So now, we bought Videdressing to bring us their skills and know-how on the shipping, on the peer-to-peer that we will deploy on Leboncoin. So we have a very strong strategy [on the net] also to reinforce our position in our markets.</p><p>So now, if I'm going to the different markets. As you know, the real estate market is by far the #1 in our company. This market is a quite dynamic market. The last year was very good in France, especially last year in terms of number of transaction, the price are increasing in France, so the market is in a good health.</p><p>The online classified market is the biggest of what we are attacking. It's around EUR 350 million. But the value chain, as you see, is much bigger. So what we want to do is step-by-step to propose more services like insurance, advices, data to try to attack this value chain.</p><p>So what is our position today? We are a leader by far on this market. Leader in audience, leader in content, leader in terms of market share. And Leboncoin is not alone now. We have Avendrealouer also that it was very far in this rank before, but now, what we have done the last 15 months with Avendrealouer, now they are taking some position and now we are #4 in traffic. They became the #3 in content and #4 in terms of number of customers. So step-by-step, Avendrealouer plus Leboncoin, it's the good solution for our customers to have a generalist and a specialist to push their ads.</p><p>So what are we doing with Avendrealouer? Avendrealouer is a specialist. We bought it some 15 months ago. What we have done the last month is we have bundled Leboncoin and Avendrealouer. So if you are a real estate agent, now you have to buy Leboncoin and Avendrealouer because it's bringing much more traffic, much more leads and it's a good combination between the generalist with strong audience and the specialist.</p><p>And the last thing we have done is we have deployed a new construction offer, it was in September. So it's a new market for us that we are attacking, thanks to Avendrealouer platform.</p><p>So in terms of KPI, the real estate market is a very strong and growing market in a regular way. And how -- if I can explain how we are doing this both, there's 2 things. The first thing is we are taking market shares. So we are attracting more and more real estate agents in our portfolio. And at the same time, we are growing our ARPU, thanks to new product, new offers that we are proposing to them. So the last year, it's an amazing market and we strongly believe that for the future, we'll continue to grow and to conquer market share, especially we'll continue to develop the ARPU.</p><p>So how to do it. There's 2 things, there's a lot of things to do, obviously, on this market, but I think there is 2 main things. The first thing is, of course, we'll continue to develop offers for our customers. What they want, there are customers they want to have new mandates for their business. We are attacking the new construction market. So step-by-step, we are verticalizing in this vertical offer.</p><p>The second thing is we will continue to develop good product for our customers. Not focus on the product part at the beginning, but we will focus on the professional part. Why? Because they want more tools to manage their leads. They want more data. They want more intelligent -- intelligence behind the leads. They want to manage leads in their performance dashboard, for example. So we will continue to improve this market.</p><p>So the real estate market, if I summarize it, this is our #1 market. We have strong position on this market, in audience, in content, in terms of number of real estate agents. We will continue to develop it. It's a profitable market, it's a growing market for us.</p><p>If we now go to the car market. The car market is our second market, we have started to monetize Leboncoin with this market. The market is quite positive as well. It's a growing market. And as you can see, the online classified spend is EUR 160 million. So in comparison with the real estate market, it's 40% of this market, but the value chain of this car market is quite interesting and quite attractive for us. It's why I will explain that we'll go through the value chain step-by-step to be close to the transaction, sending new features like C2C payments, for example, for private people. So we believe that we can increase the size of this market to be closer to the transaction.</p><p>What is our situation at this market, on this market today? Probably, this is the strongest market where we are today in terms of audience, in terms of content, in terms of number of customers. We are by far a strong leader and we will continue to increase our position. Mainly I think in content, we can continue to grow on this part.</p><p>So what is it in terms of monetization? Monetization is very good as well, a little bit below real estate but very strong impressive growth. It's coming from 2 things. One is we're continuing to gain market share to attract more car dealers. But as you know, we are quite high in terms of market penetration on this part. But what we are doing mainly is we are doing -- we are working our ARPU. We're increasing the value of what we are bringing to the customers, giving them more tools like pricing tool they can use today, more data to improve the ARPU and to convince our car dealers that we are the best solution. So bringing more added value, at the same time, we are increasing prices and developing more product.</p><p>So what is the strategy on this market? Two things, this is the first market where we will launch new offers. We will be focused on developing data-driven product on this market. What does it mean? It means that we will -- we are working now developing some algorithm to develop the visibility of the ad. Because now, most of our car dealers, they are bumping manually their ads. What we'll do is we'll do this for them. So some data-driven intelligence will be behind, and we will bring to these car dealers more intelligent product to bring in more leads.</p><p>Secondly, on the product side, we are changing completely the way we are developing our new ad insertion fees, that is quite technical. But we will attack the C2C payment market. It will be for private people. It's something that is quite exciting for us because we are by far the #1 in the private segment, and we'll bring them a very useful and safe payment system. And this solution will be deployed next year.</p><p>So now, I'm happy to present our last baby, because it's a baby in comparison with the others, but this is our last market, the job market. After the real estate market and the car market, the job market is quite different. As you know, in France, the last years and the last months, sometimes it was a little bit difficult for the economy. And we have a quite strong unemployment rate, it's improving now but it was a tough year. But now we are recovering growth and we see some potential to follow Leboncoin on this market.</p><p>So what is our position on this market? It's clearly a challenger position, which is good because sometimes with my team, we are #1 in real estate, #1 on car, we are feeling quite confident. So now, the job market is different, it's a challenging position and we are in a challenger position and it pushed us to innovate more.</p><p>So what is our position today? Traffic, we are #3 and we are growing. On content, now we are #5. And we are #5 because we have implemented some insertion fees. So we lost some content but we are recovering dynamic content on it. And the customers, recruiters, we are #2 and we are attracting more and more small businesses and big recruiters on our platform.</p><p>So as you know, we started to monetize this market 3 years ago, so it's a very young market. So it was an incredible growth rate between 2016 and 2017. But now we see very good trends on this market. And we are very focused on attracting new recruiters. This what we're doing. We are not working a lot on ARPU, we are working mainly to attract more recruiters, to attract more content. This is the basic of the virtuous cycle of this category. We need more job offer to have a very good sense.</p><p>So this is what we are doing and this is what we will continue to do. And we will continue to enforce our position based on 2 things. The first thing is to realize this market needs more investment in terms of product. We are a generalist and our platform is generalist but we will verticalize it. And this platform needs specific product to adapt.</p><p>The first product is we'll do exactly what we will do on the car market. We will develop some performance offer for our recruiters to bring them more leads. Because as you know, on this market, what is important is to bring leads, but the quality of the lead is very important at the same time.</p><p>Good candidates, it's much better than -- 5 candidates with good quality i's much better than 50 candidates without any quality. So first thing, data-driven product to push more leads to our customers.</p><p>Second thing is we will continue to develop some performance products for recruiters, but also, mainly, we will work a lot with the big recruiters to have the connection with their ATS. You see it's the software managing their HR or your HR people, your people, so we will connect to this.</p><p>So the job market for us, as you understood, is our third market, it's a new market for us. We are investing a lot on this market to build the right features, the good product to recruiters, and we have room to continue to grow, not by 500%, but we will continue to grow the next years.</p><p>So after presenting the different verticals, real estate, the car market, the job market, as we are a good generalist now, we are also a very good media for advertisers. Why? Because we are bringing a lot of audience, 28 million unique visitors per month, a lot of data. The quality of our data is very good. Why? Because we know what kind of flat or house people are buying; what kind of car they are buying. What kind of job they are doing. What are the furniture in their house. So we know a lot of things. So we have plenty of advertisers that they would be happy to buy some advertising in our site.</p><p>So what is the strategy on this advertising market? It's a different market, much bigger than the classified market. So we have 3 main pillars. As I said, I love pillars. First, we will continue to accelerate on display, mainly on the local path. The local market for us is DNA. Leboncoin, when you are going to Leboncoin, there's a [geo-localization], when you are arriving to Leboncoin, so it's very interesting for small businesses to touch these users using around Leboncoin around them.</p><p>Secondly, we'll continue to attack the search market. As you know, the market, the advertising market is divided in display, search, programmatic. The search market for us, we will continue to develop a self-served service that we have developed a few years ago. We are refactoring it and we have a good sign to relaunch it in France, and it's very tactical for us. What is it exactly? It's you are bringing your credit card, you are bringing clicks and you are doing it by yourself.</p><p>And the last, we strongly believe that the advertising market and the classified market are very close. So we're bundling a lot of classified offer and advertising offer and it's working well. For real estate agents, for example, it's very interesting to push their ads but also to have some branding locally. So we are doing a lot of things for -- mainly for the telesales force. So advertising market is continuing to be an interesting and attractive market, even if it's a tougher market in comparison with the other.</p><p>So to build this, of course, we have an IT strategy. We are a tech company, it's what we are doing. And we are focused on the satisfaction of our users. So what is our strategy on this? We have 5 pillars on this strategy.</p><p>First, we accelerate. To give you an example, 3 years ago, we were doing 2 releases per month, it's very bad. I was complaining a lot. And now we are doing 20 releases per day. It's okay, I'm complaining. But what we are doing is we have to change a lot our way to work. So we are very -- now, very small teams, we have changed the tools, we have changed the processes, so we are accelerating.</p><p>Secondly, we have to leverage our data. As you can see, most of the product we are launching are based on data. So we have made a lot of efforts to build very good data-driven product and to bring some good experience to our users because the basic products on our platform, we have it. The next product that we have to propose is based on recommendation, blockchain, all these kind of stuff. So it's very important.</p><p>Third, we have to protect our users. This is our DNA, Leboncoin. We respect the data so we have worked a lot on GDPR. And then in turn everybody has worked a lot of GDPR -- on. This is important and this is a different session because of payers.</p><p>Synergies, with Adevinta group, of course, but also within France, we bought Avendrealouer and we bought Videdressing and to grow this company, they need Leboncoin. So step-by-step, we are going to share components and to have more or less the same platform.</p><p>And again, anticipate, we were a challenger in the last years, running in our market. But now, as we have more capacity to develop more product, hopefully, we'll be able to innovate more because this is the most expected need that our users and customers they want, they expect for us.</p><p>Just an example of what we have done, we'll have detail on all this stuff. But during the last few years, of course, we have switched to mobile completely, 75% of our mobile traffic now on Leboncoin. And now we are deploying some huge and big features, like we have changed our search engine last year, we are deploying the search, we are deploying peer-to-peer payment, we'll deploy shipping before the end of the year. So we are accelerating a lot.</p><p>So if I have to summarize what is our strategy. First, to be the best marketplace, to buy and sell, the best brand and the best reflex to use Leboncoin for selling on the real estate market, on the car market, on the job market. We have to be the best on it. To do it, we launched a lot of transaction product, we will go up to the transaction.</p><p>Secondly, we will continue to verticalize our approach on each market we have presented to you, on the real estate, on the car market, on the job market. We developed a lot of features specifically for real estate, car dealers, recruiters, it's very important. And we are preparing the future, the next strike for Leboncoin. Why not have a development tool, why not services? So we are -- we have team now that they are starting to develop features and strategy on this market. So the main of the new drivers for the future, you know it. We will continue to reinforce our leadership on the verticals, on real estate, on car, on the job, for sure.</p><p>We are moving along the value chain on the consumer goods content, and we are attacking new markets. The cost driver will be, of course, the product and tech investments. Some of these markets, they need more investment to develop quite complex features.</p><p>We will need marketing spend, of course. Some of these market, some there -- our users, they don't know that we are very good on holiday rental. So they need to know. And of course, we'll expand our sales force. It's a growing team, at the same time, of the tech team.</p><p>So if I summarize what I said today, now I'm very happy to be with you to present Leboncoin, very proud of what we have done. I'm very confident for the future of Leboncoin group, not only Leboncoin, Leboncoin group, because we have a strong brand. We have a strong audience. We are touching half of the French user every Internet user per month.</p><p>We will continue to grow in each verticals we have because we are a growing company. This is our DNA. We are making a lot of projects, new projects, because we want to expand our revenue and because we want to continue to be a very steady company in terms of profit.</p><p>And to do that, we will do it based on data-driven product, and the data-driven product is not only data-driven because data is fancy, but we'll use it for building concrete product for our users and for our customers, more leads, more qualified leads, more intelligence.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Thank you, Antoine. Now, of course, you have the chance to ask questions to Antoine. And I think I remember it was the last Capital Markets Day where there were so many questions to Antoine, that even when he was going to the men's room and the break, people were following him. So hopefully, we can do most of the questions before that.</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU: I'll remove my badge.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Right, yes? Here, on the second row.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Could you possibly comment on whether there was any acquisitions in Q4? And what the impact of this was on your top line?</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU: So the acquisition of Q4, it was Videdressing. Videdressing, it's a small company and we do it because we want to accelerate on the fashion content and the fashion market. So not a big impact. As it's a very small company, it's not a big impact for us. But it's bringing a lot of product insights.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I think this completed in Q4, right? But were there any since then which have been included? Or has there been any other acquisitions since that one completed or...</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: That was the acquisition we've done in Q4, that's the last we've done. Preben?</p><p>PREBEN RASCH-OLSEN: Quick question, very impressive growth in recent years, but we've been a bit disappointed on the margins. And listening to you now, it seems like you still will have to spend a lot of money. So my question is really, should we expect stable margins in Leboncoin going forward? Or should we hope to see margins coming a bit back up?</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Well, we don't -- I know you like to ask that question, Preben. And as you know, we're not guiding specifically on margins, and we're very happy with the development we're seeing in Leboncoin and the growth. And I think they will have good margins in the years to come, but I won't be very specific about it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can I ask about the bundled product between the -- that you mentioned in terms of what kind of impact you saw on that product? What kind of price you are able to charge? And actually, how the reaction has been from clients?</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU: So I will not detail completely the offer, but we have started to deploy this offer 1 year ago. So at the beginning, it was not mandatory, but now it's mandatory since September. And we are bringing a lot of added value to our customers. So we have deployed a very strong strategy. So it's a real only one product and within this product, you have Leboncoin and Avendrealouer included. So it was a way for us to increase the ARPU and to increase the prices because the average prices increase was around 20%.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Customers are very happy with it.</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU: And the feedback we have today is that it's very natural to have this bundle. Because it's -- generalist is bringing a lot of power, powerful audience, and the specialist is bringing a lot of qualified leads. So now, we are attacking the market not with 2 verticals but 1 vertical and 1 generalist. It's the best offer you can because within, you are covering 100% of the needs of your customer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And then a general question about your product development. I mean, what extent are you cooperating with your colleagues in Spain or in FINN or in Blocket to actually develop the new products? It sounds to me like you have been doing quite a lot of the product development by yourselves in Leboncoin. Could you comment on that, please?</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU: We are doing both. What we didn't say is the performance benchmark is a common component. So messaging is a component -- is a global component. So step-by-step, as you can see, I said yes, we did it but we did it together with Adevinta team. And we have plenty of components deployed on Leboncoin and step -- and Leboncoin and on Spain, and step-by-step we are sharing this component. So it's very useful to accelerate because now the performance dashboard is a very sophisticated product that it will be deployed in the other countries the next months.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: [Markus]? Bring that microphone here in the middle.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Could you comment a bit more about the competitive environment in the property vertical? We've seen some slides about the current traffic share and listing share. More gradually, your competitor had a big acquisition, you had a big acquisition. How do you think the competitive environment go from here? I mean, so far it has been relatively behaved I would call it. Do you think that this is changing? Clearly, there are some regional differences, but do you think that it's -- there's an intensifying a bit more from here? Or do you think the developments that we've seen in the past 2 or 3 years would kind of continue?</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU: You're right. I think the real estate market is concentrating a lot between 2 players, between us and the German company. But what I think is now we are growing so fast. As you can see, our growth rate is quite impressive. So we think that we will continue and we are very happy to have Avendrealouer to help us to accelerate, mainly on the new construction market. So we are quite positive in continuing to grow.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: But regionally, you think that there will be -- that you would go more into regions where you might be not that present right now, like Paris? There's always the debate Paris versus the rural areas.</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU: Clearly, as we see our penetration rate, we are quite high on this market. And now we have deployed a specific approach in Paris.</p><p>You're right, not only in Paris, in the rest of France as well. With the sales force dedicated to our -- to this place, so -- and now we are producing those first results. So its impact as a rate growth on getting new market shares on the above customers is based on these, Paris and France.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: I would say France is a big market, it's growing rapidly. There are room for 2 players, we are very confident about our position and development.</p><p>Right, any other questions? There's one up there. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Leboncoin is clearly the largest asset within Adevinta. So is it fair to assume the 15% to 20% growth target longer term would apply to Leboncoin as well? And of that, how much roughly would be volume driven? Just wondering how much further penetration of customer can increase. You talked about it being high in real estate. Is the scope for real estate agents to use more than one partner or is it -- I think, in France?</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: When it comes to growth, we don't specify growth per asset, as you know. And that's obviously, with the sites of Leboncoin, they would be an important contributor to the total growth. And then I think for the...</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU: The penetration rates, I think, in France, we are around the 30,000 real estate agents, and we have 90% of these real estate agents. So we have still room to grow, mainly in Paris and in the few region in the south of France. So we will continue to grow on this region.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: We have room for 1 or 2 more questions. One here, [Frank]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You mentioned, I think, shipping a couple of times as a new service or feature. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about the TAM and the pricing model? And if you've seen that elsewhere, what's kind of led to that?</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU: You're right. We will -- as we want to be close to the transaction, we want to develop some features around this. The first feature was to develop a C2C segment. It's what we are testing since last summer. And we will be deploying slowly now. So next stage will be the shipping part. And the shipping part is natural after paying, you need a shipping solution. The business model is not completely finalized on it, but it's not -- there's not a lot of complexity on it, because we will take a margin on -- further beyond that.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Okay. There's room for one final question before we move on. Yes, it's at the back here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Historically what's happened these days in France, it seems like there is a slowdown. And shall we expect that to continue? Or are you guys doing things to change the dynamic?</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU: So the dynamic of the market, as you know, is changing a lot, not only in France, but in all the markets in the world, mainly, because there's strong competition by the GAFA on these markets. But at the same time, Leboncoin is one of the biggest national advertising agency in France, and we are continuing to work on this. But what we have realized is that we have to improve a lot what we are doing. It's what I have presented, strong action plans to develop more formats on mobile, on video, to continue to solve our -- to improve our revenue on the programmatic and to accelerate on this, which is quite important. And the last point is to continue to have a sales expansion. So -- but you're right, I think it's a big market, but it's a tougher market in comparison with the others.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: So I think in the aftermath of GDPR, we can say that GAFA has actually strengthened their positions, but we are doing a number of things now both with products and sales versus trend formats that makes us confident that we'll take a bigger part again going forward.</p><p>All right. I think, there, we have to move on to the next part. So thank you very much, Antoine. Then I'd like you to welcome on stage Gianpaolo. Gianpaolo has been a senior member of Schibsted management team and specialty classifieds for a number of years. And for the last year he's been the CEO of Spain.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>GIANPAOLO SANTORSOLA: Thanks Rolv Erik. Welcome, everybody. We move south. We move from France to Spain. So let me start with a few key messages that I want to give you today. First of all, Adevinta, in different forms, have been operating in Spain for already more than 40 years. We know the market, the users, the customers very, very well.</p><p>Second, Adevinta Spain is in a clear leadership position. We had the biggest -- we are the biggest online classified company in the market. We have fast revenue growth and we are growing profitability even faster, we will take later. Third, we operated in Spain through a multi-brand strategy, and we are present in all the verticals that matters. We are very happy with the position that we have in jobs and cars. We believe, we can have room for growth in real estate, and we strongly believe in the power of the generalist to enhance our vertical positions.</p><p>Finally, similar to what Antoine was saying, we believe in data and we believe that they can represent a unique source of competitive advantage going forward. So let's see how we have beat this position.</p><p>I will not tell you all the story, but the first form of Adevinta presence in Spain was in 1978, 1 year before I was born. Segunda Mano was a monthly free newspaper for classifieds. Since then, many things have passed, one of them is that we have moved completely online, and the very nice thing is that we have moved many of our customers online with us. So we've done this journey together with our customers. In the years that followed, we had several M&amp;A acquisitions. And as a result of this, we have now a portfolio of brands, representing many verticals, in all the verticals, the main verticals in online classified business. Since a few weeks, as you know, we have already gained 100% control over our operations, and we're ready to move forward together with our customers, as we have done in the last 40 years.</p><p>So let's see our -- how our brand play together one with another. As you can see, there's a big difference from what you've seen in France, right? In France, Antoine talked about a lot Leboncoin, this fantastic position that him and his team have managed to build organically, now adding a few assets around it to make it even stronger. In Spain, situation is different.</p><p>Rolv Erik in his introduction said that no, we don't take that one solution that fix all, but we adapt our strategy to the market. So in Spain, we are different, we are presenting with many, many brands, results of our M&amp;A acquisitions. As you can see, we're present in jobs, in cars, in real estate and in generalist. So let's start looking at them one by one.</p><p>In jobs, we have a leadership position that is very strong. I said very strong, because it's a kind of leadership position that is very easy to explain, because it's #1 everywhere, right? We are #1 in traffic, in listings. We are #1 in content. We are #1 in revenues. We are #1 in margins, so whatever, we're #1. And in Milanuncios, help us -- help me for jobs to give also access to lower income jobs and temporary jobs. So with that, we're also clear leaders in terms of content.</p><p>In cars, we are very proud, very proud that we have recently managed to build industry position similar to the one that we have in jobs, very strong. Again, very easy to explain. #1 everywhere. We are #1 in traffic. We are #1 in listings. We are #1 now in customers, in revenues, in margins. And there, we have the strength of playing with both the generalist, Milanuncios, and with a leading vertical coches.net. Coches means cars, by the way.</p><p>In real estate, our position is not as strong as we have in jobs and cars. Our vertical competitor has more traffic, listing and customers of any of our vertical players taken individually. But if we join our forces, if we put together Fotocasa, Habitaclia and Milanuncios, we see that we are #1 in listings and #1 in customers. Again, this is the kind of leadership position that yes, it's there, but it's not as nice as the first 2, right? It takes a bit longer to explain. So we want to improve Fotocasa and Habitaclia and how all our brands work together so that over time, it's easier to explain this leadership as well.</p><p>In generalist, finally, we have a challenger position. We have a competitor that is app-based, that is stronger than us in the miscellaneous goods, in every goods. So in clothing, sport equipment, electronics, et cetera, et cetera. They are stronger there. I am proud and I'm happy of the fact that Milanuncios is stronger in real estate, in cars and jobs and in generalist. So Milanuncios is still stronger where it matters. Nevertheless, we want to develop Milanuncios further to reduce the gap that we have in miscellaneous goods.</p><p>Together, this position creates a lot -- okay, together these positions create a lot of value for our users, for our customers, for our shareholders, but also for our communities. So a clear example of the latter, of our impact of communities, InfoJobs. Only 2017, InfoJobs enabled 1.5 million jobs and contracts to be signed in Spain. In a country, like Spain, where unemployment rate is still pretty high, that's -- make me and my people very proud of what we do. Together, with all our brands, we also touch every month 17 million people in Spain. This means one every second person that access the Internet in Spain uses at least one of our brands every month. This is a penetration similar to what Antoine was describing for Leboncoin.</p><p>The difference is that it does it with one brand and that we do it with many, because our strategy is different. Together, also we managed to deliver some very good financial results, and this is the first time that you will see it. So I'm very happy that in 2018, in Spain, we managed to deliver EUR 160 million in revenues. This was a 16% growth versus 2017 and following on our solid growth in the last 2 years.</p><p>Now in 2017, clearly our revenues were also accelerated by the project we acquired, Habitaclia, but also after the acquisition their growth stayed strong and stable. Also, we are very proud of having beaten our -- by far, our EBITDA record for last year. So we reached EUR 47.1 million in EBITDA and get very close to 30% margins. What is nice about this? What we like about this is also that this is happening from operational leverage. Out of there, more than EUR 22 million of fresh revenues that we generated last year, approximately 60% directly translated into EBITDA. And you can see this if you could analyze our numbers, you could see this, mainly because the weight of personnel costs and marketing costs on our total revenues is decreasing, right? So the weight of personnel cost has gone down 5 percentage points, our total revenues in the past -- in the last 2 years and 4 percentage points for marketing. So it's -- numbers look good and we are proud of what we're doing.</p><p>And to keep delivering on these results, we have a clear strategy. It's pretty easy. The very strong positions that we talk -- that I spoke about at the beginning, we just want to make them even stronger. We want to solidify them. We see that there is room for growth in the market. There is room both in underlying market to grow, but also in the -- our capacity as an OLC company to capture part of this value. In real estate, we want to strengthen our position even further, playing together with our brands. And we want to reduce the gap in the miscellaneous every day in both categories when it comes to our generalist position.</p><p>While every vertical there's a clear strategy to execute, we also believe that at the company level in Adevinta Spain, we have 3 main foundations -- oh sorry, I would have said pillars, Antoine, but we have 3 main foundations that we want to build on: the first one is like our users and our customers.</p><p>We have 17 million users every month and we have tens of thousands of customers. And their expectations are ever-growing and we want to exceed them. We are putting -- we are making organizational changes and also changing the way the company works so that we get closer to our user and our customers and we put them at the center of all of our decision-making.</p><p>We also -- to do this, we also need to attract talent. So only in 2018, we hired more than 100 people. There's a previous year's model for the tech talent, in particular, in Barcelona in these days. And in order to improve our employer branding, in the next few weeks, we will move most of our talent in one single building in Barcelona in the tech district of Barcelona to get where the talent is.</p><p>Finally, as Antoine was saying, also, we believe in the power of our data and I will tell you a bit more later in my presentation on how we want to do this.</p><p>So this was the introduction. In this slide that follows, I will analyze the key vertical segments. So jobs, cars and real estate, and for each of them I will show you 4 things: first one is how the market is developing. Second is how the competitive landscape looks like. Third, our commercial metrics for them and fourth, our product development efforts. Examples of what we are doing in developing our products. So let's start with jobs. In jobs, as you know, we have the big crisis and unemployment rate skyrocketed to 26% during the crisis and now we are in a healthy recovery path. In January, February, unemployment rate was around 14.5%, but still far from the record lows that we had in 2006, '07, et cetera. So we believe that there is still room for further job creation in the market. Also, when we look at the market, we see that the total marketing spending of recruiting agencies and of corporates is estimated in 2017 to be around EUR 120 million, and roughly half of it is captured by classifieds.</p><p>We believe that there is a room for growth there. We believe that when we compare the take rate of online classifieds company, in jobs, in Spain, versus other European market, we see that there is room for growth. But we also believe that there is further room for growth when you look at adjacent businesses. We believe that there is a revenue opportunity moving in the value chain of recruiting, either upstream, for example, looking for employer branding revenues or downstream, taking part in all the business-related with recruiting and candidate selection.</p><p>So next slide, I will show you the competitive position. But before I show it, let me tell you that now what you will see will show you that in all the opportunities there, InfoJobs is the best positioned player in Spain to capture it.</p><p>So when you ask -- or actually when Ipsos asks people in Spain, where do you find the job? Where do you go when you need to find the job? Well, InfoJobs come first. 40% higher than our social network competitor and many, many times distant from the first job board. And when TNS asks, okay, does it work? Is this liquid, right? Do you find a job? Well, again, we are 30% more effective than our closest job boards, and by the way, twice as effective than the social network we were discussing before. So if you ever happen to be jobless in Spain, you know what to do.</p><p>So let's -- what I'm proud of is on the fact that this leadership, my team has managed to translate it also in commercial delivery. So if you look at our index and figures, revenues have grown by 38% in the last 2 years. This is impressive. And this is a result of mainly an increase in volumes. What is happening here is that with our -- our number of customers have increased by 69% in the last 2 years. That's mainly because we've managed to open up InfoJobs to small and medium enterprises in Spain. Small and medium enterprises are, in fact, a super important part of the economy in Spain, and with the new offering from InfoJobs, we are now able to address them with that self-service tool. So companies, small and medium companies can just buy our products on a web-based, self-service tool that represents for us a very cheap distribution channel. So no wonder, and don't get scared when you see these numbers going down, because this has mainly reflected that our customer mix is changing. We have many, many smaller companies in our mix. And by definition, small and medium enterprises hire less and hence pay us less every month.</p><p>Nevertheless, if I take the long-paying consumers out and I only focus on the customers that were already in 2017 paying us more than EUR 400 during the year, for those customers, ARPU has increased by 8%. So we keep growing the ARPU on our stable customer base, but we keep also adding new customers, smaller customers at the bottom of the pyramid.</p><p>Let's look a bit at what we're doing in terms of our product. A few examples, but there are many other things, but I think that these are 3 good examples. First of all, we are a bit paranoid about increasing constantly the quality of the information that is in the job posting and in the CV. So now we are creating incentives for companies, for employers, to be transparent about their salary range of the offer. This is something that employers in Spain don't like to do. And we are creating incentives, because it helps -- it's good for candidate, but also because with that information, we can improve our matching. We're categorizing the information that we have in the job post, but also in the CV in a way that will enable us to do automatic matching between job posts and candidates.</p><p>Also as I told you, we have attacked the small and medium enterprises in the last 2 years. So we realized that the small and medium enterprises, not always, there is an HR department that takes care of their recruiting, but many times, the recruiting was done -- is done mainly by line managers. So we developed an app for recruiters, our -- app for recruiters on the go. On your mobile, you can easily manage the recruiting process, look at candidates, filter candidates, et cetera, et cetera. Only February, 1,000 companies were using this product.</p><p>As a last example of what we're doing, I told you before that Spain is a bit crazy for tech talent lately, and that's good and we like it.</p><p>But we want to give more visibility for the companies that are looking for these positions. This is why we have now, very recently, reached an exclusive partnership with Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow is a tech community, is a giant tech community. And now in exclusivity for Spain, all the job posts that are posted at InfoJobs are automatically posted for the benefit of all the members of their Stack Overflow community. This is very good. So recapping a bit, the job sector. Market is good. It's we think growing and InfoJobs is in the best position in the market to capture all the opportunities that will come.</p><p>Let's move to motors. As you can see, also motors is -- the car business is recovering after the crisis in 2012, '13. Both new cars and used cars are growing and there are more used cars sold in Spain than the new cars. So there is approximately 1.7 used cars sold in Spain for every new car sold. Nevertheless, this is not a number that is like best in market. But when, for example, I compare my figures with Antoine, as he -- for example, the number of second-hand car transactions per capita in France is almost double than in Spain. So there is room there for growth in second-hand car business.</p><p>When we look at the total market size and addressable markets, we see that EUR 32 billion are spent in Spain every year to buy cars. Of this, EUR 2.2 billion are captured by car dealers, excluding financing services and ancillary services. And out of these, EUR 80 million are spent in marketing and only EUR 35 million are spent in classified. There is clearly room for growth. Mainly because in this EUR 80 million, there is still print, still EUR 50 million are spent every year in print and marketing, so we want to go for that. It's our job since the last 20 years, going for the print revenues. We will keep doing that. But also we believe that there is a lot of revenue potential and revenue growth coming from all the [adjacencies] of the car business.</p><p>Let's look at the competitive landscape. As I said, in Spain, Adevinta's presence with both the leading vertical, coches.net and the leading vertical -- leading generalist, sorry, Milanuncios.</p><p>Now volume is the superpower of the generalists. Conversion and modernization is the superpower of the verticals. In Spain, we play with, look here, Milanuncios is #1 everywhere when it comes to traffic, when it comes to content, when it comes to customers. It's higher than its generalist competitor. And after that, we see coches.net everywhere. Very strong position, clear position in content, in customers. We share most of our customers between Milanuncios and coches.net. And I'm particularly proud, because in the last 2 years, coches.net has also done a lot of progress in terms of traffic. So in 2 years, coches.net has doubled its traffic, and we are happy -- very happy about it.</p><p>All of these, let's say, superpowers, have translated into commercial performance. So if we index our revenues in 2016 at 100%, last year, we did 60% more. And this was mainly the result of an increase in customers, in particular, in 2018, we moved many of the smaller customers that were on Milanuncios, we convinced them to move to coches.net and buy our bundle, but we are also increasing constantly our ARPU. Now, again, don't get confused by this 5%. This is mainly because there are many, many small car dealers coming.</p><p>If I do the similar analysis that I did with InfoJobs and I only isolate the customers that in 2017, we're paying more than EUR 100 per month for most people, our ARPU increased by 25%. It is mainly because of that -- of the bundle.</p><p>Let's look what we're doing in terms of product in Coches. So first of all, I mentioned you want to buy a car in Spain, most probably, most likely your journey will start on your phone. 75% of our traffic now is mobile, and we've built our app so that they have top-notch rating. When you find a car that you want to buy, you can contact the seller directly through a chat. It's the same chat that Antoine was talking about. It is not a chat that I've developed with my team in Spain. This is the chat that comes from the group, and it's super good. Now we've mentioned that you've chatted with the seller, you are happy, you are close to make a transaction, but trust is an important barrier in Spain. You don't really put -- trust the seller, you want to do the last check. So from a few weeks now, you can check online directly from the ad page of the car that you're looking for, the history report of the car.</p><p>We can do this through a partnership that we have CARFAX that also creates for us further opportunities of revenues, because we give a lot of visibility and branding visibility through CARFAX, but also we have a revenue share deal so that for every report that comes from coches.net's users, we get a share of those revenues.</p><p>So before moving to real estate, let me recap a bit cars. We believe that we are in very strong position. We are happy with the position that we are at. We believe that the market will grow and we believe that there is significant opportunity also in the adjacencies of online classifieds, and we believe that with the vertical experience that we have in coches.net and with the breadth of reach that we have with Milanuncios, we are best positioned to capture this opportunity.</p><p>Let's move to real estate. Same story when you look at the market. The real estate market is growing in Spain, recovering from the credit crunch and from the bubble burst. But we believe that we are still distant from peak levels or from bubble levels, both in terms of number of transactions and in terms of unit pricing. So there is still room for growth. And out of the EUR 90 billion that every year, in 2017, according to our estimate, were spent in the residential property, well, real estate agents capture EUR 2.5 billion, EUR 150 million approximately are spent in marketing and classified companies capture 2/3 of that. If we compare take rates with other markets, for example, Germany or France, et cetera, we believe that there is room for growth both in the market -- in the underlying market, but also in the OLC take-rate.</p><p>Let's look at the competitive landscape. So as I told you at the beginning, Fotocasa and Habitaclia have the #2 and #3 position in the country in terms of traffic. This is fantastic for Habitaclia. Habitaclia is different from Fotocasa in a way. Fotocasa is a national player, Habitaclia is a player that is only present in certain regions of the country. In regions that represent more or less 50% of the residential transaction last year. Despite being only a regional player and on the back of our launch of Habitaclia in Madrid, we're already #3.</p><p>Now, unfortunately, there are no official sources that can split the traffic of Milanuncios into the different verticals. And if we could, well, I can tell you that Milanuncios would be in the top 4 players there as well. So yes, we are not at the #1 position yet when it comes to traffic, but we have 3 out of the 4 top positions in terms of traffic in the market. Then when you look at count -- content of the customers, again, the superpower of the generic comes back. Milanuncios is #1, followed by our vertical competitor. But here you can see that both in content and customer, the distance from Fotocasa is much smaller. So again, as I said, when I was trying to explain our strategy, we -- this is a leadership position that is not as obvious as in cars and jobs, but we want to keep working hard to make this line look better in the future.</p><p>Nevertheless, our financial performance is very strong. We have increased the revenues by 54% in the last 2 years, and clearly, 2017 was possibly affected by the acquisition of Habitaclia, but the growth has been strong and stable also in 2018. The growth is mainly the result of an increase in customers. Again, here, you see dark bar for Fotocasa, light bar for Habitaclia, representing the fact that Habitaclia is only present in certain parts of the country. Similar ARPU though between the 2 players. And we keep that ARPU stable despite an intense competitive pressure in this market in Spain.</p><p>Let's look at some of our products. So let's imagine you are [Pablo] and you are a real estate agent and the customer comes to you and asks you what should I sell my house for? Until now, Pablo should guesstimate. From a few months, Pablo can use our product, that is called DatAvenues, that is a combination of our proprietary data with third-party data and third party tools, and we believe that this is the best tool for valuation in the market right now. It's a data-driven valuation tool and we are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers. [Maria] said, she is a new user, and she wants to buy her first flat. And she received a link on her chat about a property. If she clicks it, she can now have an app-like experience on her Android phone similar to what would she have if she was -- if she had the app downloaded. So this gives a lot of improvement in terms of user experience. Our users are loving it, it's translating in better conversion, better lead generation, and contrary to what we thought at the beginning, is also boosting our downloads of apps. Because it's a very first -- good first trial from the link you see or the app look like, you'll like it and then you end up downloading it.</p><p>Finally, I wanted to show the content aggregation system that is what we're building to give to our users an exposure to a wider catalog and to give to our real estate agents access to a broader audience. So the content aggregation system makes so that when you have applied your filters for the house you are looking for on Habitaclia, at the end of your result page, you are able to see Fotocasa ads that match that exact search. In this way, you can have in one spot all the possible parts that we can offer you.</p><p>So synthesizing the position of real estate, it's not as strong as in the cars and jobs. We believe that we have a strong position as a combination of the power of Milanuncios, Fotocasa and rapid growth of Habitaclia. We want to improve that position and we believe that there is room for growth, because the market has still potential for growth.</p><p>Finally, before I conclude, I told you that we believe in the power of data. We believe on the fact that we are collecting an unparallel set of data in Spain, and we believe that this can help us to increase our relevance, our engagement, our accuracy, our safety in our marketplaces. So let me give you an example. My wife is a heavy user of our products.</p><p>From the information we collect from her with her consent, we know her demographic information, we know her salary from InfoJobs, we know her hobbies, we know that she likes to cook, we know where she lives, we know what she dreams, she [believe]; we know that she's looking for the smallest car possible that can fit 2 kids and a dog and we know that she would never be interested in a motorbike. All of these information can help us to give her better advertising, better recommendation, help her to taking better transaction decision. We believe that this is a fantastic opportunity.</p><p>Now there's only one company, only one online classified company in Spain that can reach this level of information and that is Adevinta. So let me close, just recapping my remarks. Adevinta has been in Spain for more than 40 years. We know our market, our users, our customers very well. We are the leading online classified company in the market. We are the largest. We have revenues that are growing very healthy and profitability is growing even faster. We have a multi-brand strategy. We have many brands. We are present in all the key important segments. We are leaders, clear leaders in jobs and cars, and we want to improve our position in real estate.</p><p>Finally, we believe that we are collecting a lot of data, and over time, we are best positioned to make a fantastic use of this data. Thanks a lot.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: All right. Thank you, Gianpaolo. We'll soon have a break, but first, before that, we'll have a Q&amp;A session for 10 minutes on Spain. So anyone wants to deep dive? Yes?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: How can -- let me start with this, sorry, why having so many brands and not only one?</p><p>GIANPAOLO SANTORSOLA: Well, this is the result of our strategy, right? The way we've built in -- our position in Spain is different from what we did in France and is the result of many acquisitions. And with every asset we acquired, we realize it is a lot of brands. So there's a lot of brand recognition in that brand. And thinking of changing that brand or moving to a single brand is not something that would work for us and for our users. For sure, honestly, I would love to have only one brand, right, because I have many to feed, but we believe that it is still the best choice.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Yes, question here on the right hand.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Is InfoJobs participating with Google for Jobs or are you planning to? And the broader question, what are you seeing in the competition with Google for Jobs, Facebook, Indeed competition and in Vibbo with Facebook Marketplace?</p><p>GIANPAOLO SANTORSOLA: Yes. So we are not participating, I believe, with Google for Jobs. Other than Blink, we have decided not to do it. We believe, we don't need it anyway. We are the strong leaders. We don't need the Vibbo. Nevertheless, coming through your broader question, we have a lot of respect for these global players that are coming. And we are used to compete with the global brands all over our history. And we believe that competition improves us and is a fantastic stimulus to improve us. We hope that the competition comes with fair terms and fair regulation. But this said, we are very happy with the position we have. And for the time being, we don't see a lot of user traction, right? So if I give you the example, yes, I'm a bit worried because Google for Jobs has very rapidly, very rapidly achieved a lot of content and when it comes to user engagement, we still believe that we have a great margin. Did I answer?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: There is a question in the back.</p><p>ANDERS WENNBERG: Anders Wennberg from Catella. Further on the competition, if you compare France, Sweden and Norway, they have done perfectly well all the time and kept the leadership position. But it seems like Spain has been more challenged more often. And Milanuncios used to be a challenger to you that you have to acquire and then Wallapop popped up. Can you explain a bit what is the difference in the structure in this Spanish market? Why this new competition was kind of appearing and not in the other markets?</p><p>GIANPAOLO SANTORSOLA: Well, more than trying to explain, I think rather observed, right? What is observable is that it seems that the people in generalist position is more difficult to keep that position. That product users are more inclined to quickly shift to something else where that something else is easy and free. And that was what happened with Milanuncios and then there was -- what happened also with Wallapop. So, yes, there might be something structural, but it's what it is. And we keep working hard on Milanuncios to improve it every day. And we believe that the team is doing very good progress.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: I think it's fair to say that this has not affected us when it comes to monetizing on the verticals. I mean, you have a different market and we have very strong vertical positions. And that progress is going very well. Yes, Martin.</p><p>MARTIN STENSHALL: I just wanted to follow up on the question about running certain brands and multiple platforms. I can see that you have Milanuncios and Vibbo in cars, you also had in generalist, would it be an opportunity to kind of merge the 2 of them? That's the first question. And the other question is basically about product development. How does it really work, for example, when we think cars, with regards to Coches, Motos, Milanuncios and Vibbo doing cars, are you able to do product development in cars that kind of run on 4 of them? Or to an extent you have to do adjustments to have the new product run on all 4 platforms?</p><p>GIANPAOLO SANTORSOLA: So thanks, good question. So the first question on Vibbo and Milanuncios. We are happy with having both. It's clear internally that we are putting all our bets -- or most of our bets on Milanuncios, all our product development is in Milanuncios. We don't spend any marketing around -- on Vibbo. But Vibbo is an organic way of existing -- it generates leads, is strong in some parts of Spain, in some islands. It's very strong, Vibbo, so we will keep it and we are happy with having it. But our priority in terms of product development and brand building is Milanuncios. When it comes to how the different platform play together, well, as I said, Coches and Motos are a -- have a very similar platform. And over time, we want to completely merge it. So there I would have only one platform. Vibbo, I don't want to develop that platform further, so it is only the Coches platform and the Milanuncios platform. And on those, we are breaking our code, our monolith, in modules, so that we can develop common component or use common component that comes from the group.</p><p>MARTIN STENSHALL: Well that's also been the case for Fotocasa and have they -- sorry about the pronunciation.</p><p>GIANPAOLO SANTORSOLA: So the 2 products are different now. All this time, I don't exclude that we will try on the back end part, from the data part, to try to converge to some common data platform.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: A couple more questions with Gianpaolo before we take our break, if any. Here's a question on the front.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can you tell us a little bit about the new cars -- can you tell us a bit about the new cars market? And whether you see a strong opportunity there for Coches?</p><p>GIANPAOLO SANTORSOLA: Yes. It's a -- we are in a great business because it's our prioritization business. So 1 year ago, we had to prioritize on whether capturing the secondhand market opportunity or looking at new cars. And we decided to focus much more on secondhand because we knew that there is more to gas for the time being. Still, we looked carefully on the new car segment, and actually we're doing experiments. So there are more than 6,000 new cars now on coches.net despite we do not like advertising them very loudly because we are testing continuously a solution that still works for car dealers and car brands at the same time. But no, we like the opportunity.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Final question over here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: There was reference in the Leboncoin presentation about cross-listing in real estate and actually that you're forcing agents to do it now? I'm wondering why you don't do that in Spain. My thought is that it would -- does it not apply, for some reason? Wouldn't it strengthen both or all 3, frankly, of the assets, if you put a listing up on all 3?</p><p>GIANPAOLO SANTORSOLA: So we give freedom to our customers to choose, if they want to use one, the other or both. We don't force them at this point in time, mainly because the coverage is different and the tools and the platform is different, right? So we still have separate commercial force, separate CRM, et cetera, et cetera, and also different coverage. Nevertheless, as I showed you in the content aggregation system, this will enable us to show content from Fotocasa, Habitaclia, from Habitaclia to Fotocasa.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So it's mostly a geographical coverage point, is that -- I mean, I guess, my question is why would that apply so nicely on France? We heard the positive results, but not apply in Spain? I can understand if it's a geographical coverage point. But if it is overlapping geography, it should be the same logic, no?</p><p>GIANPAOLO SANTORSOLA: Well, the real overlapping geographies is in Catalonia and there we have strong customer relationships, if you want to manage carefully.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Right. Okay. Then I think we're ready for our break. So please be back in 15 minutes. There are coffee and refreshments outside and then we will with start Brazil in 15 minutes. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: All right. Welcome back to the final part of the session. Please find your seat. We're now moving to next part of the presentation, and I'm very proud to present to you Andries, who has left his family on vacation and come to join us for this day. Andries had started actually working in Schibsted, which I think I believe it was in 2008.</p><p>And 2 years later, he moved to Brazil where he was the first employee and the founder of the company Bom Neg\u00c3\u00b3cio and has been running it since. And of course, he oversaw the merger with the Naspers [site] OLX and has been running that also since the merger. So please welcome on stage, Andries.</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Thank you, Rolv Erik. Really happy to be here with all of you. This is a really important day for Brazil, not only because there is this great group of people talking about Brazil together. But you probably all know Chinese New Year, but there is also such thing as Brazilian New Year, right? And you might think, \"Oh, it's the 1st of January, right? But in reality today, today is the first working day after the summer holidays in Carnival, and today is when Brazil really starts running. And the really important news is that the new Congress is now starting to work and there's some really important reforms coming for the economy and for security that we all believe will be a great propeller for a new phase of growth for Brazil. And we are really going to take advantage of that, because we believe that Brazil has a great opportunity.</p><p>The market is much bigger than we expected when we entered into the market. We now think that we have an addressable market of about $5 billion, which is really one of the biggest markets that Adevinta is going after. We also think we have a great starting point to go after this opportunity. We have a top-of-mind brand in many different segments. And we have a very strong local team with strong talents, 600 people, extremely passionate about this journey of changing the consumption model in Brazil. We've already started to enter in several of the key verticals. We are already either in cars, we're building a leadership position in real estate and there's several further verticals where we will enter in the next few years.</p><p>We've also got a great structure. We've got the 2 biggest classifieds group in the world. On the one side, Adevinta and Schibsted; on the other side OLX Group and Naspers, who are really strategic investors in this industry. They really believe in Brazil as a key markets and are giving us full access to all the knowledge and technology that exists in both groups. So it's a great position to be in and we are learning from the best, and we really think that is a key strength in going after this market opportunity.</p><p>So just to look a little backwards. Over the past 8 years have been an incredible journey for myself, like what Rolv Erik said, I moved here in 2011 because I really believe this is an incredible market, huge number of consumers that still needs to learn this new consumption model.</p><p>In 2011, both Schibsted and Naspers starts to invest heavily in building the brand, building the category. And in 2015, we joined forces and really consolidated all the buyers and sellers and the brands into 1 marketplace. That really helped us to propel further growth and to increase further network FX. We started to focus on monetization, building verticals in cars and real estate. And now 2018 was a key milestone that we are profitable. So what we've got now is really a #1 position in end-users and many other metrics.</p><p>More than 6 million daily users. More than 80% of those are mobile, which is clearly the best platform for marketplaces, but we're also one of the top 20 sites in Brazil with more than 50 million monthly visitors.</p><p>So there's this big market opportunity I was talking about, $5 billion is a great market opportunity and much bigger than we expected. Like Antoine and Gianpaolo had been talking about before, there are many adjacencies that are very relevant in these markets, all right? So all these key verticals exist in Brazil also: cars, real estate, jobs and others. But it's not just about listings, someone who needs a car, they also need financing, insurance and other services to make the whole process more seamless. And in Brazil, probably these adjacencies are even bigger than in some other markets because, for example, the banking spreads are much larger in Brazil, thus making car financing a much more attractive than in some other markets.</p><p>And looking at the past few years, we've already shown very solid growth in more than 50% annual growth in revenues looking in euros. When you look in local currency it's more than 70%. And also you can really see the operating leverage that we've got with this model. So nearly all the extra revenues and extra customers we bring onboard, we can do with existing organizations, existing operations. So our costs only grew about 10% to 15% per year in the times we're growing revenues more than 70%.</p><p>So it's really showing this business is extremely scalable and we expect that to continue going forward, as how we turn this loss-making business in 2016 into a profitable business in 2018.</p><p>And we're really standing on the shoulders of giants here, right? We didn't invent this whole model ourselves. We're looking very closely at what Leboncoin did starting in 2016 -- 2006, and also what Avito did in Russia. Those are 2 benchmarks we have. We look at them very closely, we exchange a lot of knowledge with them and you can see our revenues have been following a very similar trend to them, with the last 6 years delayed to Leboncoin and 4 years delayed to Avito, and we expect to be able to continue that even though probably our strategy is different now than it was back then, we expect that the potential is the same.</p><p>We're now, more or less, at a level of revenues that Avito had when Naspers acquired the majority. That was at a valuation of $2.4 billion. So this clearly shows also the value of the markets. And GDP is more or less the same. I think you compare France, Russia and Brazil, they are similar in size of GDP, and we think also similar in size of the classifieds opportunity.</p><p>So let's talk about our biggest assets and the biggest value, that's our top-of-mind brand. So if you ask any person in Brazil on the street, where would you buy or sell a good, or buy or sell a car, or buy or sell real estate, they always mention OLX first. So if you first look on the horizontal level, the key competitor there is MercadoLibre. This is more or less kind of an Amazon of Latin America. So they have shifted their focus from C2C used goods more to B2C new goods, and they have been very successful with that and they're very strong also in end payments and delivery. And we see this reflected also when you look at top-of-mind of selling, you see the gap between OLX and MercadoLibre is much bigger because consumers now primarily see MercadoLibre is a place where they buy goods and not to sell things. We also have a new entrant which entered last year, that's Facebook Marketplace. So it's the first new entrant that actually showed up on the charts because it is very difficult to enter such a competitive market with strong network effects. Of course, Facebook has some key advantages there, but they have not really entered the mind of the consumers yet as a place to buy and sell. And where you really see the value of this top-of-mind brand is when you enter the verticals, right? Because there we have a huge advantage versus the vertical players. So you see the gap in top-of-mind versus the key vertical players in any of these verticals.</p><p>And this is without any marketing investment in the verticals. So even before we started to think about real estate, we were already top-of-mind in real estate. So it really shows the strength of this horizontal model that was pioneered by Leboncoin and others in Scandinavia, and we really think that we'll continue to leverage this and use OLX as the core brands in each of these verticals.</p><p>So let me tell you a bit about our key pillars, to use Antoine's language. We have 3 key pillars for this year that we're focusing on. The first one and really important is to continue growing our users. Because we really believe that we're only halfway there in this journey of converting Brazilians to this new consumer model, right? When we entered Brazil, nobody believed that this model would work in Brazil, we're never going to buy and sell online used goods from people who don't know, it doesn't make any sense.</p><p>And now a lot of people already started using that, but we believe that sales model can be much bigger, right? And when we benchmark against OLX and other mid-income markets, we believe we can double the number of users in the next 5 years. The second front is about verticals and monetization. We have already started to enter in cars and real estate and continue to focus on those. We see big potential to grow further, and we're started to develop the next verticals.</p><p>The third front is our technology and organization. We're investing a lot in machine learning and data, same what you've heard from Antoine and Gianpaolo, and we are hiring 100 new product and tech talents in Brazil this year. Until now, with technology is 100% local, but we are starting to share more and more knowledge with both OLX Group and Adevinta because we believe there's a lot of synergies and there's a lot of things we can do together. So that is something we expected to do more in the future.</p><p>So just explain to you why you why cars and real estate still are the main focus. Here you see how penetrated we are in the markets. The total number of dealers and the dealers that are using OLX, about 25% is using OLX now. And it's partly because many are not even using the Internet and they are still primarily offline and the ones that are online are not all using OLX yet. So clearly, we're just in the beginning of penetrating these markets and we will continue to focus on those as a primary source of revenue growth in the next few years. And there's many different ways to show that there's huge market potential. I can talk about this for the whole day. Just to show you a few more data points here. If you look at online -- if you look at ad spend for cars, only 5% goes to classifieds sites, and we think we can grow that a lot.</p><p>Also new cars is a big opportunity where we are talking with several of the brands to use classifieds in a better way. And also when you look at international benchmarks, you see that the penetration of car classifieds versus, in general, commonly is still very underpenetrated, which means we believe that the cats, we can really outgrow the total economy in the next few years.</p><p>And you also see that the car market has really started to recover. So Brazil went through a very tough recession. And in the last few years, people really started to regain confidence in the market. And you really see that also in car acquisitions, where we started to grow. And we expect this to continue in the year going forward.</p><p>So when you look at our competitive position, this is like what Gianpaolo would call an easy to explain slide. We have a very clear leadership position on all metrics in cars. If you look at traffic, if you look at used also if you look at revenues, we are the market leader in cars. And that key competitors are Webmotors and iCarros which are owned by 2 of the biggest banks and the Autoline is also owned by a bank. So these are the key competitors. Why do banks own these classifieds sites? Because the importance of car financing in Brazil and they really see this as an acquisition channel for leads. We have also started to work with those banks. So when these banks see that their own vertical is not enough to capture the full market opportunity and also want to work with OLX to capture more leads and it's a big opportunity for us. MercadoLibre shows up here because they are very strong in car parts. This is a market we have not started to look at yet but is also a big opportunity for OLX.</p><p>So if you look at our revenue growth over the past few years, we managed to quadruple revenues in cars since 2016, and that's driven both by penetration of the markets and acquiring many more professionals. It was back then in 2016, we were a C2C site primarily with some professionals using it via C2C channels. And then we really started to develop the B2B channels, required a lot more professionals and really started to establish OLX as a key player in the car market. And we also managed to make our solution much more complete, which allows us to increase ARPUs over time and really showed that we are delivering value to our customers.</p><p>So this is just the beginning. There's a lot of investments we still need to do, so we're going to continue to penetrate the markets and get all of the professionals in OLX. And this really also means being perceived as a key partner for the professionals. It is something that, although we are clearly the leader in the eyes of the consumer, I think professionals there's still a long way to go for them to really see that OLX is only key place they need to be. It has a lot to do with building great tools, building our brand. We've also launched a specific vertical site called Autoline with only professional content to further strengthen the relationship with the professionals. We're also going to work a lot on the buyer experience and verticalized experience to help people in their journey to find what is the best car for them and also to select the best dealer and the best price. And we started to develop adjacencies. We already mentioned financing as a key one, but also insurance, and also looking at end-to-end flow of buying and selling a car and adding on various services to be able to really make that whole flow seamless. Because when you really think about removing friction, actually the whole process of posting and negotiating, on OLX it's actually reasonably frictionless, but there is a whole offline process which is extremely -- with extreme friction, right? And especially in Brazil, it's definitely not easy to transfer a car or get to financing and all these other processes. So to really make the end-to-end process of C2C see as good as it is with a dealer, there's a lot of additional adjacencies we need to develop, which will be great for our users and also really expanding opportunity for OLX.</p><p>So this is what I had to tell about cars, but now looking at real estate. It's also a really interesting but a little bit different situation. There's a few things that are different in Brazil from other markets. One thing is the importance of new properties, the developers. It's a very big market, with about half of the marketing spend in real estate is for new properties. And this is something we have only barely started to go after this market. It's a huge opportunity because people who are close to the Brazilian real estate market know that the mass markets -- new properties is where the big growth is. And OLX is in a very strong position and we have already started some partnerships with mass market developers, the Minha Casa, Minha Vida developers to go after this market and the first results are very good. And you can also see the real estate market is much less developed than the car markets and we are still very far behind some of the international benchmarks. So we expect this market to mature over the next 5 to 10 years. And this is really about educating professionals in the market on how to digitalize their business and to better use digital channels for marketing their properties. And yet the same effect in real estate as you have in cars, that as the economy is recovering now, interest rates are at a record low, which really is boosting financing and investment. And you see in the past few years we have already seen growth and optimism is extremely high, especially in the key S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo markets where there's a lot of construction and property purchasing going on. But when you look at competitive situation, the real estate story is a little bit more complicated than in cars.</p><p>Last year, 2 key competitors, Viva Real and ZAP, they merged, so they are now one company. They are owned by Globo, which is the biggest media company in Brazil and several financial investors. And this is really tough competitor to be up against. And so we are largest in visits on an individual basis, but if you add up the 2, we are #2. And also in content and dealers, we have a lot of room to grow. But we have like a few key insights here, right? This market is extremely early still, so you cannot really speak about the defendable leadership position, right? And these shifts at Adevinta, I always talk about, okay, what is a defensible market position? One of the key criteria there is that the market needs a certain level of maturity. And we believe that this market is not there yet, so this is not really a defendable leadership position that cannot be challenged. So the main challenge for all of us is going to be to develop this market, to digitalize it. And also we have this incredible asset, which is top-of-mind brands. So everybody in Brazil who thinks about real estate, thinks about OLX. That's a huge opportunity and it's very difficult to replicate that for the others.</p><p>So we really believe that with those 2 assets, we really can build a leadership position. And we've seen over the past year since their merger, that we've been growing much faster than ZAP/Viva Real. And also, we have been able to acquire a lot of their talents who believe a lot in the growth opportunity of OLX.</p><p>So looking at real estate, even though that was quite a competitive market, we've still been able to triple revenues. You can see that a big part of revenue growth comes from penetrating the markets, which is really crucial to get the entire market on a site, to have a complete database of properties. Here we had a little bit less growth in ARPUs especially because we want to be cautious with price increases, so we've been adding a lot of functionality and results without increasing prices a lot, because we really want to capture the entire market.</p><p>And we are really investing heavily to further improve our products. So we have continued to really focus on penetration as the key thing to get this complete database of properties, which is really important when a buyer comes to our site, they can trust that all the properties are there.</p><p>We're also improving the whole buyer experience, verticalizing it to make it much easier for people to find properties, to help them in their decision-making of where they want to live, what price, how to negotiate. And also, yes, we are looking at really improving our professional tools. So there's a lot of demand from professionals in this sector to have a much more complete set of tools, including CRM systems, administration systems for the dealerships, the data, other intelligence to really help them optimize their business, and those are things we can uniquely offer to them.</p><p>So there is another really important segment apart from cars and real estate that I can tell you about, and that is jobs. This is a market where Adevinta is not only active with OLX, but also with InfoJobs. This is a site that has been able to grow traffic really fast over the past few years when there was a big unemployment and lower job seekers. And now it is really in a good position to take advantage of the economic upturn and also grow revenues and there's still a very big gap versus the market leader, Catho, in revenues, owned by SEEK. And also OLX is a brand that we are looking after with jobs, especially blue-collar jobs is a segment that we think could be really big for OLX, both as a new vertical for monetization but also as an engagement driver.</p><p>Because like I said, there's a lot of people in Brazil looking for blue-collar jobs.</p><p>So as a summary of the key messages here, Brazil is a huge market with a great opportunity. We have an excellent starting point to go after this opportunity with very strong brands and user base and team. We've already started to develop some of the key verticals and there are many more to come and we have the best shareholders you can imagine with huge support from both Adevinta and OLX group. So now I'd like to open for some questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Thank you very much, Andries. I know that there are many interested in Brazil and I think it's a productive development as we've already seen in the last year, so I'm sure there are many questions. Here, starting with one in the back there.</p><p>ANDERS WENNBERG: Anders Wennberg from Catella. A couple of questions. First, one about MercadoLibre, I realize they're a different animal that pushed more into e-commerce and into payments. But still they deal with classified and they seem very aggressive. They've pushed down their margins from 30% to negative or 0. Do you think they could become more aggressive also in the classifieds market?</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Definitely they could be, like I showed MercadoLibre has very strong brand just behind OLX. They have made some inroads into classifieds, both cars and real estate over the past years but without big success in Brazil. They've had success in some other markets. It doesn't seem to be the big focus for them now. You mentioned the big investments they're doing. That is primarily in offering free shipping on their B2C business which is quite similar to Amazon. And -- so but we are watching them closely and I think it's a great company. And of course, we have to take them very seriously but we actually see the overlap with MercadoLibre reduce over time over the past few years.</p><p>ANDERS WENNBERG: I also wonder, if you look at the sister companies, Leboncoin has obviously been very successful and also FINN and [Oui] et cetera, while Subito in Italy has completely failed. What can you learn from these 2? How can Brazil become more like France than Italy? Is there any learnings to do?</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Yes, I wouldn't say Subito is a complete failure. But yes, so I think that's one of the big questions I think as many people have asked in Schibsted over the past few years, what explains the difference between Leboncoin and Subito. And I think a big asset that we have which is very similar to Leboncoin is just very strong brands and a very strong user base and a very strong engagements, right? And I think it all starts with that. And once you have that asset, I think all the other problems can be solved and I think that is something that's been again a key strategy for us and the key learning we took from Leboncoin that the first focus always has to be on building a very strong brand and engaged user base.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: I think also the timing was good to attack the verticals, the way that you have been doing. So whereas in Italy, you have a very strong incumbent, both in the real estate and in the cars sector. So Martin and then another I think.</p><p>MARTIN STENSHALL: Are you able to offer any, let's say, thoughts about financial aspirations, targets for Brazil? Obviously, a great growth so far. And we were with the slide, looking at the monetization level for [OLX], I think it was 6 assets, we saw in Brazil still in a very low territory. So please some comments on that and also any comments if you can on margin over the longer term. Thank you.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: The margin is heading north, we can say that, but we don't go out with specific margin targets. But the business, you can talk about.</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Obviously, they are very ambitious and we look at some of the benchmarks like Leboncoin and Avito and try to replicate their success. But of course, every market is different and yes, we really see ample opportunity both in cars and real estate to penetrate the market, increase ARPUs and also there are many different verticals that we haven't even mentioned here yet that we can -- want to go after the next few years. So I think, yes, the growth will continue for many more years.</p><p>MARTIN STENSHALL: Would it be then reasonable to assume that the margin uptick could be as in Avito, since you made the example of being at X amount of years behind Avito?</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: I think both Leboncoin and Avito had very high margins early on. I think that was a reflection also the market was different back then. I think the complexity of the business has increased a lot. So now we actually develop for 4 different platforms and competing against some global players. So our cost base has increased a lot earlier on than they did. It's difficult to say something about the long-term profitability. But I think yes, in the short-term, you cannot expect to see the same uplift as you've see in Leboncoin and Avito 6 years ago.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: I think Aditya is next, just behind you. Okay? Thank you.</p><p>ADITYA BUDDHAVARAPU: [Lerten] your revenue growth has been quite impressive. But could you give some more color on the competitive environment in real estate? And if it has intensified since Zap acquired Viva Real?</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Yes. So we were actually not totally unhappy with this merger happening. Because before we had 2 competitors, now we only have 1. And we've actually not seen that it is bad for us. We've actually seen, yes, a lot of receptiveness in the market, who want to have OLX as a competitor to Zap Viva Real. And we've been growing much faster than they have. If you look at metrics like the number of dealers, the -- so the number of ads, we've been growing much faster. But yes, I think they've been in a situation where after the merger, they have a lot of internal challenges. So we have to see, yes, what's going to happen when they get their act together. I think it's a very serious competitor. Yes, but like I mentioned, I think it's mainly about developing the market now which both of us are doing. And I think in such an early market. It will take a long time before you really get consolidation, right? So we think that we can both grow in parallel, developing the market. But yes, in the long-term, I think one, we need to win. And I think with our top of mind brand, I think we are the best placed to do that.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Other questions? Now you have the chance, it's not that often that Andries is available, he's normally in Brazil, of course.</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Okay, thank you.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: There's one in the middle there with Mark -- [Markus].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Andries, I'll ask the margin question in a different way. Just we turn profitable in Brazil, but can you basically rule out that we're going to see losses in the next 2 or 3 years? Is that -- given that the competitive environment is it really that we should think about margins going north?</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Sorry, I didn't completely understand the question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Basically, is it a gradual improvement for margins from here, or is there a risk that you feel that you need to invest more and we might see losses again for a short period of time?</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Yes, we don't really do any forward-looking statements there. But no indications at the moment.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: No, see I think the main message here is that we are very confident about the progress that Brazil is making and then I think of course they navigate in markets like we all do that are dynamic and sometimes you need to do investments, then it's not possible to really foresee exactly when and where they come. But the main thing is that Brazil OLX is going very well. There's a lot of opportunities ahead.</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: We think extremely long-term, right? And we want to win each of these verticals in the long-term. So if needed, we will make investments necessary. But if not, I think we can keep on growing our top line which a big part of the top line growth translates our equity in profits.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: I can say also that both the shareholders have the same view because Naspers have similar experience and also Avito, et cetera. So they also take the long-term view that we're building this business for the long-term. Right. There's one question here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Without talking guidance or margins or anything, is there any area where you see feel you're underinvested today and you wish you could invest more?</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: No, not really. Actually, we have this discussion often with our 2 shareholders and we really have full commitments that if we need to invest more, we can do it. We are definitely not in the mode of milking the business. Really, we have strong focus on user growth and also investing in that. And also, yes, if we see we need to make acquisitions or other investments to really accelerate the path to leadership, we are definitely willing to do that.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: [Marcel]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can I ask, you still have quite a low penetration with real estate agents and car dealers. To get that up to much higher levels, you need a substantially bigger sales force. Are you now regionally focused towards it nationwide? Just want to understand why this penetration is so low.</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Yes, we have been scaling up our sales force recently quite a lot. We have now regional key account force all across Brazil with primary focus on S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo which is 40% of the economy in Brazil. And we also have telesales force which attacks the whole country. But definitely we'll see further increasing that sales force as a key part of penetrating the market. But it's also a question of time, right? So I think when we started looking at professionals, nobody was considering OLX as a key player. Often in the real estate agents, they -- a lot of the individual agents were using OLX secretly. But the boss of the agent never heard of OLX and thought it was for consumers only, and this takes time. It was a very conservative industry. So we'll be doing a lot to educate the market about how they can use OLX and establish OLX as a key B2B brand also in the sector. And we see that starting to pay off because it will take a few more years before everybody is on board.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: I think it's [Bjern] in the middle there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: [Bjern Ikalb]. I was wondering, the joint venture with Naspers, between Naspers and Adevinta, does it have a termination date or is there a shoot-out clause arrangement for terminating it? Or will it run forever?</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: No, we don't comment on any of those things. Just saying that I think, we have 2 shareholders, they're both committed for the long-term development of this company. There's a question here on the left-hand side.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can you comment about the dynamics of the car market in Brazil? You mentioned that financing is really important. Just wondering if people buy the car on financing and then at the end, they retain ownership or is it more like a PCP type of market?</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Yes, so the majority buys the car with financing and they retain ownership of the car afterwards. Yes, so it's -- and often, the financing is acquired through the dealer. So big part of what we're also trying to develop is now the financing for C2C which is a market that doesn't work as well. So we really expect this market to grow a lot in Brazil.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And how often do people change cars? Like in the U.K., I think it's about every -- well, it's more often than other markets, so just wondering what it's like in Brazil.</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: It's actually very far -- very often. So I think when we benchmark internationally the ratio of new cars versus used cars, I think in Brazil, number of used cars is like 5x as big as the number of new cars sold which I think is one of the highest in the world. So it's a very dynamic market.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: There's one in the back here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Sorry, let me just go first. You are showing in your presentation slides that you're showing there is static relative positions in terms of traffic. Can you provide us with some updates in terms of the evolution of traffic and user engagement since you have significantly dialed back from the heavy investments, just so to provide some level of visibility or assurance to investors that your historical quality of investment is high enough and your current level of investment is -- will not accelerate from here? I guess I'm just trying to ask the same question as previous attendees in a different way.</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Yes, yes. So since the merger in 2015, I think our growth profile has changed a lot, right, because before it was really TV driven growth and when we consolidated the 2 marketplaces and brought all the buyers and sellers together, we saw liquidity increase a lot. People sell much faster. And that really helped to generate a lot of organic growth. So basically in the years afterwards, we actually continue to grow at the same speed as before the merger but with much less investments. I think growth has become lower in the past few years, because it gets more and more difficult to grow. But like I said, we still expect to be able to double the number of users in the next 5 years. So it's a growth of plus 15% per year. And that's not really so much driven by heavy media spend, right? We actually have about 600,000 new listers every month, posting for the first time on OLX. And the big challenge is actually to get them to have a great experience, right, and to sell fast to have good customer satisfaction. We think that will be the main driver to really turn these trial users into a recurring habit because that will be the main driver of growth. So it's not so much a media investment as it is a tech investment. That's why we really are scaling up our products and tech force in Brazil and really making sure that we have a world-class product that people really want to return to. And we don't expect that we, on the generalist level have to go back to some of the investments that we had in the past.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: One final question, and that goes to [Beli Leferge] in the back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I don't think you could pick 2 higher-quality shareholders to support you in your growth. But how do you access their respective technology platforms, given they're also competitors? And are you as free, say, to choose the advances that Leboncoin are making than -- versus Avito or is there some conflict there?</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Yes, we actually have a contract in place with both companies to have full access to their knowledge and their technology. So actually what we are already doing is basically visiting all the different companies and head offices to learn what they're doing and also share what we are doing in Brazil. Actually, using some of their components is a little bit more difficult for us than it is for some of the other businesses because some of these components are somewhat linked to other components in the platform. But it's definitely something we are looking into. So we are working very much closer. And that's really something that's been changing now for the past 6 months where also you had the majority of the tech stack of both the OLX Group and Adevinta has increased a lot, and I think now is a good point for us to see how we can share more technology.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Right. Thank you very much, Andries.</p><p>ANDRIES OUDSHOORN: Thank you.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: We wish you a safe journey back and a Happy New Year. And a good business year coming up. Here we are moving on and now, we've been through our 3 largest segments. And now, but we still have an interesting presentation for you. Because now we are going to talk about our, what we call the Global Markets which is the rest of a very diversified and interesting portfolio. To present that, please welcome on stage, Ovidiu Solomonov. Ovidiu has been working in central functions in Schibsted, both strategically and especially in classified the last 5 years, has been responsible for this portfolio a little bit less than 1 year. Ovidiu?</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: Thank you, Rolv Erik. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm really excited to be here and give you a deeper look into the Global Markets story. I hope I can convey that excitement. I've heard already a veiled question towards Italy and Subito's success. So I'm hoping to address that head on a little bit later on.</p><p>Before getting to the pillars -- right, we love pillars, we get that -- one big message that I really hope I can pass over, we see significant untapped potential in this part of the portfolio. I think we are present in very attractive geographies. So it's a diversified mix. We are covering more than 300 million people. So that's exciting. We have the building blocks in place. Right? So we have strong brands and we have strong traffic generation and you've already heard how important that is. We are converging our technology base. And I think that is especially important for us because we are benefiting a lot from those common components and developments. Last but not least, we are verticalizing both our products and our commercial approach. And this is the key driver for monetization.</p><p>Now a deeper look at the portfolio. So it is diversified, right? The whole map didn't even fit properly on the slide. So it is geographically diverse. We are touching 4 continents and it is diverse in terms of maturity, right? So we are touching a pretty broad scale of maturity levels.</p><p>Now we are looking at 2 main levers when managing this portfolio. One key tenet is moving all assets towards profitability, right? So we have mature assets that are already profitable and that increasing their operating leverage and we are moving all the investment phased assets towards profitability, that's rule #1. Rule #2 is actively managing the portfolio. So we are continuously looking for opportunities to strengthen our positions wherever attractive and feasible. And we are also reviewing our performance in terms of generating value.</p><p>Now a quick look at the larger assets, right, so again, you've seen many clear wins, not so clear wins. It's obvious, it's not obvious. In our case, looking at the 4, let's say, most mature markets. We are seeing leading positions in the generalist. We are already leading in cars in all of them. In Hungary's case, we are actually having the #1 and #2 positions. We are already leaders in real estate in Ireland and Austria and challenger positions in Italy and Hungary. And in quite a few countries, we have good challenger positions in jobs. So I think this is a very good place to start from. Again, the key driver and the next enabler to put on top of this is verticalizing our product through those -- through that converging technology and common components and verticalizing our sales approach.</p><p>Looking at financials, right? So this part of the portfolio, how does it look, how did we manage to do so far? In the past 2 years, we've seen good revenue growth across the whole portfolio and we've seen that trickle into profitability, right? So both in mature markets where we have been improving our leverage. Also in investment phase assets where we have been getting much closer to breakeven. Now we are not guiding, but we are expecting this trend to continue. So we are looking to be a profitable part of the portfolio within the next years.</p><p>Now looking a bit -- we selected some of the large countries and giving you a bit more detail on that. Now in Ireland, we operate through a JV with a local partner, Distilled Media. And our approach in Ireland is quite similar to what we are doing in Spain, right? So it's a vertical-first approach. Now in real estate, we are present through Daft. Now Daft, if you don't know it, you can think of it as the right move of Ireland in terms of traction, penetration with agents. Not yet in terms of monetization and we are working to get that. And I think this is the key message, that I think we have a very strong position. We are continuously developing our product, focusing on data-driven products and capturing much more of that available revenue pool.</p><p>DoneDeal has historically been a journalist operation with a very strong presence in motor. Now what we have done in the past year-and-a-bit is emphasize that development in motor. So we are much more aggressive with our product development in motor and we are commercially pushing more upmarket and attracting professional leaders. And that's working really well and we will continue to do that.</p><p>Now Adverts is a generalist operation. It's rather strong in Dublin and it works much like Milanuncios in Spain, delivering good leads for the verticals.</p><p>Now to Austria. Austria is an interesting country because it is small, it is rich and it didn't yet fully do the transition to online. So Internet penetration is high but the classified spend is still offline. So there's quite a bit of radio, of print in there. So we see good potential going forward.</p><p>In terms of playbook. This is the traditional Leboncoin-like playbook. So you can think of Willhaben as the Leboncoin of Austria. So it's a strong, generalist brand and traffic machine that made a good transition into the verticals. It's now leading in cars and real estate and is the challenger in jobs. So the blueprint is there.</p><p>Now if we look in more detail into the verticals. So we see in terms of -- as Andries was mentioning earlier, so top of mind, brand perception, ability to generate traffic, we're doing very well, we are clear leaders. In both cars and real estate, we are continuously developing our product and we are pushing even stronger on the supply side. So towards professionals, attracting more content, going even more upmarket, right, so expensive cars, expensive properties and we think that, that's going well and that will help us increase our lead versus our competitors.</p><p>Now in jobs, it's a pretty interesting challenger position because again we are touching a large part of the Austrian population. We have a very good access to candidates. We have unique relationships with many SMEs which are the, say, the backbone of the Austrian economy and we will now start developing our product even more. So I think this is the next clear avenue for growth for us in Austria.</p><p>And now to Italy. So I'll start with the obvious. Italy is large, right? So it's a large country, many people. Internet penetration not there yet, hopefully picking up. Online classified spend, again a lot of it offline. So quite a long runway for growth in the online foundation.</p><p>Now many players have found Italy a tough nut to crack. And I think that's both because the macroeconomic conditions are not ideal and there are also structural factors to the market, right? So the level of trust of the average Italian user in transacting online is not high. It's probably closer to the emerging markets than to developed Europe. Italy is a very regionalized country, right, so the South is not like the North and one needs to take into account all of those things when developing the product, moderating content and so on.</p><p>Now on our end of the story, we have deployed the traditional generalist playbook. I think it's fair to say that it wasn't as fast as we would have liked. I think it's both due to some of these, let's say, structural trends and it's also due to poor execution especially in product and technology. And then we have acted on it, we have made changes to the management team and we are focusing much more on product development around search, discovery and trust and towards verticalizing our product for -- especially in cars.</p><p>Now why am I optimistic? I think traffic is behaving well and it can accelerate. We are already seeing good acceleration in cars actually. In jobs, we have a solid position. So Subito is very strong on blue-collar. InfoJobs Italy has a strong position in the middle white-collar part of the market. So we can develop both of those quite well. Real estate is a pretty competitive market because there are 3 big verticals fighting it out. Our strategic choice is to focus on our stronghold, right, so focus on private content, focus on rentals and then not join the big 5 but leverage our unique strengths. So on Italy, I would actually say that going forward, the acceleration in Italy can be a pretty interesting driver for growth for us.</p><p>We are searching to deploy into the cars vertical, into jobs and to some extent, into real estate. I think that acceleration in cars is particularly exciting. The position we have in jobs is particularly exciting.</p><p>Now to our next interesting case, Shpock. I think we have been presenting it a bit and mentioning it quite a bit. I think there are 2 interesting parts to the Shpock story, right? One is the Shpock product. It has been built in order to remove friction as it is very simple, easy to use, it's a very efficient tool to acquire both content and users. We have been focusing on the U.K. market especially. And to our knowledge, we are head-to-head with Gumtree in the generalist. And I think that's a good position to build from.</p><p>Now strategically and I think we have been announcing and discussing this quite a bit over the past quarters, we have chosen to change a bit the playbook with Shpock. So historically, we have tried to execute on the same generalist playbook, right? So build traffic, content, create that virtuous circle in consumer goods, then move to the verticals, attract professionals and then monetize. And then seeing the development in the past years with Shpock, it's a much better strategy to actually go for profitable growth, right? And move it from a generalist classified blueprint towards the transactional marketplace, which especially in consumer goods is much better able to monetize early on as it grows.</p><p>So we have a new management team in place since October and we are seeing very good progress. So we are seeing monetization levels increase. We have significantly reduced the cost base and we are seeing very good development of our product. So we are quite well on the path of becoming a proper transactional generalist market.</p><p>Now for the last deep dive on Hungary. So in Hungary, we are present with 2 brands, right, 2 products. One is Jofogas, which is the absolute leading generalist. And the strong #2 in cars, jobs and real estate. And the other one is Hasznaltauto, which is the clear leader in cars.</p><p>And we see several interesting levers for growth in Hungary, right? One is cars where we are operating #1 and #2 and we are going for a bundled strategy, much like Gianpaolo was mentioning in cars in Spain, like Milanuncios and Coches or what Antoine was saying in real estate in France. And then we are seeing good opportunity to ramp up Jofogas's traction, both in terms of product and commercially especially in jobs and also in real estate. I think that's a pretty good avenue for growth.</p><p>So summarizing with our strategy for this part of the portfolio. Changing the pillars into a small little puzzle, right? I think that there's one key enabler which is converging technology. For us, it's extremely important. This is what will ensure accelerating time-to-market. This is what will help us get operating leverage and it will help us benefit from all these common components that we are developing.</p><p>The second one is to fuel user and content growth and that comes by focusing on matchmaking and liquidity. Third one is verticalizing the product and commercial execution and fourth one is focusing on monetization as a result of all of the above.</p><p>Now there is -- the underlying logic for all of this is an active portfolio management, right? So we are doing all of this across the portfolio. We are continuously looking for opportunities to consolidate our positions and reviewing our ability to deliver that. I think that's an important message to think.</p><p>Now to New Models. We are called Global Markets and New Models. What is the New Models part about? I think it's a page out of the Schibsted growth playbook. As we are saying, we have strong capabilities in terms of knowledge, traffic generation and content and we are looking to use those to accelerate and scale startups that are remaking the value chain of our key verticals, right? So we want to be able to be part of the new wave and bet on these new winners by using our unique ability to create value. And so it's not just financial investments, it's bringing our traffic content knowledge to play.</p><p>We have already done 2 pretty exciting investments in 2018, one in the property tech market in iBuyer, one in the jobs market with a transactional marketplace for medical personnel. And we have partnered with a few funds in order to be able to give access to a really good deal flow, especially in locations like London and Berlin where we are not directly present ourselves. I think mid to long-term, this can be very interesting catalyst for growth.</p><p>So summarizing. Why am I excited about this part of the portfolio? I think we have really good opportunities for growth. I think we are a diversified portfolio, attractive geographies, more than 300 million people. We have the building blocks in place, so both strong brands and traffic generation. We are converging our technology base. So we'll be benefiting a lot from these common developments and we are verticalizing both product and commercial approach. So I'm really excited about the journey ahead and I hope I'm managing to convey some of that to you. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Thank you very much, Ovidiu. Let's move to Q&amp;A for this part. There's a question in the middle, in the back there. Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: If I remember this correctly, Mexico must be the only country left that yet to turn profitable. I was hoping that you will be able to provide a deep dive on this market as well. Can you just update us in terms of the path to profitability on this market? And the second question is that, given that both Italy and Mexico are both 2 tough markets to crack so far and it hasn't been a smooth journey, wouldn't it make sense to swap assets with eBay classifieds between these 2 assets like what you did with Naspers? Wouldn't it make sense at all to do it now given that profitability is still low or still loss-making that you will not attract the attention from the Competitive Authority like you did probably in Sweden with Hemnet? Could you just [please inform me] in terms of both Mexico and Italy, please?</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: I think the first part is [a gal] so I'll conveniently start with the first one. Regarding Mexico, I think the market is developing and it is actually slower to develop, right? So I think that there's a lot of I'd say people coming into the market, classifieds is still gaining traction. We are moving rapidly towards breakeven in Mexico and we are doing that by focusing a lot on the verticals and we are very pleased with our progress both in cars and real estate. With regards to consolidation...</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: No, I think these sites that [for turn] many of these sites in the portfolio that we have yet to turn to profit or good profit still represents very interesting options for us. So I think that they can -- I think France and Italy, we have an option to develop that site in several directions. Then of course as I said previously, we will do active portfolio management and continue to do that. And we will continue to develop local leaders. And sometimes, we don't succeed and sometimes we do bolt-on acquisitions and we will continue that active portfolio management. Yes. There's a question here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: For Italy, you didn't include the normal chart of competitive positions. Could you tell us a little bit more about how the competitive positions rate in Italy? And particularly, how do you think you performed versus AutoScout24 in the cars segment?</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: I think we have included the first one with [the memos] and that was traffic based by vertical and I think we are #1 clearly in cars. In content, we are also ahead. Again, to the best of our knowledge, we are ahead in content as well -- in cars.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And do you believe in revenue that you're anywhere near AutoScout in...</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: I think we are progressing fast. I think we are gaining share.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Yes, I think, there's quite a business there. But we are quite happy with the progress we are making in product development in motor and thereafter revenue.</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: So I think I can't go too much into the commercial strategy. In sum, we are making good progress both at market in terms of more expensive newer cars, larger dealers and in terms of some regions which are inherently more interesting than others.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: A question here in the back. There's [Adrian] also. I think that's -- doesn't work, that microphone.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can you talk a bit about how product development works for all of these different sites? Do you have local development resource for the bigger countries like say, Italy and Austria or are you mainly calling on the central functions?</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: All of these except the 2 smallest ones have their own product development resources and they're increasingly benefiting from the common components. So that part is increasingly becoming a lesser part of the mix, right? So we are deploying the messaging that you've seen earlier, we are deploying it as well, notification service for professionals, right? So performance dashboards, valuation tools and so on. So we are increasingly being able to absorb components from group and we still have local teams because I think a large part of that verticalization is market-specific. So the more you grow closer to the user and customer experience, the more you need to adapt the flow. So all the fundamentals are coming increasingly from central.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can you give us an idea how big that will be, so say for Italy's product development team, how big would that be?</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: In each country?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: In Italy, for instance?</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: I'm sorry, what was the question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: How many people do you have in your like tech team in...</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: I think we are increasing the numbers there so it has been a little bit north of 50, and yes.</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: It's closer to 60 and we are ramping it up significantly.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Yes, there's a question here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I wanted to get a slightly bigger picture one on where Schibsted's going in kind of 5, 10 years. They started out being capital light, kind of high margin, no balance sheet type businesses. There are some pretty interesting adjacent models thinking AUTO1, [was that are up to]. Can you give me a sense as to how you see that developing and whether you think you need to deploy a balance sheet at some point as classifieds evolve post transaction?</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: I can take it from the New Models angle, right? So with the New Models team, we are actually looking at these more transactional plays, right? So what is making the value chain in property, in jobs, are much more, let's say, end-to-end models. So hence we invested in one iBuyer and trying to understand what are the drivers there, what makes it successful, how does it perform when the downturn hits the market and so on. I don't think we are at the point of saying we would be moving our business in that direction like some other companies.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: No, but I think like we talked about France and Leboncoin, so we are trying to take out the friction in the user journey, which will also mean that we can do other parts of the value chain. So payment, transportation, pickups, et cetera, et cetera. And that's an interesting opportunity I believe. I don't -- we don't have any plans to go in the direction that you see that some of the U.S. players have done, where they use their balance sheets like Opendoor and now Zillow, doing that. We are not planning that -- we don't have any plans to do that. Okay, there's a question here on the back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Could you describe what has changed in the common technology stack for you to be able to use a lot more of the common options? So is it more from them -- their side or from your side to change your code in a way that allows you to do that?</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: It's very interesting to answer this question with [Renault] in the room, right? No, I think it's the fruit of the work that we've been doing over the past years on both ends, because if you think in order to let's say, easily plug and play components at the product level, what you should have is at least a pretty standardized data layer. So data taxonomy, all the [mount] points for those components need to be pretty standardized so that when you build something, it's easy to deploy. And I think that requires work on both ends. And I think we've been working on it for a while now and I think now we are starting to see some of the benefit.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: We have room for one final question. No? So thank you very much, Ovidiu.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Then, it's -- let's go look into some of the numbers and let's go into the financials. So Borja will do that. Borja is the interim CFO, he's been with the company for 6 years and he's also head of business controlling. So please, Borja.</p><p>BORJA DE MULLER: Thank you, Rolv Erik. So you've heard insights from different segment leaders. Let me try to pull these together and take you through our reporting structure to frame context of our financials.</p><p>So post -- let's see. There. Okay, now. Okay, so post the demerger process, Adevinta is composed of these segments. So France, Spain, Brazil and Global Markets. While we consolidate most of our assets to 100%, let me be very specific around the assets that we consolidate via the equity method. So those are OLX Brazil and Willhaben. Both of those are owned by Adevinta on a 50%.</p><p>So we are very pleased to have seen the top line revenue development that you see in this slide. Basically from the year 2016 to 2017, we grow by 21%. And from 2017 to 2018, by 16%, providing a very robust CAGR of 19% over the last 2 years. This has been -- this growth has been achieved across our portfolio. As you see, France and Spain have been growing at a 20% CAGR, while Brazil has grown on a 50% plus basis over the last [2] years.</p><p>Let me point out that the Brazil segment includes OLX Brazil, which is accounted via the equity method and hence not consolidated into our figures. This is -- as a result, you have here the eliminations which are basically composed of the Brazil operation. Therefore, the -- if you want -- those consolidated figures do not show, do not reflect our Brazilian growth to the full extent and a proportionate owners' view would be better to actually look at that. Let me get back to you -- I'll come back to that in a minute.</p><p>As you know, our revenues -- so 76% of our revenues come from the core classifieds, while 23% come from display advertising. We are very pleased to have seen very strong growth on our core revenues from classifieds, particularly in the verticals. As you also know, in the last quarter of last year, we also saw some softening in the display advertising growth. Similarly, beginning of the first quarter of this year, we are seeing a slow growth of the display advertising while experiencing very strong growth on the verticals.</p><p>As this is the first time that Adevinta is reporting separately, we thought it would be helpful to just walk you through our P&amp;L structure. This is a complicated slide, if you want, but I just wanted to point out a couple of things from here. First one, and as I mentioned before, you have on top of this slide our reporting segments. So France, Spain, Brazil, Global Markets, headquarters and others, and eliminations.</p><p>The eliminations are -- that is later reflected below EBITDA via the equity method. The eliminations also include some intersegment sales. The last thing to point out here is, as you see Willhaben is only reported via the equity method and they fall below EBITDA.</p><p>The last column, in the last column of this slide, what you will see is basically our consolidated numbers of EUR 594 million in revenues and EUR 151 million in EBITDA which you can then reconcile to the previous pages.</p><p>As I mentioned before, a better way to actually understand our scale, our growth and our profitability is to -- across our portfolio is actually to look at it from the proportionate ownership view. This is what I've laid out for you on this slide. On the one hand, you have our consolidated numbers. Also, you have here the perspective of our proportionate ownership view, accounting for 50% of OLX and 50% of Willhaben.</p><p>From the first quarter of 2019, Adevinta will disclose proportionate revenue and EBITDA. And let me be very clear. Our targets are always based on a proportionate view basis. So just to reemphasize this idea, our targets when referring to revenues and EBITDA are always taking into account on a proportionate view basis.</p><p>Turning to profits. We are very happy to have seen a very robust development of our EBITDA margin. Over the last 2 years, we have expanded margins by 10 percentage points, resulting in a 25% margin in 2018. And while also focusing on investments, primarily on the tech area, we have been able to keep the requirements of CapEx fairly stable and at a low 5% of revenues. Basically, this is the result of the high cash generation nature of the Marketplaces business model.</p><p>Just to wrap up this presentation, let me give you an update on our balance sheet. Again, a crowded slide, but I think what is very important to point out from here is that post the demerger process and post the buyout of the minorities in Spain, our net interest bearing debt is going to be EUR 116 million. This puts Adevinta into a very good and flexible position for future growth.</p><p>So basically, I think we've gone through our reporting structure. The key message is a strong revenue, a strong topline growth while at the same time, being able to expand very rapidly on margin. And we have a good balance sheet for future revenue.</p><p>And now let me hand it over to Rolv Erik.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Thank you very much, Borja. We will have a final Q&amp;A towards the end. But if you have detailed questions around this, I suggest that you talk to Borja or to Trond or to Kristin or Espen outside. Then let me just wrap things up. Some of you have been asking questions about the management incentive schemes and Trond's also commented on the management incentive schemes.</p><p>We have developed our own incentive scheme in Adevinta. There's 2 things to remember. One is that management should build up skin in the game and second is that the interest should be aligned with shareholders. So we will be able to provide some more details around this later when we publish the prospectus. But as you can see, there's going to be performance shares, of B shares granted to the participants and it's going to be measured against the subset of the Stoxx Europe 600 Index comparable companies and sites and then the maximum amounts for some of the people involved will be 300% of salary, if we do a good job for the shareholders and have a good return there.</p><p>So we will be able to publish -- to give you more detail on that. But that's just an overview of the things that we are working on.</p><p>So 2 things. Management should build up skin in the game and we should have aligned interest with shareholders.</p><p>All right. Then towards the end, let me say a little bit about our targets, about our financial targets. And here, I'd like to say that in the medium to long-term, we remain confident about our guiding -- the guidance of 15% to 20% annual revenue as annual revenue growth on a proportionate view, as Borja pointed out. And I think that the presentations that we've gone through today, they support that firmly.</p><p>In the short term, as we have explained, we have experienced some softness in the display advertising market. Although verticals, let me reiterate that, continues to drive a very strong growth. So our current assessment is that the revenue growth in the first half of 2019 may come in slightly below the 15% to 20% target range as the result of the display ads softness. But I mean we are talking about potentially 1 to 2 percentage points below the range. So I am relaxed about that because as you've seen, we also spent time today for example, in Antoine's presentation in France about what kind of actions we are taking to mitigate this trend both on the -- from strategic initiatives, product development, new apps or products coming on board but also short-term tactical things and initiatives we're doing in the market and the sales force.</p><p>Then on the EBITDA margin. We have said that we have increased our margin in the -- from 15% to 25% in the last few years. We believe that as a result of continued good growth in our main businesses that Adevinta's portfolio has shown a positive development. In the long-term, we should look at EBITDA margins about 40%.</p><p>For the leverage, we have the ability, we have a very sound balance sheet today as you saw with EUR 160 million in total debt. We've said that we can increase that up to a multiple of up to 4x. So that gives us strength and the ability to participate in further consolidation. Of course, with that leverage and then combined with our ability to issue new shares, will give us good opportunities going forward.</p><p>Then for the dividend policy. So this year, we are not going to pay out any cash dividend but the ambition is for next year on to pay a stable and growing dividend while maintaining all the financial flexibility to invest further in growth opportunities. Right.</p><p>Now we are very close to the end. Now actually I'd like to invite my team to come up on stage with me to share for the final Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: If you have any more questions, of course there will be a mingling session outside right after this event. So we are looking forward to that as well. But we will give you the chance to ask some questions. I think [Vashney] and [Renault]. Thank you. We are all here. We have a microphone to pass around. Any final questions? Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just one, the 15% to 20% growth target again is that an organic number, or is that assuming some bolt-on M&amp;A?</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: No, that's largely organic but we have included that we do smaller bolt-on acquisitions but it's largely organic.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So do you think that you can grow 15% organically in the mid to long-term or what's sensible in terms of organic growth?</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Well I think 15% to 20% is what we're aiming for. Of course, 20% would be more of a stretch. But this is definitely the range we are aiming for. Yes? Is it working?</p><p>MARKUS BJERKE, ANALYST, SEB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Markus Bjerke from SEB. In Norway, you had a fantastic success in FINN with the Blink technology. We have not heard very much about similar usage in the other sites. All of that has been on your own assets in the Nordics in Schibsted. But what about the potential to do similar technology in third-party channels for the rest of the group?</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: I think -- we have Laila and [Renault] here. So Laila, do you want to start with a few products perspectives?</p><p>LAILA DAHLEN: So we probably haven't talked a lot about what we've done as common product in the Adevinta portfolio. A lot of the products that Ovidiu and Antoine and Gianpaolo were talking about is actually commonly developed product in our central product and tech team which is for instance, messaging, trust and reputation products. We do a lot with more machine learning capabilities where we've seen really that it makes sense to develop in one place to attract the right talent for that. So for instance, in the fraud detection for, on the apps, in our marketplaces, we use machine learning. We do it with a system for all the Marketplaces for quality review. So there is a lot of examples where we're actually using common products and technology. For FINN and Blocket, especially on [Tore], until now, we've done a lot of common also with them. So of course, now we are separating. But we are sort of taking forward some of these products, both for the Nordics and for Adevinta. I don't know if you want to add, [Renault]. I think one area we should also comment is a lot what we've done on infrastructure. There's quite a lot.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, we talked about product that are visible but we're also creating synergies at the more infrastructure level. We talked about data, so there's a lot of data infrastructure that we are sharing across the sites, but also when it comes to transitioning to the cloud, all the cloud engineering and automation that goes with this, we are also leveraging a central team for this. So that also generates leads, not just product features.</p><p>LAILA DAHLEN: I might have misunderstood your question. If it was about third parties. Yes, so...</p><p>MARKUS BJERKE: Yes. I think my question was more related to the success we had with [anbeceve] and Blink in Norway. It's phenomenal. Why have we not seen or heard anything about using third-party channels to do similar targeting with, particularly in real estate and cars on the other sites?</p><p>LAILA DAHLEN: I mean, what we've done in Norway with Blink has been amazing. It's clear that FINN is a very advanced marketplace. We are doing similar things in our other marketplaces as well. And we are able to do this even without having the ecosystem that we have in Sweden and Norway because we can do this with distribution on third parties. So it's nothing preventing us from doing that. I have to say, FINN has been sort of a leading star in that area. And of course, we have the knowledge to copy that also for the rest of the marketplaces. And then I will have to say we are doing a lot of partnerships with third parties in areas where we are not the best ourselves. I think like the payment solution in France for instance, that's an example of that where we go to the best third-party player in that marketplace.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: [Devin], there's a question there in the back. First, [Adrian] has to do and then [Kevin] next.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: It's [Adrian], Page 121, Note #2, you say EBITDA before JVs and associates, but your EBITDA margin is including JV and associates. So I just want to clarify how did you define your EBITDA? Because in the footnote, it says that you do that before JVs and Associates. Page 121, Note #2.</p><p>BORJA DE MULLER: So EBITDA, the $151 million is excluded, both -- well, it's excluding OLX and Willhaben that are accounted via the equity method, below EBITDA.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: The margins are [in the teens to be] ...</p><p>BORJA DE MULLER: No, in the target. So the numbers that you've seen are on a consolidated basis, they are excluding the assets that we consolidate via the equity method. Now when we refer to targets or to guiding, what we talk about is it's from a proportionate view basis.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: [Kevin] next?</p><p>BORJA DE MULLER: Is that clear or?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible)</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Okay. Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So revenue growth came down in 2018 with improvement in profitability which is an improvement in profitability, better in margins basically. And now you're saying that the first half revenue growth is coming down. And going forward, you are aiming at 15% to 20% revenue growth and also improving profitability. In my experience, those 2 things never come at the same time. So what I wonder is, what's most important for you, to get the revenue growth back up to the 15% to 20% or to get the margin up towards the 40%?</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Well you're the guy who's been telling us that we should have more operating leverage, so the margins should come up. Now that you're expecting it to happen and I might say it will happen, right, in the years to come. I think that that's -- and I know you don't like that anymore, so. Just kidding. I think that we've worked hard for this long-term revenue growth and that's why I said 20% is obviously a stretch but we believe that it's a combination of our portfolio and new things we'll do that we will be able to improve that segment. And then I think that as the portfolio changes and as Adevinta's portfolios become more profitable then we will actually see more operating leverage throughout the group. So that's why we say but for those margins we guided that, that will be in the longer-term. Because we are moving in that direction, it will take some time. Yes, [Margit]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes, it's a question regarding the demerger transaction. Why not a collapse of the A and B share in Schibsted and then secondly, any comments relating to the approach or how you will actually do the collapse in Adevinta?</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: I think I should pass the microphone to Trond here. Because this is more for our ownership.</p><p>TROND BERGER: Yes, when it comes to the Adevinta, we, due to legal reasons have to mirror the AMV structure when we do the spinoff. But as we have stated is that we will collapse and the plan is of course to do that during 2019, subject to an AGM. So it will be one shareholders structure in Adevinta from 2020 and onwards. So that's the planning there. When it comes to the Schibsted A and B structure, as we have said, we have had the vehicle of an A and B historically in Schibsted. That has actually proven to be the right thing. Longer-term, view could also be some of the same thinking in Schibsted. So that's been also addressed and discussed at the board and therefore we will continue with the A and B structure in Schibsted.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Right. Any other questions? Yes, here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just on Shpock. Compared to previous CMD presentations, I noticed a lower focus on Shpock. Just wondering if it's because of the country and geographic exposure you have at the moment? Is there anything that you can learn from Shpock to implement in the other websites like the geographic location?</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Sure. Ovidiu?</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: I wouldn't say it's a lower focus, I think -- Is this on? I think in terms of making this transition from, let's say classified generalist product towards transactional, I think Shpock is actually probably in the more advanced within our group and I think it is the one moving fastest, right, because for them this is the key focus right now. I think we are quite excited about that. We are seeing the transactional model already validated by some other players in consumables, and I think it's a pretty clear runway for us. And I think there are a lot of learnings especially around payment discovery that we are building and we are sharing among ourselves.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: A question here, in front here. Okay. We have room for I think 2 more questions and then --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Does that mean though you're deemphasizing the focus on autos in Shpock?</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: Yes, so short-term we are focusing on moving to transactional model in consumer goods and kind of having profitable growth. From that basis, I think we can continue to grow both in consumer goods and we can let's say look at the vertical through the fresher look.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Question up there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Aditya Buddhavarapu, Modavu Bar]. Could you talk about what incentives and KPIs you use at a regional level? In terms of measuring...</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: For instance for the Leboncoin (inaudible) that we are using. Yes, for this group of course, we are using then the total shareholder return. Then for your management team?</p><p>OVIDIU SOLOMONOV: It's a combination of different things. And we have of course the fixed and we have what we call STI so it's short-term incentive based on EBITDA and then they have part of the program to get some shares also. So they have -- so they will have shares of Adevinta. So it's good money for them if we succeed in reaching our targets.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Okay. Well, it's -- sure.</p><p>ANTOINE JOUTEAU: We combine both financial methods, created using revenues and EBITDA [and also study equations] with traffic and content, et cetera.</p><p>ROLV ERIK RYSSDAL: Well I think it's been a very long day. And we are nearing the end now. And let me emphasize that we will be around and looking forward to meeting you in the mingling salon, so before we leave let me just repeat the main messages from Adevinta.</p><p>We spent many years to build up the positions we have and the competence and we operate in very attractive geographies with a big room for growth. We have a very attractive business model. User -- winner takes most, clear networks effect. I believe that what differentiates us is that we have the local leaders and then we are backing them with a global scale and product and tech. We delivered results throughout. And I'm sure that with the sites we are having and the market positions and the financials and not least with this team in place, we are very well-positioned to continue on the [cross-bridge] journey. So thank you very much for attending and looking forward to speaking with you, talk to you more in the mingling salon.

Adam Schiff of California met with Mark Zuckerberg and said the Facebook CEO showed a deep awareness of the threat to the elections from so-called \"deep fake\" videos and other technically advanced tools.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Schiff told reporters Facebook is \"in the process of developing what I hope will be very strong policies on this. ... I think he (Zuckerberg) fully appreciates the gravity of the situation.\"</p><p> It was Zuckerberg's third day of private meetings in Washington, following other sessions with top lawmakers and President Donald Trump. Zuckerberg also met Friday with the leader of a House antitrust investigation into the big tech companies and pledged to cooperate.</p><p> The House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, led by Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., is investigating the market dominance of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. The lawmakers recently asked the companies for a detailed and broad range of documents related to their sprawling operations, including top executives' internal communications.</p><p> Cicilline and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, met in a separate session with Zuckerberg. Cicilline told reporters afterward that \"Mr. Zuckerberg made a commitment to cooperate with the investigation, and we look forward to his cooperation.\"</p><p> That cooperation would cover \"a whole range of things,\" Cicilline said, including providing the requested documents.</p><p> As he did when making the rounds on Capitol Hill Thursday, Zuckerberg left the meetings without answering reporters' shouted questions.</p><p> The conciliatory tone from lawmakers on Friday stood in contrast to declarations the day before from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., a conservative who is the Senate's most vocal critic of the tech industry. Hawley said he challenged Zuckerberg in their meeting to sell his company's WhatsApp and Instagram properties to prove that Facebook is serious about protecting data privacy.</p><p> \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action,\" Hawley told reporters.</p><p>Congress has been debating a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data. A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.</p><p> Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said Friday that Zuckerberg and lawmakers discussed data privacy in another meeting and that Facebook \"is engaging to find solutions.\" Collins also assured Zuckerberg that in their bipartisan antitrust investigation, the lawmakers were not taking \"an adversarial role.\"</p><p>Facebook, a social network behemoth with nearly 2.5 billion users around the globe, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of abuse of its market power to squash competition.</p><p> In addition to the House probe, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting antitrust investigations of the big tech companies, and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general has opened a competition probe specifically of Facebook.</p><p> Schiff said he also discussed with Zuckerberg cooperation between the tech industry and U.S. intelligence agencies to combat foreign interference in the 2020 elections. The government isn't looking for companies' confidential information other than that related to efforts by foreign powers to intervene in the elections, he said.</p><p> Cooperation between the industry and intelligence agencies has improved, \"but there's still more to be done,\" Schiff said.</p><p> U.S. intelligence officials determined that Russia carried out a sweeping political disinformation campaign on U.S. social media to influence the 2016 election, with especially heavy use of Facebook.</p><p> Officials are especially concerned about so-called \"deep fake\" videos, which are altered using artificial intelligence and facial mapping to appear legitimate, and posing a threat to national security and the 2020 election. Some officials have called on companies such as Facebook and Twitter to take action against false videos.</p><p> Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A teacher approves it pending any red flags in the system, such as another student he should avoid out in the hall at the same time, then logs him back in on his return. If he were out of class for more than a set amount of time, the application would summon an administrator to check on him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Heritage High School in Loudoun County, Va., introduced the software, called e-Hallpass, in September as a way to track trips to the bathroom, the nurse's office, the principal or other places on campus. It collects the data for each student's comings and goings so approved administrators can see pass histories or look for patterns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I just think it's a violation of our privacy, and I don't think it's something that needs to be in place. I would understand if it was something for specific people or even underclassmen,\" said Chase, who started an online petition on Change.org to remove the technology, which he calls invasive.</p><p>As technology becomes more pervasive in schools, parents and students are getting a lesson in data privacy. Every year, they face the overwhelming task of sorting through the benefits, drawbacks and privacy implications of each piece of educational software. Families have to decide if they are comfortable with how information is being collected and used and whether they want to - or even can - opt their kids out.</p><p>Hundreds of applications, big and small, are being used at schools across the country to do things as varied as track homework and modify behavior. They can collect data about intelligence, disciplinary issues, personalities and schedules.</p><p>It is common for families to take precautions outside of school, enforcing screen time rules at home and limiting what photos they post of their children on social media. But controlling what happens at school is harder, in part because districts are not required to inform parents of every type of software students use. And the apps, as well as the schools deploying them, have different rules for how they use, share and store data.</p><p>There are classroom management tools like Google's G Suite for Education that tracks school work and helps teachers, parents and students communicate via messaging and email. Smaller apps such as ClassDojo, which claims to be in use at 90 percent of K-8 schools in the United States, tackle specific subjects or problems. That app lets teachers communicate with parents and grant students virtual points for positive behaviors like teamwork or subtract them for negative actions like being out of their chair. Newer \"personalized learning\" programs attempt to develop custom education plans for students based on data they collect about their interests and skills.</p><p>Google, ClassDojo and E-Hallpass say in their privacy policies that student data is not shared with third-party companies for marketing or advertising, and parents can request deletion. E-Hallpass says schools are entirely in charge of the data the program collects and can delete it as often as they like.</p><p>Advocates for these types of software say they can revolutionize education, helping students gain valuable skills to prepare them for college and the workplace. Research on the technology is in the early stages.</p><p>Still, privacy advocates say parents face a conundrum. Though there have been improvements, the education technology industry as a whole is lagging in privacy protections, with many apps selling easily de-anonymized data and tracking users, said Girard Kelly, counsel and director of privacy review at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization that reviews technology and media targeting young people.</p><p>School districts increasingly have their own data privacy agreements for third-parties, but with anywhere from 200 to 600 applications being used across all schools and grades in a single district, by Kelly's estimate, screening every classroom tool can be difficult.</p><p>As a result, families are often left on their own to navigate a confusing maze of privacy agreements, school policies and federal privacy regulations.</p><p>\"Everyone feels overwhelmed, everyone feels like they don't know what they're doing, and that's because the technology is not transparent and does not allow for easy understanding of what your kid is using,\" said Monica Bulger, a research affiliate at the independent, nonprofit Data and Society Research Institute.</p><p>It is reflective of a broader distrust in big tech. According to a Pew Research Center survey last year, only a quarter of Americans think tech companies \"do enough to protect the personal data of their users.\"</p><p>Some parents do manage to comb through privacy policies, opt out of classroom programs and ask to have students' data wiped from company servers - even when it puts them at odds with their kids' own schools.</p><p>Kristin Phatak was recently notified her 11th-grader was using a program called Thrively, which asks students to take a personality assessment and then uses the answers to determine their \"strengths,\" recommending careers or skills they should learn.</p><p>Her son had already used it once, so Phatak asked her school at the Sweetwater Union High School District in Chula Vista, Calif., to opt him out, to see a copy of the data the company collected about him and for the company to delete any information about him. First, the principal suggested she speak with Thrively's CEO so he could directly address her concerns.</p><p>\"As a parent, why am I having to go through this? Why is the principal of our school on a first-name basis with the CEO of a company who is collecting data about our kids?\" Phatak said. She eventually received a copy of the data and was told it was deleted, but then her child's teacher accidentally had him use the tool again.</p><p>Sweetwater school officials did not reply to repeated requests for comment. Thrively's CEO, Girish Venkat, said the incident was an anomaly but that he does try to talk to parents who request that their kids' data be deleted. Of the four parents who have asked, he says all but one decided to let their kid keep using Thrively. The tool is used by roughly 1 million kids, he added.</p><p>Thrively's privacy policy says it does not sell or rent user data, but like many education apps, it can use depersonalized and aggregated information to market products to parents.</p><p>\"Many parents are upset about the lack of privacy involved with the data going into private corporate hands and how their education is being outsourced to tech companies,\" said Leonie Haimson, head of the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, an advocacy group that gives parents guidance on navigating school data issues.</p><p>She recommends making an appointment with a teacher or school principal to ask questions, including what programs are in use, who has access to the data, if the companies are barred from using the information for marketing and if the programs are in compliance with state and federal privacy laws.</p><p>Federal laws put some limits on how software is used by schools. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 limits how schools can share educational records and gives parents the right to review them. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act has rules that apply to companies collecting data about kids under 13. However, under the law, schools can consent on behalf of parents for educational products. The Federal Trade Commission is considering updating COPPA.</p><p>Parents also have rights under the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment, which requires schools to get parental permission for any federally funded student survey or sensitive topic evaluations, such as religion, political views or income. But for the most part, schools are not legally obligated to get permission from parents to use specific software in classrooms or to let students opt out.</p><p>Some schools, like those in the Montgomery County public school district in Rockville, Md., are more receptive to parents policing their children's technology. Ellen Zavian, a lawyer and professor at George Washington University Law School, has cleared her middle-school-aged son to use Google's education software but not ClassDojo.</p><p>\"At the beginning of every school year I send the principal what my son's allowed to be on and what he's not allowed to be on, and thus far my local schools have been incredibly supportive and have been willing to learn from me as I have been willing to learn from them,\" Zavian said. \"My goal is to give my child the smallest footprint possible, to give him the largest opportunity possible.\"</p><p>To help parents and educators make decisions, Common Sense Media examines education- technology privacy policies and looks at factors such as whether data is sold to third parties or if the apps include ads. An application might be dinged for not saying whether it tracks users or created ad profiles, and get points for storing data securely. (The project is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is invested in edTech, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which makes the personalized learning program Summit Learning.)</p><p>Common Sense Media found both ClassDojo and the stand-alone Google Classroom tool to have sufficient privacy policies - enough to get a green check mark and a \"Use responsibly\" label - meaning they met the organization's minimum privacy requirements. Points were subtracted from ClassDojo's overall score for its system for obtaining parental consent, while Google Classroom was dinged for how much data it collected.</p><p>ClassDojo said its tool is designed to collect the bare minimum amount of information about students and to not create a digital footprint, and that it goes \"above and beyond\" for parental consent. Google said student information collected by G Suite for Education products like Google classroom is only used to provide the services themselves and that schools are in control of how often it is deleted.</p><p>E-Hallpass does not have a rating by Common Sense Media yet, though the company that makes it, Eduspire Solutions, says it is used in hundreds of schools in the United States. Eduspire President Brian Tvenstrup says the system is meant to keep track of students in an emergency, decrease vaping, identify vandals and crack down on truancy. A feature that lets a school flag specific students or groups who should not be in the hallways at the same time can cut down on bullying or gang violence, Tvenstrup said.</p><p>Students can also choose to use e-Hallpass on their personal smartphones, and the mobile app does not use GPS tracking.</p><p>Both e-Hallpass and its competitor SmartPass Mobile say another selling point is that the physical objects many classes have typically used for hall passes are unsanitary. A computerized system cuts out the germs.</p><p>As for privacy concerns, Tvenstrup says the same information was already being collected by schools - just on paper. Schools have control over how long they store the data. Some delete it annually, a few delete more often than that.</p><p>\"In our case we're providing a service. It's a database of sorts, but it's analogous to the transition of other digital record keeping that schools keep,\" Tvenstrup said. \"Twenty-five years ago, grades were not digitized.\"</p><p>Many students and parents see a digital hall-pass program differently. At Heritage High School, Chase says, other students are also unhappy about the new system. The Change.org petition he created has more than 400 signatures, though it is not clear how many of them attend the school, which has around 1,500 students.</p><p>The Loudoun County Public School district, where Heritage High School is located, allows parents to opt their kids out of the e-Hallpass system and use alternative passes instead, according to Wayde Byard, the school district's public information officer. It deletes the data it collects once a year, and the more advanced features like cross-referencing students are not widely used in the district. The system is in use at 23 middle and high schools across the district, and each school makes its own decisions about which teachers and administrators can see the data for all kids.</p><p>Northwood High School, in Montgomery County, Md., plans to bring e-Hallpass to its campus at the end of October, though a number of parents planned to oppose the decision at a recent PTA meeting. The school will have a single school-issued computer in each class where students can request passes and will not use it on personal cellphones, according to Derek Turner, head of communication for Montgomery County Public Schools. The district does not have plans to test it at other schools, Turner said.</p><p>Both the Montgomery and Loudon County school districts have data privacy agreements tech companies must agree to as part of their contracts. When online educational tools are used without contracts, the schools say they vet and approve them.</p><p>Privacy attorney Brad Shear has two elementary-age kids in the Montgomery County schools.

A teacher approves it pending any red flags in the system, such as another student he should avoid out in the hall at the same time, then logs him back in on his return. If he were out of class for more than a set amount of time, the application would summon an administrator to check on him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Heritage High School in Loudoun County, Va., introduced the software, called e-Hallpass, in September as a way to track trips to the bathroom, the nurse's office, the principal or other places on campus. It collects the data for each student's comings and goings so approved administrators can see pass histories or look for patterns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I just think it's a violation of our privacy, and I don't think it's something that needs to be in place. I would understand if it was something for specific people or even underclassmen,\" said Chase, who started an online petition on Change.org to remove the technology, which he calls invasive.</p><p>As technology becomes more pervasive in schools, parents and students are getting a lesson in data privacy. Every year, they face the overwhelming task of sorting through the benefits, drawbacks and privacy implications of each piece of educational software. Families have to decide if they are comfortable with how information is being collected and used and whether they want to - or even can - opt their kids out.</p><p>Hundreds of applications, big and small, are being used at schools across the country to do things as varied as track homework and modify behavior. They can collect data about intelligence, disciplinary issues, personalities and schedules.</p><p>It is common for families to take precautions outside of school, enforcing screen time rules at home and limiting what photos they post of their children on social media. But controlling what happens at school is harder, in part because districts are not required to inform parents of every type of software students use. And the apps, as well as the schools deploying them, have different rules for how they use, share and store data.</p><p>There are classroom management tools like Google's G Suite for Education that tracks school work and helps teachers, parents and students communicate via messaging and email. Smaller apps such as ClassDojo, which claims to be in use at 90 percent of K-8 schools in the United States, tackle specific subjects or problems. That app lets teachers communicate with parents and grant students virtual points for positive behaviors like teamwork or subtract them for negative actions like being out of their chair. Newer \"personalized learning\" programs attempt to develop custom education plans for students based on data they collect about their interests and skills.</p><p>Google, ClassDojo and E-Hallpass say in their privacy policies that student data is not shared with third-party companies for marketing or advertising, and parents can request deletion. E-Hallpass says schools are entirely in charge of the data the program collects and can delete it as often as they like.</p><p>Advocates for these types of software say they can revolutionize education, helping students gain valuable skills to prepare them for college and the workplace. Research on the technology is in the early stages.</p><p>Still, privacy advocates say parents face a conundrum. Though there have been improvements, the education technology industry as a whole is lagging in privacy protections, with many apps selling easily de-anonymized data and tracking users, said Girard Kelly, counsel and director of privacy review at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization that reviews technology and media targeting young people.</p><p>School districts increasingly have their own data privacy agreements for third-parties, but with anywhere from 200 to 600 applications being used across all schools and grades in a single district, by Kelly's estimate, screening every classroom tool can be difficult.</p><p>As a result, families are often left on their own to navigate a confusing maze of privacy agreements, school policies and federal privacy regulations.</p><p>\"Everyone feels overwhelmed, everyone feels like they don't know what they're doing, and that's because the technology is not transparent and does not allow for easy understanding of what your kid is using,\" said Monica Bulger, a research affiliate at the independent, nonprofit Data and Society Research Institute.</p><p>It is reflective of a broader distrust in big tech. According to a Pew Research Center survey last year, only a quarter of Americans think tech companies \"do enough to protect the personal data of their users.\"</p><p>Some parents do manage to comb through privacy policies, opt out of classroom programs and ask to have students' data wiped from company servers - even when it puts them at odds with their kids' own schools.</p><p>Kristin Phatak was recently notified her 11th-grader was using a program called Thrively, which asks students to take a personality assessment and then uses the answers to determine their \"strengths,\" recommending careers or skills they should learn.</p><p>Her son had already used it once, so Phatak asked her school at the Sweetwater Union High School District in Chula Vista, Calif., to opt him out, to see a copy of the data the company collected about him and for the company to delete any information about him. First, the principal suggested she speak with Thrively's CEO so he could directly address her concerns.</p><p>\"As a parent, why am I having to go through this? Why is the principal of our school on a first-name basis with the CEO of a company who is collecting data about our kids?\" Phatak said. She eventually received a copy of the data and was told it was deleted, but then her child's teacher accidentally had him use the tool again.</p><p>Sweetwater school officials did not reply to repeated requests for comment. Thrively's CEO, Girish Venkat, said the incident was an anomaly but that he does try to talk to parents who request that their kids' data be deleted. Of the four parents who have asked, he says all but one decided to let their kid keep using Thrively. The tool is used by roughly 1 million kids, he added.</p><p>Thrively's privacy policy says it does not sell or rent user data, but like many education apps, it can use depersonalized and aggregated information to market products to parents.</p><p>\"Many parents are upset about the lack of privacy involved with the data going into private corporate hands and how their education is being outsourced to tech companies,\" said Leonie Haimson, head of the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, an advocacy group that gives parents guidance on navigating school data issues.</p><p>She recommends making an appointment with a teacher or school principal to ask questions, including what programs are in use, who has access to the data, if the companies are barred from using the information for marketing and if the programs are in compliance with state and federal privacy laws.</p><p>Federal laws put some limits on how software is used by schools. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 limits how schools can share educational records and gives parents the right to review them. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act has rules that apply to companies collecting data about kids under 13. However, under the law, schools can consent on behalf of parents for educational products. The Federal Trade Commission is considering updating COPPA.</p><p>Parents also have rights under the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment, which requires schools to get parental permission for any federally funded student survey or sensitive topic evaluations, such as religion, political views or income. But for the most part, schools are not legally obligated to get permission from parents to use specific software in classrooms or to let students opt out.</p><p>Some schools, like those in the Montgomery County public school district in Rockville, Md., are more receptive to parents policing their children's technology. Ellen Zavian, a lawyer and professor at George Washington University Law School, has cleared her middle-school-aged son to use Google's education software but not ClassDojo.</p><p>\"At the beginning of every school year I send the principal what my son's allowed to be on and what he's not allowed to be on, and thus far my local schools have been incredibly supportive and have been willing to learn from me as I have been willing to learn from them,\" Zavian said. \"My goal is to give my child the smallest footprint possible, to give him the largest opportunity possible.\"</p><p>To help parents and educators make decisions, Common Sense Media examines education- technology privacy policies and looks at factors such as whether data is sold to third parties or if the apps include ads. An application might be dinged for not saying whether it tracks users or created ad profiles, and get points for storing data securely. (The project is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is invested in edTech, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which makes the personalized learning program Summit Learning.)</p><p>Common Sense Media found both ClassDojo and the stand-alone Google Classroom tool to have sufficient privacy policies - enough to get a green check mark and a \"Use responsibly\" label - meaning they met the organization's minimum privacy requirements. Points were subtracted from ClassDojo's overall score for its system for obtaining parental consent, while Google Classroom was dinged for how much data it collected.</p><p>ClassDojo said its tool is designed to collect the bare minimum amount of information about students and to not create a digital footprint, and that it goes \"above and beyond\" for parental consent. Google said student information collected by G Suite for Education products like Google classroom is only used to provide the services themselves and that schools are in control of how often it is deleted.</p><p>E-Hallpass does not have a rating by Common Sense Media yet, though the company that makes it, Eduspire Solutions, says it is used in hundreds of schools in the United States. Eduspire President Brian Tvenstrup says the system is meant to keep track of students in an emergency, decrease vaping, identify vandals and crack down on truancy. A feature that lets a school flag specific students or groups who should not be in the hallways at the same time can cut down on bullying or gang violence, Tvenstrup said.</p><p>Students can also choose to use e-Hallpass on their personal smartphones, and the mobile app does not use GPS tracking.</p><p>Both e-Hallpass and its competitor SmartPass Mobile say another selling point is that the physical objects many classes have typically used for hall passes are unsanitary. A computerized system cuts out the germs.</p><p>As for privacy concerns, Tvenstrup says the same information was already being collected by schools - just on paper. Schools have control over how long they store the data. Some delete it annually, a few delete more often than that.</p><p>\"In our case we're providing a service. It's a database of sorts, but it's analogous to the transition of other digital record keeping that schools keep,\" Tvenstrup said. \"Twenty-five years ago, grades were not digitized.\"</p><p>Many students and parents see a digital hall-pass program differently. At Heritage High School, Chase says, other students are also unhappy about the new system. The Change.org petition he created has more than 400 signatures, though it is not clear how many of them attend the school, which has around 1,500 students.</p><p>The Loudoun County Public School district, where Heritage High School is located, allows parents to opt their kids out of the e-Hallpass system and use alternative passes instead, according to Wayde Byard, the school district's public information officer. It deletes the data it collects once a year, and the more advanced features like cross-referencing students are not widely used in the district. The system is in use at 23 middle and high schools across the district, and each school makes its own decisions about which teachers and administrators can see the data for all kids.</p><p>Northwood High School, in Montgomery County, Md., plans to bring e-Hallpass to its campus at the end of October, though a number of parents planned to oppose the decision at a recent PTA meeting. The school will have a single school-issued computer in each class where students can request passes and will not use it on personal cellphones, according to Derek Turner, head of communication for Montgomery County Public Schools. The district does not have plans to test it at other schools, Turner said.</p><p>Both the Montgomery and Loudon County school districts have data privacy agreements tech companies must agree to as part of their contracts. When online educational tools are used without contracts, the schools say they vet and approve them.</p><p>Privacy attorney Brad Shear has two elementary-age kids in the Montgomery County schools. He has been vocal about parental privacy rights and successfully lobbied the district to adopt an annual \"data deletion week.\" Now, the school purges any unnecessary data about students from tools like Google's education suite, keeping essential information such as grades.</p><p>However, if the district does decide to test e-Hallpass in more schools, Shear and other parents are ready to mobilize against it.</p><p>\"I will not allow this app to be utilized in my kids' schools, period. If the app ends up getting rolled out I will make sure that I get the PTA involved,\" Shear said. \"This is bathroom big brother.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:heather.kelly@washpost.com\">heather.kelly@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-937f914e-fa6d-11e9-8190-6be4deb56e01</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDP-RMH1-DXXY-33YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2290\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 3, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A teacher approves it pending any red flags in the system, such as another student he should avoid out in the hall at the same time, then logs him back in on his return. If he were out of class for more than a set amount of time, the application would summon an administrator to check on him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Heritage High School in Loudoun County, Va., introduced the software, called e-Hallpass, in September as a way to track trips to the bathroom, the nurse's office, the principal or other places on campus. It collects the data for each student's comings and goings so approved administrators can see pass histories or look for patterns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I just think it's a violation of our privacy, and I don't think it's something that needs to be in place. I would understand if it was something for specific people or even underclassmen,\" said Chase, who started an online petition on Change.org to remove the technology he calls invasive.</p><p>As technology becomes more pervasive in schools, parents and students are getting a lesson in data privacy. Every year, they face the overwhelming task of sorting through the benefits, drawbacks and privacy implications of each piece of educational software. Families have to decide if they are comfortable with how information is being collected and used and whether they want to - or even can - opt their kids out.</p><p>Hundreds of applications, big and small, are being used at schools across the country to do everything from track homework to modify behavior. They can collect data about intelligence, disciplinary issues, personalities and schedules.</p><p>It is common for families to take precautions outside of school, enforcing screen time rules at home and limiting what photos they post of their children on social media. But controlling what happens at school is harder, in part because districts are not required to inform parents of every type of software students use. And the apps, as well as the schools deploying them, have different rules for how they use, share and store data.</p><p>There are classroom management tools like Google's G Suite for Education that tracks school work and helps teachers, parents and students communicate via messaging and email. Smaller apps such as ClassDojo, which claims to be in use at 90 percent of K-8 schools in the United States, tackle specific subjects or problems. That app lets teachers communicate with parents and grant students virtual points for positive behaviors like teamwork or subtract them for negative actions like being out of their chair. Newer \"personalized learning\" programs attempt to develop custom education plans for students based on data they collect about their interests and skills.</p><p>Google, ClassDojo and E-Hallpass say in their privacy policies that student data is not shared with third-party companies for marketing or advertising, and parents can request deletion. E-Hallpass says schools are entirely in charge of the data the program collects and can delete it as often as they like.</p><p>Advocates for using these types of software say they can revolutionize education, helping students gain valuable skills to prepare them for college and then the workplace. Research on the technology is still in the early stages.</p><p>Still, privacy advocates say parents face a conundrum. Though there have been some improvements, the education technology industry as a whole is still lagging in privacy protections, with many apps still selling easily de-anonymized data and tracking users, said Girard Kelly, counsel and director of privacy review at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization that reviews technology and media targeting young people.</p><p>School districts increasingly have their own data privacy agreements for third-parties, but with anywhere from 200 to 600 applications being used across all schools and grades in a single district, by Kelly's estimate, screening every classroom tool can be difficult.</p><p>As a result, families are often left on their own trying to navigate a confusing maze of privacy agreements, school policies and federal privacy regulations.</p><p>\"Everyone feels overwhelmed, everyone feels like they don't know what they're doing, and that's because the technology is not transparent and does not allow for easy understanding of what your kid is using,\" said Monica Bulger, a research affiliate at the independent, nonprofit Data and Society Research Institute.</p><p>It is reflective of a broader distrust in big tech. According to a Pew Research Center survey last year, only a quarter of Americans think tech companies \"do enough to protect the personal data of their users.\"</p><p>Some parents do manage to comb through privacy policies, opt-out of classroom programs and ask to have students' data wiped from company servers - even when it puts them at odds with their kids' own schools.</p><p>Kristin Phatak was recently notified her 11th-grader was using a program called Thrively, which asks students to take a personality assessment and then uses the answers to determine their \"strengths,\" recommending careers or skills they should learn.</p><p>Her son had already used it once, so Phatak asked her school at the Sweetwater Union High School District in Chula Vista, Calif., to opt him out, to see a copy of the data the company collected about him and for the company to delete any information about him. First, the principal suggested she speak with Thrively's CEO so he could directly address her concerns.</p><p>\"As a parent, why am I having to go through this? Why is the principal of our school on a first-name basis with the CEO of a company who is collecting data about our kids?\" said Phatak. She eventually received a copy of the data and was told it was deleted, but then her child's teacher accidentally had him use the tool again.</p><p>Sweetwater school officials did not reply to repeated requests for comment. Thrively's CEO Girish Venkat said the incident was an anomaly, but that he does try to talk to parents who request that their kids' data be deleted. Of the four parents who have asked, he says all but one decided to let their kid keep using Thrively. The tool is used by roughly 1 million kids, he added.</p><p>Thrively's privacy policy says it does not sell or rent user data, but like many education apps, it can use depersonalized and aggregated information to market products to parents.</p><p>\"Many parents are upset about the lack of privacy involved with the data going into private corporate hands and how their education is being outsourced to tech companies,\" said Leonie Haimson, head of the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, an advocacy group that gives parents guidance on navigating school data issues.</p><p>She recommends making an appointment with a teacher or school principal to ask questions, including what programs are in use, who has access to the data, if the companies are barred from using the information for marketing and if the programs are in compliance with state and federal privacy laws.</p><p>Federal laws put some limits on how software is used by schools. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 limits how schools can share educational records and gives parents the right to review them. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act has rules that apply to companies collecting data about kids under 13. However, under the law, schools can consent on behalf of parents for educational products. The Federal Trade Commission is considering updating COPPA.</p><p>Parents also have rights under the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment, which requires schools to get parental permission for any federally funded student survey or sensitive topic evaluations, such as religion, political views or income. But for the most part, schools are not legally obligated to get permission from parents to use specific software in classrooms, or to let students opt out.</p><p>Some schools, like those in the Montgomery County public school district in Rockville, Md., are more receptive to parents policing their children's technology. Ellen Zavian, a lawyer and professor at George Washington University Law School, has cleared her middle-school aged son to use Google's education software, but not ClassDojo.</p><p>\"At the beginning of every school year I send the principal what my son's allowed to be on and what he's not allowed to be on, and thus far my local schools have been incredibly supportive and have been willing to learn from me as I have been willing to learn from them,\" Zavian said. \"My goal is to give my child the smallest footprint possible, to give him the largest opportunity possible.\"</p><p>To help parents and educators make decisions, Common Sense Media examines education-technology privacy policies and looks at factors such as whether data is sold to third parties or if the apps include ads. An application might be dinged for not saying whether it tracks users or created ad profiles, and get points for storing data securely. (The project is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is invested in edTech, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization, The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which makes the personalized learning program Summit Learning.)</p><p>Common Sense Media found both ClassDojo and the stand-alone Google Classroom tool to have sufficient privacy policies - enough to get a green check mark and a \"Use responsibly\" label - meaning they met the organization's minimum privacy requirements. Points were subtracted from ClassDojo's overall score for its system for obtaining parental consent, while Google Classroom was dinged for how much data it collected.</p><p>ClassDojo said its tool is designed to collect the bare minimum amount of information about students and to not create a digital footprint, and that it goes \"above and beyond\" for parental consent. Google said student information collected by G Suite for Education products like Google classroom is only used to provide the services themselves, and that schools are in control of how often it is deleted.</p><p>E-Hallpass does not have a rating by Common Sense Media yet, though the company that makes it, Eduspire Solutions, says it is used in hundreds of schools in the United States. Eduspire President Brian Tvenstrup says the system is meant to keep track of students in an emergency, decrease vaping, identify vandals and crack down on truancy. A feature that lets a school flag specific students or groups who should not be in the hallways at the same time can cut down on bullying or gang violence, Tvenstrup said.</p><p>Students can also choose to use e-Hallpass on their personal smartphones, and the mobile app does not use GPS tracking.</p><p>Both e-Hallpass and its competitor SmartPass Mobile say another selling point is that the physical objects many classes have typically used for hall passes are unsanitary. A computerized system cuts out the germs.</p><p>As for privacy concerns, Tvenstrup says the same information was already being collected by schools - just on paper. Schools have control over how long they store the data. Some delete it annually, a few delete more often than that.</p><p>\"In our case we're providing a service. It's a database of sorts, but it's analogous to the transition of other digital record keeping that schools keep,\" Tvenstrup said. \"Twenty-five years ago, grades were not digitized.\"</p><p>Many students and parents see a digital hall-pass program differently. At Heritage High School, Chase says, other students are also unhappy about the new system. The Change.org petition he created has more than 400 signatures, though it is not clear how many of them attend the school, which has around 1,500 students.</p><p>The Loudoun County Public School district, where Heritage High School is located, allows parents to opt their kids out of the e-Hallpass system and use alternative passes instead, according to Wayde Byard, the school district's public information officer. It deletes the data it collects once a year, and the more advanced features like cross-referencing students are not widely used in the district. The system is in use at 23 middle and high schools across the district, and each school makes its own decisions about which teachers and administrators can see the data for all kids.</p><p>Northwood High School, in Montgomery County, Md., plans to bring e-Hallpass to its campus at the end of October, though a number of parents planned to oppose the decision at a recent PTA meeting. The school will have a single school-issued computer in each class where students can request passes and will not use it on personal cellphones, according to Derek Turner, head of communication for Montgomery County Public Schools. The district does not have plans to test it at other schools, Turner said.</p><p>Both the Montgomery and Loudon County school districts have data privacy agreements tech companies must agree to as part of their contracts. When online educational tools are used without contracts, the schools say they vet and approve them.</p><p>Privacy attorney Brad Shear has two elementary-age kids in the Montgomery County schools. He has been vocal about parental privacy rights and successfully lobbied the district to adopt an annual \"data deletion week.\" Now, the school purges any unnecessary data about students from tools like Google's education suite, keeping essential information such as grades.</p><p>However, if the district does decide to test e-Hallpass in more schools, Shear and other parents are ready to mobilize against it.</p><p>\"I will not allow this app to be utilized in my kids' schools, period. If the app ends up getting rolled out I will make sure that I get the PTA involved,\" Shear said. \"This is bathroom big brother.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-5ba5a14608cb4779a67ea38644e8a6d1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCP-6RJ1-JB4M-V1V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2290\"/><timeReceived>3:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 29, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Graham Doyle, deputy commissioner with the DPC, said the office had held no \"secret meetings\" with Facebook.</p><h>Supervision functions \"We regularly engage and meet with companies from all sectors as part of our regulatory enforcement and supervision functions, in accordance with article 57 of the GDPR, in the same way that many of our EU colleague data-protection authorities do.\" Mr Doyle said the DPC was advancing 23 different inquiries into big tech firms and recently announced \"significant developments\" in several. </h><p>At the core of Mr Schrems's argument are 10 meetings held between the DPC and Facebook in advance of new data-protection laws introduced in May 2018, as well as a White Paper supplied by the company to the DPC. </p><p>Mr Schrems claims that at the same time the GDPR came into force, Facebook changed the legal basis on which it relies when processing user data, changing from a reliance on consent to an \"alleged contract\". </p><p>The meetings are referred to in submissions made by the company during the DPC's investigation of the complaint.</p><h>'Direct engagement'</h><p>Excerpts from these submissions show Facebook stated it had \"detailed direct engagement with the commission prior to the implementation of the recent update to our terms, spanning 10 meetings\". </p><p>On Friday, the Irish regulator announced it had completed its investigation into Twitter's handling of a data breach in 2018, raising the prospect of the first fines against tech companies who have made Dublin their European base and the DPC the lead regulator.</p><p>Mr Schrems criticised DPC investigations into data-collection complaints filed by users of WhatsApp and Instagram, both Facebook subsidiaries.</p><p>Investigations into WhatsApp and Instagram were still in the early, draft stage and, he said, counted as a \"slap in the face\" of complainants. </p><p>A text analysis revealed the WhatsApp and Instagram reports were largely identical to the DPC's draft report into Facebook last year, he said. </p><p>Five years after his landmark ruling striking down previous EU transatlantic data-transfer mechanisms, Mr Schrems says he has no plans to give up on his case. When the High Court lifts its Covid-19 restrictions and reopens, he will begin a judicial review into the DPC approach to his case.</p><p>Fred Logue, an Irish solicitor and data-protection expert, said under GDPR, firms must have a legal basis to process data. </p><p>\"I am quite concerned that the DPC appears to accept without an investigation that Facebook can rely on contractual necessity for the extensive processing of personal data on its platform.\"</p><p>Mr Logue said the DPC must look at the substance rather than the form of the contract to see if the \"processing is truly necessary\".</p><p>\"I would be very surprised if a data controller such as Facebook could avoid consent by incorporating data-processing terms in its contract. If that were the case, the idea of consent would be completely hollowed out.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4262577</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600C-90P1-JC8Y-8204-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 26, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Another complaint worth EUR 3.7 billion was filed with French data protection authority France CNIL in the case of Google's Android operating system for smartphones.  </p><p>They are the first legal tests of Europe's new data protection rulebook, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect at midnight yesterday. It harmonises privacy rules across the bloc and foresees fines of up to four per cent of group turnover for breaches. </p><p>The new lawsuits mark a fresh round of legal tug-of-war between the Austrian campaigner, Facebook and the Irish data protection commission (DPC), which began in 2011 and are ongoing.</p><p>A spokesman for the Irish Data Protection Commission noted that Mr Schrems's complaints were made to other EU data protection authorities earlier yesterday and that they would be forwarded to the Irish regulator should they come under the GDPR's \"one-stop shop mechanism\" that brings matters relating to Facebook and Google to the Irish authority given that their EU headquarters are based in Dublin.</p><p>\"These authorities will forward them to the Irish Data Protection Commission, as provided for in the GDPR, if appropriate,\" said the spokesman. </p><h>'Tricks' </h><p>Mr Schrems, head of a new privacy lobby group noyb (None of Your Business), accused Facebook of \"blackmail\" for giving users only two options: accept the new rules - and hand over more data than needed to operate the service - or deactivate their account. In addition, noyb claims Facebook used \"tricks\" to keep its customers using the service. It claims Facebook created fake red dots suggesting new messages, which the user could only see if they agreed to the new terms of service.  </p><p>\"This is nothing more than an aggressive and absurd attempt to deprive data subjects of their rights,\" the complaint adds.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3509583</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SDG-KTK1-DYS1-03X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"436\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 26, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The EU's highest court will today hear legal opinion on the third referral to Luxembourg arising from the Austrian man's legal campaign against Facebook.</p><p>Since 2011, Schrems has fought a David and Goliath battle against the US social media giant, accusing it of collecting more information on users than allowed under EU law - and allowing US intelligence access the data hoard.</p><p>Such practices would breach European citizens' fundamental right to privacy, he has argued - a point on which the ECJ has already found once in his favour.</p><p> In 2015, the court spiked the EU's main data transfer agreement with the US, called Safe Harbor, calling it unfit for purpose. </p><p>As well as Facebook, Schrems has been locked in combat with Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), Helen Dixon, claiming Irish regulation of big tech is so light-touch as to be almost non-existent.</p><p> Dixon disagrees vigorously, pointing to her Commercial Court case - referred to the ECJ - over Facebook's business practices, including data transmissions to the US.</p><p>Today's ECJ court date is not about that case but a class-action Schrems filed in Vienna against the US company.</p><p>According to Schrems, Facebook operates in Europe with contracts that are invalid under EU consumer law. Facebook has disputed this through several legal instances, questioning the jurisdiction of Austrian courts and challenging the legality of 25,000 EU citizens who have assigned their claims to Schrems in this case.</p><p>In addition, Facebook has accused Schrems of having a commercial interest in his long-running campaign.</p><p>Schrems denies he is challenging Facebook in order to earn money or build a profile. The reason it has dragged on so long, he claims, is because of Facebook's legal obfuscation and a go-slow from the Irish DPC.</p><p>The lawyer argues he withdrew his Irish Facebook complaint and shifted it to Vienna because he got tired of waiting for a final DPC ruling on whether Facebook's Dublin operation adheres to EU privacy law. Six years on, we're still waiting. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3290907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PYB-CXX1-DYS1-02SX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"348\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 14, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Positioning and survey data suggests this includes most long-only managers.</p><p>\"As investors we have spent a lot of time debating the positive and negative effects of these businesses. What is their impact on wider society? Is there a long-term risk from a growing regulatory burden?\"</p><p>Ms Davidson said these companies often have a large degree of market control, which has made regulators \"twitchy\". </p><p>She added: \"We see the most likely risk as taking the form of regulation on the one hand and or consumer backlash on the other.\"</p><p>Ms Davidson added that tech giants have also been accused of stifling innovation by gobbling up promising start-ups and monopolising the best talent.</p><p>She said: \"Critics point to the precipitous decline in the number of start-ups in recent decades, with most years seeing more companies fail than start.</p><p>\"Disruptive competition cannot emerge if the tech giants are allowed to subsume all possible rivals. We also have more sympathy with the view that flouting of copyright laws by YouTube in particular is damaging to the creative industries.\"</p><p>She added Schroders would continue to monitor developments and remain wary of tail risks that could threaten the long-term durability of their business models. </p><p>But Samuel Blanning, financial adviser from Bristol-based Star House Financial Services, said stricter regulation is unlikely to have a big effect on the big tech industry. </p><p>He added: \"When you invest in shares which trade at several hundred times their profit, it doesn't take regulatory action to make the share price wobble.</p><p>\"Any investor who has 'significant positions' in an individual stock will always have something to worry about; if they are concerned, perhaps they should consider whether they are diversified enough.</p><p>\"Personally, I think the biggest backlash to worry about isn't from regulators, it's from fashion. A teenage club mate of mine said recently that 'we only use Facebook to let our parents know we're still alive'. Her generation are all on Snapchat.</p><p>\"Any regulatory action will probably arrive about five years after everyone has already abandoned Facebook, as they did MySpace and Friends Reunited.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTAONL-41644916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTAONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RPX-S4P1-JCJY-G006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"523\"/><timeReceived>10:57 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FTAdviser.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59853\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 23, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000749</classCode><className>FOREIGN INVESTMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000037</classCode><className>AGENCY RULEMAKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkRFNDkwODkxNDVGNDI1NDg0RUU3RjREMTgwNEJEQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM</classCode><className>Agency Rulemaking</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001631</classCode><className>STOCK INDEXES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp;

Thank you for joining us. When we did our first one of these in October '17, I said to everyone in the room, if you come here to update your models, you've certainly come to the wrong meeting, and I won't be offended if you want to leave now. The purpose of this is not to try and give you an update on financial models. It's to try and help you understand our business.</p><p>We've talked a lot about strategy. I've -- very strong view that quarterly reporting does not reflect the dynamics of our industry, and that strategy is massively important. So the purpose of the day is to try and talk about little more about some of the other aspects of our business that we don't get a chance to do on regular reporting basis.</p><p>The last time we spoke about things, we spent quite a lot of time on our core business in terms of how we're going to increase client longevity, new markets we're going to go into, new channels we're opening up, new products we were launching, UCITS capital, et cetera. And the transcripts of that is still available, and we're certainly happy to take questions on that later on.</p><p>The purpose of today is to look more about with the consumer side of our business. This chart is familiar to anybody who looked at our results. We spent quite a lot of time on that middle box and we talk about targeting client longevity. In fact, targeting client longevity is important across every aspect of this but probably no more so than in the consumer box, and that's really the purpose of today's meeting.</p><p>For me, there's a funny thing about our industry. We obsess about the thing which matters most to us, which is investment performance, right? It's written on everything, in every tin. It's a bit like going to book a train time. When you book a train, all the websites do, is they don't tell anything about the experience. They just tell you about the times of the trains. If you book onto a plane website, it just tells you about what the price of the plane ticket is.</p><p>Our industry just tells you about the performance of the product. And the irony of that is to the end customer, what they're much more concerned about is do they get a good outcome? Do we meet their needs? And yet our industry just wants to talk about one thing. To my mind, getting access to solving the customer problem is a much, much bigger part of thinking than just saying, how many basis points of Alpha are you going to put on the [tin.] And that's a fundamentally different thing.</p><p>The second is the dynamics of this consumer box are fundamentally different. The longevity of the client on that side of the page is somewhere between 10 and 20 years. Look at the well and you'll get a very, very high retention rate.</p><p>Longevity of the clients in the middle blocks on average is 4 years. So compound growth is much, much easier to achieve if you got no hole in the bottom of the bucket.</p><p>The idea today is to spend a little bit of time looking at different aspects of how we're approaching consumer business. And really, I've lined up -- Group [of consumer] management because it's much better that you hear it from where they're doing in different parts of the business than hear it again from Rich and I, and I'm much keener that they should have the stage.</p><p>Just going through quickly. First of all, Peter Hall -- we'll sum it in a moment. Peter joined us from running Tilney's for Permira -- start of the year. Peter has a long, long career in Wealth Management at Barclays, running UBS and most recently the best invest in Tilney, and is in a good position to give the overall view of all of our wealth businesses.</p><p>James has recently taken on -- actually not quite taken on because we haven't gone live, but the Lloyds joint venture. James used to run our U.K. Intermediary business, knows the U.K. market incredibly well and will talk in more detail about how we're going to drive value and the dynamics of that business.</p><p>Susan runs our Singaporean business but is also leading the charge on mass personalization for us across the group. Been with us a long time. Singapore, as you know, has been a fabulous success story for us in many ways. And so having her here talking about the digital age is fantastic.</p><p>Graham may be familiar to many of you. He is our CDO, Chief Digital Officer, and we'll talk about how we're digitizing the business. And then finally, Jessica Ground's going to come and talk about sustainability. And you think, what's that doing there?</p><p>Actually, I think it's critical because if you think about the point I started with, the notion that all we've done is sell performance. What matters to people increasingly is how we go about generating returns, and the mass personalization of that gives investment products a meaning. So to my mind, the coming together of sustainability and performance becomes a much more powerful thing than just selling raw numbers. So how we're going to integrate that in with a data-driven mindset is going to be critical to that broader consumer base.</p><p>At the end of every session, there'll be an opportunity for questions. Richard and I are going to be here throughout to take any questions, but unless there's any at this stage, I'll step out of the way and let Peter take on.</p><p>PETER HALL, GLOBAL HEAD OF WEALTH MANAGEMENT, SCHRODERS PLC: Thanks very much, Peter. Good morning. As Peter mentioned, I joined Schroders as Global Head of Wealth Management just back in January. And I joined because I believe that we have got a unique and really exciting opportunity in Wealth Management. So it's great to have the chance today to talk about where I believe that opportunity lies and how we're going to capture it.</p><p>Peter mentioned the group strategy of getting closer to the customer, and that hinges upon the relative attractiveness of the Wealth Management business. So if we sort of put it side-by-side with Asset Management, Wealth Management is projected to grow significantly faster. As Peter mentioned, it has much higher longevity. So for us, in the Schroders group, the longevity within Wealth Management to 12 years is almost 3x the level of Asset Management. Revenue margin significantly higher. So for us, 61 basis points as opposed to 45 basis points. But importantly also because we're closer to the customer and because the customer is much more sensitive to issues of trust and relationship and service, we believe that the revenue margins there will be significantly less vulnerable to margin compression. So overall, an attractive space for us to focus on, and that's what lies behind the group's strategic focus.</p><p>Within that attractive sector, we already have a strong franchise in the U.K., and, funny enough, coming into this from the outside, I think a lot of people outside Schroders don't appreciate quite how strong our franchise is. So targeting the charity space and the high net worth, we have Cazenove Capital. Targeting the affluent segment and broadly speaking by affluent there remain individuals who have less than GBP 1 million in investable assets, we have Benchmark Capital. And then later in the year -- and James will talk more about this later, we will have the joint venture with Lloyds, which is going to come under the Schroders Personal Wealth brand.</p><p>Put all that together and we will be looking after GBP 65 billion of client assets with over 700 advisers. And if you sort of benchmark that within the industry and you think about how does that stack us up against advice wealth managers, then it really puts us in the U.K.'s #3, so behind Quilter and behind St. James's Place.</p><p>So a strong franchise. And that franchise is generating significant profits. So look at last year, combined the Schroders Wealth and the Benchmark businesses, we made pretax profits of GBP 93 million. And then on the right-hand side, what we are showing there is a notional 50% stake of the 2019 pro forma numbers for the joint venture, which comes to GBP 17 million. So it gives you an idea of the totality of the profits that we'll generate.</p><p>Importantly, while we're generating significant profits, we are also achieving a turnaround in growth. So I think Richard shared the left-hand chart with you at the results presentation, and what you can see there is the annualized net new revenue in the past couple of years having a good upward trajectory. And what's driven that is on the right-hand side, net new business as a percentage of assets, which certainly in my mind is probably one of the key metrics for growth. Go back to 2015/2016, we were pretty much flat lining. Go to 2017/2018, and we were achieving growth rates there of 3.5% to 4.5%.</p><p>So a strong franchise, a franchise generating significant profits and a franchise achieving a turnaround in growth. Looking forward, key question, what's going to set us apart? What is unique about what we do?</p><p>From my point of view, there are 5 things that I would focus on. The first one is brand. We have a couple of fantastic brands. Our research shows that the Schroders brand is ranked #2 in the retail space in the U.K. but with the top ranking for trust and innovation. And if there are 2 things I really wanted to be top ranked for within Wealth Management, it would be trust and innovation.</p><p>And then Cazenove is perceived as a brand which is respected and exclusive. So we've got great brands for each of those segments. And to be honest, I think it's important to have differentiated brands for each of those segments because the brand stretch is too great in terms of trying to recover that broad spectrum with solely one naming convention.</p><p>Secondly, we have unique sources of new business growth. And importantly, we will have through the Lloyds joint venture access to 1 in 5 affluent individuals within the U.K.</p><p>We've got fantastic technology and benchmark. Again, I'm not sure how much people appreciate the strength of that. But recently, we were awarded the best U.K. platform position for that capability, which is going to underpin our moves in the affluent space.</p><p>Through Schroders, we have a multijurisdiction capability. So we can support client booking, whether that is in the Channel Islands or it is in Switzerland or it is in Singapore. Increasingly important, amongst our wealthier clients where, internationally of course, we are in an environment of a growing level of political uncertainty. And then critically underpinning the whole thing, we have the global Institutional investment capability of Schroders.</p><p>Those 5 assets are great strengths. And honestly, I say that coming, as Peter said, from having spent 20 years in leadership roles at the main competitors of us elsewhere in terms of UBS Wealth Management, Barclays Wealth Management and then a private equity business, Tilney, where we grew the assets from GBP 4 billion to GBP 24 billion in 3 years.</p><p>So very strong franchise and great strengths. What I'm now going to do is I'm just going to talk about each of the businesses and what are the specific opportunities in each of them. So let's start off with Cazenove.</p><p>Cazenove has got some fantastic franchises to build on. We are literally #1 in the charity spaces, which as you'll know typically falls within the Wealth Management arena, and we are looking after GBP 6.6 billion of assets there.</p><p>We have a great family office franchise, and we are looking after 101 families who, together, have GBP 10.6 billion of assets. And then within this space, we have a great network and reputation with private client lawyers and accountants. I sort of mean the Withers and the BGAs of this world. And that's really important because, in this space, they are sometimes the trusted relationship, and they are, therefore, an important source of referral business for us.</p><p>And every industry has its own awards. The one award which you want to win in wealth management is the PAM Award. Why? Because it is the one which is voted on by those private client lawyers and accountants, and they voted us the best wealth manager for the high net worth segment earlier this year.</p><p>But we've also got a couple of very new and interesting opportunities in the new wealth segment. So entrepreneurs, again a great franchise to build on from Lloyds, where they look after literally 1 in 4 SMEs, and then the professional segment. To some extent, it's a very natural space for us. It's a space where the Cazenove brand, I think, really resonates. And not surprisingly, it's a brand where we, again, win the Magic Circle Awards because of our perception.</p><p>Great opportunities in Cazenove. Different set of opportunities in the joint venture Schroders Personal Wealth. So here, we are really focusing on the opportunity in the affluent space where there is a growing need for advice, particularly around pensions. Why? Because of the freedom's in pensions and the complexity, to be honest, of pensions. And James will talk a lot more about this later.</p><p>And how we're going to be successful? Well, we have deliberately set this up as a stand-alone venture with an independent board. Why? So that we can take an entrepreneurial approach to it while drawing on the fantastic strengths of the 2 parents. It's going to be open architecture so it can draw on the fantastic investment expertise of Schroders, but actually we'll be free to identify and offer the best manager in each sector or in each theme for its clients.</p><p>And then really importantly, we'll have a challenger in mentality and in particular, look to leverage innovative digital opportunities, and it's obviously early days before the JV has been set up to elaborate on what some of those opportunities could pay. But I think to give you an interesting insight into the sorts of innovative ways to leverage digital, both in terms of customer proposition and in terms of business model, Susan is going to talk about some really exciting stuff later that we are doing in Singapore.</p><p>So third business is Benchmark. Different opportunities again. And here we've got a couple of opportunities. One is to provide and continually develop this leading technology to underpin the innovative propositions that we're looking to build in the affluent space. And then the second one is to represent a different but complementary channel to target the affluent segment through its award-winning network of 250 financial planning advisers. So as you can see, exciting opportunities but very different opportunities across 3 businesses.</p><p>If we look back across the totality of what we have in Wealth, what are the key priorities for us to maximize its value within the group? So the first one is to strengthen organic growth further. And as I look at that and, based on my experience, there are 4 key drivers that we need to look at. The first one, of course, is recruitment of advisers, and that takes 2 approaches. Part of it is homegrown talent, and the second one is poaching the best advisers from our competitors.</p><p>And interestingly for me coming in, if you look at the senior advisers at Cazenove Capital, the vast majority of them have been with us for more than 15 years and started off as graduates. So actually, we have got a really good record here of nurturing top talent.</p><p>Second one is freeing up capacity. This is an industry issue. You will all know quite how incredibly clunky and paper-based and archaic, really, the wealth management sector is. And what that means is that advisers spend a whole lot of non-value-added time on stuff rather than being with the client or focusing on new business. And I'll talk about another priority later in terms of using digital to liberate that.</p><p>Third one is culture. So I think, within Schroders and certainly at Lloyds as well, we pride ourselves on a culture of real client care and very, very strong compliance. We need to hold that very precious, but we need to blend it with a sales culture. And there, I don't mean sales in a sort of dirty word. I mean sales in the sense of getting a deep understanding of a client's needs and offering top-quality solutions.</p><p>And then the third thing is, of course, there's no point of getting new clients through the front door and growing assets if we are losing clients through the back door. And so the last piece is about retention. And we do provide excellent client service. We have very good retention stats. Our internal client surveys are very positive. But there are a couple of areas where we can improve our investment offering. And by improving our investment offering, we will improve our retention.</p><p>So that very much leads me on to the second key priority, which is offering truly institutional-quality investment drawing on Schroders' expertise. So through Schroders, we can offer top-quality segregated portfolios, which are customized to the individual client, which are lower cost than a portfolio of funds and which, by definition, have much more investment story and content than ever can be brought alive through a portfolio of funds.</p><p>And actually, I believe that, within Wealth Management, there is almost going to be a dramatic shift back now towards segregated portfolios of individual shares and bonds rather than portfolios of funds but not in the way that it was decades ago with the old boy stockbroker getting tips from lunch, where actually people like us, who can draw on truly institutional-quality segregated management, will have a fantastic advantage.</p><p>Second thing that we can offer is sustainable investing. I totally agree with Peter. It's absolutely critical, and Jess will talk more about the great expertise that we have in that area.</p><p>Third one is private assets. It's another strategic priority. It was that -- it was the third pillar on Peter's initial charts. Georg Wunderlin, as you know, is joining fairly shortly to lead the charge on that. And certainly, amongst our wealthier and more sophisticated clients, there is a growing demand for private assets because of the illiquidity premium.</p><p>And then last one is, we are of course open architecture, as I mentioned, but where we choose Schroders as the best manager, we are able to offer it to our private clients at an institutional rate.</p><p>Priority 3, digital. Now digital I see in 2 ways. So the first one is the innovative customer proposition leveraging digital, which I mentioned earlier and Susan will talk more about later. The third one is digital in the sense of streamlining and automating what we do. And we think Cazenove, we have kicked off a program which is focusing on the 2 most clunky parts of the process, which are onboarding and client reporting and [seedability]. And what we're aiming to do through this digital program is to free up 15% of adviser's time through doing that.</p><p>Fourth priority is Asia. Now I mentioned earlier that Asia represents about GBP 3 billion of client assets out of a total of GBP 8 billion of assets that we are looking after in our international offices. So by definition, starting from that base, it'll be a longer-term play for it to create significant value within the group. But we're fantastically well placed to build that value here over the long term.</p><p>And if you look at the approach that we're taking, it actually just mirrors the approach and the business model that we're adopting in the U.K. So in the affluent space, we're partnering with banks. Obviously, in U.K., it's the JV with Lloyd's. In Asia, it is partnerships like the one that we have announced with Maybank, which is actually the #1 bank in Malaysia.</p><p>In high net worth, it is a matter of building a top-quality team of advisers. And you may have seen recently that we acquired an independent asset manager called ThirdRock. The story -- that's very interesting because ThirdRock was -- assembled 18 of 28 individuals who -- entrepreneurial, but who would each come from top large wealth managers in the region, like Goldman's or Credit Suisse.</p><p>So it has that entrepreneurialism, top-quality advisers who had the confidence to go out on their own. But what was fascinating when we talked to them was how valuable they felt it was to join our group because of the strength of the Schroders brand, which is literally #1 ranked in Singapore and Hong Kong, and because of the strength of the institutional investment capability that I mentioned earlier.</p><p>And then the fifth priority is acquisitions. And there, I believe that we have a really good track record in terms of acquisitions. It's an industry, as you know, where that is often not the case. But I think that what we have achieved with Hoare, with benchmark, with ThirdRock is very, very positive outcomes where we've done them for the right reasons and we're integrating them successfully culturally as well as strategically.</p><p>What are we going to look for? We will look for acquisitions where we believe it gives us a core strategic capability that we haven't got, where it will accelerate our growth. We will not look at them where we do not believe strongly in the cultural fit because, obviously in Wealth Management, that is critical. We will not look at them if we believe that it will not generate significant shareholder value, and we will not look at them where we feel that, in integrating the acquisitions, we could not simultaneously drive the organic growth that we're looking for.</p><p>So those are our key 5 priorities. What is our overall goal? So our overall goal is to become a top-3 player across that whole spectrum in the U.K. And this in many ways is what is unique to us. You get strong players in affluent, strong players in charity, strong players in high net worth. We are aiming to be a top-3 player across charities, high net worth and affluent financial planning and doing it by leveraging on those unique sources of distribution, leveraging on those fantastic brands and leveraging on the global institutional investment capability.</p><p>And the key measure there really is ultimately client assets, and then within that, ensuring that we are looking after those client assets with a business model as an attractive cost-income ratio and with strong underlying organic growth.</p><p>But in many ways, there is one financial goal. Just as important or if not more important for me is looking at this from the eyes of the clients. And the critical thing for us, long term, is to be known in the client segments that I mentioned earlier as our target's strategic client segments as the people to come to as the best people to help is their trusted advisers because, really, that is what is a very emotional relationship, wealth management. It is all about trust, and it is all about peace of mind. And that is the sort of relationship that we're looking to build.</p><p>So hope that's given you a bit of an overview on the attractiveness of Wealth Management, the strength of our franchise. Don't know whether it surprised some of you, but I do think, looking outside in, people don't often appreciate it where the key opportunities are and then what our top priorities are going to be to maximize its value over the coming years.</p><p>And now I'm very happy to take a few questions or pass them off to Peter if anyone has any at this stage.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: Could you wait for the microphone down front here. We're being recorded, so for those online, it would be a lot more helpful if they could hear.</p><p>GURJIT SINGH KAMBO, HEAD OF DIVERSIFIED FINANCIALS RESEARCH, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Good morning. It's Gurjit Kambo, JP Morgan. Just a few questions. Firstly, when we talk about Asia, clearly, it's a fast-growing market, but it's a relatively competitive market, and obviously recruiting advisers there cannot be cheap. How do you think about that GBP 3 billion you have at the moment? And in terms of is that profitable business for you at the moment? So we're just trying to think about growth versus profitability within Asia. So that's the first question.</p><p>PETER HALL: Yes. So our Asian business at that level is profitable. I agree with you. It is a competitive market. And I think, what is it which makes us different? It is going to be attracting entrepreneurial talent. So these were the best advisers who themselves had left the Goldmans and the Credit Suisses because they didn't want to work at what can be seen as large and rather heavy bureaucratic organizations. But then saw the benefit of being able to leverage our network, our brand, which is literally #1 in Asia, and our Institutional investment capability. So we're going in there with a unique proposition. And for me, the acid test was our ability to track those individuals.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: I think what I would add is that we're very -- taking a long-term view of this that compensations revenue for that business is way higher than it is for our long-gain businesses in more material markets. You'd expect that because they're not to scale yet. So actually, acquiring scale and becoming that brand is a very important part of the long-term journey rather than just to say we're going to run it on a low-cost basis. Be very profitable but not very fast growing, the opportunities for growth.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And just 3 sort of quick questions. One, are you going to consider an adviser score within the Schroders and the Lloyds JV or just broadly within Schroders?</p><p>PETER HARRISON: I think James will cover that in a moment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. And then the final question for yourself is [C&amp;E] developing with Schroders for a short period of time, obviously got a lot of experience with the wealth management industry. Is there anything in particular you've seen that very positive actuaries already think where you feel that Schroders needs to do better or improve their, whether it's technology or other areas?</p><p>PETER HALL: Yes. The first thing that comes through incredibly strongly is the long-term view. To build a leading Wealth Management business, you need an incredibly long-term view. I think that is absolutely core to Schroders and linked in to the family ownership, whether I have been at banking institutions or private equity businesses, inevitably, there is not that kind of time frame.</p><p>The investment capability that we can draw on as wealth managers is fantastic. And whether it's that segregated capability or private assets or ESG is amazing. The strength of the franchise in Asia is remarkable.</p><p>What excites me and what attracted me, and this is very much down to Peter's leadership is, while we are large, there is an entrepreneurial feel to it. And that's exciting, and that's absolutely critical for us to be successful.</p><p>What do we need to do better? You'll hear a lot today about digital. We have big ambitions in digital. We need to do a lot more in that. And we've certainly embarked in wealth on a significant program there. And when you think about us as a challenger, I think that's one of the key areas where we can stand out.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: Peter, I think, would have highlighted one other area when he first arrived, which we're addressing now. He chose his words carefully on private assets. So I thought our growth rate in wealth has been hampered by a lack of a really good private assets offering for our high net worth clients. We're in the process of addressing that. But I think we've had years where we've seen long-term client money depart because we haven't been able to plug that gap. And simply being able to have a good offering in that space has been critical, and probably -- alongside digital, it's probably the single other good growth opportunity because it creates stickiness to clients as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [David Maw] here from [Santander.] Actually Peter, coming back to your comment on private assets. I was at the CFA conference yesterday, and that's exactly what they were talking about is their own family offices and private assets is basically where the growth is. So great to hear that.</p><p>And Peter, welcome to Schroders. What I would like to ask you is what does the customer of tomorrow look like for you? And how do you think you'll acquire them? Will there be more in Cozenave or your affluent -- or your mass affluent area?</p><p>PETER HALL: I think we're in a very fortunate position that we have lots of different opportunities. So within Cazenove we have -- there are lots of opportunities for us to help entrepreneurs and business owners. And at the moment, there's a really attractive environment out there in terms of business sales, and through the Lloyd's relationship, we have great access to them. As you mentioned, family offices are an area -- I think, there are a lot of family offices at the moment out there, which are perhaps of a scale where it's questionable whether it makes sense for them to carry on doing it themselves. Well, I mentioned we're looking after 101 families with over GBP 10 billion of assets. We think we are in a very strong space.</p><p>And then James will talk more about this later, but the affluent space is a very interesting space, because it's still almost dominated by very, very large number of rather tiny IFAs. And they're an enormous number of individuals who need help in terms of their retirement and their planning, and they don't know what they've got, and they don't know what it's worth, and they don't know what they need. And we have an ability to help them and help them in an innovative way as well by drawing on digital channel. So what I like about us, our position is that there are a range of opportunities, and we're not overly dependent on one.</p><p>HUBERT LAM, VP, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Hubert Lam, from Bank of America. Just one question on cost-income ratio. Your cost-income ratio is 68%. I'm just wondering what your target is over time? How long will it take to get there? And how many assets do you need to see significant improvement because you speak of increasing scale but also I'm conscious of higher operating costs that you have in technology, Asia, et cetera? So just wondering cost-income, what your targets are on that?</p><p>PETER HALL: Yes. I think over the medium term, we'd see the cost-income ratio at a similar level. If we look at the different drivers on it, on the cost side, there are opportunities -- medium term through greater digitization and through investments in the platform. But as you mentioned, obviously short term, there are the investment costs associated with that.</p><p>On the revenue side, while we believe being close to the customer that revenues are much more defensible, of course, over the long term, one would expect some element of margin compression. And then, also as you indicate, the growth through hiring of talent has a bit of a hockey stick to it. And therefore, as one embarks on that program, it can result in a short-term dip before growth. So broadly speaking, if you net those factors out and you also benchmark us against the competition, I think that, over the medium term, that's the sort of level that we will be targeting. So if you look at the driver of value, it is much more on the growth side.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: (inaudible) as these benefits come through, the key is to keep reinvesting it, keep running harder and keep investing more because that becomes our advantage. If we can create a low-cost digital platform for managing class, that's a huge advantage if we can bring in new team. So rather than just running up a higher margin, we'd prefer to invest that back in the business to -- for the long-term benefit. We -- there was a very interesting chart that Peter put out. For 2 to 3 years, this business had been about integration. We haven't seen any net new business growth. And then 2 years ago, we -- I remember saying at the analyst meeting, the growth in this business is unacceptable. We're going to move it to a growth footing. And we've seen 3.5%, 4.5% growth come through subsequently, and whilst that's not a forecast for any individual year, I think at the same time, we've also made a step-change in digital, and you should expect that run-rate of our effort reinvest back into the business to be an important part of the future.</p><p>Have time for one more, and then we'll move on to James and pick up any later. No. James, you're up.</p><p>I think this is -- to my mind, it's a very different change of pace because we're dealing with a whole of market and much bigger numbers in terms of affluent clients.</p><p>JAMES RAINBOW, CO-MD OF UK INTERMEDIARY, SCHRODERS PLC: Good morning. Thank you, Peter. We are here today at a very interesting time for the development of Schroders' personal wealth, particularly as we're 2.5 weeks away from launch. So time is -- and we're feeling a little bit of pressure in terms of time at the moment, but I think that's generally a healthy thing and a healthy situation to be in.</p><p>What I'd like to cover is 3 things. I think that this is a fascinating time to be entering this market, and I'd like to talk a little bit about why. I think that the market is changing pretty quickly, and I'd like to just talk a little bit about the background and the direction of travel in the market. And finally, I'd just like to talk about the steps that we're taking to create the new business and how you can think about that developing and evolving in the months ahead.</p><p>It's quite clear that when we announced this in October, we generated a really very significant amount of interest both in the conventional media and on social media. Quite a lot of it we've been standing I guess on the sidelines being relatively amused about the fact that some of this has been news flow but a considerable amount of this has been rumor and speculation, not all of which was true, and certainly, not all of which came up from us. But I think that it points to a level of just latent interest in entrants into this market.</p><p>And as I said, what I'd like to do first of all is just to try and figure out why? I think if you look at our targets or our total addressable markets, there are, in the U.K., roughly 6 million people with investable assets of more than GBP 100,000. And so what I'll talk about in a moment is how we serve those clients. But actually in terms of our forward-looking projections, I think it's quite fair to say that we are going through a significant societal change where I think that, that 6 million people is somewhat understated on a forward-looking view.</p><p>I think if you think about how people are beginning to approach their retirements, they're working longer. They're phasing into retirement. There is far less reliance on defined benefit pensions. I think it was 2 years ago that for the first time in living memory the amount of income in retirement going from a defined benefit pension scheme fell below 50%. And I think that's a huge trigger in terms of changing behaviors and changing the personal behaviors as people think about that provision in retirement.</p><p>I think that Peter has already talked about the fact that pensions are a key focus for us. And I think that this notion of people taking greater responsibility for their retirement, for their savings, will naturally drive people towards advice. At the point of retirement with things like pension freedoms, this is an incredibly complex subject, and it is an area where people, I think, feel acutely the need for help and advice.</p><p>It's quite interesting that in recent years, the changes in pensions legislation has meant that getting a pension has never been easier. The things -- the measures such as auto enrollment but also if you go to one of the direct platforms, you can open a SIP in a matter of minutes, and I think what's fascinating there is that whilst you can get into one of these things, when you've accumulated wealth and you've saved and you're reaching the point at which you want to spend it, then it becomes incredibly complex. And that's not just for the people who are thinking about withdrawing money or retiring, but equally, there are an increasing number of people who are coming up against issues, such as lifetime allowance. And I think again, these are areas where you see the behavioral drivers towards advice growing all of the time.</p><p>There is the somewhat apocryphal quote from the U.S. that 90% of children will fire their parents' wealth manager on receipt of an inheritance. And I haven't been able to find where the data point for that is, but I think that what it does say is that, as we think about money moving from one generation to the next and how that accelerates in the coming years, I think it's fascinating to think that there is an enormous opportunity as these assets are disturbed and a new generation of people inherit wealth and look for advice and help with what to do with it.</p><p>And finally, I think if I was standing here as an economist, I would be telling you this last data point is particularly bad news. But in an advice business, actually, a concentration of people and a concentration of wealth are the elderly segments of our society actually points to the fact that, again, this is a really interesting time to be launching into this market for the first time.</p><p>Now having dealt with what I would describe as the demand side for our business, I wanted to talk a little bit about the supply side. Now there has been a gradual rebuilding in the number of advisers since the retail distribution review, and I think that's generally a healthy sign. I'll talk in a moment about capacity for advisers, but I think, about this in a fairly simple way, which is, if an adviser has the capacity to serve roughly 100 clients, 26,000 advisers can serve 2.6 million clients.</p><p>And I think that if you start putting numbers around what is colloquially known as the advice gap, I think you can quite quickly establish what that number looks like. And even if you did something material to push that capacity up, there is still a very large number of people who are underserved by the number of advisers that exist today. So I think that the -- whilst I think that I would paint a picture of very strong demand side, I think that we do have some issues with supply as well.</p><p>This is compounded by the fact that, as Peter said, we are living in a world which is still a massively fragmented and micro-industry for advice. With less than 5 advisers per advice firm, I think that this creates some really big structural barriers to the industry and its future development, and that's what I'd like to turn to next.</p><p>I think that the advice market today I would make a case for the fact that it is relatively young. I think that people will increasingly view the retail distribution review as a seminal moment in the development of what I would describe as our profession. And it really did create a profession, I think, for the first time, and a profession that can stand alongside the established professions of the legal and accounting profession on a similar footing with a similar qualification and professional standing. But it is at a very, very early stage in its development.</p><p>And I think that we need to move quickly away from the narrative that your outcome from an advised client is the same as a direct client, and therefore, the only difference is the fee you're paying, so please justify what that fee level is. I think there's an increasing body of evidence -- and I cited some of it here -- that the number -- the clients who actually get professional advice end up with a materially better outcome than those who DIY.</p><p>Now there are a number of reasons for that, but principally, the behavioral issues of buying the wrong things at the wrong time, selling out when you get nervous, and there are market events that scare you. I talked about pensions being complicated, so tax optimization is critical, and then asset allocation being the other driver. I think that we, as an industry and as a profession, need to make a better case for the fact that this is really important and that we can make a massive societal difference as we serve more people with the services that we have available today.</p><p>I think that the difficulty that we have -- that we face, though, with a very fragmented market is, firstly, speaking as one voice. And the second is that, in a fragmented market, we are dealing with -- still dealing with an enormous amount of issues that drain our capital, such as increasing in insurance costs, and in many cases, just simply the availability of professional indemnity insurances is a significant issue that the industry faces. But equally, implementing regulatory change, such as MiFID, for very small firms is a huge burden. And what that does is it actually limit the ability for us as an industry to grow a new generation of advisers, to really increase the availability of advice because there are very few firms that can actually do that.</p><p>The question earlier about whether or not that's a route that we're taking is absolutely fair and absolutely the right one, and we've made a very significant financial commitments to invest in a new way -- in a, I don't like the word academy, but it seems to have been coined by our industry, but an academy to train advisers, and we're in the process of hiring somebody at the moment to lead that initiative for us.</p><p>And equally, I think, that as people evolve and as they think about how they'd like to be served in different ways, and Graham will talk about the technology implications of that, there is an obvious barrier with a very fragmented market for developing technology and customer experience in a new and meaningful way. And I think that is also something that is significant. It's something that we will be focusing very hard on.</p><p>Now the second thing was about the structure of our market and the direction to travel. And what you can see here is quite clearly the impact of RDR moving away from a market that is based on sales commission and one that is based on fees. And you can see this, clearly, in terms of how businesses are valued and the importance that people are placing in evaluation of businesses in recurring fee revenues as opposed to commissions.</p><p>But I thought what I would do is just try and give you a flavor as to what that essentially is in terms of -- what fees are looking like and how they're charged? And the next few slides are from a study of advisers that Schroders does every year and just specifically focusing on this issue for a moment.</p><p>What you clearly see is that when we talk about fees, generically, we are talking about a move, overwhelmingly in this market, to a fee -- to [add AUM-loans fee model] where fees are charged as a percentage of funds under management or funds under advice.</p><p>Mainly facilitated by platforms. But when we talk about recurring fee revenues, this is quite clearly the model that now dominates our industry. In terms of the quantum, similarly, I think, there has been a very significant shift here where traditionally the advisory model in a commission world that was generally [0.50%] of the commission paid by a product manufacturer, and that's shifted clearly in terms of structure as I described, but it also shifted in terms of quantum, with advisers taking a greater share of the client value-sharing and who've been moving through those fee levels. The average is today almost exactly 0.75%, but there are a number of different models, and you'll regularly hear people talking about moving into 1% wealth for advice.</p><p>And then finally, the other obvious lever in terms of creating value in Advise business is the average number -- is the average clients that you're serving. I talked about capacity. I think, advice is naturally a capacity constraint -- market is a capacity constraint model. Peter talked a little about and how you can get some efficiencies in that model. But similarly, you can only start of a certain number of clients irrespective of how efficient your model becomes. And average client size is critically important.</p><p>Now we've heard examples where firms in an extreme [ordeal] are taking -- are asking clients to find other source of advice and leave their business in order to increase their average clients and build capacity in that fashion. We think about it slightly differently which is a balancing approach to average client size where, on the one hand, you have clients who have accumulated wealth who are at the later part of their savings journey and probably de-cumulating and people who are in much earlier stage in their savings journey. And this I think is where, in many cases, the pensions opportunity that Peter talked about is really a key, just people are accelerating into saving and into their retirement. But it's a model that we look at in so much a metric that we focus on in a very significant way.</p><p>The final parts of the Schroders research here was the perceived impact of technology, where advisers are clearly telling us that they feel that technology has a very significant role to play in that business both now and in future. I think that where -- if you ask about -- if you ask advisers where they're thinking about this and how they're thinking about it, it's much more in the area of process efficiency and allowing them to serve more clients and removing grand total loss of that friction, but it's removing friction. So if you think about, not in financial services, but if you think about the experience that you have if you shop with Amazon or you take a cab with Uber, a lot of that focus is about removing that friction, making the process of getting the service that you want easier.</p><p>I think that there is another lever or another opportunity here, which is about improving customer experience, be on the process and then simply how we think about our business model evolving in the future. But I think as we start thinking about the business that we are building today, I think -- we're thinking about it in 3 distinct steps.</p><p>Peter talked about the value of a personal relationship. I still think that advice is, at its heart, a deeply personal relation -- it's about a deeply personal relationship between 2 people. If you ask clients what they value most in their relationship with their adviser is it's always the time that they have -- they are able to spend with their adviser. It's very rarely about anything else. And I think that making sure that we value that, we invest in our people, we invest in our service standards, we get advice into the hands of people, where they live much more readily, I think is something that is critically important to the future of this business.</p><p>I talked about technology, and I think as we move to the Benchmark technology, there is an obvious dividend that we will have in terms of process efficiency, which is using the Benchmark CRM and adviser-facing technology, and there is an obvious clients experience dividend through the fusion platform and access to your investments online free for the first time for many of these clients.</p><p>But I think in terms of technology and how we think about the future developments of our business, we are already thinking about that and how our model evolves. And 2 obvious examples there are with the partnership with Lloyds, it would be surprising if I didn't talk about the tremendous opportunities presented by open banking and the ability to integrate your cash, your savings and your investments for the first time, and we are already working on that. But equally, the thinking that we're doing about how people choose to be certain of the future.</p><p>We already have a direct or hybrid capability within our business, which is designed to serve people who don't want or don't value a face-to-face in-person relationship but still want to talk to somebody, and they choose to be served by phone or by Skype or something of that order. And I think that, that's a -- that today is a very small part of our business. But as we think about and we test new ways of doing business and new ways of thinking about our business, I think that's an area where we will keep coming back to and we'll keep testing.</p><p>And finally, I think, it's really important that we build solutions and products that are straightforward, that are simple, good value and meet the needs of our clients. And how we're thinking about that is in 4 boxes. I think it really is very, very important to me that this is an entirely transparent model.</p><p>So we will -- we haven't announced these fee levels yet, which is why you don't see numbers on these. But as soon as we do, we will publish them on our website. We will make them absolutely available to anybody who wants them. And to be very clear about not just the prices that we're charging but the service that we're providing in each of these areas.</p><p>Broadly, though, the initial advice relationship that you -- the initial advice that you get has a range of services and has a fee attached to it. I've talked about ongoing advice already. Discretionary for management is simply around arranging your investments and making sure that your investments remain on track and aligned with the goals that you set with your adviser and the risks that you're prepared to take. And then platform is where the Benchmark technology comes in and the costs for custody and platform services. But it's critically important to me that this is done on a principle of transparency and openness.</p><p>There is a fifth box which will join this in the coming months, which is about funds. And I think there is a significant opportunity where we can launch our own Schroders personal wealth branded funds. As Peter has already said, it's done fully on an open architecture basis. But I think that there is an opportunity to put -- to build and design our own funds to meet the needs of our customers, but I think that there is also a commercial opportunity there as well.</p><p>Now finally, just about the steps we're taking to build this business. The program team that's being created by Lloyds to do -- to help us to do this has been incredibly well resourced. And the commitment that they're showing has been really fantastic. We are approaching this first of our 5 transition steps at the moment where we launched the business, where we put -- where we transfer the people and client relationships into it. Quite quickly after that and after a fairly intensive period of training which was already started, we get new technology in July when Benchmark comes online. And then I've talked about the launch of funds, which are designed to follow that. And we have got an application with the FCA to do that at the moment. And then the last stages are more to do with when Schroders takes their stake later this year, and when we are fully operationally stand-alone and we've exited the transitional service arrangements that we have with Lloyds, which support the business in its first instance.</p><p>So I'd like to say thank you very much for your attention. I think this is -- I would reiterate this is a really exciting time to be launching this business. I think we have a really amazing opportunity. And if you have any questions, I'd be delighted to try and answer them at possibly the most lurid color you could imagine.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JONATHAN RICHARDS, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Jonathan Richards from KBW. Couple of questions for me. In your opinion, what segment of the market do you think is least served with respect to the advice gap at the moment? And how are you positioning the Schroders business to sort of take advantage of that? And secondly, when you think about sort of client evolution throughout their lifetime or earnings period, how are you guys thinking about handoff between different brands, different buckets, whether they started GBP 100,000 and move up to GBP 1 million? And then how are you thinking about sort of fee harmonization between the different brands and, I guess, alongside of that, sort of adviser continuity because it is, as you said, a very personalized business, and if maybe you started with someone at Schroders Lloyds and, all of a sudden, you're now a capable Cazenove client, how are you guys thinking about sort of managing that?</p><p>PETER HARRISON: James will take the first one and Peter will take the second.</p><p>JAMES RAINBOW: Well, I think that how this evolves, I think, is really interesting, and Peter may have some color to this one, making sure that when we're thinking about client segmentation, if we're thinking about the evolution of our client base, we're doing it in a way that first and foremost make sure that we put the right product services and solutions into the hands of our clients at the right time for them. Now I think that if you look at the business today, we've set that our target market is GBP 100,000 to GBP 1 million. And I think based on our average client size, that's absolutely -- that remains absolutely right and absolutely relevant. We actually serve quite a lot of clients today who are above GBP 1 million. And I think the thinking we've done is to say well actually, if the services that we're providing would ensure that personal wealth remained feasible for them, there's no reason why they can't absolutely remain where they are. But increasingly, as you move up that wealth curve, you end up with a client need for -- the client just get more complex. They have more bespoke requirements. They have more bespoke structural needs. And that's a business that we don't intend to be in. And it's a business where I think we talked about the 2 experts approach, where we can bring the expertise from Cazenove and not to break the link with your adviser, but I think to ensure that you're getting the best stock. So I don't think this in here, if you like, a dyssynergy or where we're breaking links, but we've felt very -- we felt acutely aware of the fact that we need to make sure that we're putting the right things into the hands of our clients at the right moment.</p><p>PETER HALL: Yes. And I absolutely agree with James. This has to be driven by client need rather than sort of arbitrary level of investable assets. But I think we're building a very, very good relationship between the 2 businesses. And to give you an example of that, that was on the Lloyds side a sort of fairly high-end book of clients, about GBP 400 million, around 300 individuals. And over the past couple of months, we have transferred those over to Cazenove. And we've double-headed the client meetings, working together. And it's been an incredibly easy and seamless approach, where we have hung on to I think 98% of those, and a couple of them chose to stay behind. So I think that, as James says, there comes a point where a client need may be better met, say for example, access to private assets or a customized segregated portfolio, in which case, we're in a very good place to do it.</p><p>Quick view on your first point is that, inevitably, I think when people talk about the advice gap that is very much a mass affluent space, isn't it? And so it is very much in the space where sometimes individual clients at that level feel as though they are not being looked after by their existing adviser, because they're not profitable enough. In that space, obviously, the ability for us to provide top-quality care profitably through the sorts of hybrid solutions that James is talking about is the approach. And to be honest with you, as I look at competitors, I don't think there's much out there doing a good job in that space.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: I think if you get back on that chart pre 2009 in terms of number of advisers, you get the numbers of 80,000 and 90,000. Now you can argue about what level of qualification, et cetera, but the world was very different at a different time. And as Peter says, this is that segment which has suffered the most.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just in terms of the point you made about sort of fees -- adviser fees potentially moving to a new world where we get to 100 basis points or so for adviser fees. Is that the expense of the Asset Management fees coming down so you can position them to a client and the overall cost fee is the same but we're taking a -- but we get a lower product? So that's the first question. And then the second one, just around the integrated flows within the model. How are the advisers incentivized if you have an integrated flow from the start through to the end? Are they incentivized at a higher rate?</p><p>PETER HARRISON: If I could just touch on the first. Part of the whole purpose of this strategy is that asset managers typically take -- have taken 25%, 30% of the value chain and that has come down. So post RDR, the windfall of the client has not been there. But James...</p><p>JAMES RAINBOW: Yes. And I think, yes, we talked a lot about the fact that there's been this, we call this, inversion of the value chain where, traditionally, if you're a manufacturer meaning you set the price through the chain and then, of course, what effectively the RDR has done is flip that on its head. And that's really important. No, I think the -- we've been really clear on incentivization that we are not moving into a sales coach. And I will fight until they've got the last breath in my body about the fact that anybody who is challenging me that this is -- yes, this is some sort of return to a 30 or a model of bank assurance and stuff, I will reject it outright and wholeheartedly. I think that we are talking about incentivizing peoples who do a great job for their clients irrespective of the services that we need. Now I also -- I think that the notion about an integrated model is one that I think it's one size fits all and you must access all of the sort of touch points that we -- that I put up on the chart. And again, I think that's absolutely not the case. So whether it be a handoff to Cazenove but equally whether or not a particular service is right, suitable and appropriate for a particular client, that's absolutely critical to our mind in our model. I think that the opportunity, as we see it, is more can we build the individual range of services which are individually described and individually priced in order to make sure that where we have client needs, we're capable of meeting them within our group rather than talking about something which is very highly -- very siloed and very functionally aligned as to a single solution.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: There's one piece that is missing from James' presentation, and you hopefully understand why is that because we haven't gone live, the detailed financials that you would hope to have to model us out were not there. Peter gave a small snapshot, but it weren't surprising that the number of assets per adviser, the flow rate through the adviser population and translating that into new business, and the number of touch points coming out of the Lloyds Banking Group are very low levels. And part of the normalization versus part -- as well as putting in new technology, a new rate card is also driving the efficiency of this esteemed business. We can see a transformation in the profitability of the business just from doing that before one starts doing these other things. And that's -- yes, that's why that -- it's going to take us 1.5 years to re-platform to get it right. After that, then it starts to get exciting. But I would hate you to just go away from your models and think this is easy. We're going to put the old numbers in for next year and the year after. The opportunity here is a 5-year but material [EV] creation, but it's not next year. Sorry, seems [away]...</p><p>ARNAUD MAURICE ANDRE GIBLAT, MD &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Arnaud Giblat from Exane. One question, please. Aside from the share of profit for Lloyds, is there -- are you incentivizing Lloyds in any way to send over clients?</p><p>PETER HARRISON: There is an -- we have an agreement in place. But there's no incentive to do that. So -- and it was very clear at the outset that we would not do that in order to make sure that the -- again, this was about meeting client needs rather than meeting numbers and targets. So yes, there's no incentive in place other than the fact, of course, that we would hope that there's an aligned material interest simply because Lloyds have the ownership stake in this business and they, like Schroders, clearly want it to succeed and to flourish.</p><p>We're to take one last question and we'll move on.</p><p>HUBERT LAM: So it's Hubert Lam from Bank of America. Two questions, firstly on client advisers. For you to get to where you want to be, what would you say is the mix between hiring people and homegrown talent? Secondly, in terms of hiring and poaching new people, what's the typical cost of poaching good advisers? And has that changed over time?</p><p>PETER HARRISON: So in terms of mix, we've got targets for both, and they are blended. I think that we've talked about I think some fairly ambitious targets for academy and I -- but I think it will take a little -- to Peter's point, going to take a little time to set that up and to get the wheels turning. But -- and equally, where advertiser talent is available, then I think that we would be an attractive home for it. And certainly, the level of interest, just latent interest that we generated would already indicate that we've got a lot of interest in people coming to join this business. To be -- I mean, as an example, [nonex] which is a non-advice role but we put in an advice -- we put a role into the market last week and we've got 88 applicants for it, which I think is a relatively unusual position to be in and indicates the level of interest that we've got. And we've had a lot of interest from advisers as well. Schroders has the # 1 brand in the advice market. So if you're an adviser, this is not a -- not an unattractive vendor.</p><p>I think in terms of cost, to be honest, there are pockets of really hot concentration where it's expensive and where it's standing stage is where it's most acute. But there is a massive geographic dispersion in terms of the cost of advisers and equally the competition for those advisers. I think that where we've baselined our compensation and, given that adequate flexibility, I think that we got enough in terms of the -- in making it financially attractive but also the other sort of soft factors to make this an attractive place to come, whether or not you're in a place like in the middle of London or somewhere else in the U.K.</p><p>I'm going to stop at that and ask Susan to pick up. And then [we windup]. Thank you, James.</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>JAMES RAINBOW: I mentioned already Susan has grown for us over many years the leading business in Singapore. So I'm delighted that she's taken up the challenge of now transforming the consumer experience around the world.</p><p>SUSAN SOH, CEO - SINGAPORE, SCHRODERS PLC: Well, good morning. I am very privileged to be representing Asia to share with you some of the very exciting digital pursuits that we are undertaking in our part of the region. But before I get into that, I would like to give you a quick overview of what our business in Asia looks like.</p><p>Our footprint in Asia is one of the best in the industry. We are represented across 8 countries in all the major financial markets in Asia. And we include our joint venture with Axis Bank in India, then we are in 9 countries in Asia.</p><p>Over the last 5 years, we have grown our AUM at a CAGR of 7.8% to reach just under GBP 91 billion. And last year, we contributed as a region GBP 477 million to the group's revenue. Our investment expertise in investing in Asian markets has a very long track record of over 40 years. And we are well rated by consultants in our region. We employ over 900 staff in the region, of which 12% are investment professionals.</p><p>Over the course of last year, we did 2 transactions and entered into 1 strategic partnership. The first transaction is that we took a strategic 20% stake in a digital technology -- wealth technology provider called WeInvest. Now the rationale is to enable us to broaden our service offering to our distributor clients who are actively building up their digital advisory tools.</p><p>The next is that we signed a strategic partnership with Maybank. Peter Hall has mentioned about that. Maybank is the largest banking group in Malaysia. Out of every 10 Malaysians, there will be 7 Malaysians that will have account with Maybank, right? In the partnership, we not only are providing the regular investment funds and the [DPM] portfolios from Cazenove to be distributed by Maybank in Malaysia. We are also working with them to deliver a B2B2C digital wealth advisory platform targeting the Islamic and conventional customer deposit base.</p><p>Now the third acquisition is ThirdRock, and Peter has mentioned the rationale for it. So I would just skip it.</p><p>Next I would like to share with you the very fast evolving landscape in the financial ecosystem in Asia. First is technology. It's not new to any part of the world. The digital revolution is very much enhanced by the mobile connectivity network and the extensive availability of data.</p><p>So across Asia, we are seeing a lot of tasks being automated and also business models evolving. So the financial ecosystem is not spared.</p><p>Next, Asia is home to more than 800 million digitally very savvy millennial. Now this is a group or a generation that thrives on global connectivity and is very demanding of the immediacy of service offerings. Now in investing, they are very cognizant of cost comparisons. And they would also want to express their individual preferences, such as their support to impact and sustainable investing. They also have a very positive -- or progressive attitude towards transacting. And they would also demand positive user experience.</p><p>Also across Asia, our regulators are recalibrating their approaches to support digital technology and fintech solutions. This is because they want to actually have better and more efficient choices for the consumers. So we saw the sprouting of a new channel of distribution in the form of global advisers. And just before I left for London, the Hong Kong SFC has announced the approval of 2 digital banking licenses, one to Alibaba and the other one to Tencent. Now you know that these are the 2 institutions that have created the momentum for digital adoption across Asia. And they are now setting their sights in providing digital banking services and wealth advisory services.</p><p>Although currently, they are only managing money market fund. And I'm sure you have heard of the world's largest money market fund called Yu'e Bao managed by Alibaba. Now in time to come as they acquire more clients and they learn more about wealth management, they would be making -- or they can be expected to make a greater impact.</p><p>Additionally, the regulators across Asia are also talking about open banking. Singapore and Hong Kong have already announced their open API framework. And Japan, Australia and Korea are set to follow.</p><p>Now open banking envision an environment where open flows of data permitted by customer can be aggregated. This will potentially lead to increased competition and also the demand for more personalized services.</p><p>So our incumbent distributors are all reacting to this. What they have been doing is that they have been building digital wealth advisory platform to enhance their client servicing and also to scale into segments of their clients that are currently underserved.</p><p>On top of that, for the RM channel, which is the relationship managers -- in Asia, we call them RMs rather than advisers, for their RM models, they are also building digital tools to help the RMs become more efficient so that they can move up the value chain of wealth advisory to focus on discussing life goals and retirement planning rather than on transactional sale of investment products. And with open banking, the banks are also exploring tools and solutions to help them offer personalized services to the end customers.</p><p>So how should we, as asset manager, reinvent ourselves to remain relevant in this digital age? Now this is the reinvention journey that we in Asia have set for ourselves to develop a strategy for the digital age.</p><p>First, we started off by looking at enhancing our own internal productivity. Moving technology. So we were the first in the group to actually roll out RPA, Robotic Process Automation, to automate the repetitive process of our daily work life. And this is to free up resources to be able to focus on doing digital projects.</p><p>Next, we started to identify what are the technological capabilities that we will need to actually help our distributor clients transform. We saw the need to actually have a wealth technology provider. And that's why we took a stake in WeInvest. And we started to look at the value chain of wealth advisory and identify interesting points where we can develop digital tools to help enable our distributors. So we started to develop a chat bot. We're in the process of developing digital training, and we are leveraging on the group's investIQ which is a client profiling tool to actually offer to our distributors.</p><p>And finally, with platforms proliferating, it actually opens up an opportunity for us to provide solutions to this platform. So we are learning to transition from a product provider to a provider of advisory solutions.</p><p>And through this reinvention journey, this is what we have built up in terms of a service offering framework for our clients. And this is on top of the strategic investment capabilities that we already have.</p><p>So the first is platform-as-a-service offering that we can offer to our distributors and then advisory-as-a-service offering. And finally, in the world of open banking, we will be innovating AI tools to be able to continue to enable our distributors in that environment.</p><p>And with this service offering framework, we proactively go out and engage our distributors beyond the B2B relationship of a product provider that we already have with them. And in so doing, we are able to develop a B2B2C relationship with our distributors, and that will actually enable us to create a longer-term and more sustainable relationship with them.</p><p>Now these are the service offerings that we can offer to our distributors in terms of platform building. WeInvest, as a technology -- a digital technology provider, it is able to provide our distributors with front-end account opening or client onboarding even to the point of execution for our distributor clients.</p><p>They are also able to build digital robo for distributors who wants to actually build self-serve models. And at the back end, they are able to build account aggregation models and also client reporting models for the distributors. So we have been taking WeInvest around to see our clients. And they have been winning views through us opening doors for them.</p><p>The next is Schroders GO, a chat bot that we have built to enhance our client servicing for our distributor. Now this is a chat bot that can actually offer real-time fund information and market information to the RMs. And on top of that, the chat bot is able to compare our own fund information with that of our competitors. So we reinvent the word coopetition, cooperating with our competitor to win. And in the Phase II of Schroders GO, we will actually be pushing out the Schroders' tight leadership through that platform.</p><p>Now digital training is what we are currently developing. Now if you imagine what the branch traffic would be like within this digital age, that has significantly reduced. Now as part of our distribution agreement with our clients in Asia, we are obligated to provide training to the RMs of our distributors. Now if branch traffic has come down, the RMs are not going to be in the branches for you to train them. So we felt that by developing this tool, we will continuously be able to reach out to them and continue to own their mind share in terms of the products that we are offering as well as our obligation to train them. So on this platform, there will be investment 101 training, which we would be gamifying the investment concepts, there will be product training, and there will also be a facility or utility that will track CPD hours. This is the continual professional training hours or development hours that is required for the RMs to continuously renew their license every year.</p><p>So we have actually sounded our distributor clients out. They are very excited about this, too, and are waiting in anticipation.</p><p>Now for solution to advisory-as-a-service, the group already have model portfolio service solutions which are risk-based. And this is actually leveraging on the -- or built from the strategic asset allocation and the tactical views of our multi-asset team. And this is open architecture. So the client can specify the universe, and we can provide that model portfolio, invest that universe.</p><p>Peter mentioned that, in Asia, we are pioneering something called the mass customized solutions. Now this is the life-goal solutions that Peter is referring to. This solution would be able to cater to the changing life goals of an individual. As individuals, our life goals never remain static. It changes over the time.</p><p>So this solution will be able to cater for that and adapt as an individual moves along his life journey, right? And if you think about the world of open banking when data -- individual data becomes available, this solution would be able to take data and as adapt itself as it goes along.</p><p>So on top of that, we are also building within this solution the ability to cater for individual preferences. Remember, I mentioned that the millennials love to actually assert their individual preferences, and this would be able to cater for it. And with technology, this would become individual portfolios for each client.</p><p>Now the group also has a client profiling tool called investIQ, which I think, I mentioned earlier. Now this is a client profiling tool that is built based on behavioral science. It is designed for investors to actually better understand their own personal investing instincts. The tool is put on our Internet, and there were 40,000 tests that has been completed globally, and it is available in 17 countries and 15 languages.</p><p>And we believe that by offering solutions or advisory solutions as a service to our distributor, it gets us one step closer to the end clients, because we will be able to understand the end clients' needs better.</p><p>Now as open banking comes about, we are all ready to be thinking about innovation in the space of AI and machine learning. So we will be leveraging our data science team and our robotics teams and, together with Graham Kellen, who will be talking about our other digital -- group digital pursuits, we will be looking at innovating in that space.</p><p>Now how successful have we been in using this approach to engage our clients? Here are some examples. With investIQ, Ant Financial, which is a part of Alibaba, has taken up the tool. And 3 months into the deployment of the tool, 600,000 tests has been done. This is a fantastic bending exercise to our Asian business into the domestic Chinese markets. Additionally, Citibank in the region has entered into a partnership to actually take the tool and use it as a conversation starter with their clients.</p><p>And back in Singapore, a bank is currently seeking regulatory approval to use the tool as a complement to their traditional [KYC] in order to risk profile their client in their -- on their digital-services platform.</p><p>And in terms of developing advisory solutions for our clients, I mentioned Maybank earlier. Maybank -- in Maybank's case, we are developing wealth advisory solution that is able to accommodate the Sharia restriction principles in the solution.</p><p>And with another bank in Singapore, we are actually developing a life-goal solution where they would be providing us with the data in order for us to actually customize.</p><p>For Schroders GO, we have wrote out to 11 intermediary clients in Singapore. And the region is looking at deploying the tool on a broader basis. And for digital training, we are expecting to complete the development of the platform at the end of the year, looking to roll out early part of next year.</p><p>This is a sneak preview of what the life-goal or mass-customize solution would look like. It would combine the investment capability of our multi-asset team with life-goal forecasting tool and will be digitally delivered across to each individual clients. So we believe that solutions like this would truly put client at the center of the proposition.</p><p>And in Maybank's case, we are using the preference model of the life-goal solution to actually optimize the portfolio based on the prescribed restriction that the Sharia principles have. And this would include a limit on leverage ratio, prohibited financial instruments, prohibited activities, purification -- it's actually philanthropy, and also exclusion of interest-taking deposits.</p><p>Now we believe that our approach or our strategy of a B2B2C approach will actually harness our strategic benefits over the long time, right? This will enable us to actually get closer to the end client by delivering customer solutions that are focused on solving client-specific needs.</p><p>It would also improve our longevity with our distributor client, because we will be embedding our digital tools and solution early onto their digital platform as they are building it. And internally, these tools will also help us improve our own efficiency. So tools like Schroders GO and digital training cuts down a lot of our resources in terms of client servicing and training.</p><p>That's the end of my presentation. I'm happy to take questions.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: Thank you, Susan. There's quite a lot of work in progress here so -- and there's quite a lot of sensitivity about names and things. So you would have seen lots of referrals to vague things that are going on. And you understand that we don't want to put up exactly what we're doing with many of the distributors -- or many of the distributors at this stage. But any questions for Susan?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MICHAEL JOSEPH WERNER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mike Werner here from UBS. Just a quick question on the investIQ platform that you have. When you provide that to your client base who then go and implement that in their own digital platform, are you able to see the data that is coming in from those client responses from those tests that you mentioned, the other 600,000 from Ant Financial? Or is that kind of the data of the client and not accessible from shareholders' perspective?</p><p>SUSAN SOH: He's the technical guy.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: We'll hear from Graham in a moment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It depends on the client relationship. (inaudible) want to get this (inaudible) to make the (inaudible) finance work, but we don't see the underlying data. On most cases, the client (inaudible) protection of that data (inaudible) get the statistical model results that they need to fully (inaudible) They help refine (inaudible)</p><p>MICHAEL JOSEPH WERNER: And I guess in terms of the feedback that you have gotten from those clients, has that actually been integrated? Or how does -- how is that integrated in terms of the service and products that you will provide or you plan to provide going forward?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think Susan showed that it's part of (inaudible) approach of moving across the value chain. We designed it using (inaudible) version. We designed it using micro services like to stay behind seamless (inaudible) where they can (inaudible) use to work around it to take out content, to change the questions which (inaudible) behavioral science (inaudible) For them, it's really easy. We absolutely set out to recognize that the way risk profiling works in most (inaudible) doesn't take into account the true personal situation of advisers or the true risk nature of (inaudible) so we wanted to address that (inaudible) in this product we've built.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: Susan, thank you. We're now going to stop for a quick cup of coffee and resume in 15 minutes. All good? Great. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>GRAHAM KELLEN, CHIEF DIGITAL OFFICER, SCHRODERS PLC: So yes, I think I'm very impressed that everybody came back. Actually, I think several years ago, the thought of talking about a technology discipline after a break would have cleared the room. So thank you.</p><p>So what I'm going to do today, as Peter says, is really talk to you about the journey we've been on. I think today the great think you've seen is when people talk about digital, the first question they generally ask is what does that mean, what does it do. It generally, historically, has been a very technical discipline.</p><p>But what you've seen today is really the outcomes that the journey we've been on over the last 3 years have enabled us to do. And really part of the thing I would like to discuss with you today is that transition from just being technology to becoming an enabler and then the future state of us really becoming a value driver.</p><p>So over the last 3 years, Schroders have spent a great deal of time really understanding the trends, the technologies that are available to financial services as a whole and to other industries and really trying to understand which of them we should be harnessing, which of them are hype and which ones that we should be maturing our own capability of being able to deliver.</p><p>And as you can see, we recognize all of those and we're at varying degrees on each of those. The ones that I think we are now recognized through awards with being voted the Digital Asset Manager of Asia, for our being voted by the [Living Group] as the #2 globally in terms of digital intelligence. We've managed to harness some of these and really start to drive them into the core of our business.</p><p>Going forward, over the next 3 years, the sorts of areas we're starting to think about is the next generation, the next follow-on from Robotic Process Automation, which we're calling and is called in the industry as intelligent agents. There is so much hype around artificial intelligence, but we will be looking at the true advances in that in terms of deep learning.</p><p>We've already seen the new interfaces, conversational interfaces in terms of a chat bot, the APIs needed to drive technologies and delivery of extra services to our clients, such as investIQ, and then also how that would power the platforms that actually drive the wealth management business that you've already heard explained.</p><p>One of the other things we're looking at is as we become a data-driven organization, it's really important that we constantly keep giving our users and our colleagues the very best visualization tools. And over the next 3 years, we expect to see an emergence of much more 3-dimensional visualization of data because, as you start to get more complex, and the search for alpha increases of trying to find those insights that nobody else can find, 2-dimensional view is not enough. So we'll be exploring that going forward.</p><p>But it's not just about technology. What it's also about is thinking across the whole organization. So one of the key things over the last 3 years has been that digital has gone from just being a distribution and a marketing support function to working right across the organization. Everything we do, we break into -- has to comply with 1 of these 4 pillars. It has to improve the customer experience. It has to improve our operational processes. It has to challenge, evolve or refine our business model. And also one of the key things that's often forgotten which I'll talk about in terms of digital strategy is how do you change the culture of the organization to be able to accept the new ways of working, the new technologies, how do you create that innovation culture for people who are at the grassroots of the organization to be able to identify the things they could be doing differently and how do you make those happen. And then also how do you provide people with the skills to understand and really leverage the technology or the new capabilities we're putting in their hand. And the key enablers for that inevitably are analytics and data science. Becoming a more data-driven organization means that you can find the insights and you can see some of the problems a lot quicker, so democratizing that. The emerging technologies we talked about but also, to Susan's point, about coopetition and collaboration. We've also, as part of our digital strategy, significantly changed our approach in how we interact with fintechs.</p><p>Over the last 3 years, we've gone from seeing them as potentially in the robo space as competition to actually somebody we can work with. So fintechs, we spend an awful lot of time collaborating with and actually working with them to create solutions for asset management and wealth management.</p><p>Over the last 3 years, one of the key things we've seen is the definition of the opportunity for fintechs, that this space, asset management and wealth management, is somewhere they can really play in and provide solutions to.</p><p>So I'm going to touch on the customer experience area briefly and really before I start on that, it's been a key mission over the last 3 years for us as an organization to understand the change in customer experience. A decade ago, when I've previously worked in asset management, it practically felt that people still believed institutional clients would like to receive a [quail-based] letter. But now in every walk of life, in every aspect of their working life and of their personal life, our clients, our intermediaries, our end consumers, the B2C, they now live in a world where technology is everywhere. They are connected all the time in every aspect of what they do. And what we have worked hard to understand is the various touch points of that and how does that affect us staying relevant in that changing world, in that new connected environment and how do we deliver products and services to that. We also provide the capability to work with our distributors for them to understand their market as well.</p><p>And how that's translated is that change in the user experience expectation. So we now have got in the digital team an experienced design team. Everything we do, we now recognize that understanding experience, the service design, how that's delivered, the context in which it's delivered is absolutely essential. It is part of the product.</p><p>So when Peter was talking about that focus historically of the industry just on performance numbers, we're now looking much broader, and we're understanding how is this delivered. And this has resulted in significant changes.</p><p>Schroders GO that Susan talked about is actually a [whole of] market, chat bot. So actually, you can ask a question about non-Schroders products. That was quite a leap. Traditionally, I think, an organization providing the first chat bot in Asia, as we are, would have just focused it on just Schroders products. But we actually ran some client focus groups, and they liked the product, they liked what it would do for them, but they actually said but it would be helpful if I could look all funds and I could actually compare them. So that's what we did. And that's why it had significant success.</p><p>So various sorts of areas. We've also recently, as you know, worked with marketing and brand to really define our brand and the digital experience of that. And that's been quite key because, as we move to multi-platform consumption of our content, we have to be able to make that still feel cohesive to the end consumer. And really, I guess the best analogy is working like Apple and really caring as much about the box that the product comes in as the actual product.</p><p>Some of the data science capability that we've been working on, we've now started to roll out across the organization. And that means we've reached a significant level of maturity now in the data science techniques and the capabilities to provide a really great understanding of what our clients actually want. That isn't just about personal face-to-face user group conversations.</p><p>It's really understanding of the content we push out there, the thought leadership we push out there and the client interactions, our advisers and our salespeople have, how do we start to categorize that, how do we start to use that as a data resource to be able to provide our users analogy internally, provide our sales teams and our marketers and product designers with their own Iron Man suit, with a JARVIS that's constantly feeding them real-time data about how successful the article has been, whether or not the clients are finding the certain topics we're talking about interestingly.</p><p>We've actually started to be able to engineer for the first time a direct correlation between website activity and investment into product. That's absolute gold for both us as a product manufacturer but also for our distribution partners to be able to provide them with the clarity of what pitch is, what events, what activities, the actual evidence to show that those are working. And you can see there, there's a sort of dashboard we call the sales cockpit, which shows what's going on and the information there. And you can search for when a product has been discussed and what the sentiment was. So we've taken that very sort of leading-edge digital marketing capability, and we've turned it on to an internal lens.</p><p>But again, going back to the original point of it's not just about marketing, we've applied the same techniques and capabilities across the organization. So focusing on operational improvements, Susan talked about Singapore leading the way in our robotic process automation. These are some of the numbers that we've shown. So we've got 79 bots working. There are 10 business areas that are actually leveraging those. And what's interesting is those 100 FTE equivalents are freeing up people's capacity.</p><p>Think about your own working day. When you come into work in the morning, there are activities. Either quarterly, monthly or daily you have to do, they're very mundane. You have to collate data. You have to process information before you can actually start to do your job. And what we're really seeing is the opportunity here is taking those slices of non-value in our generating activity from a sort of productivity perspective and actually taking them away from people who should be doing other things and automating them for them. So when they come into work, the task is already done. The data is ready to go. They've got the information they need to do their job. And that's the real value of this. And we're starting to apply more intelligent automation going forward to start allowing there to be decisions and criteria around certain follow-on activities.</p><p>One of the other things we found is, for example, when we implemented RPA in Singapore, for example, we found this latent business engineering capability where some of the people that we were taking out time from their day and freeing them up, they actually had computer science degrees that they weren't really using in the general day. So by being able to provide them with these sorts of tools, they can now code their own robots to actually do other tasks and actually start to free up their own time and really get to being a much more self-service capability.</p><p>The other area I think that's been really revolutionary for us is we were one of the first movers to implement a data science function within the investment research and investment space. We've now reached the maturity of that where as I said in distribution and marketing that capability is now being rolled out across the organization. And we spent an awful amount of time understanding the data that we need to be able to create, to manage.</p><p>And that's a significant part of what we do, that data management, and that's now happening across the organization in all the different spaces. Part of the benefit of the digitization of what we do is the vast amounts of data that we then get, organizing that and then being able to provide those feedback loops on the objectives, the success of those activities or finding those lean opportunities to actually redefine the process to take out the wasted activity or the areas that we could just automate anyway.</p><p>So that's now reaching a significant level, and we're starting to find that by democratizing the data science capability and making it available to everybody through both our own skills development, also the commoditization of those technologies is becoming much easier to actually overlay technology on top of the data we've got to start to help people serve themselves but also to be able to find the ways in which we can then learn from that and improve what we do. So the democratization of the analytics has also been a key activity because it's one thing being able to capture the data to be able to analyze the data, but it's the visualization of that, which has also been key. So rolling out a global analytics practice to help every aspect of the business define the reports and insights that they need on a daily basis.</p><p>So fundamentally, the toolkit available to a fund manager and pretty much to most other people in the organization has fundamentally changed. So now we have the ability to give them analytics and insights on their data. We now are building a really sophisticated data platform. We're just launching a project, which will deliver an internal data marketplace. One of the things about democratizing that data is if you think about your own organizations and our own peers often, often they have lots of data, but it's in silos. And getting access to that data is one of the biggest inhibitors to becoming a data-driven organization.</p><p>So part of our digital strategy is to find ways of being able to make that able to be shared within a safe and appropriate way and allow people to -- instead of the previous models of people having their own copy of the data, manipulating it doing their job and then it not being useful to anybody else, we want to be able to create this data marketplace across the organization that everybody will be able to work on the raw data collectively. So they will have access to it, and then as they work and refining that and creating value out of that data, they can then share it. So then that means that the application of robotics to take some of the manual tasks out of those processes and then applying machine learning and artificial intelligence creates a very different skill set and capability, where it gives us scalability and it gives us insights and efficiencies faster.</p><p>The previous 2 elements of better data about what your client is doing, what your client wants, looking at your operational processes to drive efficiency and increase the capability of those lead you naturally to the ability to actually evolve, challenge and redefine your business models. So the living proof of that -- unfortunately, he's not in the room now -- is really Susan and Jane's rainbow where we're able -- through acquisition of a technology-centric business such as Benchmark, we're able to enter into a joint venture to be able to provide technology that previously wouldn't have been made available or wouldn't help us to be able to operate at the scale we now need to work at.</p><p>And really that's a reflection of the journey that digital has had through the asset management industry. So where you see Susan talking about being able to provide enhanced products and services, that is a very natural progression, and it's a journey we've been on over the last 3 years. So when we first started out in digital -- unfortunately, I was there -- in 2001, it was just about creating websites and marketing. Then we evolved into being a sales support tool, starting to evolve into client services, where we're providing portals for clients where they'd log in. The reality of those portals was that we were probably 1 of 8 providers.</p><p>So we weren't necessarily solving the client problem. We were solving our part of the problem. So what we needed to do is now moving into Digital 3.0, is really start to co-create financial solutions with our clients and actually provide solutions to their exact problems. So an institution we would now expect to be either working with them with something like Symphony, where we create a live data stream for them or actually providing APIs for them to be able to plug the data into their core systems, whereas previously and traditionally, they would receive a PDF version of the data, which is completely -- although it's informative, they have to [re-get that data]. It doesn't form part of their own business value chain. So what we're trying to do now is reinvent how we deliver that information, working with our partners and distributors to actually create those data streams of a variety of data.</p><p>So our API strategy is very key in terms of how we cooperate and really design financial products and solutions. And that's true for our intermediaries and distribution partners. As Susan was explaining, by providing tools that go into that client relationship, a, that helps to provide better outcomes for the end consumer. So we are much more sure by providing things like investIQ as part of the risk profiling process, we are much more sure that we are confident about client suitability of those products being sold to that client. But also, we have been part of that journey. And as we work with those distributors and partners, to get feedback about what worked and what doesn't, hopefully that will inform our product design and the design of our capabilities and services.</p><p>And it is about longevity. So providing these services creates a deep relationship with our partners in every way. A, we are easy to work with. We've removed friction from the process of buying and selling products. And we're seen as a deep partnership where we really help them try and understand their clients and help them deliver value to their clients.</p><p>Classic example is the Ant Financial. The Ant Financial discussion that got us to deliver investIQ to them was something that was born out of our desire to get much closer to the client in terms of understanding the experience they wanted. We ran a workshop in Hong Kong. We invited Ant Financial along when we were just designing the very start of that product. And we designed the capability for a client to be able to take this and use it for their own relationship discussions right from the very beginning.</p><p>Those conversations drove the design, the technology that was being used, and how we would actually think about how we would manage the security of the data and how we would run that part of the technology platform. And it is those sort of platform decisions that form an equal part of understanding the client and delivering value to them and is a key part of what we're calling Digital 3.0.</p><p>So this all is -- being a digital leader is great, but you need to make sure in my job that you keep the organization with you. So I spend a lot of time working with senior leaders, helping them understand the art of the possible, helping them understand why something is hyped, why something isn't quite mature yet but also that certain things are very mature and we really should be exploiting them and then working with to work out how they should be able to leverage those and also on the ground helping people who are living the interactions with our platforms, running our business on the grassroots level, really helping them understand this disruption that they're seeing in their everyday working life, helping to balance some of the hype that you get in the media about robots taking all of our jobs, et cetera, and really, a, demystifying it for them but also making them informed so that they can be part of that change, too.</p><p>And so we've developed sort of a 3-level digital training program, which we're rolling out in the second half of this year, which will be foundational level for everybody in the organization and help them understand both the digital transformation they're seeing in their personal life but also their working life and then helping them specialize in certain areas such as AI, machine learning, robotic process automation to help them become really quite expert in that in terms of being a practitioner on the ground. And then for certain people that we're working with that will be actually driving those change and really identifying where that application would really provide value, we're providing the absolute master class level.</p><p>We see this. So everything I've talked about, we see as a significant competitive differentiator. So everything today -- as a former technologist and a former entrepreneur, it's great to work at Schroders because our embracing of technology is significant. You've seen it today. It's mentioned in every presentation. And the desire to change and disrupt ourselves is huge, and we see that as working on the application of this as a key driver of our future.</p><p>The final thing I'd talk about is how we are learning from other organizations, be they a fintech, be those big tech on the East Coast, and really understanding how we can inject into our organization those different ways of thinking. The recruits I have in digital are not often traditional financial services employees. They come from telecommunications. They come from big tech. They come from fintechs themselves. And that's really key because they bring that very different perspective, and they inject into the discussions that slightly different way of thinking.</p><p>The other way we do that is through our Cobalt program where we work with incubational startups, where they have a product that may not be quite right at the moment for asset management or they have an asset management applicable product but we think it would be really interesting to actually use that in our organization. And instead of doing the usual thing of setting up a lab or setting up a garage in Shoreditch where they all sit on beanbags and play table tennis all day, we decided to do it in a very different way. So we actually bring them into the organization.</p><p>One of the promises of fintech mentoring and fintech engagement is that your staff will mentor them. Well, if you've done that outside the organization, they're not going to get the time because everybody is too busy. And the other challenge with innovating with a fintech external to your organization is, to be honest, you haven't really dealt with the problems, which are compliance, which are legal, which are information security and it's your technology infrastructure.</p><p>So by bringing them into the organization at the very beginning, we tackle all of those issues head-on and actually significantly change our procurement process, our legal processes. We're getting NDAs, and how we actually design contract for companies are very new and also working with our information security guys to help them understand the different ways of working on the cloud and the different ways you can work with data.</p><p>So over the last year, we've met with over 400 startups. You can see on there that 30 of them were running with active proof of concepts. And what we also do is by having those engagements and understanding those technologies and where they may be applicable, we also run hackathons right now on the 9th floor. There is a distribution hackathon going on where we are working with our distribution folks.</p><p>My internal and my external innovation team are working with the distribution folks to explain to them very much in the Google way of giving up 5% of your time, giving up 5% of your working time over the next 3 months, how can you innovate and change something in your organization. So right now, they're upstairs. They're going through the ideation process, this morning. This afternoon, they'll refine those ideas. And then later on, they will then decide which of those ideas are going to be successful and worth pursuing over the next 3 months.</p><p>Last week, Peter very kindly hosted our own internal hackathon, which is a global one, where it's an innovation challenge. And the great thing, when we first started out, it was a load of technology. So we're just finding technical things they could do. This time around, we've have had 69 ideas submitted, of which completely, to be frank, 66 of them were actually business ideas. There wasn't actually much technology involved at all. And pretty much none -- I think all but 2 of them were new technology.</p><p>So it was taking the existing technology, finding new ways of doing new business things that actually have significant value. And we chose the winner, and the winner will now be funded because as we work with our key technology delivery partners, we run a sort of innovation fund where we accumulate funds. And then we use that to then make sure that those innovative ideas actually make it into the real world. And actually, if you didn't know, Schroders GO was a previous -- the chatbot, was actually a previous winner of an internal hackathon. So we now have a track record of taking that idea that came out of Singapore from a very small team where they decided that it will be great if you could get fun prizes just by using a chatbot. And we took that idea. We got business sponsorship and we've delivered it.</p><p>So in summary, I hope I've been able to illustrate to you that digital at Schroders is not just about the traditional digital aspect of distribution and marketing. We are a team that champions new ways of working. We're driving and working with senior leaders to really understand how they can disrupt their own business. And we're actually delivering value to both of our clients, we're improving our operational efficiency, and we're also upskilling our employees and colleagues for the future. And the combination of that is presenting some quite interesting opportunities for us to innovate our business. Thank you.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: Thanks, Graham. I've got one other thing that I think we -- in transforming people's personal technology, we've enabled the organization to go get rid of paper, work in an agile manner. So we weren't able to move 1,800 people necessarily into this building because of the structure. But the fact that we put 2,500 people in this building because we're able to work agile, that was driven by a technology platform and ability for people to log on anywhere, any moment within 3 seconds. And that just changes the whole tempo of the organization. It makes you far more appealing to a different group of employees that perhaps wouldn't have been attracted to financial services in the first place.</p><p>Questions for Graham. I thought that was going to be the case. Gurjit. Thank you.</p><p>GURJIT SINGH KAMBO: It's Gurjit, JP Morgan. In terms of when you're looking out the sort of digital propositions to clients, how tailored are these solutions? And I guess what I'm trying to understand is the tailoring versus the scalability in these solutions.</p><p>GRAHAM KELLEN: So I would say that the reality is that change happens, and every client -- you have to build these things knowing every client will have different requirements. So we are very fortunate, I think, in this day and age that by developing micro-services, so by itemizing everything you do into very small components allows you a greater deal of agility. But we also go into these things. I think traditionally when people were building monolithic solutions, they would have a very defined use case and it would only cater for that use case.</p><p>So we try and be a bit more flexible when we're developing those now, but also the technology we're delivering allows us -- so the CREST example, somebody asked about the data on investIQ. We've designed that so that it can be delivered on-prem for the client, it can be in the cloud of their choosing, or we can host it for them. So by having that micro-service capability, it gives us the ability to deal with those nuances that worked in client technology delivery for 20 years. And every time you go to a client, it's different. So we just try to bake that in from the get-go.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: I think that -- but it allows us to do many other variables of investIQ, which we haven't talked about, but deliver -- which will come from the same technology platform. So you can rescan this over and over again.</p><p>GRAHAM KELLEN: And that really has been learned from talking to East Coast big tech organizations about how do they experiment and fail safely. People talk in my role about failing fast. We're working in a regulated environment. I've got to fail safely. So part of the challenge is finding ways of making sure we can zig and zag without it being a problem.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: We talked right at the beginning about personalization. And like I said, I think our industry obsesses about performance. I think we're in a -- as the world recognizes that capital isn't working, climate is becoming massively important. What we do with our money, I think, is going to be more important than ever. We've set ourselves an internal goal to make sure that we lead in this place.</p><p>Jessica Ground is the Head of our Stewardship. She's going to spend a few minutes now just talking about what that actually means because I think bringing it to life -- we're not talking about painting the walls green. There's a huge amount of painting the walls green which has gone on. This is, I believe, different. Thanks, Jess.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>JESSICA GROUND, GLOBAL HEAD OF STEWARDSHIP, SCHRODERS PLC: Thank you, Peter. As a former financials analyst myself, I have some sympathy for you sitting out there at this stage in the Investor Day. So I will really try to focus on making this an engaging and as punchy as possible but also stressing how important this is for -- increasingly for our clients.</p><p>I'm sure you're aware that you cannot open FTfm this week without there being some article on ESG investing. And we believe it's something of a perfect storm, primarily because we see environmental and social change accelerating and creating an incredibly challenging backdrop for companies to navigate and for our investments to navigate. If you look 10 years ago, the World Economic Forum was talking about the challenge of asset price declines and failed states. Roll on, it's now about cybersecurity and climate change, clearly ESG risks.</p><p>The second major issue is the global challenges that Peter just talked about, issues like climate change, which definitely require finances involvement to solve. In case you haven't noticed, governments seem to have run out of money, and we need to think about a low carbon economy. So there's going to be more pressure on channeling finance towards that direction.</p><p>Then there is the regulatory pressure. This has really risen in the wake of the global financial crisis. And it is indeed global if we look at things like stewardship codes. But there is more scrutiny on the entire investment chain about how we're holding companies to account not just on issues like remuneration but also on their own environmental and social performance. Asset managers have increasingly got to maintain their own social license to operate and prove that they are not just traders but really are good stewards of the companies that they're investing on their end clients' behalf.</p><p>And then finally, there is the end client interest. That old adage you don't what your father drank. You don't invest perhaps like your father invested or indeed your mother. And savers of all types are increasingly focused on sustainability-related issues, and it becomes more important and part of our overall proposition for clients.</p><p>But we are a -- clients come to us for Alpha, and I think the most important thing to start is why does ESG integration, why is it increasingly important for us as active fund managers and how we navigate these headwinds that I've just talked about. There is plenty of academic evidence that is quite backward looking that says what we all feel we know that companies that are well managing their ESG risks benefit from lower cost of capital, less operational volatility that gets recognized in credit ratings.</p><p>But what I think is a forward-looking approach, and that's what's really important for us as we think about how we navigate this for our clients, large companies are becoming increasingly important to economies. And they've grown their share of GDP, their share of employment over the past 20 or 30 years. And that trend doesn't show any signs of abating. And in line with that, I mentioned asset manager's license to operate. But unsurprisingly, as they adopt this privileged position in society, there's a lot more focus not just on what they're doing but how they're operating in business terms.</p><p>So if we look at a number of issues in terms of how regulatory costs are increasing quite significantly not only in the U.S., where we have the data there, but we're seeing that happening globally, in emerging markets as well. We've all seen the OECD clampdown on tax avoidance and tax rates, and the public's mistrust of major corporations is rising. So for us as investors, we need to understand, as I said, not just what a company is doing but increasingly how it's doing it. And that pulls on a lot of the new data analytical tools that Graham just talked about.</p><p>So unsurprisingly as well as being more important for generating Alpha, we have a huge amount of our own data about why this is more important for our clients. We do 2 major survey of clients every year, both institutional and retail. Let's start with the institutional one, 650 asset earners, everywhere from pension funds to insurers globally. And what you will see if you look at 2007 to 2018 is being the acceleration of those who feel that sustainable investing is going to become more important over the next 5 years. Now levels are very strong in Europe. We know that. It's quite well established here. What is so interesting is the growing interest that we're seeing in the U.S. and Asia. And we're very focused on being early movers into these markets and talking to our institutional clients.</p><p>The same data comes through in our retail survey, which looks at 30,000 investors at about 28 countries. So 64% of them say that they're interested in sustainable investing, including funds that are supporting things like good corporate governance and climate change. 64% have increased their allocation over the past 5 years. That's from a very low base. And 76% of them say it's much more important than it was 5 years ago.</p><p>But what's so fascinating is when we survey the advisers. And what we are seeing is that sustainable investment is much more important to end clients than it is to advisers. And that's a gap that we can really help to bridge. And the other thing that we see is that end clients say that sustainable investing is the number -- the second education topic that, that would like to receive training on. So there's a huge underlying demand for more sustainable investing, which so far, as far as we can see, the investment chain hasn't been very good at navigating and demonstrating.</p><p>And one of the things that we need to be able to demonstrate is how we really are giving our clients more than investment returns and also how our work can actually support the development of investment returns. Now we're in a stage now where everybody, if they didn't embrace the green revolution as an asset manager is now talking about how they drive a Tesla. And what's incredibly important to underline about how we approach here is our ongoing commitment to it.</p><p>So we first started this 20 years ago, and yes, we have grown the team recently. And Peter's been instrumental in backing that over the past 5 years in particular. But you cannot do this overnight, especially if you want to embed it and have it impact every aspect of your performance.</p><p>The second thing, which I think is very distinctive about what we do, is we have the investment leadership of it. So I've been for 21 years. As well as being a financials analyst, I was a global -- I was U.K. [PM]. And if you look at Andy Howard, our Head of Sustainable Research, he was a sell-side analyst. And that's incredibly important because there are a lot of people there who are passionate about the environment, but they don't always know how to translate that into financial impacts.</p><p>And if you look at the thought leadership that we put out there, we chose like carbon value at risk, the climate change dashboard. We've been really innovative at showing that. And then it's unsurprising that we're getting a number of accolades. So we've consistently been A+ by the UN PRI for our overall approach, and we're either A or A+ in each of the individual asset classes, which is incredibly important. There is not an institutional RFP that does not ask that these days.</p><p>I think something we're more proud of is the NGO ShareAction doing an assessment of 40 pan-European fund managers in 2017. This is the last date that they did for and saying that we were #1 for the robustness of our policies and processes. That type of external validation is incredibly important to us and incredibly increasingly important for clients. Whereas ESG a few years ago used to be a tiebreaker, it's now very much a dealmaker in the institutional space.</p><p>But one of the questions that we need to acknowledge about sustainable is it's very easy to say that we all want to be more sustainable and we all want our investments, but it's so incredibly complicated to navigate. And this really is one of the huge opportunities that we have for getting closer to our clients. There is a huge variety of regional definitions and differences. There's a huge growing body of both soft and hard regulation in here. Many of you would be aware of the EU financial package on sustainable finance, which is creating a whole load of more things that need to be navigated for a lot of our clients. But we're also seeing policymakers all around the world having more interest in this area.</p><p>And then finally, there are a number of different solutions to meet a number of different client needs. So while the overall objective is being sustainable, the regulation is increasing. The levels of education are relatively low, and the investment solutions are complex. So actually, we spend a huge amount of our time helping clients to navigate that. We spend a huge amount of time producing research on if you want to decarbonize your portfolio, what are the options and a huge amount of time trying to bridge the very different expectations. If you're a private client, you're perhaps interested in how do I actually have impact. If you an insurer, you're trying to understand what's the FCA going to do to regulate me on this.</p><p>So one of the things that we've done in our institutional survey again is we've actually dived down into the barriers to this and what -- to give us a better understanding of what clients need to do to help them to gain confidence in this area and then recalibrated our approach accordingly. So the major concern is still performance. And people have had bad experiences with different versions of sustainability.</p><p>Sustainability 1.0 was all about exclusions. Unsurprisingly, that can sometimes drive a bit of a volatile performance. Sustainability 2.0 has been more about perhaps some of the best in class or some of the indexes. I'll show you later why they haven't delivered. We're very confident that sustainability 3.0 of meaningful ESG integration, and we can start to see these in our own funds and teams that are doing it, can drive Alpha. But we've got to realize we've got to get our clients over that.</p><p>But equally and just as powerfully are the number of concerns about lack of transparency, reported data, the need for education difficulty in measuring and managing risks. So we can really take our clients on a journey to educate them about this and to help them to navigate it.</p><p>And one of the first things that we're doing is just helping them to understand that everything under this huge sustainable investment umbrella is not the same. Talking to Peter's thing of -- idea of mass customization. I think as we look into the future, we're going to see this more important, being successful of sustainable investing. Right now, we have a situation with the Nordics and the Belgians can't even agree on what's unethical, let alone what is ethical or sustainable.</p><p>And also what we see increasingly coming into the conversations is an explicit desire to have social benefits alongside financial benefits. So I want to take you across the spectrum and just talk briefly about what we're doing. First of all is ESG integration, meaningful voting and meaningful research. Incredibly important, as I said, on how we deliver Alpha going into the future, incredibly important for our institutional investment and has become very much non-negotiable for any fund manager who wants to work in our business. Peter is nodding on that one.</p><p>Where we're seeing really interesting demand is -- and actually, that is coming from institutional asset owners or it's also coming from intermediary -- is more sustainable investment. So more of a best-in-class approach, explicitly stepping away from more controversial stocks or sectors. And we've launched a number of new options there.</p><p>And we're still seeing demand for screened investments. We chose growing faster than our overall AUM, and those are becoming much more complex.</p><p>Impact is -- we take up a pure definition of impact. So we are really targeting, as this says, social benefit as well as a financial benefit. And I think it ties in quite nicely into things we're looking at, tying very nicely with private assets.</p><p>And then finally, philanthropy. Now one of the huge challenges that we have in this is that we're seeing a rise of different labels, and we are also seeing a huge amount of brainwashing. And so some of the things that people are being -- putting out about caring about the environment are not necessarily matched by other areas. So what we have done is introduce an internal accreditation system for individual funds and investment projects. So that is -- one of the most important things about this is that our fund managers that are integrating ESG have to be able to demonstrate that they're doing in a meaningful way that can pass rigorous tests by clients and consultants and provide the evidence of how that's influencing their portfolios' construction and their stock selection.</p><p>So ESG analysis and sustainability becomes a building block of the investment process. We have about 40% of our AUM that has already achieved this. And the target is to have 100% by the end of 2020. I would like to say this is what we believe is a step above what already is the UN PRI assessment at an individual asset class level. And so far, it encompasses quite a wide variety of assets. So as much real assets that we have, real estate that's already integrated, as we have EMD, as we have another of our equity.</p><p>Then the other area where we are investing more resources and launching new products are sustainable products, where we are explicitly targeting the same -- normally the same performance target as the reference fund but asking that their clients look at the longer-term approach. They look for outperformance over 5 years. And we've launched a number of interesting global solutions, both across multifactor and very concentrated equity. We're building out our original equity and increasingly our fixed income and our solutions in other asset classes. And as I said, hopefully over time, we will be launching, looking more at the impacts based on what we can do with our existing capabilities there.</p><p>As I've mentioned, our realization as well as ESG integration, we need to show that we're delivering more than investment returns to clients, and holding companies to account is a really important way of doing that. So over -- we've been increasingly engaging more on ESG topics. And increasingly, we're seeing more regulatory interest in this not just in the U.K. but globally. So we did over 2,200 in 2018. About half of these are fact-finding and half of these are pushing for change. These are the number of issues that we've engaged on. Climate change, we believe, up to 15% of global earnings could be at risk. Issues like data security as well as your typical corporate governance issues.</p><p>What's really important is these engagements give us additional investment insight, but they're also encouraging that more sustainable financial change. We've been tracking our engagements since 2000. We have a very high success rate. We're talking about a success rate of 60% to 70%. But you have to be patient. It takes 2 years to affect the change.</p><p>And we're also backing it up with very rigorous voting. So at 48% of AGMs where we voted last year, we voted against management on at least one resolution. And we have one of the best records on voting for things like climate change resolutions, as recognized by the NGO, as we show. So we really are engaging, holding companies to account and then able to show our clients the impacts that, that is having on their portfolios.</p><p>So lots of people are talking about their engagements or writing lovely letters about how they're holding management to much more account. But one of the other questions that we have is can ESG be done passively. We've witnessed this huge growth of more sustainable funds, particularly in the ETF space. And one of the things we passionately believe, that ESG is so complex it cannot be distilled down to a single number. And actually, if you look at the evidence of when that's happened, it has not delivered Alpha going back to that huge concerns about performance that we see.</p><p>So on the right, we've got the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the FTSE4Good, and you can see their underperformance against the mainstream reference indexes in both of those cases. The left is some analysis that we have done on ourselves on third-party ESG ratings, and we particularly looked through the lens of corporate controversies. And what we found on average if I -- these corporate controversies will be very familiar to you, that on average, the third-party rating agency had given them higher-than-average ESG ratings. And then quickly, they have a controversy. They get downgraded. They're a bad stock and it takes them many years. One of the great examples that I love as an ex-banks analyst is all the banks were AAA going into the financial crisis.</p><p>There is also another -- a number of issues with these third-party ratings we've written on quite extensively. They overweight developed market stocks. If you're a larger company, you get a better score. And again, quite a lot of evidence they don't [release an] Alpha. But of course, we need to make sure that we're integrating ESG in a meaningful way and that we're not -- because we don't believe in third-party ratings, we're not stepping away from that.</p><p>So I'm going to give you insight into one of the tools and how we're helping our analysts to do this really rigorously. So I think it's first helpful to think about the traditional model of ESG analysis, which basically focus on governance and management quality. And I was as guilty of this as most. I'd throw in a question at the end of a meeting. And if the CEO didn't seem to completely panic at the question, I would assume that all ESG issues were under control.</p><p>What we are moving to is a much more evidence-based and much more data-driven approach. And what that look -- it looks through the lens of different stakeholders. And it's underpinned by my original premises that companies have got to maintain their license to operate and the cost of maintaining that license to operate is growing. How have we done this? So the first thing is we spent 2 years doing it. It's taking quite a lot of time, and it's very much been helped by the digital things that Graham was talking to.</p><p>The second thing is we've gone back to academic evidence and to have a rigor. So we're looking at 735 different global ESG trends for 47 different subsectors. And what's so different about what we do compared to the third-party ESG ratings is that we've used our financial analysts to decide, looking at this body of evidence, what do they believe is really the most important issues. This really contrasts with what we know some competitors have done, which is just use a standard framework like SASB. We want to engage our analysts and we want to have this feeding in.</p><p>The second point is it's incredibly data-driven. So we're looking at 150 different data metrics from 50 data sources to evaluate how well companies are managing their stakeholders. About half of this is conventional data. So from Thomson Reuters or sort of the MSCI. But over half is from unconventional. So this is helped hugely by working with the DIU, looking at brand data, looking at product recall data, looking at the Glassdoor. We can analyze over 10,000 companies. That's 1,000 more than the leading third-party ESG rating agency. And it sits on the desktop of every analyst.</p><p>And I thought I'd give you an insight into how the analysts are able to use this to come to data-driven, informed ESG views that they agree with. So we had quite a lot of fun picking a company that wasn't necessarily going to be controversial, and I think this goes back to one of the core adages, is that there is no such thing as a perfectly sustainable company. And what we can do is understand relative areas of weaknesses and strengths and build up an evidence-based conclusion.</p><p>So this is a consumer good company. And one of the very powerful things about our tools, as I mentioned, the third-party ratings just look -- they look globally, is that investors can change this to reflect their universe. So this is against European universe. But equally, the company might look different against a global one.</p><p>And then you can see a picture. You can see relative areas of strengths. So management quality is one. Actually, this particular company is very good on the environment. But then what's so interesting is that you see they're quite weak on employment, and you can see the reason behind that. They don't train very much compared to a lot of their peers, and their Glassdoor ratings are much lower than their peers. And in terms of governance, they don't have very high levels of independence on their Audit and Nomination Committee.</p><p>So what this enables our analysts to do is, one, come to an evidence-based conclusion; and two, to then engage and to improve things on relative areas of weakness. What we can also do with this example is we are building funds where we can see our top quartile, our best performers on this tool called Context either by make up the investment universe. And then as a fundamental person, I'm normally pretty skeptical of that test, but it looks like our analysts are on the right track. So if we look at our top quartile Context scored stocks, they appear to be maintaining their returns on invested capital for longer. So going back to our clients still want us to deliver investment returns. They want us to identify the most sustainable companies, and they want us to engage to improve performance where things are weak.</p><p>So I think I have managed to keep back on time, but just to summarize, this is an incredibly multifaceted area of investment. But hopefully, you can see is now we can work and deliver our whole firm to our clients to help them navigate this. Most importantly, it helps us to deliver investment performance. So it's giving unique investment insights which don't come from traditional analysis.</p><p>I was like, say, 20 years ago, when I started as an analyst, it was -- you look pretty good if you can work Excel because we still had some people in the department that couldn't. Now it's much more about how you analyze huge amounts of data and understand the changing world. That's what our ESG team really focuses on, and that's what the investment leadership makes them uniquely positioned to do. That in turn feeds through into really rigorous ESG integration and products that are able to deliver Alpha.</p><p>We are committed to being good stewards. So that means holding companies to account, pushing for change, pushing for engagements. In a couple of weeks, we will invite -- we have invited all of our U.K. holdings where we're going to talk to them about the issues of climate change and also run them through some of our thoughts on corporate governance. So we can have a really proactive dialogue with that and providing transparency to our clients and showing them the impacts of that stewardship activity and then finally, eliminating risks that can't be done by investments alone.</p><p>And then finally, we're really determined to find solutions realizing that there's a huge scope and there's a huge range of different needs. It is going to be about mass customization. There are very different challenges if we're looking at the Nordics compared to Shariah compliance, impacts compared to that example of just working with an insurance company to help them manage risk. But we are rarely committed to taking our clients on that journey and providing some clarity on what we know is an incredibly complex but popular area. Thank you.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: Jess, thank you. You've done well to go through all that in that time. I was rather enjoying the picture of a green and rather concrete jungle. But anyway, before we do general questions, is there any questions for Jess that anyone would like to raise? I'll take that as -- thank you, Gurjit. We've got a microphone there.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>GURJIT SINGH KAMBO: Just in terms of assessing performance versus benchmarks, how has the benchmark industry evolved? Because I think clearly it's quite difficult to compare funds versus others.</p><p>JESSICA GROUND: Yes. So that's a great question. And as you know, the benchmark industry mostly evolved to charge us more for custom benchmarks. So as I briefly sort of touched on with our -- the new products that we're launching, we are using the mainstream benchmark because actually we think a lot of times that's what our clients still want. But generally because these are more of a best-in-class or a narrow approach, we're saying there will be some intermediate volatility so let's look at that over 5 years, over 3 years. Now -- and the performance for that so far seems to be building quite well. And I think that's really important because if it's sort of its performance without all the bad stuff, people are -- those performance concerns are still going to exist.</p><p>ARNAUD MAURICE ANDRE GIBLAT: It's Arnaud Giblat from Exane. You're saying that 40% of your AUM was currently accredited under your current criteria. What do you think the industry AUM would look like under appropriate level of accreditation?</p><p>JESSICA GROUND: That's a great question. And you hear horror stories of firms that have made huge commitments to ESG and the asset -- and individual asset managers not coming in. Or you hear people just saying -- some of the corn houses are just saying, well, we're integrating this because we have essential ESG score. I think it's very hard. We haven't heard of other people doing this in that it's rigorous. It's annually renewable. It's in people's objectives and appraisals and monitored by senior members of the firm.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: It's also an objective measure. So there are RFPs. Those are proper auditor process that says you have integrated this into your investment process. And we think that actually if you think about where this goes over time and being held accountable for what it is we're doing, I think that clarity and that real detail would be really important not just from a return perspective but also from risk perspective because you can't make these claims unless you can genuinely validate that you're doing these things.</p><p>So we're going to be at 100% at the end of next year. 40% of our investment team is there today. And without exception, our teams are on -- the other [6 day] are on that journey to accreditation. But it's not an easy journey. I mean those who have done it, there's lots of sweats and tears along the way.</p><p>Great. Thanks, Jess. Before I let you go, are there any questions that we haven't addressed about the broader business? I'm conscious that we've focused on the consumer and wealth today. Richard and I are happy to take any other questions of how this fits together in the broader picture.</p><p>HUBERT LAM: It's Hubert Lam from Bank of America. I guess one name we haven't mentioned today was Nutmeg and how that fits into your digital and your wealth management. Or is it just a financial stake in -- I guess I'll leave it at that.</p><p>PETER HARRISON: Nutmeg is a financial stake. It's -- it was a very helpful learning for us to understand the nature of robo, the cost of customer acquisition. You've seen that Goldman Sachs took a meaningful stake alongside it. We've done a number of other initiatives, but Nutmeg is now held as a financial investment for us.</p><p>Great. Well, thank you all for giving us the morning. I appreciate the time. So we've done wealth. We've done the core business. Next time we'll probably bring it together with private assets. But thank you all for giving your time.

The tie-up would create a $5 trillion giant, advancing Schwab's leading position as custodian for assets managed by financial advisers. That could raise antitrust concerns even as competition among brokerages is driving down fees for investors. </p><p>\"We think this deal may face somewhat significant antitrust hurdles,\" Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Kyle Voigt said in a note Thursday. Schwab is the number one player in the market for safeguarding assets managed by registered investment advisers, followed by Fidelity Investments, Voigt said. Schwab may hold about half of the market, while TD Ameritrade may have around 15% to 20%, he said. TD Ameritrade surged as much as 26% Thursday \u2014 the most in 20 years \u2014 while Schwab rallied 14%. Schwab Nears Deal to Buy TD Ameritrade in Industry Overhaul Still, the market is fairly fragmented with smaller competitors and falling management fees have been a boon to investors, a trend that looks unlikely to change, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst David Ritter. \"It's hard to imagine that that train is going to be slowed by one merger like this,\" he said. One of the last major deals in the industry \u2014 TD Ameritrade's acquisition of Scottrade in 2017 \u2014 won approval from U.S. antitrust officials without conditions. Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada's second-largest lender by assets, owns a 43% stake in TD Ameritrade. Although fees are going down for consumers, antitrust officials will focus on whether the deal will mean less competition for the interest paid to investors on their accounts and whether fees on other services could rise, said Robert Litan, a partner at Korein Tillery and a former official with the Justice Department's antitrust division. The tie-up will likely be reviewed by the Justice Department, he said, instead of the Federal Trade Commission, which also reviews mergers. \"The intense competition in the industry has forced them to go to zero commissions, but that doesn't mean that the market still isn't susceptible to having consumers hurt as a result of further consolidation,\" he said. Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note that the takeover will get significant scrutiny from regulators that could stretch into the third quarter of 2020, though he said he expects it will be donebefore the next presidential inauguration. \"The concern is that this becomes political,\" Seiberg said. \"Democratic candidates including Senator Elizabeth Warren have been railing against big tech and big banks. It is easy to see how this could get drawn into this anti-big business campaign.\" UBS, Brennan Hawken The very large and surprising deal \"carries a lot of execution risk,\" particularly regarding legal and regulatory issues, Hawken warned in a note. Hurdles include the \"size the combined entity would represent in the discount brokerage space,\" even if regulators were to take into account full-service wealth management firms like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp., he said. Schwab cutting commissions and then bidding for its \"most hindered\" competitor might also draw legal challenges and further anti-competitive scrutiny, Hawken said. Hawken added that E*Trade was \"left out in the cold,\" and appears vulnerable as it had begun to reflect an M&amp;A premium and the Schwab-Ameritrade tie-up would reduce the number of potential buyers. BofA, Michael Carrier TD Ameritrade's relationship with holder Toronto-Dominion Bank \"creates some complications,\" Carrier wrote, including \"dis-synergies and a bit tougher regulatory approvals.\" Carrier expects merger discussions and activity in the sector in the near term, which is likely to benefit online broker stocks. He sees the Schwab-Ameritrade deal making \"strategic sense\" as the two have similar business models, particularly regarding retail and registered investment adviser, or RIA, platforms, and TD Ameritrade lacks a permanent CEO. Most firms in the sector, including E*Trade, will likely conduct merger talks given the \"pressures on the business, this transaction, game theory, as well as the attractive synergies and accretion,\" he said. Shares of companies that get left out may face pressure.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001123462</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJT-NHX1-JBRC-V0C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000283S</classCode><className>CHARLES SCHWAB CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009ANY</classCode><className>TD AMERITRADE HOLDING CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001YMV</classCode><className>TD BANK FINANCIAL GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00028E1</classCode><className>FMR CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00081VT</classCode><className>KEEFE BRUYETTE &amp;

Now it's seizing on the turmoil it unleashed to acquire one of its biggest rivals, TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just weeks after Schwab stunned competitors by letting customers trade stocks for free, the company is moving to tighten its grip on the industry with talks to acquire TD Ameritrade, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deal would give Schwab, the nation's original discount broker, even more sway over the industry it pioneered nearly half a century ago -- and an edge in the intensifying battle for ordinary investors' dollars, and the investment advisor business. The tie-up would result in a $5-trillion titan that could attract antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>\"An acquisition of TD Ameritrade would expand Schwab's roster of active traders and solidify its leading position serving independent advisors,\" said David Ritter, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p>A sale could be announced as early as this week, the person said, asking not to be identified because the discussions were private. The companies didn't immediately respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment.</p><p>TD Ameritrade stock leaped 16.9% on Thursday, the most since 2008. Schwab shares climbed 7.3%.</p><p>Shares of E-Trade Financial Corp., which analysts have speculated TD Ameritrade might want to buy, sank 9.3%. A deal between its two rivals could leave smaller brokerage E-Trade contending with a more formidable competitor than ever.</p><p>Schwab's move to zero commissions forced other brokerages to follow suit and triggered a slump in those firms' stocks, with TD Ameritrade among the hardest hit. It swept away a revenue stream and rekindled speculation that online brokerages might have to cut deals to survive the increased industry pressure.</p><p>TD Ameritrade has relied more on commissions than some competitors, drawing 36% of its net revenue from commissions in 2018, compared with 7% at Schwab.</p><p>For founder Charles Schwab, ending commissions has been a longtime goal.</p><p>\"I hated commissions,\" he said at the Impact 2019 conference in San Diego this month. \"I hated them then. I hate them now. I took them away.\"</p><p>He had also hinted he was open to deal-making.</p><p>\"I don't know whether we'll be successful in that pursuit, but in the industry you're going to see more consolidation, more firms getting together,\" he said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio in October. \"You just have to have that scale and volume. So we're prepared to do it if the opportunity arises. If not, we're perfectly happy to go it alone.\"</p><p>A deal between Schwab and TD Ameritrade could face antitrust scrutiny, Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods analyst Kyle Voigt wrote in a client note Thursday.</p><p>Schwab is the No. 1 player in the market for safeguarding assets managed by registered investment advisors, followed by Fidelity Investments, Voigt said. Schwab may hold about half the market, while TD Ameritrade may have 15% to 20%, he said.</p><p>Although fees are going down for consumers, antitrust officials will focus on whether the deal will mean less competition for the interest paid to investors on their accounts and whether fees on other services could rise, said Robert Litan, a partner at Korein Tillery and a former official with the Justice Department's antitrust division. He said the tie-up is likely to be reviewed by the Justice Department instead of the Federal Trade Commission, which also reviews mergers.</p><p>\"The intense competition in the industry has forced them to go to zero commissions, but that doesn't mean that the market still isn't susceptible to having consumers hurt as a result of further consolidation,\" he said.</p><p>Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note that scrutiny from regulators could stretch into the third quarter of 2020, though he said he expects it will be completed before the next presidential inauguration.</p><p>\"The concern is that this becomes political,\" Seiberg said. \"Democratic candidates including Sen. Elizabeth Warren have been railing against Big Tech and big banks. It is easy to see how this could get drawn into this anti-big business campaign.\"</p><p>An acquisition would come at a time of transition for TD Ameritrade. The Omaha, Neb., brokerage said in a surprise announcement in July that Chief Executive Tim Hockey would leave no later than the end of February 2020, rekindling questions of whether it would pursue a deal. Hockey denied that his departure had anything to do with a potential deal at the time. Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada's second-largest lender by assets, owns a 43% stake in TD Ameritrade.</p><p>Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA Research, said that a tie-up of the two firms could help address the burn of zero commissions with increased scale.</p><p>\"It would reduce the likelihood that investors bounce around,\" he said. \"They'd have a go-to destination.\"</p><p>Rosenbluth said the same principle would apply for independent advisors, who increasingly choose between the two firms for clearing and trading services.</p><p>\"There's scale benefits for them to provide,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: A DEAL for TD Ameritrade would give Schwab, the nation's original discount broker, even more sway over the industry it pioneered nearly 50 years ago.

The letter adds that while a few \"research hotspots\" still exist in Europe, \"virtually all of the top people in those places are continuously being pursued for recruitment by US companies.\"</p><p>The extent of the hiring frenzy and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-cern-scientists-discover\">damaging impact it is having on British universities</url> was revealed in a Guardian investigation last year. It found that PhD students had left their studies for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-cern-scientists-discover\">six-figure salaries</url> at US tech firms. Meanwhile, some universities had been hit so hard that they had       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-cern-scientists-discover\">lost an entire generation</url> of talented young researchers.</p><p>The letter, signed by scientists in the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, Israel and the Netherlands, calls for work on the new institute to start this year. Under the proposal, participating countries would fund the institute as an intergovernmental organisation. The same approach is used to fund the European Molecular Biology Lab, which has a major centre in Cambridge.</p><p>\"Something needs to be done and it needs to be done now,\" said Zoubin Ghahramani, professor of information engineering at Cambridge University and chief scientist at Uber. \"It would provide Europe with centres of mass where we would have not 10 researchers but hundreds with expertise from different countries.\"</p><p>Ghahramani, one of the most influential AI researchers in Britain, joined Uber after the San Francisco-based firm bought Geometric Intelligence, an AI startup he co-founded with a New York University psychologist some years ago. Despite the move, which exemplifies the problems Europe now faces, he has driven the UK's involvement in the proposal for the new lab.</p><p>\"This is of such importance to Europe it would be a terrible mistake not to do something major,\" he said. \"If we don't act in this area, both European universities and European industry will start to drift downwards.\"</p><p>The institute's stated mission is to ensure that the best AI research is performed in Europe, a goal that would drive jobs and economies and also give the region's scientists a voice in shaping how AI changes the world, the scientists believe. Those who work at the institute would have the freedom to work with industry and launch startup companies based on the breakthroughs they make. </p><p> Related:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-cern-scientists-discover\">Questioning AI: what kind of intelligence will we create? - Science Weekly podcast</url></p><p>Private and public investment in AI have soared on the back of breakthroughs in the field over the past few decades, but the US and China have firmly taken the lead. The technology has such potential that its impact on society is widely expected to be as profound as the industrial revolution. </p><p>The first steps in building the institute are expected to begin with a collaboration between France and Germany with other nations joining later. Ultimately, each local lab would become a $100m facility with an annual budget of $30m. </p><p>The potential for AI to have a dramatic impact on lives, by taking decisions in areas from healthcare and policing to defence and transport, has led to serious questions over who writes the rules on how AI is used. </p><p>If Europe steps back and watches AI research from the sidelines, it will have little say in shaping its future, Ghahramani said. \"The regulatory environment for technology is often led by the people who control the technology,\" he said.</p><p>Another major supporter of the institute, Bernard Sch\u00f6lkopf, director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in T\u00fcbingen, Germany, said: \"Europe has a unique academic research tradition, so we have managed to keep up for a number of years. But the US and China have recognised the strategic importance of this field and no single European country is a match for this.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-43372111</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5H-X991-F021-63VW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><timeReceived>5:39 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

That's peanuts compared to current climate mitigation and adaptation estimates.<br/> Solutions to global warming that do not require large cuts in emissions are likely to become increasingly popular as reports of soaring carbon dioxide levels[2], melting Arctic ice and high warming projections[3] continue to make the news.<br/> SRM is one of a flock of schemes that comes under the geoengineering umbrella. Others include cloud whitening, carbon capture and storage and ocean fertilization.<br/> As interest in these grow, international efforts to agree on a global climate treaty grind on - with any deal unlikely to come into effect before 2020. By then some analysts say 1.5-2\u00b0C of warming may already be 'locked into the system'.<br/> The rate of melt in the Arctic could be slowed by spraying aerosol particles into the stratosphere - reducing the sun's power (Pic: NASA Goddard)<br/> In January the World Economic Forum listed the hijacking of the global climate[4] by 'rogue geoengineering' as one of the major risks in 2013.<br/>Microsoft founder Gates, who has funded research into geoengineering, is unlikely to pay for a small airforce to change the world's weather. Nor has he indicated he has any intention of doing so.<br/> But it is instructive to learn that the planet's climate could be so dramatically altered by one very rich person or a few determined countries, and scientists who are studying these techniques warn they come with profound risks.<br/> 'We have never tried any large scale weather or climate manipulation, so I don't know we know how well it works,' Matt Watson[5], who runs the Spice project[6] at Bristol University, told RTCC.<br/> 'My position is that I am terrified about the loss of Arctic sea ice, it's a profound and hugely visual signal of our failure to act as stewards of the planet, but at the same time I don't want to be pumping 5-10 million tonnes of sulphuric acid into the stratosphere, because I have no idea what it would do.'<br/> Volcanic evidence<br/> The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines illustrates the link between temperature and particles in the stratosphere.<br/> That event caused the world to experience a 0.5\u00b0C temperature drop for two years (it later returned to previous levels), although Watson says it's only now, 20 years on, that the true effects are being understood.<br/> At the same time, we are getting a better idea of what some radical schemes could achieve.<br/> A paper by Jim Haywood[7] from Exeter University published in the journal Nature Climate Change[8] indicated attempts to release sulphate particles about the Equator over a 50 -year period could also dramatically affect rainfall patterns in Africa.<br/> 'If you inject just into one hemisphere that's where you start to have hemispherical imbalance in the energy budget, and that's what the paper was looking at,' he told RTCC.<br/> 'As soon as you get that, you start to move the ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone[9]) which carries an awful lot of the precipitation.<br/> 'So if you cooled down the northern hemisphere what you will do is move the ITCZ to the south - you'll move monsoon circulation south. Alternatively if you did it in the southern hemisphere you could move it north.'<br/> Connected ecosystems<br/> Haywood's research, based on the Met Office's HADGEM2 modelling software[10] illustrates how complex the earth's systems are.<br/> Particles injected into the northern hemisphere would cause drought in Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal and Chad. Move that into the south and while the Sahel would flourish, north-eastern Brazil would suffer.<br/> Haywood warns that another side-effect of greening the Sahel would be to increase Atlantic hurricane frequency by about 20% - that's 20% more Hurricane Katrina's hitting the US East Coast.<br/> 'With geoengineering there is no magic bullet. You will improve conditions in one part of the planet, but they will deteriorate in others,' he said. 'There are winners and losers. Then you get into the whole moral and ethical deliberation - who chooses?'<br/> Moral considerations<br/> It is currently unclear who would have a final say on a global geoengineering effort: 'no body exists that will take ownership of the problem, and there are no rules and regulations,' said Watson.<br/> A Royal Society report[11] in 2009 stressed that geoengineering was no alternative to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, but recommended research continue in the event of a climate emergency.<br/> The Oxford Principles[12] are often cited as guidelines for deployment - these focus on transparency, independent governance and public participation in decision-making. And the hostile use of 'environmental modification techniques' is banned under the ENMOD Convention[13] agreed at the UN General Assembly in 1976.<br/> Last October the UN Convention on Biological Diversity[14] (CBD) agreed that small-scale experiments in a 'controlled setting' could take place[15], but urged caution, insisting that they should not detract from climate mitigation efforts.<br/> A UK Government statement released in February[16] admitted current regulations were 'inadequate', committing to work with the CBD to review regulatory instruments. It did support further 'responsible' research, stressing that decision 'does not imply an intention to deploy geo-engineering'.<br/> Catch-22<br/> The trouble for scientists is that unless they can conduct larger experiments in the real world, it will be hard to work out the potential and the consequences of various techniques.<br/> The unauthorised dumping of 100 tonnes of iron sulphate[17] into the Pacific by an American businessman in 2012 is a worst-case example, but there is an evident need for theories to be put to the test.<br/> Limited SRM experiments have taken place, along with the 'real life' evidence volcanic eruptions provide. But given a full deployment would likely affect the entire planet, there is currently a glaring gap in our knowledge.<br/> 'It's difficult to imagine any scheme that affects the atmosphere that wouldn't have an effect on the entire atmosphere, but there are scales,' says Watson.<br/> 'So on one extreme we have sulphuric acid and aerosols, and if you inject that near the equator you're going to cover pretty much every part of the stratosphere in the atmosphere at some point.<br/> 'Conventional wisdom goes that the stuff that draws down, called Carbon Reduction Methods (CDR) tend to be expensive, slow and you have a massive problem with storage, but relatively safe.<br/> 'SRM tends to be large scale. A sledgehammer to crack a nut, but really cheap. And it depends whether you think cheap is good - I happen to think it isn't.'<br/> Piers Forster[18], Professor of Physical Climate Change at Leeds University, believes deployment timescales for technologies are 'optimistic', and says larger trials are inevitable if governments are serious about exploring their potential.<br/> 'I think what is really difficult to do is to try and evaluate the impacts, and that is definitely the impact on the global mean temperature, and other things like precipitation,' he said. 'I just think that to try and get a significant response you have to do a big experiment. You can't get away without one.<br/> 'This is where we become quite dependent on our computer simulations, and you have to have a lot of confidence in these simulations if you are going to use them to begin geoengineering, is what I would say. You perhaps have to have more confidence in them than you do for mitigation experiments.'<br/> Climate panacea<br/> Various techniques are expected to be explored in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report[19], due out later this year.<br/> It is expected to offer a view on the effectiveness, feasibility and scalability of geoengineering, but is unlikely to back any particular method as a silver bullet in the battle to address climate change.<br/> At best, many view the various technologies as a 'sticking plaster', given they do not address the underlying causes of global warming.<br/> 'If you are to consider any geoengineering it has got to be part of a larger strategy,' says Haywood.<br/> 'You would be crazy to say 'we'll just geoengineer', you'd be crazy to say 'let's just adapt'. You need mitigation, and potentially geoengineering - and different types. Solar radiation management or CO2 capture. I don't think there's a simple answer.'<br/> Forster agrees, suggesting it could be decades before man's ability to alter the world's thermostat either by sucking out carbon or by blocking out the sun becomes a reality.<br/> 'Perhaps it could still be done by an individual country - but I do think that people are very optimistic of how much of a technological development you have to take,' he says.<br/> 'I also think it's quite difficult to get stuff up to the altitude to really have a big effect, I do still think with that technology there's a lot of stuff to do.<br/> 'There is one experiment we're currently undertaking - we're trying to look at rescuing Arctic Ice by stimulating aeroplanes flying from Spitzbergen in Norway - and dump out a lot of Sulphur Dioxide, and we're trying to look at that as a very short term protection against the loss of Arctic Ice.<br/> 'Perhaps you could do something relatively short term like that but I do still think that to introduce a big transformation it will take a big tech development.'<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/rtcc_edking\">https://twitter.com/rtcc_edking</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.rtcc.org/mckibben-400ppm-is-a-grim-climate-landmark\">http://www.rtcc.org/mckibben-400ppm-is-a-grim-climate-landmark</url>/ [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.rtcc.org/global-warming-set-to-approach-4c-by-2100\">http://www.rtcc.org/global-warming-set-to-approach-4c-by-2100</url>/ [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-risks-2013\">http://reports.weforum.org/global-risks-2013</url>/ [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bris.ac.uk/earthsciences/people/matthew-m-watson/index.html\">http://www.bris.ac.uk/earthsciences/people/matthew-m-watson/index.html</url> [6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2011/7895.html\">http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2011/7895.html</url> [7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/jmh232\">http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/jmh232</url> [8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate1857.html\">http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate1857.html</url> [9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone</url> [10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/unified-model/climate-models\">http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/unified-model/climate-models</url> [11]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://royalsociety.org/policy/publications/2009/geoengineering-climate/\">http://royalsociety.org/policy/publications/2009/geoengineering-climate/</url> [12]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/oxford-principles/principles/\">http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/oxford-principles/principles/</url>?

Separately, a group of states on Friday disclosed an investigation into Facebook's market dominance. South Carolina is not among them.</p><p>The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators.</p><p>South Carolina's involvement in the review of Google's business practices means its legal experts will be advising in the investigation of a company that employs about 400 workers at a Lowcountry data center, which has received financial incentives from the state and local governments.</p><p>Last year, Google announced it was investing another $600 million to expand the site near Moncks Corner, bringing its total spending at the Berkeley County campus to about $2.4 billion.</p><p>\"No company, no matter how big and how powerful, is above the law, S.C. Attorney General Alan Wilson said in a statement Monday. \"Every citizen has the right to the protection of his or her privacy even from internet giants. We will get to the bottom of and answer these very serious questions regarding Google's practices.\"</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's fairly impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.</p><p>Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its ad dominance.</p><p>Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business.</p><p>One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. On Monday it referred media outlets to a Friday blob post by Kent Walker, senior vice president of global affairs.</p><p>\"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" Walker wrote. \"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have.\"</p><p>But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets.</p><p>\"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"</p><p>Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a news conference in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\"</p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation. The District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are.</p><p>Experts believe the probe could focus on at least one of three areas that have caught regulators' eyes.</p><p>A good first place to look might be online advertising. Google will control 31.1 percent of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. And many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes - because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p>\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" King said.</p><p>Another visibly huge piece of Google's business is its search platform, often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.</p><p>Google's smartphone operating system, Android, is the most widely used in the world.</p><p>European regulators have fined Google $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5d76c0e661ee9image\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5d76c0e8e7355image\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.

No. 679/2019) are at odds with each other. \"One [in SC] says that right to privacy doesn't allow anybody to [use Aadhaar information]\" while the petitions in the Madras High Court claim that \"privacy is not paramount and information can be shared with intermediaries\".</p><p>Justice Gupta at this point asked about the petition filed in Orissa High Court and Venugopal said that that Orissa wasn't here. Sources later confirmed to MediaNama that Justice Gupta was mistaken, and meant to refer to the PIL in Bombay High Court.</p><p>Rohatgi argued that the \"original prayer in the Madras High Court was based on Aadhaar linkage to social media accounts, but the police commissioner of Tamil Nadu asked the court to direct Facebook because of which the High Court expanded the scope of the PILs [to include issues including curbing cybercrime and intermediary liability within the ambit of the legal proceedings]\". As the division bench discussed, he continued, \"the original prayer was expanded because of the Tamil Nadu police commissioner.\" Sibal called this power of the Madras HC \"the gift of Article 226\" of the constitution of India which</p><p>Article 226 in The Constitution Of India 1949</p><p>Power of High Courts to issue certain writs</p><p>(1) Notwithstanding anything in Article 32 every High Court shall have powers, throughout the territories in relation to which it exercise jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases, any Government, within those territories directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibitions, quo warranto and certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose</p><p>(2) The power conferred by clause (1) to issue directions, orders or writs to any Government, authority or person may also be exercised by any High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to the territories within which the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises for the exercise of such power, notwithstanding that the seat of such Government or authority or the residence of such person is not within those territories</p><p>(3) Where any party against whom an interim order, whether by way of injunction or stay or in any other manner, is made on, or in any proceedings relating to, a petition under clause (1), without</p><p>(a) furnishing to such party copies of such petition and all documents in support of the plea for such interim order; and</p><p>(b) giving such party an opportunity of being heard, makes an application to the High Court for the vacation of such order and furnishes a copy of such application to the party in whose favour such order has been made or the counsel of such party, the High Court shall dispose of the application within a period of two weeks from the date on which it is received or from the date on which the copy of such application is so furnished, whichever is later, or where the High Court is closed on the last day of that period, before the expiry of the next day afterwards on which the High Court is open; and if the application is not so disposed of, the interim order shall, on the expiry of that period, or, as the case may be, the expiry of the aid next day, stand vacated</p><p>(4) The power conferred on a High Court by this article shall not be in derogation of the power conferred on the Supreme court by clause (2) of Article 32</p><p>In light of the \"magnitude of problems, magnitude of issues, and the central government's stance\", Rohatgi argued that the four petitions should be transferred to the apex court.</p><p>Rohatgi cited MeitY's submission that said that \"the Ministry will address these concerns\". \"If this is going on, is it appropriate for one high court, at the behest of a police commissioner, to [circumvent] the policymaking process?\" he asked the court.</p><p>Rohatgi said, \"In matters of this nature, the last court should decide. Should the IIT professor [referring to Kamakoti] decide? We don't agree with him\" He said that this was a \"larger issue flowing from the Puttuswamy judgement which was decided by 9 judges\". He also said that this issue of traceability was not unique to India. \"This is a not a homegrown, but a worldwide phenomenon. Does it happen only in Madras? Therefore, the highest court in the land should decide. [Having had] 17 hearings is not an argument.\"</p><p>Dr Kamakoti submission looms large, Facebook and WhatsApp contest his suggestions on tracing the originator</p><p>Rohatgi once again referred to IIT Madras professor Dr Kamakoti's submission to the Madras High Court that tracing the originator on WhatsApp is technically possible, and how it undermined the international operations of Facebook and WhatsApp. \"At tomorrow's hearing [at the Madras HC], will we hear an IIT professor who will come and say 'I will tell Facebook how to share information'?\"</p><p>He once again emphasised the international nature of the organisation. \"We are an international organisation and therefore have millions of laws to follow [across the world].\" He referred to the demands of the central government in the intermediary liability rules about permanent office in India, etc. \"The central government is examining the statutory position which the police commissioner had asked for [such as a permanent office in India]. We have said what we wanted to say [on that issue].\"</p><p>\"Will Mr Sibal tomorrow cross-examine the IIT professor?\" he asked the court. Rohatgi explained to the court that according to Kamakoti's suggestions, if Sibal sent him a message, and he forwarded it to someone else, Sibal's name would appear in the forwarded message, which he may not wish for. To this, Justice Gupta said, \"That may be going too far. Only thing is that the intermediary should have the means to identify [the originator], but not in public domain.\"</p><p>\"If need be in a given situation, [the intermediaries] should be in a position to say that this is the person who sent this,\" Justice Gupta opined. To this Rohatgi said, \"In this [regime] vacuum today, there is a set of rules. There is provision for complaints to be made to WhatsApp and Facebook.\" Justice Gupta said that this wasexamined (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/supreme-court-has-sought-details-of-complaints-to-google-facebook-whatsapp-over-uploading-of-objectionable-content-4009383.html\">https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/supreme-court-has-sought-details-of-complaints-to-google-facebook-whatsapp-over-uploading-of-objectionable-content-4009383.html</url>) by another SC judge, Justice Madan B. Lokur.</p><p>Sibal problematised the issue of an originator. \"I am on WhatsApp and take an image from YouTube. Who is the originator here? People today can replicate my number using apps. Will I still be treated as the originator? All kinds of serious issues have to be decided.\"</p><p>Rohatgi said, \"We are international organisation that wants to work here. How do we do that when faced with one IIT chap? Is this the scope of Article 226 that Mr Sibal should call a WhatsApp engineer to the court and the IIT professor will tell him how to run the platform? Should one High Court decide when four high courts and the Supreme Court are hearing on this matter?\"</p><p>Sibal said that the \"issue was with WhastApp, not Facebook because of end-to-end encryption. The key is not with WhatsApp, but only with the sender and the receipient.\" \"The government of India in Madras High Court said that they need time to get the rules in place, but in Madras High Court, the IIT professor says that traceability is possible. What is the point of this piecemeal hearings?\" Sibal asked the court.</p><p>Justice Bose, at this point, said that that government India was not in the Supreme Court, to which Sibal said that they had filed an affidavit.</p><p>Can a High Court decide this issue?</p><p>Sibal argued that the traceability issue was a policy issue and thus couldn't be decided by a high court. Justice Bose said that it could be.As in the Madras High Court (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2019/08/223-tell-us-if-traceability-is-technically-possible-madras-hc-to-whatsapp-and-iit-madras-professor/\">https://www.medianama.com/2019/08/223-tell-us-if-traceability-is-technically-possible-madras-hc-to-whatsapp-and-iit-madras-professor/</url>), Sibal cited theUnion List (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/shed07.htm\">http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/shed07.htm</url>) that defines items on which the Parliament has exclusive power to legislate. Entry 31 in the List includes \"posts and telegraphs; telephones, wireless, broadcasting and other like forms of communication\".</p><p>As Rohatgi once again cited the Tamil Nadu police commissioner, Justice Bose asked him, \"What's your main grievance? The transfer or the commissioner's order?\"</p><p>Rohatgi cited three reasons for seeking a transfer to the Supreme Court:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Confusion arising from conflicting decisions from the three high courts</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Citizens of India are affected by these decisions, and hence the apex court should look at the case</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Government of India is looking at the traceability issue from a statutory perspective.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Rohatgi cited Justice S. Manikumar's order, dated August 28, 2018, where he expanded the scope of the PILs: \"On the facts and circumstances of this case, and in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, we are of the prima facie view that the Information Technology Act, 2000 Act and rules made thereunder, have to be implemented, in letter and spirit, and therefore, decide to enlarge the scope of the writ petition. Social media like, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Whatsapp, Google from whom information is sought for investigation, Cyber Crime, Commissioner of Police, are required to be heard, as to why they should not be made as party respondents, to these writ petitions.\"</p><p>Sibal once again made an argument about the international nature of these platforms. \"Any product of this nature is a global product. WhatsApp is a global product. Any interim order will apply globally even though this issue is pending before the Union of India for parliamentary legislation. That is the issue.\" He also said that \"no other country has intervened in this product\". He reiterated Rohatgi's argument that they couldn't have conflicting orders, and thus the SC should decide.</p><p>Justice Gupta was pretty clear that the high courts could decide such issues.</p><p>What about Aadhaar linkage?</p><p>Justice Gupta asked Facebook about the effects of all the petitions on Aadhaar. Rohatgi said that according to the Aadhaar Ordinance, \"Aadhaar can be used for authentication, even by private entities.\" He argued that these were all aspects of privacy that were best decided by the Supreme Court. \"We had Puttuswamy 1, then Puttuswamy 2, and then Aadhaar. Merely because 10-15 hearings have taken place [in the Madras High Court], you cannot refuse to transfer.\"</p><p>State of Tamil Nadu argues</p><p>The Attorney General of India, K.K. Venugopal, represented the state of Tamil Nadu and argued against transferring the petitions. He said that \"18 hearings, 10 effective hearings, and 5 orders\" had taken place/been passed. On the point of traceability, he said, \"Originator of all this is a criminal who must be apprehended. Pornography is just one part. Terrorism and defamation are the others.\"</p><p>Venugopal cited the affidavit submitted by the ACP of Central Crime Branch, Greater Chennai, cited in Madras HC order dated August 28, 2018: \"It is respectfully submitted that even though, the service providers are not providing the details, this respondent analyze the social media accounts like facebook, twitter, whatsapp, youtube and others through open source intelligence by gathering the available information viz., photograph, personal details and friend list about suspects and take appropriate actions. [sic]\" He argued that crime cells across the country are state entities, not central ones.</p><p>He also cited from Madras HC order dated October 31, 2018: \"Endeavour of this Court is that how these service providers can help an investigation agency, in the matter of any crime which is reported and taken note of. Is there not a duty and responsibility of a service provider to furnish information to the investigating agency, promptly, and if so, to proceed further. Viewed from the perspective of privacy vis-a-vis crime, we are of the view that service provider has a duty and responsibility, to provide adequate information to the investigation agency.\"</p><p>Venugopal argued that as far as WhatsApp is concerned, since it is owned by Facebook, the two are practically the same. He cited from the Madras HC order, dated June 6, 2019, where Sibal and Arvind Datar's submission in court, that WhatsApp cannot technically trace the originator: \"On behalf of WhatsApp, Mr.Kapil Sibal, learned Senior Counsel and Mr.P.Arvind Datar, learned Senior Counsel for WhatsApp, submitted that in respect of the content removal on sharing the hash value/originator identity/maintaining log of voice calls, WhatsApp, does not have any mechanism to identify the originator of the information nor WhatsApp maintains the details of log of voice calls.\"</p><p>Sibal prompted him to read the next paragraph of the judgement that reads: \"Both the learned Senior Counsel submitted that on the aspect of Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules, 2018, being brought into force, there is a consultative process and the stake holders, have given their comments, in three volumes. It is the further submission that whatever basic information is required by the Law Enforcement Agencies, is furnished and some of the deliverables, have been agreed upon to social media intermediaries.\"</p><p>Venugopal read fromKamakoti's submission (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2019/08/223-kamakoti-medianama-whatsapp-traceability-interview/\">https://www.medianama.com/2019/08/223-kamakoti-medianama-whatsapp-traceability-interview/</url>) that suggested that traceability was technically possible. As he read, Justice Gupta, in a moment of levity, said, \"At least this part is Greek to me.\"</p><p>For the state of Tamil Nadu, Venugopal argued that with Kamakoti's suggestion, WhastApp felt threatened and thus approached the Supreme Court. Sibal shook his head in vigorous disagreement.</p><p>Venugopal said that their prayer was not not stop the Madras High Court hearing in the middle.</p><p>Blue Whale makes an unlikely appearance</p><p>Venugopal drew the court's attention to the problem of Blue Whale challenge and how the government of India was struggling to find the perpetrator. He cited writ petition no. 943/2017, which was transferred to the Supreme Court. Justice Gupta asked if Blue Whale challenge was circulated only though Facebook and WhatsApp. As Venugopal looked a bit confused with the question, Virag Gupta, the counsel for K.N. Govindacharya, who has filed a petition to be impleaded in the case, said that the links to the challenge were primarily circulated on WhatsApp and Facebook.</p><p>SC Bench: To transfer or not to transfer is the question</p><p>Justice Gupta said that the bench would not go into the merits of the case, but, at this stage, just evaluate the need to transfer. He said that the primary conflict was between the right to privacy and the right to govern an entire country. For the latter, it was important to consider under what conditions information was to be given and to whom. He remarked that if this were the 50s or the 60s, the Supreme Court would have sought ten opinions from the high courts, but that \"in the last decade or so, things had changed\".</p><p>Venugopal said that the Madras HC division bench was \"practically decided\". \"You have seen the progress made. Tomorrow is the 21st hearing. You will have some judgement from a very enlightened division bench.\" He suggested that the SC could perhaps \"ignore\" other high courts for the time being, but let the Madras HC hearings go on. \"When the Madras High Court hearings are about to be completed, they want to move. Let the bench decide.\" Rohatgi challenged Venugopal's characterisation of the Madras HC's progress: \"Not for final hearing. That is wrong.\" Sibal seconded him and said that in the August 21 hearing, the first objections to Kamakoti's suggestions will be heard. Gupta made an interjection but was shut down by the bench.</p><p>Justice Bose asked the State of Tamil Nadu, \"In individual crime detection, aren't there enough provisions to find the originator through social media companies?\" Venugopal said, \"The problem is that WhatsApp doesn't have the provision to find the originator, so they say that how do we help you?\" Justice Gupta asked about using Aadhaar number. Venugopal immediately replied, \"That is not the focus now. It is now about cybercrime.\"</p><p>Readers should note here that the debate in the Madras HC has evolved beyond the Aadhaar linkage, and the division bench had categorically denied the possibility of such linkage.</p><p>When Venugopal cited the Blue Whale case (W.P. No. 943/2017), Rohatgi said, \"The Blue Whale case also came to the Supreme Court. After 5 High Courts, it came here.\" He cited from the record of hearings dated October 13, 2017: \"As we are dealing with the issue pertaining to on-line digital games such as 'Blue Whale', we would request the High Courts in the country not to address the said issue to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting orders/directions.\" Rohatgi argued that this was an \"identically placed\" case, and of Venugopal's own showing. \"Why is the state government so keen that its high court should decide?\" Rohatgi questioned.</p><p>Justice Gupta replied, \"We are aware. Blue Whale is at least not the dark web. [leading Sibal to exclaim \"wow!\"] Dark web is much worse. I don't know how to access it, but I have heard about it.\"</p><p>Justice Gupta summarised the problem of technology in one sentence: \"It's a fight within technology about who's faster\", prompting Venugopal to say, \"And their answer is 'we're an international organisation'.\" Justice Bose asked if WhatsApp's technology was \"deliberately designed this way\". Sibal immediately said no. Gupta vehemently agreed, but was ignored.</p><p>K.N. Govindacharya's petition seeking to be impleaded</p><p>Justice Gupta asked Virag Gupta to explain who he and his client were. Gupta said that his client wanted to be impleaded as he was pursuing cases on similar matters. He cited 5 reasons for wanting to be a part of this case:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>WhatsApp and Facebook are the biggest violators of privacy, contrary to their claims. He said that case was being heard before Justice R.F. Nariman on this point.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The Big Tech do not want to come under Indian jurisdiction.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Justice Gupta intervened and asked him to focus on why he should be a part of the transfer petition. Gupta cited three reasons for seeking a stay against the transfer:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The four petitions in questions are not connected cases; they are not all related to Aadhaar.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>If these four petitions are transferred, all social media cases all over the country should also be transferred to the Supreme Court as the five major Big Tech firms, Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp, are respondents in this case.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Facebook and WhatsApp are not complying with Delhi High Court guidelines. Existing guidelines were notified in 2014.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>On the last point, Justice Gupta said that if the companies were flouting Delhi HC orders, Gupta should file a \"contempt writ\". He further said, \"We are giving you a hearing, but not impleading you. What is your point?\" Gupta reiterated his argument that these companies don't want to come under Indian jurisdiction. Justice Gupta told him to let the courts decide that. Gupta made a plea to hear the final judgements from the high courts. Sibal intervened and quoted from Gupta's petition which sought transfer of the case, leading to some confusion.</p><p>What's next?</p><p>The Supreme Court division bench issued the following orders:</p><p>* Hearing before the Madras High Court (scheduled for today0 may go on \"but no effective order be passed till further orders\"</p><p>* Notices to be issued to all unserved respondents through email, returnable on September 13, 2019.</p><p>* The next hearing on the transfer petition is on September 13, 2019.</p><p>MediaNama checked in with Antony Clement Rubin and Janani Krishanamurthy whose PILs have arguably been the biggest influences on prompting the transfer petition. At the time of publishing, neither had received a notice.</p><p>On the transfer petition, Rubin said, \"Madras High Court has heard the case right from the beginning. They have called in technical experts as well. People are also flying in from abroad. Moving the case to the Supreme Court would have left everything in the air. I am glad that the Supreme Court gave the Madras High Court the time and space to hear this case out.\" He further said that Facebook has a right to go to the Supreme Court. \"I can't say that it is a bad thing. Facebook didn't have much of an issue. [WhatsApp did because of lack of traceability.]\" On the point of Aadhaar, he clarified that that wasn't his focus. \"My focus is on traceability and finding the originator. The originator shouldn't get the benefit of privacy. There should be some task force to address cybercrime and cyberbullying.\"</p><p>Krishnamurthy told MediaNama, \"Even if it goes to the Supreme Court, the government of India will take the decision. May the best lawyers fight it and bring justice.\"</p><p>Madras, Bombay, and Jabalpur HC petitions in question</p><p>Facebook wants to transfer four petitions (TPC 1943-1946/2019) that are sub judice in Madras, Bombay and Jabalpur High Courts.</p><p>The case in the Madras High Court, which might lead to enforcement of traceability in WhatsApp, had been filed in 2018 as two PILs by Antony Clement Rubin (WP. No. 20774/2018) and Janani Krishnamurthy (W.P. No. 20214/2018) that sought a writ mandamus (special order by court) to \"declare the linking of Aadhaar or any one of the Government authorized identity proof as mandatory for the purpose of authentication while obtaining any email or user account\".</p><p>The case in the Bombay High Court was filed as a PIL by Sagar Rajabhau Suryavanshi (PIL/3/2019) in October 2018. It sought to bring unregulated content on Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter, especially in the form of paid advertisements, within the ambit of Section 126 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 so that free and fair elections could be conducted. It also sought direction against the Election Commission of India to take necessary steps.</p><p>The third case that Facebook wants to be transferred is pending in the Japalpur High Court. Amitabh Gupta, an advocate, had filed a writ petition (W.P. No. 13076/2019) in July 2019 seeking guidelines from the central government related to the operations of Facebook and WhatsApp. The PIL wants Facebook permits an individual to open an accounts only after s/he furnishes KYC details, PTIhad reported (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/social-media-pil-furnish-central-govt-guidelines-says-mp-hc/1576416\">https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/social-media-pil-furnish-central-govt-guidelines-says-mp-hc/1576416</url>). It also wants Facebook to verify new users through ID documents such as Aadhaar, driving licence, and/or voter ID in addition to providing a photograph. The PIL also wants every WhatsApp group \"with more than 50 members to add the mobile number of a policeman provided by the local police station where the group operates\".</p><p>(NB: In the Supreme Court records, Janani Krishnamurthy isn't listed as one of the respondents in the transfer petition, but sources have confirmed to MediaNama that she should be one.)</p><p>In addition, Facebook had cited W.P. No. 679/2019, currently pending in the Supreme Court in its transfer petition. This writ petition, filed by S.G. Vombatkere and Bezwada Wilson in July 2019,challenges (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2019/07/223-sc-issues-notice-to-centre-and-uidai-on-plea-against-new-aadhaar-ordinance-and-regulations/\">https://www.medianama.com/2019/07/223-sc-issues-notice-to-centre-and-uidai-on-plea-against-new-aadhaar-ordinance-and-regulations/</url>) the constitutionality of the new Aadhaar (and Other Laws Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 and the Aadhaar (Pricing of Aadhaar Authentication Services) Regulations, 2019. The petitioners alleged that the UIDAI intends to use the ordinance to commercialise and financially gain through the large-scale collection of the personal data of citizens and use of Aadhaar database by private entities.

Rohatgi intervened and argued that the \"principal question is if Aadhaar [information] can be shared with private entities\". He cited the three High Court petitions in questions wherein the three courts have held different opinions on this matter. \"Madras High Court has said that you can't share the Aadhaar information [with private entities], while Bombay and Jabalpur High Courts have said you can,\" he said. \"Where do we [Facebook] go? How many places will I go to argue the same thing?\" he beseeched the court.</p><p>Justice Gupta cited a recent Supreme Court order whereby the petitioners were directed to approach the high court first. In April 2019, the division bench constituting Justices S.A. Bobde and S.A.

We can't have conflicting judgements.\"</p><p>Venugopal, on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu, said, \"All Aadhaar orders are annexed here. 18 hearings [before the Madras High Court] have taken place.\" He citedDr V. Kamakoti's submission (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2019/08/223-kamakoti-medianama-whatsapp-traceability-interview/\">https://www.medianama.com/2019/08/223-kamakoti-medianama-whatsapp-traceability-interview/</url>) to the Madras High Court to argue that \"the originator can be traced\". \"Origin [of the message], according to Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, is encrypted. Madras High Court, on the basis of IIT professor's [referring to Dr Kamakoti] affidavit, is coming to conclusion. The proper thing will be to have a decision so that you [the Supreme Court judges] can decide [on the matter if it is challenged].\"</p><p>At this point, Justice Bose remarked, \"Facebook has a policy of not sharing\" to which Rohatgi said, \"WhatsApp has encryption because of which we can't trace.\" Justice Bose also commented that Apple doesn't share information.</p><p>Reiterating Dr Kamakoti's submission, Venugopal said, \"Their [Facebook/WhatsApp's] case in [Madras] High Court is that they can't find the originator.

They want panel members to raise the boycott with Zuckerberg at a landmark hearing[2] Wednesday. Details: In a letter written to all committee members and obtained by Axios, Common Sense tells lawmakers the boycott campaign has \"highlighted how much control Facebook has over online advertising.\" </p><p>The letter is the second of two notes sent to lawmakers in the past week \u2014 one sent last Tuesday and the second one Monday afternoon. It provides sample questions that they want lawmakers to ask Zuckerberg, such as, \"[I]s it accurate that you have said that advertisers will be back soon? Does this mean they have no real alternative?\" Zuckerberg has reportedly told employees[3] as much. Another sample question the groups suggest for Zuckerberg: \"Facebook offers tremendous reach and targeting capabilities to advertisers. What alternatives do advertisers have to reach the demographic audiences held captive by Facebook?\" Committee members have confirmed receipt of the letters and say appreciate the input from the campaign, sources tell Axios. Some of the groups leading the boycott, including the NAACP, have individually been in touch with lawmakers regarding the hearing, sources say. \"Facebook has enough power that it believes it is effectively immune to ad boycotts, massive privacy violations, and other scandals,\" Common Sense CEO Jim Steyer said in a call with Axios.The other side: \"The perception that our services are full of hate and politicaldiscourse is not true,\" a Facebookspokesperson tells Axios. \"There's no place for hate on our services and we'emade it clear there is nothing more important than that.\" The company has said it faces ample competition from other players in online advertising. Meanwhile, its free-to-users services don't trigger the consumer pricing concerns that antitrust cases are traditionally built on. Between the lines: Common Sense has long been lobbying for more action against Big Tech across an array of issues. Steyer says the aim is \"fundamental regulatory change,\" which could include Facebook being forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp.For its part, Facebook has long said breakups aren't the answer for the issues it has wrestled with but has called for[4] regulation to help reduce the amount of harmful content online and harmonize differing standards on privacy and other issues. The big picture: The #StopHateforProfit boycott has escalated quickly to encompass roughly 1,000 advertisers. Tensions between the boycotters and the tech giant haven't improved since the company's disastrous meeting with civil rights leaders[5] last month, Steyer says, and Common Sense hasn't been in touch with Facebook since.\"I don't feel they've made progress,\" says Steyer. \"I would say deny, deflect, distract has been their strategy. The meeting a couple weeks ago was a total failure.\" What's next: Steyer says that the Stop Hate for Profit campaign is going to be continuing past July. \"We will be making an announcement about that later this week.\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/facebook-faces-trust-crisis-as-ad-boycott-grows-411fc2e6-cda2-4acc-9313-520d0188d8bd.html\">https://www.axios.com/facebook-faces-trust-crisis-as-ad-boycott-grows-411fc2e6-cda2-4acc-9313-520d0188d8bd.html</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/dcs-assault-on-tech-crest-ceo-hearing-92dd16fb-7f2f-4887-8943-24eb461788a6.html\">https://www.axios.com/dcs-assault-on-tech-crest-ceo-hearing-92dd16fb-7f2f-4887-8943-24eb461788a6.html</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/zuckerberg-tells-facebook-staff-he-expects-advertisers-to-return-soon-enough\">https://www.theinformation.com/articles/zuckerberg-tells-facebook-staff-he-expects-advertisers-to-return-soon-enough</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/zuckerberg-starts-offense-on-big-tech-regulations-43062bbc-9c83-43e2-8785-e5dac6daa09c.html\">https://www.axios.com/zuckerberg-starts-offense-on-big-tech-regulations-43062bbc-9c83-43e2-8785-e5dac6daa09c.html</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/civil-rights-leaders-blast-facebook-after-meeting-with-zuckerberg-63daa9dd-0209-4420-85d3-805385825718.html\">https://www.axios.com/civil-rights-leaders-blast-facebook-after-meeting-with-zuckerberg-63daa9dd-0209-4420-85d3-805385825718.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544159590405471375776100019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FT-KDT1-F03R-N40R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><timeReceived>2:40 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

From L.A. to D.C., many American downtowns have hit their one-year anniversary with scooters, and European capitals have begun to allow them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The benefit is obvious: Scooters provide on- demand, affordable mobility to any able-bodied smartphone user. As the vehicle's fan base grows, however, so do the frustrations that provoke other urbanites to detest them -- abandoned scooters left on walkways and even scooter-pedestrian collisions. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo says escalating tensions are leading to \"anarchy\" on her city's boulevards and footpaths. And an even bigger issue looms over arguments for and against this revamped child's toy. Scooters may well be the Trojan Horse with which big tech colonizes the world's public space.</p><p>Scooters (and dockless e-bikes) inhabit cities like few other consumer products ever have. Through location-tracking and app-based transactions, scooter barons oversee their business from a distance while storing their entire inventories on our streets and sidewalks for next to nothing. When in use, scooters generate revenue for Bird, Lime or some other \"micro-mobility\" company. When not in use, they just sit there, wherever there happens to be: a bike lane, a doorway, a neighbor's frontyard. Citizens have no lawful recourse, leading some to resort to micro-vandalism.</p><p>Scooters' success in spite of the persistent backlash is a warning about whether tech can succeed in leveraging public space. A playbook seems to be taking shape. First, identify a point of friction in urban life (such as \"the last-mile problem\" in public transportation). Next, develop a profitable solution and deploy it in cities and ask for permission later. When people howl, let your early adopters fight the battle for you -- use them as a shield whenever critics speak ill of your business model. Finally, push aggressive expansion while voicing support for sensible regulations that are essentially unenforceable.</p><p>Like Uber and Airbnb before them, scooter companies aim to satisfy their customers with little regard for how their businesses affect our cities' ecosystems. All three services tamper with neighborhood norms in ways that are annoying at first and deeply disturbing upon further inspection. Via Airbnb, for instance, a quaint bungalow surrounded by family homes suddenly becomes a bachelor party pad replete with fresh groups of drunken idiots each weekend. Annoying. But what's far more worrisome is recent data indicating that Airbnb is worsening the housing crisis in cities like Los Angeles and New Orleans. Landlords love Airbnb: Why lease a place to lower-income tenants for $900 a month when you can earn double by renting it out here and there to well-off tourists? When residential units are converted into the equivalent of chic motels, the pool of long-term housing decreases and rental prices rise.</p><p>As for Uber and other ride-sharing apps, originally framed as a solution to urban congestion, they are instead putting more cars on the road, making traffic worse. A San Francisco study found that bumper-to-bumper delays soared 62% from 2010 to 2016, and roughly half of this increase was caused by ride-sharing vehicles. Very few riders are choosing to share trips with other passengers and rates of car ownership in the city remain steady. The big loser has been public transit, particularly buses, whose ridership has decreased nearly 13% -- a drop that presents grave challenges to a service that is both more affordable and energy efficient than Uber's fleet of vehicles.</p><p>Now, as big tech monetizes curbs and doorways and sidewalks, we're seeing the marginalization of non-motorists who, by choice or necessity, traverse the city on their own power. Scooters at rest and in motion create barriers for parents with strollers, frail elderly pedestrians and especially the disabled. It is perturbing for a jogger or cyclist to come upon an abandoned scooter blocking their path. That this happens regularly to wheelchair users and the visually impaired is unconscionable. Decades of activism and legal battles to secure ADA accommodations in the built environment are being causally brushed aside in the name of enhancing mobility for those who can easily walk.</p><p>Granted, it's early days for scooters; perhaps a solution will emerge. But soon it won't just be scooters anymore. In Amazon's office parks and Google's test towns, drone services are being readied to pick up and drop off items at a slab of concrete near you. Even Georgia Tech's library is using drones to fly books around campus to students too busy to swing by the stacks. Eight states have recently passed legislation that will allow delivery robots to roam the sidewalks. Meanwhile, wannabe Zuckerbergs that no one yet knows about are learning from scooters and dreaming up the next big thing they can plop all over the place.</p><p>The scooter experiment proves how difficult it is to establish a retroactive ban after some residents have already fallen in love with a new disruptive gadget. Absent better laws anticipating the takeover, the next battles, too, are likely to be lost on Day 1.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: LIKE UBER and Airbnb, scooter companies have little regard for cities' ecosystems.

If you look at Glasgow in particular, something else is going on there. We've talked on this programme before about the Glasgow effect and there is a combination of factors taking place in Glasgow.

Thanks very much for coming in. This week, we've learned the lengths that the big tech companies will go to to try to keep female employees onside. What might be called the \"perverse perks\" offered at Facebook and Apple have been followed by death threats yesterday against a prominent female American video game critic, Anita Sarkeesian. It's the latest in a series of similar incidents But what about the experience of female gamers and tech fans Julie Peacock has been taking a look at what it's like to be a woman in a very male world. game, having to fight your way home. And now for the twist. Imagine you are a woman. It is not such a hard thing for half of the population to get their head around but a female character in a first person shooter is as common as a girlfriend being invited on a lads night out. Unless she is wearing Lara Croft hot pants! But a believable female character has been created. She has to fight her way through the world of the 80s, 90s and naughties to make it back to reality. back to reality. It is quite humorous game, so it is a chance to have a satirical take on the way in which women have been neglected by first person shooters. They are usually there to perform some secondary function. If they are there in a positive sense, it is almost incidental that they are a woman. It is limited by the fact that it is a first person shooter and the weight to get round a problem is to shoot someone in the face. It is different from if she was some sort of hulking space Marine. Around half of all gamers are women but fewer than 15% of games characters are. Bedlam's developer believe that the industry is missing a trick. Heather Quinn is a woman of our time. She is a gamer, a sci-fi fan, a bit of a geek. I have friends just like her. It is a male-female split now, that play computer games. -- it is a 50-50 male-female split now. I was recently doing a talk at a local school about careers in IT to A-level students. Of the 40 or so people that turned up, there was one girl. To me, that says that that is a bigger failure of society. So what has been done to redress the balance and get young female gamers to think about a career in the industry? One person who is blazing a trail is severe George, -- Sofia George, an award-winning games designer. Girls often get discouraged from doing things like maths and I don't think they should be, they should do what they want. Do you think it would make a difference to the kind of products that were being sold if they had a better gender balance?

And as Finn Myrstad was just saying, we as consumers may not have a lot of choice when we're dealing with these massive companies. But just how massive are they?             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 Well, I'll give you some specific examples. In a 12-month period from June of '17 to, I think, June of '18, Amazon added to its market capitalization the value of the entire CPG industry.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GUY RAZ:                 This is Scott Galloway.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 Professor of marketing, NYU Stern School of Business.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 And that phrase that he just used...             </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 The entire CPG industry.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 ...Means consumer packaged goods. So we're talking Nestle, Tyson Foods, Pepsi...             </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 So you could take every consumer product sold globally...             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 ...Nike, Unilever, Procter and Gamble...             </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 When we're talking about companies - Unilever and PNG - that have been around for decades...             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 ...3M, L'Oreal, Kraft, Heinz...             </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 ...Not generations...             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 ...Adidas, General Mills, Hershey...             </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 ...Not centuries...             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 ...Mattel, Anheuser-Busch, Philip Morris...             </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 ...That have unbelievably robust consumer brands, global reach, credible supply chain - and Amazon added the entire value of that industry in a 12-month period.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON:                 Amazon is doing fine.             </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1:                 May be headed for global dominance.             </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2:                 The stock is now up 2%.             </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3:                 They're becoming a profit machine. You are seeing their profits...             </p><p>                            (CROSSTALK)                </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 And it's not just Amazon. In his TED talk, Scott focused on the three other behemoth companies that, with Amazon, make up the big four. They are Apple, Facebook and Google. So what does it mean that these companies are so big and so good at manipulating, well, almost every part of our lives? Here's Scott Galloway's take from the TED stage.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)                </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 These four companies - at the end of the Great Recession, the market capitalization of these companies was equivalent to the GDP of Niger. Now it is equivalent to the GDP of India, having blown past Russia and Canada in '13 and '14. There are only five nations that have a GDP greater than the combined market capitalization of these four firms.             </p><p>Amazon has become so powerful in the marketplace; they can conduct Jedi mind tricks that can begin damaging other industries just by looking at it. Nike announces they're distributing on Amazon - their stock goes up; every other footwear stock goes down. When Amazon stock goes up, the rest of retail stocks go down because they assume what's good for Amazon is bad for everybody else. They cut the cost on salmon 33% when they acquired Whole Foods. In between the time they announced the acquisition of Whole Foods and when it closed, Kroger, the largest pure-play grocer in America, shed a third of its value because Amazon purchased a grocer one-eleventh the size of Kroger.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 When we talk about the four big companies - right? - let's put this into a historical context. Are we kind of living through a similar period in history where you had, like, the railroad barons and the oil barons and the finance barons - the Rockefellers, the Carnegies, the Crockers - is that the world we're living in today?             </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 Yeah, we've been to this movie before. And history may not repeat itself, but it rhymes, and this definitely rhymes with periods when companies have concentrated or through excellent execution, macroenvironment, luck - whatever you want to call it - become an invasive species; and that is, small companies have a difficult time getting out of the crib. Large companies are kind of euthanized prematurely, and large companies tend to be great employers and good taxpayers.             </p><p>                What's different about this era is that we seem to have lost the script around antitrust. And that is, with the railroads, telcos, the aluminum companies, the seven sisters, the oil companies - we decided to move in and break them up and we had, quote, unquote, a \"class traitor\" (ph). And that is, a lot of people think the railroad money elected Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican, but he was willing to go in and say, I love you guys. Thanks for getting me in the office, but I'm now breaking you up because we need to oxygenate the economy. But we have been to these levels of concentration before.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)                </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 Whose fault is it? It's our fault. We're electing regulators who don't have the backbone to actually go after these companies. Amazon only needs one person for two at Macy's. If they grow their business $20 billion this year, which they will, we will lose $53,000 cashiers and clerks. This is nothing unusual. This has happened all through our economy. We've just never seen companies this good at it. That's one Yankee Stadium of workers.             </p><p>                It's even worse in media. Facebook and Google grow their business $22 billion this year, which they will, we're going to lose approximately 150,000 creative directors, planners and copywriters. Or we can fill up 2 1/2 Yankee Stadiums and say, you are out of work, courtesy of Amazon.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 When it comes to Google or Amazon or Facebook or even Apple, how much do we control our interaction with those platforms and how much are we controlled by our interaction with those platforms?             </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 So look - every time you light up a cigarette, you're making a conscious choice. But the question is, at some point, do you become so biologically addicted to nicotine, does the organization require scrutiny around what it's doing to addict you? And power corrupts, and when you're a monopoly and you're Facebook, and the worse that's going to happen to you is a fine that's equivalent of seven days' income or seven weeks of cash flow and maybe some public shaming, you're always going to find a reason not to figure it out.             </p><p>                The NRA has never been able to connect the sale of assault weapons with the murder of children. Big Tobacco was never able to connect tobacco with cancer. Big tech is never going to connect the underlying algorithms of their companies and the lack of security and the lack of human discretion and screening of their content with the division or serious division in our culture, the weaponization of these platforms to clear (ph) our elections or teen depression. They will never make that connection on their own because when it's raining money, it blurs your vision.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 See, I think the thing about these big companies that really worries me is how much I feel manipulated by them. And I don't - and it's not that I want to blame them because I am making choices. I am deciding to use these platforms and to check on Facebook or Twitter or buying things on Amazon because it's easy, you know. Like, that's the part of it that really bothers me, more than the sort of the economic cost of it, which is obviously a problem; it's the personal cost. It's how it sort of changes and has changed our behavior.             </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 Hundred percent. And I would argue that if you're going to look at price, at some point, if we end up with a group of people who can all have Netflix, all have a great phone, all have tons of content and get paper towels delivered really inexpensively, but we're - our wages are flat for five decades, OK, do we need to reevaluate priorities? I would argue that the pricing or the prices we pay for these platforms has skyrocketed. And that is, when we have a country where a lot of us wonder if the elections were manipulated, that's an enormous price we all pay.             </p><p>                When we worry about our 16-year-old daughters sitting in their room, knowing they weren't invited to a party, that's one thing. But seeing the party play out in real time, on their phones, as they're in their rooms alone, that's a price that my household pays. I'm worried that my son, my oldest son who's 11 and does a handstand, and I video it, and he asks me to post it on YouTube, and then he gets a like, and he says, can we check back in and see if I got more likes? And then someone makes kind of a snarky comment about his video, and it really bums him out. And Google responds, well, yeah, but your son can learn how to play the piano on YouTube.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY:                 There's some wonderful things about social media, but the addiction here - we know we're being manipulated. That's an enormous price we all pay.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 That's Scott Galloway, professor at NYU's Stern School of Business.

On the Amazon -- I mean you're living the benefits of the Amazon, $28 for your book \"The Four\", they're walking out the door at $18.30 prime free one day shipping. That's a discount of 35 percent. Is Amazon your friend or enemy when you're flagging a book?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: I think the answer is yes. They're so dominant in the book business that I think they've is reshape it. What's interesting about the book business though is that, Amazon has arguably done less damage or less disruption of the book business than a lot of the categories, it's kind of to after that.</p><p>So, there -- you know, they're the biggest player in books, but at the same an author, they're very good at figuring out how to track people, who maybe have checked out your book, you'll start getting hunted by ads to for \"The Four\".</p><p>KEENE: I have, I have, you know.</p><p>GALLOWAY: They'll start stalking you. And so they're --</p><p>KEENE: I almost went as Scott Galloway last night for Halloween.</p><p>DAVID GURA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: For Halloween --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GALLOWAY: But that is just terrifying costume and trust me doesn't work anywhere. Doesn't get into restaurants and doesn't -- how to get -- doesn't help anywhere. So, yes Amazon -- Amazon look, it dominant I would say on the hold, good for authors.</p><p>KEENE: OK, David Gura, why don't you start on a tech frenzy, as people know, I think is just a bunch of boloney. But, David try to be more intelligent than I can be.</p><p>GURA: What do we learn yesterday? You had three representatives from -- three of the big four on Capitol Hill yesterday testifying before this Senate judiciary committee, sub-committee of that committee to that where the House and we'll see repeat of what we saw yesterday. When it comes to what these companies did and are doing to change their behaviors, what do we learn?</p><p>GALLOWAY: So when you -- the new sort of none denial, denial or none apology, apology is the term we must do better. And, the key -- it's not a crisis itself that damages a firm, it's the response of the crisis. Martha Stewart didn't go to jail for insider trading, she went to jail for denying it, specifically obstruct -- obstruction of justice. And the only thing you really have to remember in crisis management, is to over correct or at least be perceive this over correcting. And, I would argue these guys have yet to really put out the necessary statement and that's -- that is the following, the CEO needs to stand in front of America, Congress, consumers, shareholders and say, I'm personally committing to making sure this never happens again. And they haven't done that.</p><p>GURA: How difficult is that from a technical perspective, how much sympathy do you have for these companies who say to do the kind of screening or the vigilance, have the kind of vigilance that would be required is technically an impossibility?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I have almost no sympathy, because we're not talking about the realm of the possible, we're talking about the realm of the profitable and that is if the New York Times can protect us from the weaponization of their platform on $90 million and cash flow Facebook configure out with $12 billion.</p><p>Facebook can hire 10,000 people to screen content, they could spend a half a billion dollars a year on artificial intelligence to help those 10 people identify flag their content. And it would dent their a free cash flow five or 10 percent. When big tech tells you something is impossible, that's latin for we would be less profitable if we did this.</p><p>This is -- look a better business model for a country club is to have no lifeguard at the pool. And that's what they've done. But for some reason they've co-opted us into believing it's impossible, that's just ridiculous.</p><p>KEENE: Why are they the police of all this? They just a kind of -- they're just a distribution system aren't they?</p><p>GALLOWAY: That's a fair point and that's the argument that they are \"platform\" this --</p><p>KEENE: They're a platform?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Are they platform or are they media? I would argue, I would argue the part before the stay, (ph) you create content, you spend a billion dollars on original content, you're on ads --</p><p>KEENE: Fair.</p><p>GALLOWAY: -- they got in content --</p><p>KEENE: Should they be regulated by FCC? I mean back there, you know, I remember in Douglas Brinkley's wonderful one volume (ph) and Walter Cronkite, the whole radio regulation when Cronkite was nobody in Kansas City.</p><p>GALLOWAY: I don't see why they shouldn't be subject to same scrutiny the rest of the media is. Media tag - looked up the definition last night, media is a medium that is used to influence and reach people. Facebook defines what it is to be a media company, and they still haven't admitted they're a media company. They keep saying that there are platform. This would be like McDonald's serving 80 percent of their hamburgers are fake and they get encephalitis and made bad decisions and McDonald's defense to be we're not a fast food restaurant we're a fast food platform. Facebook defines what it is to be a media company and should live up to the --</p><p>KEENE: Interesting.</p><p>GALLOWAY: -- to the responsibilities of being part of the fourth estate (ph).</p><p>GURA: How much self awareness do these companies have? I always find it funny when I go out to San Francisco, the Silicon Valley, the rhetoric that you hear. People twilling away to change the world, they have this broad, big ambitions and I wonder if there's sense of place in the United States, in the world in society generally is somehow askew?</p><p>GALLOWAY: So -- and this is going to sound cynical, but I believed what Peter Drucker said that organizations are here to create a middle class and four profit entities which is companies are primarily there to create economic security for their employees and their shareholders. Not in that order.</p><p>And the notion that they're there to connect the world or save the planet or do no evil, I think it's more marketing than it is reality and every quarter people -- analysts don't ask them if they're saving the world or connecting the Earth, they ask them \"What were your earnings?\"</p><p>And I think they are very focused on profitability as they should be. I don't -- I think they're doing exactly what they're suppose to be, the problem is we've personified these companies and we think they're almost Christ-like. We've given them the mother of all hall passes, because we decided --</p><p>KEENE: Who's we?</p><p>GALLOWAY: It's society. I think we look at these companies differently, even these questions. If they should be subject to the same regulation as radio, why wouldn't they, why would these companies be subject? If a company is weaponized by Russia and other media firms were not, then isn't the obvious answer or logic?</p><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p>GALLOWAY: -- because we didn't do a more regulation?</p><p>KEENE: Well let's take all the clicks that fit the print. I mean do the analog at Facebook the New York Times?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Do the analog of Facebook - I don't understand the question --</p><p>KEENE: How is Facebook well it's -- because, you know, I'm a student, I'm raising my hand. So Professor Galloway --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: -- compare the New York Times then, the Facebook that the pressures that the (INAUDIBLE) have --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: Versus Zuckerberg.</p><p>GALLOWAY: OK. So I was on the board at the New York Times for a couple years and I -- in my second board meeting and this might be inside baseball, I said, I suggest that we shut off Google. I think it's ridiculous.</p><p>The stupidest thing we've done in old media was buy into this lie that information wants to be free. Your boss doesn't think information wants to be free and there's a reason why this firm is still fabulously successful. But we at the New York Times, let Google show up with a dump truck and start taking cash from us, crawling our data, slicing it up, serving it against ads that they could monetize (INAUDIBLE) actual we could monetize into base our gorgeous content. We took Birkin bags and distributed them through Wal-Mart. Information wants to be free, one of the stupidest things we've ever bought into.</p><p>GURA: Let's come back here, Scott Galloway, author of \"The Four\", plenty more to talk about with him again as we look for this House hearing this afternoon. We'll be hearing --</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>GURA: -- again at 2:00 Wall Street time I think on Capitol Hill.</p><p>KEENE: We'll talk a little bit about the book as well before, can't say enough about it, just a terrific read and of course Professor Galloway, as he said earlier is not cynical, he likes to go every once in a while, as not cynical.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Different shade of gray (ph).</p><p>KEENE: Book it all.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: We're talking with Scott Galloway of New York University, his book \"The Four\" I have a rave review on it \"The Hidden DNA\" of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google it's incredibly refreshing and given the other business books that are out there. And what's refreshing about you Scott, is you've been on both sides of a fence as (INAUDIBLE) migrates down under $3 per share.</p><p>What was it like advising, consulting and being on the board of Edward Bauer (ph)? Old line -- what Seattle retailer?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, Seattle retailer, kind of an iconic brand in the northwest. I was put --</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>GALLOWAY: -- on late by the Hedge Funds who wanted to come and muscle it into reorganization. So, you know, I was there when it was kind of near the end. But what's interesting is it got bought again. And other bought and it's about to do kind of chapter 12 and I think it's about to go bankrupt again.</p><p>But you're seeing brands everywhere under attack. The era of that -- what I would refer to is a brand era, the sun has passed midday on traditional kind brand, brand building and shareholder value through a marginal product with greatest associations, that's over.</p><p>GURA: How much is that we're seeing here a governance issue, of course Uber is an outlier example of problems with the board of directories. But with these big companies, are they adequately governed by folks who know business and know about what historically business has been in stood for?</p><p>GALLOWAY: So, in media companies, media has and this is not just for Facebook and Google, but all media companies have talk themselves or most of them and to believing that they're special and that the founders have some sort of special insight that they need protection from shareholders in the honor (ph). So they typically up two classes of stock and that's true of -- is true the New York Time company. I believed its true, of news core and I know it's true of Google and Facebook.</p><p>Now, it's also true with Snap, you have a 27-year old, would you buy, share and snap? You have no rights, you have no say, you have no ability to put anyone on the board. And it's run by a 27-year old whose campaign is now worth more than Viacom, the New York Times and combine. It's like what can go wrong, right?</p><p>So, corporate governance, there isn't a lot of corporate governance here. The board of directors of these companies are really a board, they're an advisory board. Because they don't get to fire the CEO and they don't get to buy or sell the company which at the end of the day is really the really two things that matters for a board.</p><p>GURA: How we get to that point, I look at this through social site things are not willingness or to be complicit to give away data, to give away information, because it's convenient or easy and I look at them on the other side with ledger with governance and management and just the way this companies are run. How did we -- we become, we society again talking about with the capital less become so comfortable with that happening?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Sure, we're at time at this during the break, I believe that we no longer worship at the alter of care and kindness, but the altered innovators and shareholder value. And we believe that this people are good for society, good people. I think they're incredibly savvy, they've incredibly impressive. And as a political bond here, I believe they wrap themselves in a pink or rainbow or neon blue blanket, because progressives as a general rule are perceive is being very nice and weak.</p><p>It's a great foil for a company that acts like Darth Vader and spin (INAUDIBLE) in the day. Wrap yourself in a progressive blanket and your not seeing this trend (ph). Look at Microsoft, they were perceive is more conservative and conservatives are largely seen as being smart, the mean.</p><p>So the foil, the illusionist trick is to come up as very, very progressive and liberal and caring about other people, because entering the day you can be Darth Vader.</p><p>KEENE: Give the parallel then and you do this been in a book before of these giants in John D. Rockefeller, literally (ph) the first business book I ever read was I deferrable (ph). To this day I can't tell you why I pull it off the shelf at Fairport High School a million years ago.</p><p>How did they relate to John D. Rockefeller?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, you mean in terms of concentration?</p><p>KEENE: Concentration and power -- oh come on power. It simply power.</p><p>GALLOWAY: So, I would argue that at 90 percent share of search.</p><p>KEENE: Exactly.</p><p>GALLOWAY: And search is now a bigger business than the entire advertising business by (INAUDIBLE) of any country except in the U.S. And you have one company that controls 90 plus percent of it, it's Google. So, I would argue, I would that Google it has more power and concentration, a market share than the rail roads and (INAUDIBLE) when they were broken.</p><p>KEENE: Are we waiting for, I did terrible to come along to break off Google?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well there are -- the equi analog to that and the only regulator in the world now who I would describe his testicles of descended is Margaret Beissinger (ph). She's the one that's going after them. And it's because war the war against big tech is going to break out, were all the other big conflicts have broken out, it's going to break out in Europe, Tom, because we register a lot of benefit here and a lot of downside in Europe, they register all of the downside and a fracture.</p><p>KEENE: But I would agree with that analysis, but then how do you respond in the natural lock-in individualistic, we're American, we're going to do with our self, have it to that pushes against (INAUDIBLE) on Europe. I mean we push against that thing, don't we?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, no I don't think -- people say what could get them the way, these guys and people are -- I don't think it will say in between any of them in a trillion dollars for mark account right now is Washington or Brussels and its definitely more likely going to be Brussels.</p><p>But I don't -- you know, at some point Tom, one of this northern European nation is going to say is the model letting this guys and work out better or is the Chinese model we have let them chess (ph) long and have to steal their IP and then prompt up a local competitor and capture all the value. Did the Chinese have it wrong, who were the dump ones here?</p><p>So I wouldn't be surprise if we see a small European nation, actually outright banned one or more this companies. I think the warm has turned against big tech.</p><p>GURA: I had a case that it talk to some Morgan (ph) investigator in Washington and she's going to seem at least I perceive this curiosity there in terms of where she's coming from what she's trying to do I think she's quite a subject to a lot ire there of course and the bay area as well.</p><p>What accounts to the cultural different there between where Brussels is in where Washington is, are there other indications that our sense of competition is going to change or evolve as result of what we saw in this election, what we seen in terms of the -- or size of these companies?</p><p>GALLOWAY: There's a big difference and I said, in the U.S. it's hard to deny -- we register great deal of benefit from these firms. Amazon, is the largest recruiter from my class. You know, the real estate prices in California or Northern California of sky rocketed because of the wealth created there. They -- their sources of national pride, their, you know, they are ours, it's a huge sort -- they create competition, economic growth.</p><p>Though all the concerns around privacy, job -- job destruction weaponization by foreign adversaries are real conservation we're having it. But in Europe, there aren't a lot of university buildings or hospital wings, names after Facebook or Google billionaires.</p><p>So, the question is if I don't get the upside, and I get all the downside, that's stiffens the regulators back bones in Europe.</p><p>KEENE: David, just to point things out and I -- you know, I've read most of Galloway's tone here. I read the first book, the old testament but not the new.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Very good.</p><p>KEENE: Did I know David Gura, that Amazon has 541,000 employees? I don't believe I knew that.</p><p>GURA: Is there a point in which got you pushing against the company becoming too big and others we can talk about how regulation might curve the growth or the influence of a company, but just to I guess the principle of physic (ph). Could I get too big, can a company get two size, can a Google or Amazon become too big?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I don't know if they become too big, they're definitely not too big. Keep in mind -- I mean Tom talked about half a million employees at Amazon. The more interesting fact is that Facebook is now I think the fourth most valuable company in the world, they do it 22,000 employees.</p><p>And if you take this companies combined, is a population of the Lowery side where the GDP of --</p><p>KEENE: Yes</p><p>GALLOWAY: -- India. So GDP of India is right across the Lowery side. They -- it's not can we become too big, is it can we became too powerful and that's a legitimate question.</p><p>KEENE: You do your Jim Morris (ph) invitation at the back into the book. You say \"The Four\" in you what should you do about this moment and this is a profoundly American issue which is the -- people of America to the cities. And this has to do with our --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: -- American politics, get to a city.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: What do you mean by that?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Two-thirds of economic value is going to be created in city. When you're in city, you bump into people who are better or -- you know, or the best in the world that's -- when you play tennis and someone is better than you, you get better. So rally with someone who's great and the best in the world are gravitating the cities, because that's where the economic value, is to get to a city and jump off in rally would better tennis.</p><p>KEENE: 25-year old in Brooklyn, they can afford to live large like David Gura, which city should they move to? Where is Galloway favorite city right now?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Oh gosh, Tom, if you can afford to you want to live in New York or San Francisco, because it's a very interesting --</p><p>KEENE: Yes, they come on they can. I mean no, you know, it's outrageous.</p><p>GALLOWAY: There's --</p><p>KEENE: Give me a secondary city or I'm going to make some news and sell Serious XM channel 119 somewhere.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Miami, Austin, Nashville --</p><p>KEENE: Miami, a small city like Miami.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Miami is fantastic, Nashville --</p><p>GURA: Queens.</p><p>GALLOWAY: There is a ton of great cities, St. Louis, Wash U, the probably the fastest or the --</p><p>KEENE: There we go, we'll leave it there. Washington University, St. Louis.</p><p>GALLOWAY: There you go.</p><p>KEENE: Riley from St. Louis, we say good morning to you. Scotot Galloway, the book is \"The Four\". Even Riley from St. Louis is going to read it.</p><p>This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

On the Amazon -- I mean you're living the benefits of the Amazon, $28 for your book \"The Four\", they're walking out the door at $18.30 prime free one day shipping. That's a discount of 35 percent. Is Amazon your friend or enemy when you're flagging a book?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: I think the answer is yes. They're so dominant in the book business that I think they've is reshape it. What's interesting about the book business though is that, Amazon has arguably done less damage or less disruption of the book business than a lot of the categories, it's kind of to after that.</p><p>So, there -- you know, they're the biggest player in books, but at the same an author, they're very good at figuring out how to track people, who maybe have checked out your book, you'll start getting hunted by ads to for \"The Four\".</p><p>KEENE: I have, I have, you know.</p><p>GALLOWAY: They'll start stalking you. And so they're --</p><p>KEENE: I almost went as Scott Galloway last night for Halloween.</p><p>DAVID GURA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: For Halloween --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GALLOWAY: But that is just terrifying costume and trust me doesn't work anywhere. Doesn't get into restaurants and doesn't -- how to get -- doesn't help anywhere. So, yes Amazon -- Amazon look, it dominant I would say on the hold, good for authors.</p><p>KEENE: OK, David Gura, why don't you start on a tech frenzy, as people know, I think is just a bunch of boloney. But, David try to be more intelligent than I can be.</p><p>GURA: What do we learn yesterday? You had three representatives from -- three of the big four on Capitol Hill yesterday testifying before this Senate judiciary committee, sub-committee of that committee to that where the House and we'll see repeat of what we saw yesterday. When it comes to what these companies did and are doing to change their behaviors, what do we learn?</p><p>GALLOWAY: So when you -- the new sort of none denial, denial or none apology, apology is the term we must do better. And, the key -- it's not a crisis itself that damages a firm, it's the response of the crisis. Martha Stewart didn't go to jail for insider trading, she went to jail for denying it, specifically obstruct -- obstruction of justice. And the only thing you really have to remember in crisis management, is to over correct or at least be perceive this over correcting. And, I would argue these guys have yet to really put out the necessary statement and that's -- that is the following, the CEO needs to stand in front of America, Congress, consumers, shareholders and say, I'm personally committing to making sure this never happens again. And they haven't done that.</p><p>GURA: How difficult is that from a technical perspective, how much sympathy do you have for these companies who say to do the kind of screening or the vigilance, have the kind of vigilance that would be required is technically an impossibility?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I have almost no sympathy, because we're not talking about the realm of the possible, we're talking about the realm of the profitable and that is if the New York Times can protect us from the weaponization of their platform on $90 million and cash flow Facebook configure out with $12 billion.</p><p>Facebook can hire 10,000 people to screen content, they could spend a half a billion dollars a year on artificial intelligence to help those 10 people identify flag their content. And it would dent their a free cash flow five or 10 percent. When big tech tells you something is impossible, that's latin for we would be less profitable if we did this.</p><p>This is -- look a better business model for a country club is to have no lifeguard at the pool. And that's what they've done. But for some reason they've co-opted us into believing it's impossible, that's just ridiculous.</p><p>KEENE: Why are they the police of all this? They just a kind of -- they're just a distribution system aren't they?</p><p>GALLOWAY: That's a fair point and that's the argument that they are \"platform\" this --</p><p>KEENE: They're a platform?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Are they platform or are they media? I would argue, I would argue the part before the stay, (ph) you create content, you spend a billion dollars on original content, you're on ads --</p><p>KEENE: Fair.</p><p>GALLOWAY: -- they got in content --</p><p>KEENE: Should they be regulated by FCC? I mean back there, you know, I remember in Douglas Brinkley's wonderful one volume (ph) and Walter Cronkite, the whole radio regulation when Cronkite was nobody in Kansas City.</p><p>GALLOWAY: I don't see why they shouldn't be subject to same scrutiny the rest of the media is. Media tag - looked up the definition last night, media is a medium that is used to influence and reach people. Facebook defines what it is to be a media company, and they still haven't admitted they're a media company. They keep saying that there are platform. This would be like McDonald's serving 80 percent of their hamburgers are fake and they get encephalitis and made bad decisions and McDonald's defense to be we're not a fast food restaurant we're a fast food platform. Facebook defines what it is to be a media company and should live up to the --</p><p>KEENE: Interesting.</p><p>GALLOWAY: -- to the responsibilities of being part of the fourth estate (ph).</p><p>GURA: How much self awareness do these companies have? I always find it funny when I go out to San Francisco, the Silicon Valley, the rhetoric that you hear. People twilling away to change the world, they have this broad, big ambitions and I wonder if there's sense of place in the United States, in the world in society generally is somehow askew?</p><p>GALLOWAY: So -- and this is going to sound cynical, but I believed what Peter Drucker said that organizations are here to create a middle class and four profit entities which is companies are primarily there to create economic security for their employees and their shareholders. Not in that order.</p><p>And the notion that they're there to connect the world or save the planet or do no evil, I think it's more marketing than it is reality and every quarter people -- analysts don't ask them if they're saving the world or connecting the Earth, they ask them \"What were your earnings?\"</p><p>And I think they are very focused on profitability as they should be. I don't -- I think they're doing exactly what they're suppose to be, the problem is we've personified these companies and we think they're almost Christ-like. We've given them the mother of all hall passes, because we decided --</p><p>KEENE: Who's we?</p><p>GALLOWAY: It's society. I think we look at these companies differently, even these questions. If they should be subject to the same regulation as radio, why wouldn't they, why would these companies be subject? If a company is weaponized by Russia and other media firms were not, then isn't the obvious answer or logic?</p><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p>GALLOWAY: -- because we didn't do a more regulation?</p><p>KEENE: Well let's take all the clicks that fit the print. I mean do the analog at Facebook the New York Times?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Do the analog of Facebook - I don't understand the question --</p><p>KEENE: How is Facebook well it's -- because, you know, I'm a student, I'm raising my hand. So Professor Galloway --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: -- compare the New York Times then, the Facebook that the pressures that the (INAUDIBLE) have --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: Versus Zuckerberg.</p><p>GALLOWAY: OK. So I was on the board at the New York Times for a couple years and I -- in my second board meeting and this might be inside baseball, I said, I suggest that we shut off Google. I think it's ridiculous.</p><p>The stupidest thing we've done in old media was buy into this lie that information wants to be free. Your boss doesn't think information wants to be free and there's a reason why this firm is still fabulously successful. But we at the New York Times, let Google show up with a dump truck and start taking cash from us, crawling our data, slicing it up, serving it against ads that they could monetize (INAUDIBLE) actual we could monetize into base our gorgeous content. We took Birkin bags and distributed them through Wal-Mart. Information wants to be free, one of the stupidest things we've ever bought into.</p><p>GURA: Let's come back here, Scott Galloway, author of \"The Four\", plenty more to talk about with him again as we look for this House hearing this afternoon. We'll be hearing --</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>GURA: -- again at 2:00 Wall Street time I think on Capitol Hill.</p><p>KEENE: We'll talk a little bit about the book as well before, can't say enough about it, just a terrific read and of course Professor Galloway, as he said earlier is not cynical, he likes to go every once in a while, as not cynical.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Different shade of gray (ph).</p><p>KEENE: Book it all.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: We're talking with Scott Galloway of New York University, his book \"The Four\" I have a rave review on it \"The Hidden DNA\" of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google it's incredibly refreshing and given the other business books that are out there. And what's refreshing about you Scott, is you've been on both sides of a fence as (INAUDIBLE) migrates down under $3 per share.</p><p>What was it like advising, consulting and being on the board of Edward Bauer (ph)? Old line -- what Seattle retailer?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, Seattle retailer, kind of an iconic brand in the northwest. I was put --</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>GALLOWAY: -- on late by the Hedge Funds who wanted to come and muscle it into reorganization. So, you know, I was there when it was kind of near the end. But what's interesting is it got bought again. And other bought and it's about to do kind of chapter 12 and I think it's about to go bankrupt again.</p><p>But you're seeing brands everywhere under attack. The era of that -- what I would refer to is a brand era, the sun has passed midday on traditional kind brand, brand building and shareholder value through a marginal product with greatest associations, that's over.</p><p>GURA: How much is that we're seeing here a governance issue, of course Uber is an outlier example of problems with the board of directories. But with these big companies, are they adequately governed by folks who know business and know about what historically business has been in stood for?</p><p>GALLOWAY: So, in media companies, media has and this is not just for Facebook and Google, but all media companies have talk themselves or most of them and to believing that they're special and that the founders have some sort of special insight that they need protection from shareholders in the honor (ph). So they typically up two classes of stock and that's true of -- is true the New York Time company. I believed its true, of news core and I know it's true of Google and Facebook.</p><p>Now, it's also true with Snap, you have a 27-year old, would you buy, share and snap? You have no rights, you have no say, you have no ability to put anyone on the board. And it's run by a 27-year old whose campaign is now worth more than Viacom, the New York Times and combine. It's like what can go wrong, right?</p><p>So, corporate governance, there isn't a lot of corporate governance here. The board of directors of these companies are really a board, they're an advisory board. Because they don't get to fire the CEO and they don't get to buy or sell the company which at the end of the day is really the really two things that matters for a board.</p><p>GURA: How we get to that point, I look at this through social site things are not willingness or to be complicit to give away data, to give away information, because it's convenient or easy and I look at them on the other side with ledger with governance and management and just the way this companies are run. How did we -- we become, we society again talking about with the capital less become so comfortable with that happening?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Sure, we're at time at this during the break, I believe that we no longer worship at the alter of care and kindness, but the altered innovators and shareholder value. And we believe that this people are good for society, good people. I think they're incredibly savvy, they've incredibly impressive. And as a political bond here, I believe they wrap themselves in a pink or rainbow or neon blue blanket, because progressives as a general rule are perceive is being very nice and weak.</p><p>It's a great foil for a company that acts like Darth Vader and spin (INAUDIBLE) in the day. Wrap yourself in a progressive blanket and your not seeing this trend (ph). Look at Microsoft, they were perceive is more conservative and conservatives are largely seen as being smart, the mean.</p><p>So the foil, the illusionist trick is to come up as very, very progressive and liberal and caring about other people, because entering the day you can be Darth Vader.</p><p>KEENE: Give the parallel then and you do this been in a book before of these giants in John D. Rockefeller, literally (ph) the first business book I ever read was I deferrable (ph). To this day I can't tell you why I pull it off the shelf at Fairport High School a million years ago.</p><p>How did they relate to John D. Rockefeller?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, you mean in terms of concentration?</p><p>KEENE: Concentration and power -- oh come on power. It simply power.</p><p>GALLOWAY: So, I would argue that at 90 percent share of search.</p><p>KEENE: Exactly.</p><p>GALLOWAY: And search is now a bigger business than the entire advertising business by (INAUDIBLE) of any country except in the U.S. And you have one company that controls 90 plus percent of it, it's Google. So, I would argue, I would that Google it has more power and concentration, a market share than the rail roads and (INAUDIBLE) when they were broken.</p><p>KEENE: Are we waiting for, I did terrible to come along to break off Google?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well there are -- the equi analog to that and the only regulator in the world now who I would describe his testicles of descended is Margaret Beissinger (ph). She's the one that's going after them. And it's because war the war against big tech is going to break out, were all the other big conflicts have broken out, it's going to break out in Europe, Tom, because we register a lot of benefit here and a lot of downside in Europe, they register all of the downside and a fracture.</p><p>KEENE: But I would agree with that analysis, but then how do you respond in the natural lock-in individualistic, we're American, we're going to do with our self, have it to that pushes against (INAUDIBLE) on Europe. I mean we push against that thing, don't we?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, no I don't think -- people say what could get them the way, these guys and people are -- I don't think it will say in between any of them in a trillion dollars for mark account right now is Washington or Brussels and its definitely more likely going to be Brussels.</p><p>But I don't -- you know, at some point Tom, one of this northern European nation is going to say is the model letting this guys and work out better or is the Chinese model we have let them chess (ph) long and have to steal their IP and then prompt up a local competitor and capture all the value. Did the Chinese have it wrong, who were the dump ones here?</p><p>So I wouldn't be surprise if we see a small European nation, actually outright banned one or more this companies. I think the warm has turned against big tech.</p><p>GURA: I had a case that it talk to some Morgan (ph) investigator in Washington and she's going to seem at least I perceive this curiosity there in terms of where she's coming from what she's trying to do I think she's quite a subject to a lot ire there of course and the bay area as well.</p><p>What accounts to the cultural different there between where Brussels is in where Washington is, are there other indications that our sense of competition is going to change or evolve as result of what we saw in this election, what we seen in terms of the -- or size of these companies?</p><p>GALLOWAY: There's a big difference and I said, in the U.S. it's hard to deny -- we register great deal of benefit from these firms. Amazon, is the largest recruiter from my class. You know, the real estate prices in California or Northern California of sky rocketed because of the wealth created there. They -- their sources of national pride, their, you know, they are ours, it's a huge sort -- they create competition, economic growth.</p><p>Though all the concerns around privacy, job -- job destruction weaponization by foreign adversaries are real conservation we're having it. But in Europe, there aren't a lot of university buildings or hospital wings, names after Facebook or Google billionaires.</p><p>So, the question is if I don't get the upside, and I get all the downside, that's stiffens the regulators back bones in Europe.</p><p>KEENE: David, just to point things out and I -- you know, I've read most of Galloway's tone here. I read the first book, the old testament but not the new.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Very good.</p><p>KEENE: Did I know David Gura, that Amazon has 541,000 employees? I don't believe I knew that.</p><p>GURA: Is there a point in which got you pushing against the company becoming too big and others we can talk about how regulation might curve the growth or the influence of a company, but just to I guess the principle of physic (ph). Could I get too big, can a company get two size, can a Google or Amazon become too big?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I don't know if they become too big, they're definitely not too big. Keep in mind -- I mean Tom talked about half a million employees at Amazon. The more interesting fact is that Facebook is now I think the fourth most valuable company in the world, they do it 22,000 employees.</p><p>And if you take this companies combined, is a population of the Lowery side where the GDP of --</p><p>KEENE: Yes</p><p>GALLOWAY: -- India. So GDP of India is right across the Lowery side. They -- it's not can we become too big, is it can we became too powerful and that's a legitimate question.</p><p>KEENE: You do your Jim Morris (ph) invitation at the back into the book. You say \"The Four\" in you what should you do about this moment and this is a profoundly American issue which is the -- people of America to the cities. And this has to do with our --</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: -- American politics, get to a city.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: What do you mean by that?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Two-thirds of economic value is going to be created in city. When you're in city, you bump into people who are better or -- you know, or the best in the world that's -- when you play tennis and someone is better than you, you get better. So rally with someone who's great and the best in the world are gravitating the cities, because that's where the economic value, is to get to a city and jump off in rally would better tennis.</p><p>KEENE: 25-year old in Brooklyn, they can afford to live large like David Gura, which city should they move to? Where is Galloway favorite city right now?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Oh gosh, Tom, if you can afford to you want to live in New York or San Francisco, because it's a very interesting --</p><p>KEENE: Yes, they come on they can. I mean no, you know, it's outrageous.</p><p>GALLOWAY: There's --</p><p>KEENE: Give me a secondary city or I'm going to make some news and sell Serious XM channel 119 somewhere.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Miami, Austin, Nashville --</p><p>KEENE: Miami, a small city like Miami.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Miami is fantastic, Nashville --</p><p>GURA: Queens.</p><p>GALLOWAY: There is a ton of great cities, St. Louis, Wash U, the probably the fastest or the --</p><p>KEENE: There we go, we'll leave it there. Washington University, St. Louis.</p><p>GALLOWAY: There you go.</p><p>KEENE: Riley from St. Louis, we say good morning to you. Scotot Galloway, the book is \"The Four\". Even Riley from St. Louis is going to read it.</p><p>This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

On the Amazon -- I mean you're living the benefits of the Amazon, $28 for your book \"The Four\", they're walking out the door at $18.30 prime free one day shipping.  That's a discount of 35 percent.  Is Amazon your friend or enemy when you're flagging a book?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  I think the answer is yes.  They're so dominant in the book business that I think they've is reshape it.  What's interesting about the book business though is that, Amazon has arguably done less damage or less disruption of the book business than a lot of the categories, it's kind of to after that.  </p><p>      So, there -- you know, they're the biggest player in books, but at the same an author, they're very good at figuring out how to track people, who maybe have checked out your book, you'll start getting hunted by ads to for \"The Four\".  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I have, I have, you know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  They'll start stalking you.  And so they're --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I almost went as Scott Galloway last night for Halloween.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  For Halloween --   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  But that is just terrifying costume and trust me doesn't work anywhere.  Doesn't get into restaurants and doesn't -- how to get -- doesn't help anywhere.  So, yes Amazon -- Amazon look, it dominant I would say on the hold, good for authors.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK, David Gura, why don't you start on a tech frenzy, as people know, I think is just a bunch of boloney.  But, David try to be more intelligent than I can be.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  What do we learn yesterday?  You had three representatives from -- three of the big four on Capitol Hill yesterday testifying before this Senate judiciary committee, sub-committee of that committee to that where the House and we'll see repeat of what we saw yesterday.  When it comes to what these companies did and are doing to change their behaviors, what do we learn?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  So when you -- the new sort of none denial, denial or none apology, apology is the term we must do better.  And, the key -- it's not a crisis itself that damages a firm, it's the response of the crisis.  Martha Stewart didn't go to jail for insider trading, she went to jail for denying it, specifically obstruct -- obstruction of justice.  And the only thing you really have to remember in crisis management, is to over correct or at least be perceive this over correcting.  And, I would argue these guys have yet to really put out the necessary statement and that's -- that is the following, the CEO needs to stand in front of America, Congress, consumers, shareholders and say, I'm personally committing to making sure this never happens again.  And they haven't done that. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  How difficult is that from a technical perspective, how much sympathy do you have for these companies who say to do the kind of screening or the vigilance, have the kind of vigilance that would be required is technically an impossibility?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  I have almost no sympathy, because we're not talking about the realm of the possible, we're talking about the realm of the profitable and that is if the New York Times can protect us from the weaponization of their platform on $90 million and cash flow Facebook configure out with $12 billion.  </p><p>Facebook can hire 10,000 people to screen content, they could spend a half a billion dollars a year on artificial intelligence to help those 10 people identify flag their content.  And it would dent their a free cash flow five or 10 percent.  When big tech tells you something is impossible, that's latin for we would be less profitable if we did this.  </p><p>      This is -- look a better business model for a country club is to have no lifeguard at the pool.  And that's what they've done.  But for some reason they've co-opted us into believing it's impossible, that's just ridiculous.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Why are they the police of all this?  They just a kind of -- they're just a distribution system aren't they?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  That's a fair point and that's the argument that they are \"platform\" this --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  They're a platform?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Are they platform or are they media?  I would argue, I would argue the part before the stay, (ph) you create content, you spend a billion dollars on original content, you're on ads --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Fair.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  -- they got in content --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Should they be regulated by FCC?  I mean back there, you know, I remember in Douglas Brinkley's wonderful one volume (ph) and Walter Cronkite, the whole radio regulation when Cronkite was nobody in Kansas City.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  I don't see why they shouldn't be subject to same scrutiny the rest of the media is.  Media tag  looked up the definition last night, media is a medium that is used to influence and reach people.  Facebook defines what it is to be a media company, and they still haven't admitted they're a media company.  They keep saying that there are platform.  This would be like McDonald's serving 80 percent of their hamburgers are fake and they get encephalitis and made bad decisions and McDonald's defense to be we're not a fast food restaurant we're a fast food platform.  Facebook defines what it is to be a media company and should live up to the --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Interesting. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  -- to the responsibilities of being part of the fourth estate (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  How much self awareness do these companies have?  I always find it funny when I go out to San Francisco, the Silicon Valley, the rhetoric that you hear.  People twilling away to change the world, they have this broad, big ambitions and I wonder if there's sense of place in the United States, in the world in society generally is somehow askew?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  So -- and this is going to sound cynical, but I believed what Peter Drucker said that organizations are here to create a middle class and four profit entities which is companies are primarily there to create economic security for their employees and their shareholders.  Not in that order.  </p><p>      And the notion that they're there to connect the world or save the planet or do no evil, I think it's more marketing than it is reality and every quarter people --  analysts don't ask them if they're saving the world or connecting the Earth, they ask them \"What were your earnings?\"  </p><p>      And I think they are very focused on profitability as they should be.  I don't -- I think they're doing exactly what they're suppose to be, the problem is we've personified these companies and we think they're almost Christ-like.  We've given them the mother of all hall passes, because we decided --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Who's we?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  It's society.  I think we look at these companies differently, even these questions.  If they should be subject to the same regulation as radio, why wouldn't they, why would these companies be subject?  If a company is weaponized by Russia and other media firms were not, then isn't the obvious answer or logic?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  -- because we didn't do a more regulation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Well let's take all the clicks that fit the print.  I mean do the analog at Facebook the New York Times?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Do the analog of Facebook  I don't understand the question --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  How is Facebook well it's -- because, you know, I'm a student, I'm raising my hand.  So Professor Galloway --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  -- compare the New York Times then, the Facebook that the pressures that the (INAUDIBLE) have --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Versus Zuckerberg.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  OK.  So I was on the board at the New York Times for a couple years and I -- in my second board meeting and this might be inside baseball, I said, I suggest that we shut off Google.  I think it's ridiculous.  </p><p>      The stupidest thing we've done in old media was buy into this lie that information wants to be free.  Your boss doesn't think information wants to be free and there's a reason why this firm is still fabulously successful.  But we at the New York Times, let Google show up with a dump truck and start taking cash from us, crawling our data, slicing it up, serving it against ads that they could monetize (INAUDIBLE) actual we could monetize into base our gorgeous content. We took Birkin bags and distributed them through Wal-Mart. Information wants to be free, one of the stupidest things we've ever bought into.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Let's come back here, Scott Galloway, author of \"The Four\", plenty more to talk about with him again as we look for this House hearing this afternoon.  We'll be hearing --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  -- again at 2:00 Wall Street time I think on Capitol Hill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  We'll talk a little bit about the book as well before, can't say enough about it, just a terrific read and of course Professor Galloway, as he said earlier is not cynical, he likes to go every once in a while, as not cynical.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Different shade of gray (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Book it all.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  We're talking with Scott Galloway of New York University, his book \"The Four\" I have a rave review on it \"The Hidden DNA\" of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google it's incredibly refreshing and given the other business books that are out there.  And what's refreshing about you Scott, is you've been on both sides of a fence as (INAUDIBLE) migrates down under $3 per share.  </p><p>      What was it like advising, consulting and being on the board of Edward Bauer (ph)?  Old line -- what Seattle retailer?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Yes, Seattle retailer, kind of an iconic brand in the northwest.  I was put --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  -- on late by the Hedge Funds who wanted to come and muscle it into reorganization.  So, you know, I was there when it was kind of near the end.  But what's interesting is it got bought again. And other bought and it's about to do kind of chapter 12 and I think it's about to go bankrupt again. </p><p>      But you're seeing brands everywhere under attack.  The era of that -- what I would refer to is a brand era, the sun has passed midday on traditional kind brand, brand building and shareholder value through a marginal product with greatest associations, that's over.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  How much is that we're seeing here a governance issue, of course Uber is an outlier example of problems with the board of directories.  But with these big companies, are they adequately governed by folks who know business and know about what historically business has been in stood for?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  So, in media companies, media has and this is not just for Facebook and Google, but all media companies have talk themselves or most of them and to believing that they're special and that the founders have some sort of special insight that they need protection from shareholders in the honor (ph).  So they typically up two classes of stock and that's true of -- is true the New York Time company.  I believed its true, of news core and I know it's true of Google and Facebook.  </p><p>      Now, it's also true with Snap, you have a 27-year old, would you buy, share and snap?  You have no rights, you have no say, you have no ability to put anyone on the board.  And it's run by a 27-year old whose campaign is now worth more than Viacom, the New York Times and combine.  It's like what can go wrong, right?  </p><p>      So, corporate governance, there isn't a lot of corporate governance here.  The board of directors of these companies are really a board, they're an advisory board.  Because they don't get to fire the CEO and they don't get to buy or sell the company which at the end of the day is really the really two things that matters for a board.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  How we get to that point, I look at this through social site things are not willingness or to be complicit to give away data, to give away information, because it's convenient or easy and I look at them on the other side with ledger with governance and management and just the way this companies are run.  How did we -- we become, we society again talking about with the capital less become so comfortable with that happening?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Sure, we're at time at this during the break, I believe that we no longer worship at the alter of care and kindness, but the altered innovators and shareholder value.  And we believe that this people are good for society, good people.  I think they're incredibly savvy, they've incredibly impressive.  And as a political bond here, I believe they wrap themselves in a pink or rainbow or neon blue blanket, because progressives as a general rule are perceive is being very nice and weak.  </p><p>      It's a great foil for a company that acts like Darth Vader and spin (INAUDIBLE) in the day.  Wrap yourself in a progressive blanket and your not seeing this trend (ph).  Look at Microsoft, they were perceive is more conservative and conservatives are largely seen as being smart, the mean.  </p><p>      So the foil, the illusionist trick is to come up as very, very progressive and liberal and caring about other people, because entering the day you can be Darth Vader.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Give the parallel then and you do this been in a book before of these giants in John D. Rockefeller, literally (ph) the first business book I ever read was I deferrable (ph).  To this day I can't tell you why I pull it off the shelf at Fairport High School a million years ago.  </p><p>      How did they relate to John D. Rockefeller?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Well, you mean in terms of concentration?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Concentration and power -- oh come on power.  It simply power.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  So, I would argue that at 90 percent share of search.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Exactly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  And search is now a bigger business than the entire advertising business by (INAUDIBLE) of any country except in the U.S. And you have one company that controls 90 plus percent of it, it's Google.  So, I would argue, I would that Google it has more power and concentration, a market share than the rail roads and (INAUDIBLE) when they were broken.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Are we waiting for, I did terrible to come along to break off Google?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Well there are -- the equi analog to that and the only regulator in the world now who I would describe his testicles of descended is Margaret Beissinger (ph).  She's the one that's going after them.  And it's because war the war against big tech is going to break out, were all the other big conflicts have broken out, it's going to break out in Europe, Tom, because we register a lot of benefit here and a lot of downside in Europe, they register all of the downside and a fracture.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  But I would agree with that analysis, but then how do you respond in the natural lock-in individualistic, we're American, we're going to do with our self, have it to that pushes against (INAUDIBLE) on Europe.  I mean we push against that thing, don't we?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Yes, no I don't think -- people say what could get them the way, these guys and people are -- I don't think it will say in between any of them in a trillion dollars for mark account right now is Washington or Brussels and its definitely more likely going to be Brussels.  </p><p>      But I don't -- you know, at some point Tom, one of this northern European nation is going to say is the model letting this guys and work out better or is the Chinese model we have let them chess (ph) long and have to steal their IP and then prompt up a local competitor and capture all the value.  Did the Chinese have it wrong, who were the dump ones here?  </p><p>      So I wouldn't be surprise if we see a small European nation, actually outright banned one or more this companies.  I think the warm has turned against big tech.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  I had a case that it talk to some Morgan (ph) investigator in Washington and she's going to seem at least I perceive this curiosity there in terms of where she's coming from what she's trying to do I think she's quite a subject to a lot ire there of course and the bay area as well.  </p><p>      What accounts to the cultural different there between where Brussels is in where Washington is, are there other indications that our sense of competition is going to change or evolve as result of what we saw in this election, what we seen in terms of the -- or size of these companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  There's a big difference and I said, in the U.S. it's hard to deny -- we register great deal of benefit from these firms. Amazon, is the largest recruiter from my class.  You know, the real estate prices in California or Northern California of sky rocketed because of the wealth created there.  They -- their sources of national pride, their, you know, they are ours, it's a huge sort -- they create competition, economic growth.  </p><p>      Though all the concerns around privacy, job -- job destruction weaponization by foreign adversaries are real conservation we're having it.  But in Europe, there aren't a lot of university buildings or hospital wings, names after Facebook or Google billionaires.  </p><p>      So, the question is if I don't get the upside, and I get all the downside, that's stiffens the regulators back bones in Europe.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  David, just to point things out and I -- you know, I've read most of Galloway's tone here.  I read the first book, the old testament but not the new.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Very good.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Did I know David Gura, that Amazon has 541,000 employees? I don't believe I knew that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Is there a point in which got you pushing against the company becoming too big and others we can talk about how regulation might curve the growth or the influence of a company, but just to I guess the principle of physic (ph).  Could I get too big, can a company get two size, can a Google or Amazon become too big?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  I don't know if they become too big, they're definitely not too big.  Keep in mind -- I mean Tom talked about half a million employees at Amazon.  The more interesting fact is that Facebook is now I think the fourth most valuable company in the world, they do it 22,000 employees.  </p><p>      And if you take this companies combined, is a population of the Lowery side where the GDP of --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  -- India.  So GDP of India is right across the Lowery side.  They -- it's not can we become too big, is it can we became too powerful and that's a legitimate question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  You do your Jim Morris (ph) invitation at the back into the book.  You say \"The Four\" in you what should you do about this moment and this is a profoundly American issue which is the -- people of America to the cities.  And this has to do with our --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  -- American politics, get to a city.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  What do you mean by that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Two-thirds of economic value is going to be created in city.  When you're in city, you bump into people who are better or -- you know, or the best in the world that's -- when you play tennis and someone is better than you, you get better.  So rally with someone who's great and the best in the world are gravitating the cities, because that's where the economic value, is to get to a city and jump off in rally would better tennis.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  25-year old in Brooklyn, they can afford to live large like David Gura, which city should they move to?  Where is Galloway favorite city right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Oh gosh, Tom, if you can afford to you want to live in New York or San Francisco, because it's a very interesting --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes, they come on they can.  I mean no, you know, it's outrageous.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  There's --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Give me a secondary city or I'm going to make some news and sell Serious XM channel 119 somewhere.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Miami, Austin, Nashville --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Miami, a small city like Miami.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Miami is fantastic, Nashville --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Queens.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  There is a ton of great cities, St. Louis, Wash U, the probably the fastest or the --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  There we go, we'll leave it there.  Washington University, St. Louis.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  There you go.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Riley from St. Louis, we say good morning to you.  Scotot Galloway, the book is \"The Four\".

I keep saying 'the Brexit we never wanted'.

Set up in 2007 to handle used IT kit for big tech firms, the company has grown into a sophisticated global recycling business with 450 staff and annual revenues approaching (EURO)80m.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The appetite for information is growing, so e-waste is growing,\" says Sheehan, tapping his smartphone. \"We cover the whole spectrum, from iPads and laptops right up to data centres.\"</p><p>Wisetek's customers include hardware maker Dell, the Walt Disney Company, optical tech giant Olympus and the cybersecurity group Forcepoint. Others are under wraps but include householdname internet and leisure companies. The \"end of life\" IT equipment is not all scrap. Wisetek has a \"zero landfill\" policy, so computers and electronic kit are wiped and sold on intact, broken into components, or recycled - including recovering precious metals.</p><p>\"One ton of printed circuit boards has the equivalent amount of gold as 17 tons of gold ore,\" says Sheehan. \"There are seven or eight grades of metals [in a circuit board], but you have to find reputable smelters because it's the most toxic area of e-waste.\"</p><p>Last year Wisetek erased and destroyed 11m disk drives - a 30% increase on 2018. The company handles 265,000 laptops and desktop computers a year and has managed the recovery and return of 7,000 server racks from data centres back into the supply chain.</p><p>To meet demand, it has six recovery facilities in Ireland, five in America, an operation in Thailand, a UK business, and offices in Dubai and China. Sheehan mentions shipping kit and components to and from Japan and \"looking at Rwanda\".</p><p>\"We're in 70 countries, either ourselves or with partners operating to our standards. It can be tricky when you're going into new territories. Things can change very quickly,\" he says.</p><p>From a farming family in Milford, a north Cork village near the Limerick border, Sheehan has none of the airs and graces of top techies. You imagine he could still hold his own on the farm.</p><p>\"I got a good start, a good upbringing.</p><p>From a young age you'd be milking cows and cleaning out, doing the hay - all that good stuff,\" he says.</p><p>Sheehan went to school locally and briefly boarded at St Munchin's College in Co Limerick. Not a fan of boarding, he swapped for the comprehensive school in Charleville, near home. \"I wouldn't be very academic, I'd be more practical. I'd be handy enough with my hands.\"</p><p>After school Sheehan was set to do a technician's course but had a motorbike crash the night before he was due to start. \"I hit a cow - it jumped out of a ditch and I flaked right into him.\"</p><p>He missed the course and still has scars on his face. Instead, he went to work at tech multinational Wang Laboratories, which was setting up in Limerick.</p><p>Aged 19, he was employee number 18 at Wang in Ireland. When he left eight years later, he was a production supervisor and Wang had nearly 700 workers in Limerick.</p><p>Keen to travel, Sheehan went to Australia, where he was employed by Wang, before working on buildings and getting into carpentry. He did 18 months in Melbourne and two years in Sydney, and has the distinction of having been captain of the Australian hurling team.</p><p>A brother was manager of the Milford senior hurlers and pressed him to come home to play in 1989. Sheehan says he intended to go back to Australia once the hurling was done. \"If I had, I'd still be there. It was that kind of decision.\"</p><p>At home he met Dick Lehane, a former executive at Wang who was setting up an Irish unit for data storage company EMC. He did an interview and joined EMC as its 15th employee in Cork.</p><p>Sheehan rose through the ranks to production manager, a role that included managing \"take-back\" programmes, which handled used storage kit that had come off lease to customers. The kit had to be disposed of, or used for parts.</p><p>\"It was classed as a nuisance at the time. The company was growing so quickly and we were constantly being moved around,\" he says.</p><p>Sheehan saw an opportunity for a stand-alone business that would manage the old equipment. In November 2007, he left EMC and set up Wisetek - with EMC as his first customer.</p><p>\"I left EMC at 2pm and was back in with them at 8am the following day as a service provider,\" he says. \"The opportunity was there. The timing was good because landfill was getting expensive and the green, sustainable agenda was coming to the fore.\"</p><p>The timing looked less than ideal a year later, however, when the global financial crisis hit and Ireland collapsed into recession. Sheehan had a start-up business and three young children, and was in the middle of a master's in operations management.</p><p>\"People thought I had a screw loose somewhere. But it was great to have a blue-chip like EMC behind us, and we really started to develop the concept of recycling, resale and reuse.\"</p><p>Sheehan says Wisetek differed from other businesses in the sector, which are mainly logistics companies \"with big scrapyards with mounds of stuff\". Coming from a manufacturing background, he adopted lean practices with a focus on minimising waste.</p><p>\"Our facilities look more like manufacturing facilities than scrapyards. If you know how something is put together at the front end, it's easier to unpick it at the back end,\" he says.</p><p>In 2011 Wisetek went overseas and opened an IT waste facility in a free trade zone at Laem Chabang in Thailand. Sheehan looked at China, Hong Kong and Singapore before settling on Thailand, with help from Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>\"We had 15 weeks from the get-go to the first truck arriving there,\" he recalls. \"In China, the registration alone takes six months. We can take in stuff in Laem Chabang, process it out there, and bring back only what we need to Europe.\"</p><p>The 35 staff in the Thai operation are all local, and Sheehan can largely manage the business by keeping track of key performance indicators. He visits about twice a year, though the coronavirus threat has nixed a planned trip.</p><p>\"I was supposed to go this month, but it will be next month or the month after. It's a very paper-driven society there, so every time I go, I spend half a day signing stuff. Thousands of signatures.\"</p><p>At the end of 2012, Wisetek opened its first American facility in Franklin, Massachusetts, near EMC's headquarters. On the back of the move, Sheehan's company won more US customers and data centre work.</p><p>\"Europe is far ahead of the States in electronics recycling. We could bring that experience to the US with us, which was a big plus,\" he says.</p><p>Wisetek aimed to grow organically in America, but things did not happen quickly enough for Sheehan. In November 2017, the company bought US firm Computer Discounters, which trades as DataKillers.</p><p>The Maryland company has a fleet of mobile shredding trucks that cover America and do on-the-spot destruction of iPads, desktop computers and laptops. Computer Discounters gave Wisetek about 55 additional staff and a customer base that included banks and gaming companies.</p><p>\"They were doing some shredding for us and we found out they were for sale,\" says Sheehan. \"Being Irish opens doors in the States, but you need an American beside you to close a deal.\"</p><p>The latest accounts for Wisetek show it paid (EURO)10.8m for Computer Discounters, including costs. Sheehan's firm has made provision for (EURO)4.4m in deferred payments on the deal.</p><p>At the time of the agreement, Wisetek forecast the combined company would have turnover of more than (EURO)50m in two years. It has blown through the forecast, with revenues reaching (EURO)63m in 2019, up from (EURO)35m the previous year.</p><p>\"We'll do close to (EURO)80m this year. We've seen a lot of growth, mainly in the US, and that will continue this year and into next year,\" says Sheehan.</p><p>Wisetek opened in Austin, Texas, to service a large deal with a big client, and added facilities in Sacramento, California, in 2018 to be near Silicon Valley. Last year it opened in Virginia and at Reading in England.</p><p>The company also has partnerships in South Korea and Dubai, where its local partner, Enviroserve, has the world's largest facility for electrical waste. The Dubai base sells older PCs into the region, while a China office sells components back into the manufacturing cycle.</p><p>Sheehan says the business has been helped by rising landfill costs and legislation on dealing with e-waste. The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union in 2018 means companies are more alert about disposing of data properly.</p><p>\"California has similar laws, and other US states are starting to legislate more,\" says Sheehan. \"A lot of Asia is still more concerned about price [of disposing of waste] but that is changing.\"</p><p>High-end data centres \"flip\" their equipment every two or three years, he explains, though there is a market to sell it on to secondary operators. \"We have returned $1bn [(EURO)920m] in financial value back to our customers,\" says Sheehan. \"It's the circular economy.\"</p><p>Wisetek invests in research and development and has built its own software to track materials through recovery and recycling. Customers can log into the Wisetek system and request a pick-up of materials worldwide. All jobs are tracked through the process.</p><p>Sheehan enthuses about a new system that involves plugging a cable into a PC to interrogate its data instantly. Another cable can wipe the PC. \"We've taken on a lot more engineers and software people. We're moving to the premiership, and we need to have the people for it.\"</p><p>One brother, Jim, is a director of Wisetek, based in Dubai. Another, Gerard, is a farmer who \"comes in and helps out\", says Sheehan.</p><p>Lehane, the former EMC senior vicepresident of worldwide manufacturing, is on the Wisetek board, as is former Bord Gais chief executive John Mullins. Jim O'Hara, former general manager of Intel Ireland, is Wisetek's chairman. \"They keep me on my toes,\" says Sheehan.</p><p>The Wisetek boss says his company will consider more \"strategic\" acquisitions to bulk up. About 50 million tons of e-waste is produced a year and only 20% is recycled, suggesting a big opportunity.</p><p>Sheehan says Wisetek has \"absolutely\" exceeded any expectations he had in 2007. Despite a \"few nibbles\" from prospective buyers, the \"scrap man\" has no interest in selling.</p><p>\"We're in a growth phase,\" he says. \"The market is huge and we have tapped only very little of it.\"</p><p>One ton of printed circuit boards has as much gold as 17 tons of gold ore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sheehan sees big opportunities as only 20% of the planet's 50 million tons of e-waste is recycled a year.

Set up in 2007 to handle used IT kit for big tech firms, the company has grown into a sophisticated global recycling business with 450 staff and annual revenues approaching (EURO)80m.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The appetite for information is growing, so e-waste is growing,\" says Sheehan, tapping his smartphone. \"We cover the whole spectrum, from iPads and laptops right up to data centres.\"</p><p>Wisetek's customers include hardware maker Dell, the Walt Disney Company, optical tech giant Olympus and the cyber-security group Forcepoint. Others are under wraps but include household-name internet and leisure companies.</p><p>The \"end of life\" IT equipment is not all scrap. Wisetek has a \"zero landfill\" policy, so computers and electronic kit are wiped and sold on intact, broken into components, or recycled - including recovering precious metals.</p><p>\"One ton of printed circuit boards has the equivalent amount of gold as 17 tons of gold ore,\" says Sheehan. \"There are seven or eight grades of metals [in a circuit board], but you have to find reputable smelters because it's the most toxic area of e-waste.\"</p><p>Last year Wisetek erased and destroyed 11m disk drives - a 30% increase on 2018. The company handles 265,000 laptops and desktop computers a year and has managed the recovery and return of 7,000 server racks from data centres back into the supply chain.</p><p>To meet demand, it has six recovery facilities in Ireland, five in America, an operation in Thailand, a UK business, and offices in Dubai and China. Sheehan mentions shipping kit and components to and from Japan and \"looking at Rwanda\".</p><p>\"We're in 70 countries, either ourselves or with partners operating to our standards. It can be tricky when you're going into new territories. Things can change very quickly,\" he says.</p><p>From a farming family in Milford, a north Cork village near the Limerick border, Sheehan has none of the airs and graces of top techies. You imagine he could still hold his own on the farm.</p><p>\"I got a good start, a good upbringing. From a young age you'd be milking cows and cleaning out, doing the hay - all that good stuff,\" he says.</p><p>Sheehan went to school locally and briefly boarded at St Munchin's College in Co Limerick. Not a fan of boarding, he swapped for the comprehensive school in Charleville, near home. \"I wouldn't be very academic, I'd be more practical. I'd be handy enough with my hands.\"</p><p>After school Sheehan was set to do a technician's course but had a motorbike crash the night before he was due to start. \"I hit a cow - it jumped out of a ditch and I flaked right into him.\"</p><p>He missed the course and still has scars on his face. Instead, he went to work at tech multinational Wang Laboratories, which was setting up in Limerick.</p><p>Aged 19, he was employee number 18 at Wang in Ireland. When he left eight years later, he was a production supervisor and Wang had nearly 700 workers in Limerick.</p><p>Keen to travel, Sheehan went to Australia, where he was employed by Wang, before working on buildings and getting into carpentry. He did 18 months in Melbourne and two years in Sydney, and has the distinction of having been captain of the Australian hurling team.</p><p>A brother was manager of the Milford senior hurlers and pressed him to come home to play in 1989. Sheehan says he intended to go back to Australia once the hurling was done. \"If I had, I'd still be there. It was that kind of decision.\"</p><p>At home he met Dick Lehane, a former executive at Wang who was setting up an Irish unit for data storage company EMC. He did an interview and joined EMC as its 15th employee in Cork.</p><p>Sheehan rose through the ranks to production manager, a role that included managing \"take-back\" programmes, which handled used storage kit that had come off lease to customers. The kit had to be disposed of, or used for parts.</p><p>\"It was classed as a nuisance at the time. The company was growing so quickly and we were constantly being moved around,\" he says.</p><p>Sheehan saw an opportunity for a stand-alone business that would manage the old equipment. In November 2007, he left EMC and set up Wisetek - with EMC as his first customer.</p><p>\"I left EMC at 2pm and was back in with them at 8am the following day as a service provider,\" he says. \"The opportunity was there. The timing was good because landfill was getting expensive and the green, sustainable agenda was coming to the fore.\"</p><p>The timing looked less than ideal a year later, however, when the global financial crisis hit and Ireland collapsed into recession. Sheehan had a start-up business and three young children, and was in the middle of a master's in operations management.</p><p>\"People thought I had a screw loose somewhere. But it was great to have a blue-chip like EMC behind us, and we really started to develop the concept of recycling, resale and reuse.\"</p><p>Sheehan says Wisetek differed from other businesses in the sector, which are mainly logistics companies \"with big scrapyards with mounds of stuff\". Coming from a manufacturing background, he adopted lean practices with a focus on minimising waste.</p><p>\"Our facilities look more like manufacturing facilities than scrapyards. If you know how something is put together at the front end, it's easier to unpick it at the back end,\" he says.</p><p>In 2011 Wisetek went overseas and opened an IT waste facility in a free trade zone at Laem Chabang in Thailand. Sheehan looked at China, Hong Kong and Singapore before settling on Thailand, with help from Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>\"We had 15 weeks from the get-go to the first truck arriving there,\" he recalls. \"In China, the registration alone takes six months. We can take in stuff in Laem Chabang, process it out there, and bring back only what we need to Europe.\"</p><p>The 35 staff in the Thai operation are all local, and Sheehan can largely manage the business by keeping track of key performance indicators. He visits about twice a year, though the coronavirus threat has nixed a planned trip.</p><p>\"I was supposed to go this month, but it will be next month or the month after. It's a very paper-driven society there, so every time I go, I spend half a day signing stuff. Thousands of signatures.\"</p><p>At the end of 2012, Wisetek opened its first American facility in Franklin, Massachusetts, near EMC's headquarters. On the back of the move, Sheehan's company won more US customers and data centre work.</p><p>\"Europe is far ahead of the States in electronics recycling. We could bring that experience to the US with us, which was a big plus,\" he says.</p><p>Wisetek aimed to grow organically in America, but things did not happen quickly enough for Sheehan. In November 2017, the company bought US firm Computer Discounters, which trades as DataKillers.</p><p>The Maryland company has a fleet of mobile shredding trucks that cover America and do on-the-spot destruction of iPads, desktop computers and laptops. Computer Discounters gave Wisetek about 55 additional staff and a customer base that included banks and gaming companies.</p><p>\"They were doing some shredding for us and we found out they were for sale,\" says Sheehan. \"Being Irish opens doors in the States, but you need an American beside you to close a deal.\"</p><p>The latest accounts for Wisetek show it paid (EURO)10.8m for Computer Discounters, including costs. Sheehan's firm has made provision for (EURO)4.4m in deferred payments on the deal.</p><p>At the time of the agreement, Wisetek forecast the combined company would have turnover of more than (EURO)50m in two years. It has blown through the forecast, with revenues reaching (EURO)63m in 2019, up from (EURO)35m the previous year.</p><p>\"We'll do close to (EURO)80m this year. We've seen a lot of growth, mainly in the US, and that will continue this year and into next year,\" says Sheehan.</p><p>Wisetek opened in Austin, Texas, to service a large deal with a big client, and added facilities in Sacramento, California, in 2018 to be near Silicon Valley. Last year it opened in Virginia and at Reading in England.</p><p>The company also has partnerships in South Korea and Dubai, where its local partner, Enviroserve, has the world's largest facility for electrical waste. The Dubai base sells older PCs into the region, while a China office sells components back into the manufacturing cycle.</p><p>Sheehan says the business has been helped by rising landfill costs and legislation on dealing with e-waste. The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union in 2018 means companies are more alert about disposing of data properly.</p><p>\"California has similar laws, and other US states are starting to legislate more,\" says Sheehan. \"A lot of Asia is still more concerned about price [of disposing of waste] but that is changing.\"</p><p>High-end data centres \"flip\" their equipment every two or three years, he explains, though there is a market to sell it on to secondary operators. \"We have returned $1bn [(EURO)920m] in financial value back to our customers,\" says Sheehan. \"It's the circular economy.\"</p><p>Wisetek invests in research and development and has built its own software to track materials through recovery and recycling. Customers can log into the Wisetek system and request a pick-up of materials worldwide. All jobs are tracked through the process.</p><p>Sheehan enthuses about a new system that involves plugging a cable into a PC to interrogate its data instantly. Another cable can wipe the PC. \"We've taken on a lot more engineers and software people. We're moving to the premiership, and we need to have the people for it.\"</p><p>One brother, Jim, is a director of Wisetek, based in Dubai. Another, Gerard, is a farmer who \"comes in and helps out\", says Sheehan.</p><p>Lehane, the former EMC senior vice-president of worldwide manufacturing, is on the Wisetek board, as is former Bord Gais chief executive John Mullins. Jim O'Hara, former general manager of Intel Ireland, is Wisetek's chairman. \"They keep me on my toes,\" says Sheehan.</p><p>The Wisetek boss says his company will consider more \"strategic\" acquisitions to bulk up. About 50 million tons of e-waste is produced a year and only 20% is recycled, suggesting a big opportunity.</p><p>Sheehan says Wisetek has \"absolutely\" exceeded any expectations he had in 2007. Despite a \"few nibbles\" from prospective buyers, the \"scrap man\" has no interest in selling.</p><p>\"We're in a growth phase,\" he says. \"The market is huge and we have tapped only very little of it.\"</p><p>                   The life of Sean Sheehan                   VITAL STATISTICS                   Age:                   </p><p> 59</p><p>                   Home:                    </p><p>Passage West, Cork </p><p>                   Family:                    </p><p>married with three children: a son and two daughters</p><p>                   Education:                    </p><p>postgraduate diploma in international selling and master's in operational management from Middlesex University</p><p>                   Favourite book:                   </p><p> Winning, by Jack Welch, former boss of General Electric</p><p>                   Favourite film:                    The Shawshank Redemption                   WORKING DAY                    </p><p>I get up at 6.30am, drop our two girls off at school, and I'm in the office by 8am.

Today, parents fret about how much time their children spend on social media  But is screen time as harmful as the fearmongers would have us believe?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You'll get square eyes!\" my mother used to say as I sat for hour after hour glued to the television. I ignored her, of course. It was just something parents said. Fast-forward a few decades and now I'm the parent. My five-year-old lives in a world where screens aren't fixed pieces of furniture, but lie around on the kitchen table, on the sofa, by the bed, constantly accessible. You can't even avoid them by going outside. \"Screens are not only in our pockets, they're on billboards, buses and bins,\" says Tim Smith, a psychologist at Birkbeck, University of London. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The concerns have multiplied with the screens. In the past decade, we have heard that they will rewire our brains, strip us of cognitive abilities and damage our mental health. Many of us feel more distracted by them, feeling grumpier, guiltier and more tired as a result. The list of ills makes square eyes sound benign. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So should we take these concerns more seriously? Given the amount of time so many of us spend with our lit-up devices, it is an important question. </p><p>The trouble is, many of the most emphatic answers are the least reliable. Smartphones and tablets are not only TVs, they are chat rooms, shopfronts, banks and photo albums. We use them to work and play, to record physical activity and monitor sleep. We can look up peer-reviewed papers or scroll through anti-vaxxing forums, crucial distinctions that disappear when we use the umbrella term \"screen time\". As fears grow and the debate becomes ever more heated, it's time to separate the proven health advice from the hyperbole. </p><p>Smartphone pinky, <url normalizedValue=\"https://multimedia.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/2183329/text-neck/index.html\">tech neck</url>, bone spurs at the back of our skulls: the ailments we are meant to have inflicted on ourselves through excessive phone use all sound terrifying. Hence the headlines. In truth, there is no good evidence that such alarming conditions are caused by tech habits. </p><p>Any harm is likely to be far less spectacular. The World Health Organisation, for example, recommends limiting screen time as a way of tackling obesity, voicing no health concerns related to screens in particular. </p><p>What about the effect of staring at small, bright screens on our eyesight? In the past few years, more children in Britain have been prescribed glasses, says Max Davie, an officer for health improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, in London. This has led some to claim that phones and tablets are to blame. But Davie thinks the increase in prescriptions has more to do with aggressive management of existing conditions. \"At the moment, we don't have sufficient evidence for a causal link,\" he says. </p><p>One thing that does appear to be taking a hit is sleep. Studies have shown that people who are given a book to read in bed find it harder to go to sleep if they read it on a screen rather than on paper. This is probably because of the blue light that most screens emit, which throws off our circadian rhythm and tricks us into thinking it is daytime. </p><p>Of course, most of us who look at our phones last thing at night aren't reading a book. Much sleep disruption is related to mental stimulation: waiting for the next noti\u00adfication, say, or scrolling through endless news feeds. Insufficient or disrupted sleep has been linked to increased risk for all manner of health problems, including depres\u00adsion and other mental health concerns. </p><p>\"If there are any recommendations to be adopted, not using screens in the hour before bed seems to be the one with the greatest support,\" says Smith. </p><p>From video games to gambling, the apps and websites we can access on our phones have sparked widespread concern. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech\">Big tech</url> companies are adept at tapping into our need for social validation, hooking us on likes, retweets and follower counts. In testimony to a United States Senate hearing in June, Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Centre for Humane Technology, argued that the internet has created a culture of mass narcissism. </p><p>This has led many to worry about the emotional stresses of a hyper-social world on adolescents. A quick online search brings up dozens of papers linking screen use or social media with detrimental effects on mental health, including depression, anorexia and suicide. Some figures suggest girls are more affected. </p><p>\"After two decades in decline, the mental health [problems] of 10- to 14-year-old girls have shot up 170 per cent in the last eight years,\" Harris said in his testimony. </p><p>Such sound bites are alarming. They are also widely believed, thanks to popular books such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">iGen</emphasis> (2017), by Jean Twenge, a psychologist at San Diego State Univer\u00adsity, which claims that digital technology has wrecked a gen\u00aderation. The trouble is that the underlying data can be used to tell different stories, says Amy Orben, at Oxford University (now a research fellow at Cambridge Univer\u00adsity), who studies the effects of digital technology - and social media in particular - on mental health. </p><p>Ultimately, social media is just one of many things that might affect someone's well-being. Without controlled studies, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. </p><p>When Orben started looking into screen use a few years ago, she wanted to explore some of the more extreme claims researchers were making. For example, Twenge has linked social-media use with teenage depression and suicide. Orben was curious to look at the evidence herself. She found it didn't stack up. First, she spotted short\u00adcomings in several large studies from 2017 that claimed to reveal correlations between the use of devices with screens and depressive symptoms in users. </p><p>\"I found that changing how the data was analysed would give me very different results,\" says Orben. </p><p>To put her and her colleagues' results in perspective, they compared the effect of device use to other things in an adolescent's life. For instance, they looked at the effect of wearing glasses and found that this was correlated more negatively with well-being than screen use. They also looked at how often adolescents ate potatoes. \"Potatoes are in a similar ballpark to screens,\" says Orben. That doesn't mean they should be banned from schools. </p><p>Twenge stands by her findings, pointing in turn to what she considers flaws in Orben's statistical methods. For Davie and others, however, the effect of screen time and social-media use on mental health remains speculative. \"We cannot regard social media overall as good or bad,\" says Davie. He believes Orben has done fantastic work in myth-busting, but warns against applying blanket state\u00adments to individuals. He says he would never tell bereaved parents that an Instagram post about self-harm played no part in the death of their child, for example. \"We don't know that in individual cases social media is not responsible,\" he says. </p><p>Unless you are using it for purposes we already know are addictive, such as accessing gambling websites, the answer is probably not. Yet reaching for my phone has become an annoying tic and a phantom buzz in my pocket can make me pull it out and check for messages that aren't there. Whenever there is a lull in my concentration - in the middle of writing this sentence, for example - my thoughts return to my phone. What's going on? </p><p>In front of the US Senate, Harris painted a damning picture of the methods that tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter use to command our attention in what he described as a \"race to the bottom of your brainstem\". He called out design tricks such as pulling down on the screen to refresh it, which shares character\u00adistics with the mechanism of slot machines. \"It has the same kind of addictive qualities that keep people in Las Vegas hooked,\" he said. </p><p>We are also in thrall to the recommendation algorithms that know what we want better than we do. More than 70 per cent of viewing time on YouTube consists of people watching videos suggested by the platform rather than sought out deliberately. </p><p>\"You sit down to watch one video and wake up two hours later and say, 'Oh my god, what just happened?'\" said Harris. \"The answer is that you had a supercomputer pointed at your brain.\" </p><p>All this means we are often sucked into our phones, thoughts elsewhere, even when we have more immediate things to focus on - such as crossing a road. The risks have led authorities in a handful of towns, including Augsburg, in Germany, to install traffic lights on the ground in the hope that distracted pedestrians won't step in front of a bus. </p><p>Although the increased risk of distraction is very real, talk of addiction may be too simplistic. \"I think we need to be very careful about the use of the word 'addiction',\" says Davie. \"Addiction has a specific meaning of compulsive use, requiring increasing doses and a damaging effect on your life. But there are a lot of people who spend eight hours a day playing games and that's just how they like to spend their time. It's OK as long as it's not interfering with the rest of your life.\" You aren't addicted, but you may have a terrible habit. </p><p>This is where I struggle most. Not only do I get distracted by my phone when I should be paying attention to my daughter - \"Dad. Dad. Dad!\" - but I use screens to distract her all the time. When I need to cook, when I need to make a work call, when I'm feeling tired, I just stick her in front of a screen. Is this a problem? It all depends who you ask and how old your child is. There are no guidelines for teenagers, for example, and even the advice for younger children is far from clear. </p><p>The American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) dis\u00adcourages parents from allowing children under two to have any interaction with screens and recommends no more than an hour a day for two- to five-year-olds. The WHO says children under three should have no screen time and those aged three to four should be limited to an hour a day, but its focus once more is on curbing childhood obesity. </p><p>The British government largely follows the AAP's guide\u00adlines. But the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has opted not to recommend time limits at all. \"There's general confusion,\" says Smith. </p><p>He thinks the college's approach is the most logical. It bases its position on a regular review of research and has concluded that there isn't enough evidence of positive or negative effects for any guidelines to be issued. \"That's a very honest way of creating evidence-based policy,\" says Smith. </p><p>The college's view is that advice is only as good as it is effective. \"People's support for an outright ban on screen time for children under two lasts until they spend a day where there are children of different ages in the same room,\" says Davie. \"Then they quickly realise it's unwork\u00adable.\" He thinks guidelines that are hard to comply with fail to help families establish good habits and are ignored. </p><p>It isn't all negative. In 2016, Smith and his colleagues found no evidence that spending time interacting with a screen - rather than moving around or interacting with other humans - delayed certain developmental milestones, such as learning to walk and talk. On the contrary, they found a correlation between screen use and earlier develop\u00adment of fine motor skills, such as the ability to pick up blocks and stack them in a tower. </p><p>Once again, there is no causal link. It could be that those infants who happen to develop fine motor skills early are simply more likely to pick up and play with a screen. It is possible, though, that the prodding and swiping needed to work a screen trains these skills. </p><p>We shouldn't underestimate the value of screen use for older children, too. Not only do screens provide unpreceden\u00adted access to many forms of valuable information and enter\u00adtainment, but educating children about the dangers they will find online requires them to have some familiarity with it. \"To think critically, kids need to engage,\" says Smith. </p><p>The explosion of mobile-phone use has revolutionised our lives. I can download films and podcasts, write articles, communicate with my family and broadcast to the world all at the push of a button. This is unprecedented power, but there are still many important questions about these maddening, valuable devices that we have been unable to answer. What is clear, however, is that many initial reactions have been more knee-jerk than evidence-based. </p><p>Rather than impose arbitrary constraints, we should take a look at our use of screens and ask how they fit with the activities and lifestyles we want as individuals and families. Orben, who is 24, has grown up with social media. For her and her peers, managing how they spend time with their screens was part of growing up. </p><p>\"Like any social-media user, there are times when I feel I should use it less, that I need to feel in control,\" she says. \"We all have ways in which we try to self-regulate.\" </p><p>Maybe you tweak your phone's settings to reduce the number of alerts you get, or uninstall certain apps so they aren't readily available. Some have suggested introducing \"mental speed bumps\" that interrupt the habit of checking a phone too often, such as writing a note to yourself on your lock screen or simply wrapping a rubber band around the device as a reminder. </p><p>Apple and Android phones and tablets now come with widgets that let you monitor and manage screen use. You can set time limits, turn off notifications and track what you have been doing on the device. There are also \"night-time\" settings that cut the blue light emitted by the screen and a \"wind-down\" mode designed to make the screen less enticing by turning it black and white. </p><p>These all help us become more conscious of our usage. But Apple and Google could do more, says Smith. \"It's a little bit of a misdirection,\" he says. For one thing, these widgets don't allow you to explore your screen use for periods of more than a week, which you might want to do to see if any lifestyle changes are making a difference. </p><p>Every new technology with widespread impact has given rise to new fears. Orben recalls an article from 1941 that lamented how adolescents in the US were addicted to radio programmes. </p><p>\"In a lot of parenting magazines from that time, you could just replace the word 'radio' with 'social media' and you could probably publish that today,\" she says. </p><p>So the best bet may simply be to ask yourself what level of screen use makes you and those around you happy and try to stick to it. If you find yourself overindulging, don't panic - and certainly don't feel guilty. Nobody knows anything worth getting scared about. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Text: New Scientist</emphasis></p><p>Copyright (c) 2019. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.
