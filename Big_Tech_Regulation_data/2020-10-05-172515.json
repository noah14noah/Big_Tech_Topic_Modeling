Good Tuesday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Happy Tuesday.  It is Tuesday, February 6th.  Your top stories  right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Breaking news this morning the  global sell-off is continuing, futures are indicating a decline at the  start of trading this morning of 182 points as three-quarters of 1 percent.   And I should point out that that is off of the lows this morning.  The  NASDAQ is down 15 and the S&amp;P is down six, this comes of course after  stocks tumbled yesterday with the Dow posting the largest single-day point  decline ever closing down nearly 1,200 points on the day that wasn't the  low.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 wiped out the year's gains with yesterday's  performance alone.  The declines sending shockwaves across the world  overnight and this morning.  </p><p>First overnight take a look at Asia overnight, markets tip a nose-dive the  worst performers were Japan and Hong Kong with the Hang Seng index down  better than five percent and the Nikkei average in Japan down four and  three-quarters percent.  And then there's Europe, markets are open right  now and they are trading down.  You got steep declines across the board in  Europe, the FT 100 down 1.8 percent as you can see the market there hitting  the lowest level in over a year.  The CAC Quarante is down 2-2/3 percent  and the DAX Index down 2-1/4 percent.  The turmoil coming as investors are  watching earnings this morning from some big names.  </p><p>General Motors reported earnings and revenue that were above expectations  for the fourth quarter.  G.M. stock is up 1-1/2 percent, we're also  watching Disney because the Walt Disney company is going to be reporting  its fourth quarter after the close tonight.  We're also watching shares of  I'm sorry Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin is down.  The cryptocurrency fell  below $6,000 in earlier trading.  It is now down half of its value since  just the beginning of the year.  All those stories coming up this morning  and joining me to break it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  the Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath and  Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly.  Rough day at the office.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY &amp; COMPANY:  Yes, it's very interesting  though that, you know, stock are declining and G.M. is beating earnings.  I  kind of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's sort of the story.  It's the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I'll tell you why G.M.  is beating because they sold 20 percent more of their Chevy Equinox as well  as their Chevy Traverses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The SUV?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The SUVs.  They're higher margin products.  So, for example,  the Chevy Equinox, they sold 20 percent more.  The average selling price  was $3,000 more than the previous year's version.  But, you know, when you  look at the markets and we're off the lows right and VIX's hit above VIX  uncertainty indicator and last time it hit 50 was in August of 2015.  And  then the market rebounded from there, so this is really a capitulation and  the bottom could be starting to come in as we started to flesh out some of  the weaker hands in --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you see a bottom?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think -- well there is a couple -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the horizon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  So I see a bottom one because when VIX hits 50 or above  at those extreme levels then it comes down the market rises back up, right?   So the stream uncertainty has hit and then it is over.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  The markets are more stable  than they were last night.  The Dow futures at one point were down 750  points and overnight trading but we still have not seen these market gages  hit correction territory.  The closest would be the Dow transports are down  nine percent from the recent record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  is down eight and a half percent.  So watch for on the Dow 23,955 and  change that would be a 10 percent correction from the recent record.   </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great info, Dagen.  We want to get to this market here because  the Dow posted the largest ever single-day point decline in history  yesterday.  But we have been putting it in context this morning basically  saying, yes, four percent is not in the top in terms of the decline, so on  a point basis yes it was a terrible day but not so when you look at the  overall.  President Trump, of course, has touted tax reform and economic  growth for the last year and a half and he was in Ohio yesterday doing the  same -- Blake Burman is at the White House right now with the  administration's reaction to the stock market sell-off.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to  you.  You are right.  The White House has been touting the stock market at  success at almost a daily clip here but yesterday once this rout settled,  they tried to hit the pause button for a second and instead take a look at  the longer-term picture.  The White House Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders  putting out a statement which said the following, ''The President's focus  is on our long-term economic fundamentals which remain exceptionally strong  with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment and  increasing wages for American workers.  The President's tax cuts and  regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. Economy and continue to  increase prosperity for the American people.''  The Vice President who has  just landed in South Korea when he was in route yesterday was asked about  this and he said the market drop was due to the ebbs and flows of the  market.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The most important  numbers to focus on are the fundamentals.  The fundamentals of this economy  continue to be very strong.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now the Dow precipitous drop came as President Trump was in Ohio  touting tax reform.  This is an event that The President would normally  talk about the stock market successes but yesterday he did not mention the  volatility.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Factoring are coming back,  everything is coming back they all want to be where the action is.  America  is once again open for business.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Maria, as we saw yesterday The White House is planning still on  putting The President out on the road touring this new tax code, new tax  bill but yesterday's event could not have come at a worse time  realistically for this president because it was one of the rare times that  when The President was out there giving a big speech instead the cameras  were turning elsewhere as the market was dipping into the red.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  It's tough day for sure.  Blake, thank you so much.   Blake Burman joining us right now.  A Member of the House Appropriations  Committee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann of Tennessee.  Congressman, good to  see you this morning.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Good morning.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you see in terms of this market sell-off?  What are the  implications here from your standpoint?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well obviously I think we've seen unprecedented highs in the  stock market, the economy is doing well, unemployment is low.  People have  more money in their pockets because of the tax cuts.  I have never seen  fundamentals look so good in a long time.  Now we have to be cognizant that  the stock market is a market and there is speculation, people invest and  then like I think one of the things with the economy doing so well across  the board is some people may look for other places to put their money in  addition to the stock market.  So I think we need to be positive, I think  we need to work together.  And I think as legislators we need to provide a  very conducive environment for business to continue to do well I think  we're doing that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess what I was asking is, you know, Alan Greenspan, Jon,  you know this used to talk about the wealth effect.  And this market is up  $8 trillion since the election.  Well now obviously 4-1/2 trillion since  the election but that was a factor.  Are there implications in terms of  economic growth as a result of the sell-off?  That is my question.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think as long as market settles down and it looks like it  will then that will -- their wealth effect is still in there because we're  still talking about net gains for most people on their 401(k) plans.  And  we're still talking about companies net, seeing their share prices up and  being more optimistic about investing and spending money.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and also 90 percent of workers in this country this month  saying higher wages because of tax cuts so it's not just the stock market  but it's also -- they have real cash on hand because of what Congress has  done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it is great, Congressman I mean you did a good job on  the tax plan.  We're waiting to see the implications of it because we know  that people have more money in their pockets but you've got another issue  on your hands with this short-term measuring to fund the government.   Through March 23rd I've heard another shutdown while funding the defense  department for a full year?  I mean how can you -- how can you -- how do  you justify living from you know one resolution to the next?  One  continuing resolution to the next?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, as a house appropriator as you know last year we passed  all 12 house appropriation bills.  We did our job and we want to get back  to what we could locally call regular order.  In other words, the House and  the Senate appropriations committee is doing job passing budgets and  getting it down.  Unfortunately, we are in an environment largely due to  the Senate rules where they need 60 to get something done, we saw Schumer  shutdown which I thought was detrimental.  It was short thank goodness but  it's not easy to get things done right now in Washington, D.C.  So we just  have to continue to work hard.  On part of the House Republicans and house  appropriator such as myself we're doing our job, we're going to do it again  this year and we're just going to stay at it and we just hope that other  people who serve are the legislators in both parties and both bodies do  their job.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Congressman, two questions for you.  First of all on the  budget, well, how is this year pass a budget resolution and the budget.   Second of all one of the reasons the stock market is falling now is because  long-term interest rates are going up, one of the reasons long-term  interest rates are going up it seems is that we're looking at budget  deficits that are going to exceed a trillion dollars in another year or  two.  What are Republicans in Congress going to do about a trillion-dollar  budget deficits? </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, I think fundamentally we need to look long-term at  mandatory spending issues, we're seeing the effects, the ill effects of the  budget control act which is really squeezed, discretionary spending hurt  defense and hurt other domestic spending.  But the real problem is that we  have seen the dollars available on discretionary side of the budget  equation continue to shrink and that is going to happen unless we address  this in a larger sense.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So what are you going to do to address it?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, I think we need to have everyone from the  administration, the Senate, the House Republicans and Democrats actually  look to fiscal reform.  I think a balanced budget amendment which actually  I had the privilege of voting for would be a step in the right direction.   Let's face it, I come from a state -- the great state of Tennessee that has  a constitutional amendment in a state constitution to balance its budget.   We have no debt in Tennessee, if you look at some other states don't have  that in their constitutions, they are never going to get out of red I  think.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  How would you balance it what would you cut?  You just said  you don't want to cut discretionary spending so what would you cut?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, we have to reform I'd rather use the term reform when  we look at the whole picture, we have to see where we're spending our  dollars that is on the mandatory side of the equation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, talk about interest on the national debt.  We're  talking about interest rates, pressure on interest rates to go up and I do  think you'll see interest rates go up.  When you were borrowing -- when  you're $20 trillion in debt, if you are a borrow and interest rates go up  that is not good, that is not good if you are an individual borrower, that  is not good if a country that is borrowing and let's face it we are at a  time where other countries like China are buying up our national debt.   That is not good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a point you have made umpteen times, Dagen in terms of  the interest.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but in Congress, what do you do to control the actual  interest rate that's paid on the debt?  That is -- that is a market unless  you are -- unless you are telegraphing to the Federal Reserve that you want  the Federal Reserve to -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And that is rising now because debt is going up so much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It -- the -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, the cost of debt that's actually selling off -- the  price -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the cost of debt, that is right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The interest on the national debt in a few years is going to  surpass what we spend on defense every year.  Just that 80 percent of the  growth in spending is entitlements and the interest on the debt in the --  over the next decade.  So to that point when is anybody going to have the  gumption to step up and say OK it is time to get our arms around  entitlements?  And really you are going to have to -- at some point cut  what people receive from the federal government in terms of Social  Security, Medicare and Medicaid and Republicans couldn't do it with just  Medicaid last year.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I'd rather again use the term reform, we never want the scare  our senior's people 55 and over will be safe and they ought to be safe.   But we got to look at the long-term prospects for our country.  Also, the  numbers are not good, we have baby boomers, people my age and older who are  going on through the Social Security and Medicare every day.  We need to be  protected, we don't need to engage in a game political scare.  Right now we  are in a very -- most of its time politically, a game of one-upsmanship.   So we need to sit down come up with good ideas, we should have done this on  healthcare, Obamacare was a budget buster because most of that spending was  where?  On the mandatory side of the spending equation.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It doesn't sound like -- it doesn't like you want to go there  on Social Security and Medicare and like that, something you want to talk  about actually reforming or cutting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or after their midterm elections probably.  You are going to  cut -- are you going to cut these mandatory things during in an election  year?  I don't think so -- </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When is it -- when is it volatile politically?  Because you guys  are up -- right, you guys are up from re-election every two years.  So it  is -- it is always -- there is always that hot potato, that football if you  will.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, let's look at things that we can all agree on.  If we  have growth and I think we are going to have growth from this tax cut,  we're going to see the economy grow.  So that's going to be good for  everyone.  Employers hiring, unemployment is at an all-time low, we are  going to see people with more money if people who have jobs and are  spending we are going to see a healthier economy and things will go better  that way.  So you will have more dollars actually feeding those kiddies  that need to be fed.  If people are unemployed and we have gone through the  great recession that we did, starting in 2008 and they're not feeding these  programs in terms -- with the revenue, there is going to be a problem.  So  growth is going to be a key term factor in this as well as spending reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So growth is the priority right now we got it.   Congressman, it's good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN  Great to be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chuck Fleischmann, joining us.  We will be right back.  Stay  with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are selling off this morning once again.   We are seeing a continuation of that global meltdown yesterday.  Dow  Industrials down 220 points right now.  And futures were expecting they  said a tough opening for the stock market.  General Motors is out with its  latest quarterly earnings this morning meanwhile.  That stock is actually  up even though we're seeing the rest of the market trade down.  Lauren  Simonetti with the details there.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Maria.  Let's first  take a look how G.M. shares or trading right now in premarket trading after  the company reported better than expected quarterly results on an adjusted  basis, $40.02 of share, that's a gain of 48 cents.  G.M. did take its  charge who does a tax reform $7.3 billion in the quarter.  But they have a  record operating profit.  Thanks to big demand for their profitable pickup  trucks and SUVs.  Vehicle sales did rise about one percent from a year ago  to almost nine million vehicles sold in a quarter.  We're going to get  results from Dow component, Walt Disney after the close today.  Analysts  they're looking for earnings for share at about four percent from a year  ago, the result expected to get a lift from Thor: Ragnarok and from Star  Wars.  </p><p>Investors going to pay close attention to anything the company says about  ESPN, ESPN plus order other streaming services.  Shares a Disney down $1.95  in the premarket right now.  Well, how low will they go?  Bitcoin was  plummeting, briefly below $6,000 earlier this morning but then it actually  turned positive.  So we continue to watch the price of Bitcoin obviously  down sharply from 20,000 back in December.  Bitcoin has lost more than half  of its value this year, there's the chart.  This latest selling comes on  report of potential price manipulation and hacker activity and lawmakers  will explore regulatory oversight for virtual currencies in general at a  hearing later this morning.  </p><p>Let's move on to our final story which has to do with oil prices, they're  dropping for a third day.  Light sweet crude now at $63.00 a barrel,  experts say the global market sell-off actually strengthens the dollar and  arising U.S. dollar makes commodities more expensive for foreign buyers.   Oil still positive in 2018, taking a look at shares of ExxonMobil, shares  of Chevron, both of them are lower in premarket trading.  </p><p>And Vice President Mike Pence in Japan today.  On his way to the Olympics  in South Korea and he's delivering a tough message for North Korea.   Pence's says he doesn't want North Korea to hijack the games because it's  participating on a joint team with South Korea.  The Vice President is  bringing the father of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who was  imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months died last June.  Pence also  visiting a memorial to the 46th South Korean sailors killed in a 2010  torpedo attack which was attributed to the North Korea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Lauren.  We want to take a break  real quick and look at futures as we go to the break.  Take a look at this  performance after Monday's 1,100 points sell-off in the Dow.  We're  expecting the Dow to open down almost 300 points this morning better than  one percent.  The S&amp;P is down three-quarters of a percent as the NASDAQ  right now.  Plus Mark Cuban speaking out on a stock market fly.  Well, the  billionaire entrepreneur says he's not worried about the Dow plunge  yesterday.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The sell-off in stocks continues this morning  after yesterday's historic market plunge, futures are indicating another  rough beginning for this market today.  Dow Industrials down better than  300 points right, that's 1-1/4 percent.  Of course, the Dow suffered its  biggest ever one-day point decline yesterday falling nearly 1200 points at  the close.  Joining us right now is Nancy Tengler, she is Heartland  Financial Chief Investment Officer, she's also the author of The Women's  Guide to Successful Investing.  Nancy, good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>NANCY TENGLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HEARTLAND FINANCIAL:  Thanks,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, your take on the sell-off, what would you be doing  today, what are you telling clients?</p><p>TENGLER:  We are actually buying, we have taken about five percent out of  stocks and bonds on January 2nd, put in non-correlated assets and today  we'll be enabling away at large-cap, big names, you know, some of the  pharma, some of the Industrials  that have -- that didn't --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Why isn't that today the day to buy?</p><p>TENGLER:  Well, we like -- we called -- I mean, I hate to say this because  I'm not a market timer but we had called for a market timer but we had  called for a market correction in July, way too early, we just thought we  were way ahead of ourselves.  I thought the market would sell off in  January, I didn't.  And so now this is the opportunity we have been looking  for.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It went up so much since then, why wouldn't it keep going down  if we thought it was overvalued in July, isn't it still valued today?  </p><p>TENGLER:  I mean, the fundamentals are super strong.  We got earnings  revisions from 11 percent this year up to 17.9.  The market P.E. on an  estimated basis is now at 17 times next year's earnings, if you look at the  10-year it's come down so that's helpful.  And we just think the  fundamentals are very strong and we want to be owners here.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, I think if you -- there's the old market ad, right? You take  the stairs up the elevator down when it comes to the market so when we see  a big fall like this, this gives opportunity to get into a market that's  trading at 17 times earnings but we're seeing earnings grow at 20 percent  and especially with the dollar coming down.  Do you think the dollar is  going to be a big tailwind going into the second half of the year to help a  lot of these corporations because everyone is talking about one time taxes,  you know and we're seeing, you know, that's going to push for the first half  but what's the second half of the story? </p><p>TENGLER:  Yes.  That's a difficult one to measure.  I mean, we've been  beneficiaries of and have written quite a bit about the dollar.  Does it  stay here?  I mean, with cash -- if I'm a CFO, I want the repatriate my  crash at these levels, right?  So, if that happens and we see foreign  investors looking at our yields, I think that becomes a compelling story  for maybe a little push-up in dollar, but I don't think it's going to  return to the levels we saw a year ago so quickly.  </p><p>KELLY:  I have one more -- so this is the important thing I think about the  market, the corporations are buying right now because the blackout periods.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  So this is why you want to buy right now because corporations are  going to come in and start purchasing.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Yes.  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they're not buying back their stock now because they're  reporting earnings.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Right.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes. Blackout period.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Right.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point.  So, it sounds like you're happy that we have  a sell-off because it's giving the investors an opportunity to get back in,  this just a sell-off and the fundamentals backed up for the stock market is  pretty strong.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Yes.  Absolutely.  I mean, we wanted to see this, this is like  pruning, this is a controlled brush fire, I mean, it didn't feel controlled  yesterday on the floor and it a was pretty wild but yes, no, we wanted to  see this and this is what we were waiting for because we had to take a lot  off the table we were way overweighted.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But is there any really way to know given the unprecedented  stimulus that you've had for instance for banks around the globe starting  with the financial crisis in 2008 of how overvalued asset classes and where  people are most exposed.  Again, you only find -- found out who is swimming  naked when the tide goes out.  And that's something with as Federal Reserve  really pares back that giant balance sheet as interest rates continue to  rise, this could be something that plays out literally over years not just  a matter of days. </p><p>TENGLER:  Agreed.  I do agree, Dagen but I do think that we have the  benefit of a strong underlying fundamental economy and corporate CEOs that  are making actually decent decisions and unexpected decisions with the tax  cuts and so I think that's going to provide a floor if you will on-- and  with the stock buybacks, I do think that we're going to see continued moves  up at least for the next 12 months.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nancy, before you go, you got to talk just about this book, the  Women's Guide to Success for Investing, you say that women outperformed men  when it comes to investing.  </p><p>TENGLER:  We did.  We tend to be a little more deliberate, thoughtful and  less risk-focused, not less competitive but less willing to trade and that  generates excess return over the long term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just being patient.</p><p>TENGLER:  Just being patient buying great companies.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll leave it there.  Nancy, great insights from you.  Thanks  so much.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nancy Tengler joining us there.  Coming up, the White House  weighs in on the global stock market decline, futures indicating another  sharp sell-off at the start of trading down 300 points after a stock sell- off yesterday.  White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley will join  me next live.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news this morning.  A global market  sell-off continues this morning.  Thanks for joining us, everybody.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, February 6th.  We're an hour away from  the open on Wall Street.  It has been a volatile morning for stocks.  Take  a look at futures right now down 350 points.  At one point, the S&amp;P and the  NASDAQ this morning were actually up.  The NASDAQ right now is down 61  points and the S&amp;P down 29 points.  So volatility is back and we're  expecting another rough open this morning.  This, of course, one day after  the Dow suffered the worst one-day point decline ever sliding better than  four percent, that was almost 1200 points lower on the day.  As, you know,  1200 points is the worst point ever but four percent is not.  We are seeing  this market trade down having said that more this morning.  The Dow and the  S&amp;P 500 have now wiped out, any gains for 2018 in a day they wiped that out  for the 1200-point sell-off.  That bloodbath spreading across the world.</p><p>Meanwhile, Asia took a cue from the U.S. last night and markets were down  sharply.  The Nikkei Average in Japan plunged nearly five percent, this is  -- this is -- this is not right.  What does this Asian markets 2-1/2  percent?  That was wrong but we want to tell you the specifics because Hong  Kong was down more than five percent overnight and Japan was down almost  five percent, more than four percent.  These are the closing numbers last  night overnight for the Asian markets.  So there you go.  This is the  accurate numbers here.  Sorry about that.  The market is now down 10  percent from the record-high in Japan, so that is correction mode with that  4-3/4 percent sell-off.  In Europe this morning, declines across the board  as you can see, the European indices down about two percent apiece.  The  major markets in London, Paris, Frankfurt all down better than two percent  this morning.  Joining me right now to talk more about these markets is  White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.  Hogan, good to see you.   Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  Great to see you, Maria.   Thanks for the time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So in a statement, the President said he's focused on long-term  economic fundamentals, that was yesterday.  What is the president's  reaction to this market sell-off that we're watching?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Look, the same that we talked about yesterday is the same today.   The fundamentals of the American economy are really strong, some of your  guests have alluded to that very fact.  This morning we've seen, you know,  7,000 percent increase in the stock market.  We heard on the Obama  administration that 1.9 percent GDP was the new normal, manufacturing would  never come back to our shores.  All those things have been turned around in  this -- under this president's policy, not to mention the fact GDP is now  at -- hovering around three percent for the first time in the better part  of the decade.  So the fundamentals of this American economy are strong and  the American people quite frankly are seeing the effect.  He was in Ohio  just yesterday talking to the Schafer Corporation, several companies were  represented there, giving thousand dollar bonuses to their employees, wages  are going up for the first time in eight years, so overall, the soundness  of this economy is indisputable.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, there's no doubt that the economic backdrop  is very strong, we know that, I mean, now for the first time we're hearing  expectations of 5.4 percent growth for the first quarter but we also know  how focused this president has been on the stock market, right?  So does he  need to come out and at least calm people down by saying obviously markets  go up and down or whatever he wants to say.  Billionaire investor Mark  Cuban is calling out the president for cheering on the markets but then  staying silent during the sell-off.  Here is what he said yesterday.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now the argument is that you talk about on the way up,  you own it on the way down.  Do you agree with that?  </p><p>MARK CUBAN, AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN:  No, because they should have owned it on  the way up and they don't own it on the way down.  So, if you're going to  go into the market, do your homework, understand what you're getting into  and understand all the risks.  Where people get hurt is that they don't  really do their homework and they don't understand what's involved,  particularly when a markets gone straight up for so long and it feels like  -- and you have people saying day after that it's going to keep on going  straight up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I think Mark Cuban makes a good point,  Hogan.  What's your take on that? </p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, look, I mean obviously the president did tout the stock  market but I would -- I would hardly say that he focused on it, but let's  be honest, I watched yesterday in my office, we have on what your viewers  may not know as a quad, so there's a cross on my television with four  different networks in the box, I get to watch them all.  They went wall to  wall with coverage of the stock market declining.  Now I understand that's  big news but where were they when it was going up?  They didn't say a word  about that?  So, they're trying to discredit this president and his  economic prowess on what he's been able to do.  You're cutting regulations  at a tune to 22 cuts for everyone increase in regulations, that's  incredible numbers, it businesses the ability to bring in more jobs, to  expand and grow and it gives them a stability they have not had in recent  decades.  But no question, the president was involved and responsible for  the increase in the stock market but also in the overall economy which as  you know has been growing at anemic levels under the Barack Obama  administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  No, you're right on that for sure.  And we're looking  at earnings for 2018, going to be up 20 percent largely because of the tax  plan and these moves to roll back regulations I get that.  Let me -- let me  ask you about the budget, Hogan because House Republicans are set to vote  today on another short-term spending bill to keep the government open  through March 23rd, keep defense spending on track for a year.  But they  won't address the debt ceiling, of course, it's coming as the Democrats are  set to head out for their annual retreat later this week?  The budget  deadline is Thursday.  What's going to happen?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, hopefully, we can get a budget passed as the president has  been clear, many times that we want a two-year budget in place for spending  caps because we have to fund the military, we have to rebuild it, it was  dismantled over the course of the last eight years.  The president wants  that back in place because the American people deserve protection.  We have  to protect our allies around the world and this budget right now, the C.R.,  there's no way to govern long term, the president knows that and he's been  out talking about that publicly multiple times but we have to get something  in place and as we move closer and closer to that deadline hopefully the  Democrats won't hold the budget hostage or the American people hostage for  the -- for the hundreds of thousands of people here, who are here illegally  and unlawfully.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, why can't the Congress understand that the American  people want the both sides to work together?  I mean, this is just  outrageous that you can't get things done without any help on the other  side.  We're waiting on an immigration bill, who knows if they'll come to  the table thereafter the president puts something out which was obviously  three times what they wanted.  And then there is this whole memo story, the  White House has confirmed it received the Democrats' response to the  controversial document which shows abuses at the top of the FBI, your  office has just released a statement saying this, the White House has  received a memorandum from the minority members of the House Select  Permanent Committee on Intelligence, as stated many times the  administration will follow the same process and procedure with the  memorandum from the minority as it did last week when it received the memo  from the majority.  So, Hogan, it didn't take that long with the GOP memo,  are we going to see a swift decision and what is in this second memo? </p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, look, I haven't seen the second memo but I will say it took  five days for the Republican memo and the president did what was prudent.   He brought in the White House Council, he brought in members of National  Security team because it's tantamount to decision he makes at the end of  this whether did he classify or not.  What it does to the American people  if it puts National Security at risk?  This president would never ever put  American lives at risk for politics regardless of what other people may or  may not do.  He did that, he went to the proper channels and process and  procedure with the first memo.  He's going to do the exact same thing with  this memo.  As it relates to immigration if I may go back for a minute.  I  did see that Senators McCain and Coons put out a bill recently and I'm just  going to say it takes a special kind of piece of legislation to be worse  for the American people than the Durbin-Graham bill was.  </p><p>But congratulations to those two Senators, McCain and Coons because they  have constructed something that's much, much worse.  It does not protect  the American people whatsoever, it gives amnesty to scores of people who  are here illegally and it doesn't do anything that the border patrol agent  say they need as far as deportation mechanisms and fortunate mechanism, it  doesn't build the wall at all.  And the secret here is, Maria, walls work,  whether it's the one in San Diego that cut illegal crossings by 95 percent  or the one in Jerusalem that went around the city that cut illegal  crossings by 99 percent, they work and Democrats can't have it both ways,  they can't on one hand say, the wall doesn't work, what do we want it for?   And then complain that it's going to be built.  They know it works because  it solves the problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In fact, the president just tweeting about this right now.  And  here's what he just said a moment ago.  So disgraceful that a person  illegally in our country killed at full a person illegally in our country  killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson.  This is just one of the many such  preventable tragedies.  We must get the Dems to get tough on the border and  with illegal immigration fast.  He goes on to say, my prayers and best  wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson.  A wonderful young man whose  life was so senselessly taken. @Colt.  So, Hogan, the president is tweeting  about this and yet it seems that the Democrats really do not want to  execute anything more from this White House.  I mean, let's face it, they  do not like him and they do not want him to have success.  So what are you  going to do? </p><p>GIDLEY:  Right.  It's hard to deal with people when their hatred for -- their personal hatred for President Trump outweighs their desire to see  America successful.  It kind of blows my mind but look, back to this  immigration point, you remember the fight over the C.R. when the Democrats  shut down the government, hurting 8.9 million American children, defunding  border patrol agents, stopping the funding to military families, they did  all of that to protect hundreds of thousands of people who are here  unlawfully and illegally as opposed to protecting the hundreds of millions  of Americans citizens.  That line was drawn in the sand as we approach this  new deadline and this new shutdown, you will remember the Schumer shutdown,  they wanted -- Democrats said they wanted everything in the C.R., they  refused to vote for it.  The same thing applies here, the president has put  forth policies that are really about a 70 percent in popularity, 80 percent  in popularity in some cases.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Democrats says they want everything in the bill.  So, I don't  understand why in the world they would reject this framework when it gives  them what they want.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Unless they just don't want border security and that's what blows  my mind.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why I think the president has put them in a box a bit  here because he is giving them what they want and if they say no, then that  means I guess they don't want it.  Hogan, real quick in terms of this memo.   Let me end there.  Are we going to see indictments, are we going to see  accountability here?  I mean, it's pretty clear at this point that the FBI  misled the FISA judge and got a warrant to spy on American citizens so that  they could listen in to their competitor, Donald Trump and running the  election.  So are we going to see indictments?  Anybody going to go to jail  or have accountability hearing?  Also, how far high up does this go?  What  about Barack Obama, was he setting the rules?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Well look, it's very obviously that Congress is the investigative  arm here and they're -- they seem to be doing their job as far as looking  into this but I think all Americans are concerned when the highest levels  of the FBI and the DOJ can use the most intrusive invasive surveillance  methods against American citizens based on the fact that a Democrat bought  and paid for document that was a -- that was a campaign document was used  to grant the FISA warrant.  That should be concerning to all Americans but  I think, Maria, that we're seeing the beginning of this quite frankly and  the end.  I think the investigation continues, you've Congressman Nunes say  that, you've heard Congressman Schiff say that.  So I think this is going  to continue.  It's the start, not the end.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think then that there will be accountability? </p><p>GIDLEY:  I hope so and I think the American people deserve that.  They want  to know that their law enforcement arms in the Federal government are not  politically biased, but that they follow the laws and they treat American  citizens as they should under the constitution.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, did the state department follow the laws?  Devin Nunes  says now he's got an active investigation into the state department, that's  Hillary Clinton's state department.  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Right.  Again, that's something that Congress is going to have to  address but I think it's clear the investigation into Hillary Clinton,  there are serious inconsistencies.  When you're giving an exoneration  letter before you even testify, that's a serious problem and I think all  Americans are concerned by that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  All right.  Hogan, thanks very much.  We will see you  soon.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hogan Gidley joining us at the White House.  As we take a  break, take a look at this market, falling out of bed again this morning,  down 270 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.  NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500 also  weaker there or a handful of firms like RBC, telling clients to buy on the  dip after the worst percentage decline yesterday since -- back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Futures are currently trading lower this morning  after the Dow tumbled a record amount yesterday.  Look at where we are,  Futures expected to be down -- the open, rather, expected to be down 250  points on the Dow at the open.  The NASDAQ down 25 points.  This, on top of  yesterday's nearly 1200-point sell-off, the worst point decline on record,  the worst percentage decline of four percent since 2011.  Nicole Petallides  on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this morning, waiting for a  rough open this morning.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   So, as you noted, we've obviously had volatility even in the Futures over  the last several hours.  We're seeing the Futures down 250 points right  now.  Those two days of selling seven percent.  People are already printing  out the circuit breakers this morning.  A level one would be seven percent.   You'd have a 15-minute malt; 13 percent would be the level two; and the 20  percent not that I want that but I'm giving you the news, you shut down for  the day.  </p><p>The big picture also, they're talking about the recent sell-off, why it  happened, we know we have a rising interest rate environment.  A lot of  talk about those who were on the short side of the VIX which jumped 115  percent.  And so, obviously, that move historic and weighing in a lot of  calls on that one.  Margin calls on the -- on the VIX, the people who  played the wrong side of that fear index. </p><p>Then we have earnings, 55 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported, 77  percent beat on earnings per share, 80 percent on revenue.  We're watching  for both -- two names, General Motors which came out, did beat on the  quarterly results.  And they did very well.  They've been cost-cutting  obviously.  The stock is just flat, pretty great in this type of  environment and it's been a winner.  And Disney after the bell, of course,  the $52-billion deal with Fox, revenue rising, and some other news that  we'll be watching for them, so watch for Disney after the bell today --  Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Nic, thank you so much.  We're watching that open,  for sure.  There is a possible upside to this market sell-off.  Joining us  now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney, looking at the glass  half-full, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Look, it's very hard to judge  how the market opens when you're looking at these Futures because an  exceptionally volatile market, I don't think a -220 tells the full story.   I think it's going to be down like a -500 or even a -600 by the time we  actually open up this morning.  But to follow on from your comment, Maria,  I think that might open up the opportunity for some bargain hunting.  Now,  the big tech stocks have been following our tape.  </p><p>They're going to be down at the opening bell, doesn't that open up the  possibility of the pros coming in, as the amateur sell, the pros come in  and buy on what they might think is a bargain price.  Apple at 154, Netflix  247, Facebook 178, Amazon below 1400, they are going to be some pros who  say, OK, the amateurs got panicked out.  We're going to step in, we're  going to buy the big text or buy whatever they think is a bargain, watch it  run up, and then probably sell it again.  What I'm saying is, watch out for  the bargain hunters because they're going to be there, and watch out for  some exceptional volatility, up and down all day long.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  Well, we've been seeing that volatility just  this morning alone, although we had Nancy Tengler earlier, she says she's  buying on the dip.  A couple other firms out there like RBC telling clients  to buy on the dip, so, yes, you're not alone.  People seeing opportunity  here, for sure, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  It's going to be an extraordinary day, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.  We'll see you in 10 minutes, Stu.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  Join Stuart and company, coming up.  First though, an Uber for the  sky.  Why the age of flying taxis could be closer than you think, that's  next.  And then, Futures this morning, looking like 250 points on the  downside at the open this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Welcome back.  Crowds pay tribute to a Colorado deputy killed  in the line of duty, people lining the streets.  And Colorado Springs --  there they are -- to pay respects to Deputy Micah Flick.  He was shot and  killed while investigating a stolen vehicle.  The suspect shot and killed  at the scene.  Two other sheriff's deputies and a bystander were also shot.   Flick was described as an outstanding detective.  He leaves behind his wife  and 7-year-old twins.</p><p>Overseas, prosecutors in Germany searching Audi offices in the  investigation into suspected emission manipulation.  Audi accuse of fraud  and legal advertising for the sales more than 200,000 vehicles in the U.S.,  as well as Europe since 2009.  Investigators say they're focusing on the  use of technical means to manipulate the emission levels of certain V6  diesel engines.  Audi is the biggest contributor to its parent company,  Volkswagen's profit.  If you take a look at shares of Volkswagen up about  24 percent from a year ago.  Well, who knew, McDonald's French fries may  hold the key to treating baldness.  According to a new study that examined  a chemical that's used in the frying oil.  Scientists in Japan say that the  silicon chemical can actually mass produce hair follicles when you put it  on mice.  And they say the simple process is promising and that it could  maybe treat hair loss in men.  So, I don't know, try rubbing it on your  head.  </p><p>And this one no more straight out of the Jetsons space age cartoon, Bell  Helicopter teaming up with Uber to launch the very first air taxes by 2025.   So, initial tests are expected to take place in 2020 in Dallas, also in  Dubai, Bell Helicopter actually showed off their concept at the Consumer  Electronics Show in Vegas last month.  Let's take a look at the parents of  Bell Textron.  Nice chart, shares up 17 percent over the past year.  So, I  don't know where you want to go with that, but McDonald's helping men with  baldness or flying Ubers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All good stories.  I'm smarter after your report.  Thank you so  much.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We try.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But we are poorer.  Take a look at the Futures right now,  we are expecting the sell-off at the start of trading although we are well  off of the lows.  Take a look, down 151 right now, having come off of a  decline of 300 earlier, NASDAQ is now positive, up six points, as we take a  break.  We'll get our final thoughts from this all-star panel as we see  money moving into stocks, and the markets coming off of the lows right now  as we speak.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts.  Kevin Kelly?</p><p>KELLY:  We've seen a disconnect between valuation and fundamentals.  I  think valuation has come down letting credence into the fundamentals in  this economy.  It could be a buying opportunity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, buying opportunity.  Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I agree on the fundamentals.  The economy looks pretty strong.   We had good job's numbers, good wage numbers, good service sector numbers  the other day.  The economy is in pretty good shape, the market just has to  adjust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are some people getting shaken out of this market.  There  were two exchange-traded (INAUDIBLE) that collapsed overnight where people  were betting that volatility would not come back.  Again, we see who was  naked when the tide goes out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's back.  Volatility is back.  Here's Stuart Varney with more  on that.  Stu, over to you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Tuesday.  It is Tuesday, February 6th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, the global sell-off is continuing.  U.S.  markets tumbled yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting  its single largest one day point decline ever -- point decline.  It closed  down nearly 1,200 points.  On a percentage basis it wasn't the top.  Both  the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 wiped out the year's gains for 2018.</p><p>The decline sending shockwaves across the world overnight and this morning.   In Asia overnight markets took a nose dive.  Take a look.  The Nikkei  average in Japan down four and three-quarters percent.  The Hang Seng index  in Hong Kong down better than 5 percent.  Shanghai and Kospi in the red.</p><p>In Europe, steep declines across the board this morning.  Take a look at  the FT 100, down better than 2 percent, 175 point slower there.  Two and a  half percent lower on the DAX in Germany, down 312 points there.  And the  CAC 40 in Paris is down 2.5 percent.</p><p>On to futures we go.  Here in the U.S. -- and it has been a wild, volatile  morning -- we're now at the lows of the morning.  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average expected to be down 350 points, right at the get-go this morning.   That's 1.5 percent lower.  The S&amp;P 500 down better than 1 percent, as is  the Nasdaq down almost 70 points.  That plunge continuing right now.</p><p>The White House is remaining positive meanwhile in the face of all of these  losses, saying that President Trump is focused on, quote, \"long-term  economic fundamentals which remain exceptionally strong\".</p><p>The turmoil coming as investors eye earnings from several big names this  morning, some Dow components on the docket.</p><p>General Motors set to report fourth quarter earnings before the bell.   Ahead of those numbers, the stock is up 1.25 percent.  That, by the way, I  should point out, is off of the highs.</p><p>The other main name, Disney, which is a Dow component, reports after the  closing bell tonight.  That stock is down 2 percent going into the numbers.</p><p>What you need to know for these numbers coming up this morning.</p><p>Also taking a dive this morning, bitcoin.  The crypto currency fell below  6,000 earlier this morning.  It has now lost half of its value since the  start of the year.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the \"Wall Street  Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath; and Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly.  Quite a morning.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Quite a morning.  During the  break I just saw Dagen buy some bitcoin.  So that's a big -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  You know what, we believe in saving and  investing for the long term.  We do not believe in get-rich-quick schemes - - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We never did.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Of course not.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and nonsense.  And I think that that was again, the canary in  the coal mine about the excessive risk-taking that you were seeing  particularly in the last year and that showed up literally in every asset  class.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And while bitcoin was going up, up, up, up over the last few  months, I wondered could this be the catalyst that unravels the stock  market.  And I don't think it is but it's just one more indication as you  pointed out several times that it just shows an enormous amount of risk.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was symptomatic.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think bitcoin was disconnected not only from reality, but  from a lot of other markets.  I mean there was a lot of money going into  bitcoin overseas, in Asia in particular.  I mean the U.S. market has --  U.S. stock prices have been going up but there have been real fundamentals  behind it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it was nevertheless a siren about excessive risk-taking and  over-valuation of assets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, it's like Microsoft and the entire stock market was  separated from the dot-com bubble and the nonsense stocks but that didn't  prevent that bubble bursting from taking down stocks -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh yes.  Let's count the number of hits to the Web site instead  of actual revenue growth and earnings.  And with all due respect, can we  put bitcoin aside for a second?</p><p>We've got a -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- falling out of bed right here.</p><p>KELLY:  I didn't go for that but I can't help it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Thank you.</p><p>We've got the futures down better than 400 points right now on the heels of  an 1,100-point sell-off yesterday.  This is the low of the morning,  obviously.  It comes after the Dow plunged more than 4 percent yesterday,  closing down 1,175 points.</p><p>This is the largest ever single day point decline in history.  And it did  erase all the gains for the year.  Major indices in Europe and Asia also  gave up their gains for the year.</p><p>And let's talk about that right now.</p><p>Joining me is right now to weigh in is Neuberger Berman Group president and  chief investment officer, Joseph Amato.  Joe -- it's good to see you.</p><p>JOSEPH AMATO, PRESIDENT, NEUBERGER BERMAN GROUP:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Your reaction to this -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AMATO:  What a morning to be here.  So I think this sell-off is really  coming in a period of sort of strong global fundamentals.  So that's what  we think, you know, is really the important driver of where markets are  going to be in the future.</p><p>So we see strong economic growth across the globe where there's developed  markets or emerging markets.  And that's leading to stronger earnings  growth.  We saw a strong fourth quarter performance, where we had double  digit earnings growth.</p><p>And credit markets still have a benign environment.  So as we look at those  fundamentals we think this backdrop is more reflective of complacent pro- risk behavior.  Some of the things that you were just talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what triggered this then?  Is it the worry about three  percent on the 10-year yield?  Is it a worry about 2.9 percent growth in  wages year over year that you saw in the jobs numbers.  Why all this  hysteria, if everything is so great?  </p><p>AMATO:  I think it's the expectation that rates may move higher quicker, if  in fact the economic environment is growing at a higher clip and you see  some signs of inflation.  If the Fed is leading rates much higher then  markets' going to react to that.  And we have a long period where we  haven't had a correction at all so you get to keep that money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The irony here is that if stock prices collapse the wrong way,  if the stock prices fall sharply, the dollar rise as it's been doing, the  10-year yield goes up, the Fed actually has less reason to raise interest  rates more aggressively. </p><p>So my question back to you is what has actually changed that has the market  so upset.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I just asked.</p><p>AMATO:  Yes.  We don't think a lot has changed.  I think certainly the  environment of higher rates is reality because the Fed has probably been a  little bit behind in terms of its -- and bond markets have been a little  bit behind in reacting to where the Fed is going to be.</p><p>So usually it's not one thing that leads to these things.  It's a  combination of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is it rates?  Is it rates?  The fact that -- because you  just said a minute ago that there's an expectation the Fed is going to  raise rates more?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And what I'm saying is the Fed doesn't have to do so much if  all of these things are happening.  </p><p>AMATO:  And I think that's what the markets' going to take now some days to  get their arms around.  These things don't necessarily -- we're seeing that  this morning, right.  We have futures were up a little bit at one point,  now they're down.  So markets take some time to sort digest what the  fundamental picture is.  </p><p>KELLY:  So can you help me in regards to -- I think there's going to be a  cap on rates because there still is this thrill for yield and everyone is  still chasing it.  If we go over to Germany, Japan -- their yields are  exceptionally low.  They love coming over here.</p><p>Seeing the 10 year at 2.7 percent, why aren't they coming in and buying it  hand over fist, right?  Won't that cap rates from going higher?</p><p>AMATO:  I think it will.  And Jon and I were talking about that earlier  before the show, which is that low rate environment in Japan and Germany in  particular I think will keep demand for the long end of (INAUDIBLE) curve  reasonably certain.</p><p>Keep in mind rates are at 2.85 or 2.75.  In the scheme of things, those  rates are not high in context of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, they're actually low.</p><p>AMATO:  -- where the economic growth is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really low.</p><p>AMATO:  -- for the U.S. economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that shows you that the stock market though then can't  tolerate or won't tolerate yields that are significantly higher than this.   Because again, we've had a fed that has pushed assets into anything that  was risky since the 2008 financial crisis and you have a federal reserve  that's now trying to normalize itself.</p><p>And it begs the question of whether investors really understand what an  unwind of a $4 trillion balance sheet does to not only the bond market but  the stock market and real estate and junk bonds and emerging markets and  crypto currency.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that what this is, a $4.5 trillion roll-down?  </p><p>AMATO:  Well, I think the inflection point with central banks is an  important issue.  You know, we've talked a lot about that in our pieces  that we've written for clients where you have an environment where balance  sheets were expanding over the course of the last number of years and now  that's starting to move in the other direction, led by the Fed.  So that's  an issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we've never seen -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean this gets to how confusing markets can be because from  my perspective, that's a really old story.  I mean -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What -- the wind down of $4.5 trillion?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  The Fed winding down -- it's easy money.  I mean they've been  raising interest rates since December 2015.  They told us in September of  last year that they were going to be winding down their balance sheet and  they telegraph telling us that -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it's unprecedented.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- for months before that.  So, you know, the market is  supposed to be forward-looking in pricing and all these things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But saying it and doing it are two different things -- Jon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But the market is supposed to be forward-looking.  And like  we've known this for years that the Fed was going to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've known it but we haven't seen it's going to be $50 billion  a month, right, for several years to get down.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what the Fed says -- $50 billion.  </p><p>AMATO:  That balance sheet has created -- undeniably it's created some  distortion.  So when you go from central bank balance sheets from $4  trillion to $13 trillion, $14 trillion, $15 trillion -- that created some  distortion.  So the unwind, there is an element of unknown about that, as  much as the Fed has telegraphed what its balance sheet roll-off is.  And I  think the market's been expecting it.</p><p>But that goes back to the point I made earlier where you have some  complacency, particularly in fixed income markets over the course of last  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wonder -- let me just ask this question.  Jay Powell took over  yesterday on the day that the market collapses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Welcome to the Fed.</p><p>AMATO:  Welcome to the Fed, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The 1987 crashed two months after Alan Greenspan took over.  And  you've seen similar moves in the stock market, not of a 22 percent decline  in one day but when fed chairmen take over the central bank here in the  United States.  So to what extent is that nervousness or uncertainty  playing into market volatility?</p><p>We don't know what Jay will do.  </p><p>AMATO:  Yes.  I don't think Jay coming on-board is a driver but that said,  if you look back historically, markets always seem to test the new fed  chairperson.  So that's something to keep an eye on about how the Fed -- </p><p>KELLY:  The power of -- will it happen.</p><p>AMATO:  -- how the Fed reacts.  The Fed has not said anything so far.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So now the million-dollar question, what do you do?  What are  you telling clients?</p><p>AMATO:  Well, I think this gives you an opportunity.  If you think you  missed the big move in markets -- so three weeks that we're sitting here  and markets were up 7 percent or 8 percent.  And people were so -- my God,  the markets are up 20 something percent last year.  I'm upset, I missed it.   When in fact you now have an opportunity because the fundamentals remain  strong.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you buy in the dip (ph).</p><p>AMATO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Listen, I think we're tip-toeing around a couple of things.   I mean the first thing we're tiptoeing around is that wages went up 2.9  percent.  The market was not expecting that.</p><p>Now when wages go up 2.9 percent are companies going to get the  productivity that justifies those wage gains?  So that's a capital cost  that's higher now for them, right.  It's labor.</p><p>Then you've got rates going up.  So what's happening is I just see this as  the market's trying to digest risk.  And so where would you put money now,  given that we know that rates are going higher, labor is getting higher,  some companies' valuations are excessive especially certain areas.  Where's  the best way I should channel my energy today?  </p><p>AMATO:  So we would -- from an asset allocation standpoint, certainly tilt  toward the global equity asset class because we think the earnings outlook  and the economic outlook is strong.</p><p>Within the credit markets we'd lean more toward credit than duration risk  because we do think that rates will probably be growing higher over the  course of the next 12 to 18 months.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you talk about Europe and Asia?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  To put Europe so often in some perspective -- we've been  talking about 1987.  We were talking about this off camera.  In 1987 the  climb (ph) was 22 percent in one day.</p><p>Now we were talking about 4.6 percent yesterday, maybe another 2 points  today.  How big a deal is this?  In your career of looking at these market  sell-offs, is this a dime a dozen?  Or is this something -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Market was up 40 percent.  </p><p>AMATO:  That's a great point, Maria because if you think about the last  drawdown was maybe early 2016 when you had fears of U.S. recession and  China weakening, oil prices really low, markets traded up about 10 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  S&amp;P -- yes.</p><p>AMATO:  The market then rallied to mid-year.  So you had 20 percent move up  to Brexit.  Markets then traded up a bit and then since Brexit, you had a  40 percent move with no corrections and low volatility.  This is a  culmination of an environment that is quote, unusual historically.  So  corrections that you've seen are normal in a market that's been performing  - </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So what's unusual?  Is it the selloff we're getting now, is  how big the run-up was leading up to this.  </p><p>AMATO:  And the low volatility that we experienced.  It's quite unusual to  have that level of low volatility with markets moving up the way they did.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean look at that chart over the last year of the Nasdaq.   It's pretty good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Dow had ten 1 percent moves in all of last year.  I think it  had three in the last week of volatility.  </p><p>AMATO:  Well, this move in the Dow I think is in the top hundred -- barely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>AMATO:  It's not the top 10.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think it's a good point that we were up better than 40  percent and yesterday we were down 4 percent.  So keep it in context.</p><p>Joe -- good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>AMATO:  Good to see you -- Maria.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joe Amato joining us there, Neuberger-Berman.</p><p>Coming up, dueling memos -- the White House has just confirmed it received  the Democrats' response to the last week bombshell memo on FISA.  We're  going to take a look at whether it will go public, next.</p><p>And then a crypto-crash -- bitcoin recovers a bit after tumbling below  $6,000 for the first time in four months.  Why the crypto currency lost  more of its shine, coming up next.</p><p>And then will the rout on Wall Street roll on.  Does it continue.  Futures  right now are pointing to a decline of 400 points at the opening of trading  this morning, another 1.5 percent.  The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are also down,  after that large -- the largest ever single day point decline for the Dow.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We want to take a look at futures right now because this market has been  moving wildly all morning.  Dow Industrials down 300 points right now, 1.25  percent.  The Nasdaq is down 41, another two-thirds of a percent.  And the  S&amp;P also firmly in the red now, down 20 points, that's three-quarters of 1  percent.</p><p>Stocks are not the only thing falling.  Oil prices are also dropping for a  third day this morning.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with those details now -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey -- Maria.</p><p>Light sweet crude is now right around $64 a barrel.  Experts say the global  market sell-off strengthens the U.S. dollar and a rising dollar makes  commodities more expensive for foreign buyers.  Oil down 1.5 percent now,  in positive territory for 2018.</p><p>Speaking of oil, we just got earnings from B.P., first quarterly loss in  over a year.  The company hit by U.S. tax code changes and changes from the  Deepwater Horizon disaster, the oil spill back in 2010.  B.P. posting a  $583 million loss for the fourth quarter but they did say 2017 most  profitable year since oil prices crashed.  That was two years ago. </p><p>Let's take a look at shares of B.P.  They are moving slightly to the down  side in premarket trading. </p><p>Well, the stock selloff taking a toll on bitcoin too, falling below $6,000  at one point earlier today and losing half of its value for the year.   Bitcoin taking a hit recently due to concerns about regulatory oversight.   The virtual currency did hit $20,000 -- that was the high back in December.   Congress will hold a hearing on virtual currencies a bit later this  morning.</p><p>Well, SpaceX is preparing to launch its Falcon Heavy spacecraft today.  And  to show you the power of this rocket, Elon Musk's company is releasing this  animated video.  It also shows the precious cargo riding shotgun.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Set to David Bowie's \"Life on Mars\".  And this Tesla roadster  is heading to Mars.</p><p>Jeff Bezos, that's Amazon's CEO, has a space company of his own.  He's  spending his -- sending his best wishes to SpaceX.  This is what he  tweeted.  \"Best of luck with the Falcon Heavy launch tomorrow, hoping for a  beautiful nominal flight.\"  And he also included his company, Blue Origin,  their motto, which is \"Gradatim Ferociter\" which is Latin for step by step  ferociously.  </p><p>And if this launch is successful today, you could see a commercial launch  this fall.  Who's going to Mars.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's amazing.  All right -- Lauren.  Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up -- we will take a break -- when we come back, tragedy  at the hands of an illegal immigrant.  The drunk driver accused of killing  the Colts linebacker, Edwin Jackson.  That is next.</p><p>He was in the country illegally.  He had been deported several times before  and then murder.  The new details from that investigation coming up.</p><p>And the bears run wild this morning again, stocks plunging globally after  the Dow suffered the largest ever point decline yesterday, 1,100 points  down yesterday.  Futures this morning indicating a 250 point selloff right  out of the gate.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Checking futures right now, we're expecting a decline of 180 points on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average.  We've been down as much as 300 points  earlier.  And in fact, the major averages were also up earlier as well.   The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both retreating from the highs and now are  negative by 11 points on the S&amp;P and 26 on the Nasdaq.  Dow Industrials  down 200 points.</p><p>So needless to say, it has been an incredibly volatile morning for markets.   We're watching it.</p><p>Meanwhile there's this -- tragedy in Indiana.  Indianapolis Colts  linebacker Edwin Jackson and ride-share driver Jeffrey Monroe were hit and  killed by a suspected drunk driver on Sunday morning -- the day of the  Super Bowl.  Police have identified the driver as an illegal immigrant,  driving without a license, twice-deported between 2007 and 2009.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Courtney Hacking.  She is  angel mom and wife for the Remembrance Project.  Courtney -- thanks very  much for joining us.</p><p>COURTNEY HACKING, REMEMBRANCE PROJECT:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're happy to talk with you.  Unfortunately, it is under these  circumstances because you've had your own devastating experience.  Your  husband Peter Hacking, 4-year-old daughter Ely and 22-month-old son Grayson  were hit head-on by an illegal immigrant driving without a valid license.</p><p>Courtney -- when you hear this story about what has happened to Edwin  Jackson, a similar death here because of an illegal immigrant -- your  reaction, please.  </p><p>HACKING:  It's a pattern.  For me, I hear and it's devastating any time you  hear the news like that.  But you can't help but ask yourself why does this  continue to happen and it's the recurrence of the illegal immigration part  that just really, really hits home every time.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did you first learn the details when you lost your family  to an illegal immigrant?  </p><p>HACKING:  The details of it actually didn't come to me until about a week  after the accident itself.  Finding out that it was an illegal immigrant,  my husband himself was an immigrant.  He came from England.  He came here  legally.  He did it the right way.  He was very -- he's a big believer in  legal immigration, as am I.</p><p>KELLY:  Courtney.</p><p>HACKING:  However -- yes. </p><p>KELLY:  Sorry about that.  Can you shed some light on what the Remembrance  Project is?  Because, you know, hearing your story and then reading the  background, I mean the individual that crashed into your family only got  two years, right.</p><p>And I feel like if I had done the same thing I would have served a harsher  sentence and gotten more than two years.  Can you walk us through what the  Remembrance Project is?  </p><p>HACKING:  Well, the Remembrance Project is kind of that.  It's shedding  light on the fact that we do have situations where illegal immigrants are  continuously coming into the country and they're causing crimes repeatedly  and there's no -- there's a lesser punishment for them than there is for a  citizen on their own.  </p><p>I know for me, I feel the same way.  If I had committed that crime, I feel  I probably would have served the maximum sentence for it.  However, because  this person is an illegal citizen, he still has the rights that our country  gives to American citizens, yet he doesn't receive the same punishment.  So  it's kind of about shedding light on where the system fails in that manner.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So where do you think the system does fail?  I mean we should  point out that the police have identified the driver who killed the Colts  linebacker as Manuel Orrego Savala, an illegal immigrant.</p><p>He was driving without a license.  And he was deported twice between 2007  and 2009.  </p><p>HACKING:  Yes, he was.</p><p>The driver of the vehicle that killed my family had also been deported  before.  The problem lies in the system itself where we have no punishments  for them.  The punishment is you get caught doing something wrong, ok,  well, we're going to send you back.</p><p>There's nothing that keeps them from coming back and there's nothing from  our country telling them that if you do come back, that at this moment we  don't have anything in place that states you will receive a maximum  punishment or you'll receive a harsher punishment.</p><p>While American citizens receive a harsher punishment from the get-go,  illegal immigrants come to the country and there's no harsher punishment,  whether they're here once, twice, three times.  So we're telling them, come  to America because, I mean we can't do anything to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Have your views evolved or changed in any way after you  lost your family to an illegal?  </p><p>HACKING:  I wouldn't say that my views have changed.  I've always believed  in immigration itself but the legal way of doing it.  I've always had an  issue with somebody coming to the country illegally and getting the  benefits of being a citizen of the United States, but not having to follow  the same rules as we do and having no punishment.</p><p>Because in these cases in particular, these people murdered other people.   And at the end of it, the man who killed my family got two years.  And  he'll be out in April and he'll go right back to Mexico and two days later  he'll come right back because nothing says he can't.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Courtney -- thank you.  </p><p>HACKING:  So my views -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for sharing your feelings.  This is obviously  very troubling.  We appreciate your time this morning -- Courtney.  Thank  you.</p><p>HACKING:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Courtney Hacking joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, fake dirt for the dossier.  A Senate memo revealing that Clinton  associates said allegations to the author of the anti-Trump dossier.  The  implications of the new revelations -- this is getting worse and worse.</p><p>And then we could see another rout on Wall Street today.  The Dow's single  biggest one day decline yesterday is continuing this morning.  We're off of  the lows but nonetheless down in the triple digits on the Dow.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>BREAKING NEWS this morning, the global markets selloff is continuing.</p><p>Thanks for joining us everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday,  February 6th.</p><p>A bloodbath on Wall Street yesterday and it spread across the world  overnight, the Dow suffers the worst one-day point decline ever, sliding  better than four percent yesterday.</p><p>Now the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 have wiped out their 2018 gains, that happened  yesterday alone.</p><p>Asia follow the lead of the US overnight; Japan and Hong Kong the worst  performers, the Nikkei Average plunging nearly five percent on the day.  It  is officially now in correction territory for Japan, down 10 percent from  the recent high.  There is, the Asian markets overnight.</p><p>Take a look at Europe this morning, declines across-the-board there as  well, the major markets in London, Paris, Frankfurt, all down better than  two percent right now.</p><p>It has been a wild morning meanwhile in the US, you want to take a look at  Futures because this is well off of the lows this morning.  In fact, when  we first started the show an hour and a half ago we were actually in  positive territory, now we're looking at a decline of a hundred and  seventy-six points on the Dow, eight points lower on the S&amp;P 500 and the  NASDAQ down 10 points, yes, we are watching volatility rip through these  markets these last 24 hours.</p><p>The VIX Index as well, take a look at the Global Market Volatility Index,  that's the Wall Street 'fear gauge' briefly surging above 50 earlier, that  was the first time that happened since August of 2015, the VIX is now at 37  and change as you can see, volatility is back.</p><p>We also have BREAKING NEWS on earnings report, General Motors just reported  earnings hitting the tape, GM beat expectations on both profit and revenue,  the Company reported $37.7 billion in revenue on earnings of a dollar  sixty-five a share versus an estimate of a dollar thirty-eight; GM is off 1  ? percent right now.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all the above is Washington  Examiner's Chief Political Correspondent, Byron York.</p><p>Byron good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER &amp; FOX  NEWS  CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we haven't heard from the president yet and this stock  market route, obviously the president has talked a lot about the market  rally due to his policies, do you think he needs to come out and say  something about the decline?</p><p>YORK:  Probably so and he certainly need to dial back what he says a little  bit.</p><p>I mean the president has said so many things over the past few months,  basically proving the success of his presidency and his economic program by  the rise in the stock market.</p><p>There were people were saying, \"Look Mr. President, wages are going up,  that is more important to voters than the Dow Index,\" but the president  talked about it a lot.</p><p>And I think what you were talking about earlier in the program about the  risk-taking behavior that some of this run-up has shown is the president  was kind of encouraging that so the point is not to never talk speak --  about it again, it's to dial it back a little bit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's - it's a good way to put it.</p><p>You know, we want to get to this op-ed that you wrote recently and also the  great coverage you've been giving this memo.</p><p>Now White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded to the  Democrats rebuttal to the FISA memo, here's what Sarah Sanders said Byron,  \"The White House has received a memorandum from the minority members of the  House Select Permanent Committee on Intelligence.  As stated many times,  the administration will follow the same process and procedure with this  memorandum from the minority as it did last week, when it received a  memorandum from the majority.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT:  \"The White House has received a memorandum from the minority members  of the House Select Permanent Committee on Intelligence.\"</p><p>\"As stated many times, the Administration will follow the same process  and procedure with this memorandum from the minority as it did last week,  when it received a memorandum from the majority.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Byron, let's take a status check for a moment and your take on  this whole memo story and the obvious corruption that took place at the top  of the FBI?</p><p>YORK:  Well we are seeing an entirely different picture with this  democratic memo than we saw with the Republican memo.</p><p>Before - the Republican memo was released before they even voted, the  Committee voted, to release it.  We saw a lot of squawking from Democrats  and then we saw statements from the FBI saying there are grave concerns  about it; and this will be a terrible thing, it will be the end of the  world; it would release classified information and sources and methods; and  all of that stuff.</p><p>And now we are not hearing much.</p><p>And I'm actually told by Republicans who have read the democratic memos,  that it contains more classified information than the Republican memo did  because Republicans actually crafted their memo to not reveal - or to  reveal as little classified information as possible.</p><p>So, what we have now, another big difference is, Democrats voted  unanimously to not release the Republican memo and Republicans have voted  unanimously to release the democratic memo.</p><p>So, I think we're going to see it.</p><p>I don't think it's really politically possible for the president to say,  \"No.  You shouldn't see this democratic memo,\" when he just approved -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes but -</p><p>YORK:  - everybody -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - talk -</p><p>YORK:  - has seen the Republican -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - to us -</p><p>YORK:  - memo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - about the contents of the memo Byron?</p><p>Because all of this memo here, memo there, is just muddying the waters, you  know, that, that's probably the goal of this second memo anyway.</p><p>But in terms of what it says in this second memo, I mean, is there any  pushback to the fact that there was incredible amount of bias at the top of  the FBI and the fact that when they went to the FISA court they had an  enormous amount of omissions to the FISA judge so that they could get a  warrant to spy on American citizens?</p><p>YORK:  I think it's going to be part rebuttal and part diversionary.</p><p>They are apparently in the memo, the Democrats going to answer or rebut a  couple of things in the - in the Republican memo but I'm not sure it's  going to be that effective.</p><p>Remember the Republican memo, the main points of it were that the dossier  was an essential part of the FISA application or the warrant application  for surveillance of Carter Page and that without the dossier, there  would've been no FISA application.</p><p>I'm not sure the Democrats are able to effectively rebut that.</p><p>The other charge the Republicans made was that the FBI did not tell the  FISA court that the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton  campaign had financed the dossier; there is no actual doubt about that -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>YORK:  - Democrats are going to say, 'well, they kind of sort of said that  may be the source had a political motivation,' so that's -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>YORK:  - really the same thing.</p><p>And Republicans that are saying, 'No.  That's not the same thing.  You  should've said that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC financed this  document.'</p><p>KELLY:  Byron, it's -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, Byron, just really quickly though, is the point of  releasing this Democratic memo by the Democrats, just to muddy the waters?</p><p>In essence you just add more information to this story just hoping that  other people in the media, not us, not here but other networks just ignore  it.</p><p>Or again I have heard some 'hacks' try to explain this to their liberal  audience and they just completely gloss over it -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - not, they did not (ph) - they said, they always use the  excuse, 'I'm not going to get in the weeds here.'</p><p>Well, get in the weeds -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - and tell us what was told to this FISA court, what was not  told to the FISA court about the funding of this dossier by the Clintons.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right Dagen.</p><p>And not only that but they are trying to have a good excuse not to talk  about the abuse at the top of the FBI -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - because it wasn't just all those omissions but it was also  doing it four times, OK.</p><p>They -</p><p>YORK:  The -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - went back and they renewed the order, the - to the FISA  court, three times in addition after the first time.</p><p>YORK:  - the point may be to divert or to muddy the waters but the effect  will be, that we have more information out.</p><p>Now this is the Democratic counter memo, I would not be surprised if we saw  a Republican counter-counter memo.</p><p>And to the beneficial effect of releasing the original Nunes memo is, that  is created momentum for the release of more information.</p><p>So, all of us now want to see, 'look, let's settle this, let's see this  FISA application,' or 'let's see this Andrew McCabe interview.'</p><p>Let's judge for ourselves - I know you're pulling this soundbite from it  there (ph), that soundbite from it, the public deserves to see the whole  thing.</p><p>It's created pressure and momentum for that to happen and it will -  ultimately will.</p><p>KELLY:  Byron, I'm curious, are there any implications for the Mueller  investigation in regard to these memos?</p><p>YORK:  No, not that we know of right now.</p><p>One of the big mysteries of this has been to what degree if any Robert  Mueller is focusing on some of the allegations in the dossier because you  have to remember the dossier had very, very specific allegations that as  far as we know have never been verified.</p><p>For example, the dossier said, the head of Rosneft, the giant energy  company in Russia offered Carter Page millions and perhaps billions of  dollars in exchange for lifting US sanctions as if Carter Page could lift  US sanctions.</p><p>But the very, very specific allegations, is Robert Mueller investigating  those?</p><p>We don't know.</p><p>KELLY:  So -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, we should - we should point out that six senior  leaders of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been reassigned or  fired.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If this is a fact - go ahead Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  - well, Byron, what I wanted to ask you is you know,  Washington has been arguing about these memos for several weeks now.</p><p>Let's assume that the Democrats get their version out there, what happens  next in this whole controversy, what's - once the memos our out and have  been digested where is this thing going next?</p><p>YORK:  Well a couple of things.</p><p>I think we will see the release of more underlying information so that  perhaps we can make better judgments about the memos.</p><p>But you know, Devin Nunes, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,  did say that the next place he is going is the State Department.</p><p>And we're learning more about the State Department's involvement in the  dossier, Victoria Nuland who was the top Obama State Department official  said in the last couple of days that she found out about the dossier in  July of 2016 which is about when the FBI did so everybody in that - at that  time period was feeding each other information.</p><p>Christopher Steele was feeding information to the FBI and the State  Department and the State Department may have been feeding information to  him, there's a lot to learn about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So again, you've got a situation where cronies of Hillary  Clinton are feeding all of this information and the Democratic National  Committee as well as Hillary Clinton's campaign are paying for it, what do  you think specifically they are looking at, at the State Department, Byron?</p><p>Because you know, there is this new controversy surrounding Christopher  Steele as well, a new memo from the Senate Judiciary Committee says that,  'known Clinton associates were reportedly feeding the allegations to  Steele,' as you just said while compiling the anti-Trump document.</p><p>So, Chuck Grassley spoke about the revelations, here's what he said and  then I'll get your comment on this; listen to Chuck Grassley?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), CHAIRMAN, JUDICIARY &amp; INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS  CONTROL COMMITTEE:  For a long time, the FBI was giving credibility to  Steele and when Steele was being paid for by Fusion GPS and then through a  law firm as well and was very much politically motivated, that the FBI  should've taken that into consideration if they knew that it was very  wrong, if they didn't know it, why didn't they know it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Byron, two quick questions.</p><p>Number one, what do you think they're looking at, at the State Department  and number two, there's Bruce Orr and his wife, we need to discuss.</p><p>Bruce Orr, the number three leading guy at the Department of Justice, his  wife works for Fusion GPS.</p><p>Nobody knew his wife works at Fusion GPS?</p><p>YORK:  Let's - let's start out -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How ridiculous -</p><p>YORK:  - with the -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - is that?</p><p>Yes!</p><p>YORK:  - let's start out with the State Department.</p><p>The documents that Chairman Grassley released, they were heavily redacted  by the way and we're hoping to get an unredacted copy may be today or the  next few days but they outlined an astonishing chain of events in which an  unnamed foreign source came up with some sort of anti-Trump information.</p><p>He gave it to an unnamed Clinton associate, there's much speculation it's a  man name Cody Shirah (ph) who then gave it to the State Department, who  then gave it to Christopher Steele, who then created a report on it, that's  separate -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>YORK:  - from the dossier that was released in BuzzFeed.</p><p>So that's the - that's a pretty amazing course of -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is -</p><p>YORK:  - events.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - incredible.</p><p>Real quick on Bruce Orr -</p><p>YORK:  On -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - because (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>YORK:  - Bruce Orr, we know that after the Justice Department found out  that Christopher Steele was talking to the press, which he shouldn't have  done, they terminated their arrangement with him but they kept in touch  with him through Bruce Orr.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - Incredible.</p><p>Byron, thank you very much.</p><p>Great work on (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>YORK:  Thank you -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>YORK:  - Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to talk with you.</p><p>Byron YORK:</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Take a look at the Futures this morning, down a hundred and seventy points  on top of the worst day in terms of point-lost ever, for the Dow yesterday,  down 1,100 points.

And so, when you look at utilities which are trading  at 30 times earnings, that's really expensive because they're not growing  the top line and their capital-intensive businesses.</p><p>But when you look at technology where they have cash on their balance  sheet.  What does Apple going to do with $250 billion, right?  So they  don't have any debt, so they're not going to be impacted by that and  they're trading less on a PE basis.  So I think this is a reallocation of  capital and risk.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well I mean --</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  When you say risk, I  think you had a moment like this, we have to keep things in perspective but  we also have to ask ourselves, where is the risk?  It's not in corporate  credit right now.  I think it's in federal debt, government debt, and what are they going to  do back in Washington to get them under --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because right now we're facing another spending deadline.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  And pinpoint to  Bitcoin being in a speculative bubble and, again, to reiterate that point  that that was a sign that there was way too much euphoria and momentum, and  even idiocy --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in these markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, I mean, we haven't heard any reaction really.  Well,  the White House thought to distance itself a bit from the market plunge  issuing a statement which read this, \"The president's focus is on long-term  economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with  strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment, and  increasing wages for American workers.\"</p><p>Of course, President Trump has cheered on the booming stock market of  billionaire investor, Mark Cuban made the point that doesn't mean that the  president also should own the decline, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now the argument is, if you talk about on the way up,  you own it on the way down, do you guys agree with that?</p><p>MARK CUBAN, OWNER, DALLAS MAVERICKS:  No, because they should have owned it  on the way up and you don't want to own it on the way down.  So if you're  going to go into the market, do your homework, understand what you're  getting into and understand all the risks.  </p><p>Where people get hurt is that they don't really do their homework and they  don't understand what's involved.  Particularly when the market's gone  straight up for so long and it feels like -- and you have people saying  day-after-day that it's going to keep on going straight up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's a point that obviously, Dagen, you've made for many  months now in terms of the president's response to the stock market.  You  almost wished he would have acknowledged the economic strength, the  fundamentals a lot more than what happened in the stock market even if it  was a direct result.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  The -- I've cautioned the president, not that I would --  I say that the president matters on television but I cautioned him from  crowing about the stock market all the way up and it was month-after-month,  week-after-week that he's been doing this, that the \"Wall Street Journal\"  called it overselling the stock markets record-breaking run as kind of part  of his economic growth, that there is that danger that the market  volatility returns when this happened.</p><p>But the president even was talking about the stock market in his address to  the troops on Thanksgiving about that was part of, again, his poll numbers,  he loves quoting poll numbers, this was a great poll number for him.  What  it does do, it puts him in a sit -- in a position or any other member of  the administration of now having to talk about the stock market when it  falls because he talked about it all the way up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even if you have to believe that the stock market gaining $8  trillion in value is a result of his policies.  But you're right, markets  go up and down and it's stupid to constantly talk about --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Talk about the economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because it's really the economy that is a direct result  and a couple that he has done and led.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But I have to say with his policy is that the whole world  stock markets are rising.  I mean, the whole world had a great run last  year.  So he does get credit for some of this but he can't get credit for  all of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Right.  Well --</p><p>KELLY:  He's the leader of the free world, Jon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first time we're seeing synchronized growth across  the world which is pretty good.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  General Motors looks for positive news and this market slide as it opens  the books today and reports fourth-quarter earnings.</p><p>And also looking for earnings of a $1.38 when the company reports later  this morning, we will bring you those numbers as soon as they hit the tape.   Stock is already up, almost five percent ahead of the numbers. And then  more bad news for Bitcoin this morning, the cryptocurrency loosing half of  its value just since the beginning of 2018.  The number there, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well we want to show you this wild morning for Futures this  morning because there's real volatility already and you see the DOW  Industrial were down 200 earlier then went positive, up about nine, ten  points, now down 141.  S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ have now slipped into negative  territory, again, just fractionally well off below but still negative, so  we're watching this.</p><p>We are also waiting on earnings this morning, Walt Disney, DOW Component,  and General Motors as well.  Lauren Simonetti with a preview new, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Busy day Maria.   Results from General Motors and Disney come at pivotal times for both of  those companies.  Let's do GOOD MORNING first, analysts are expecting  earnings to rise about eight percent from a year ago.  Investors listening  for what the company has to say about production levels, as sales of G.M.'s  new vehicles fall.  </p><p>Analysts also looking today for Disney's earnings for sure to climb about  four percent when they report after the closing bell.  The results are  expected to get a nice clip from Thor: Ragnarok and the Star Wars  franchise.  We're also listening for any updates about Disney's upcoming  ESPN or streaming services.  Let's take a look, you can see G.M. is higher  by almost three percent.  In the premarket, Walt Disney shares are down two  percent.</p><p>Well, stocks aren't the only thing falling today, oil prices now dropping  for day number three, like sweet crude now at $63.73 a barrel, that is down  $0.43 but the crude price still positive in 2018, experts say the global  markets fell off actually straight into the U.S. dollar and a rise in  dollar is sometimes sending the price of the commodities.  </p><p>So we're seeing stocks fall, we're seeing oil fall, we're seeing Bitcoin  Futures plummet 17 percent, check this out, briefly going below 6,000 to  the lowest point in two months, $62.40 now.  With this decline, Bitcoin has  lost more than half of its value this year, this latest selling comes on a  hills of reports of potential price manipulation and hacker activity.  Mind  you that the Senate Banking Committee holds a hearing later this morning  10:00 a.m. Eastern to explore regulatory oversight for Bitcoin and virtual  currencies, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well what wide ride that was.  Bitcoin going all the way up to  20,000.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  In December.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Just a few months ago and now under 6,000, it's really  unbelievable.  We knew it was risky but that's very risky.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.  Lauren, thank you.  Yes, we did know it was  risky, didn't we?  And yet we saw people talking about Bitcoin.  Well, you  like the blockchain technology and you --</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I like the blockchain technology and Bitcoin here because it  helps people that are on bankable right.  So here in the United States we  have the -- we have a great banking system that we can rely on but in  countries like Venezuela, you want to use Bitcoin to get out of there.   There's hyperinflation, I think what started to sell --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's your take on this big selloff here?</p><p>KELLY:  So my big take on this is actually this is actually really good  because this started when Lloyds actually said they're not going to allow  people to buy Bitcoin using credit cards.  So you're starting to see credit  card companies say, \"Hey listen, we're not going to let people buy Bitcoin  on currencies using money they couldn't have.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good idea.</p><p>KELLY:  So this is actually a really, really good thing. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was an epic level of idiocy though in the trading of these  cryptocurrencies just based on my own conversations.  They were even wilder  and crazier, the conversations I had about dot-com stocks back in 2000  where people had strategies about how they were going -- they were trading  all these other cryptocurrencies and it's just nonsense.  These are people  who don't even invest in stocks but, again, get rich quick doesn't exist.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I want to say something about Venezuela, they're actually  using eggs as currency in Venezuela.  Now, they're nowhere near being able  to use some -- like -- something like a cryptocurrency --</p><p>KELLY:  Eggs drop 25 percent too, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's like Weimar Republic inflation in Venezuela, it's insane.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's tragic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a really good point.  All right.  We'll take a break.   When we come back, releasing the Democratic memo now, the House Intel  Committee votes to release the Democratic rebuttal to the GOP memo which  alleges abuses at the top of the FBI.  We tackle the controversy and the  fallout right after this break.</p><p>And we're monitoring the latest breaking market news development, take a  look at Futures here, DOW Industrial down 145 points right now, that's two- thirds of one percent, S&amp;P is down three-quarters of one point.  It's  actually unchanged, it feels like the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ want to go higher  but there's a push and pull going on and it's real volatile this morning,  so stay right here, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Volatility is back for the market this morning.   Take a look at where we stand right here, Futures down 160 points on top of  a decline of almost 1,200 points yesterday.  The S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ are  also trading lower although we have seen a bit of a bounce this morning.  </p><p>We are well off of the lows and the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are going back and  forth between negative and positive territory for the last half an hour.   We want to turn the FISA firestorm ton Capitol Hill meanwhile, the House  Intelligence Committee has voted unanimously to release a classified memo  written by the Democrats as a rebuttal to the documents compiled by  Republican Chairman, Devin Nunes which, of course, alleges abuses at the  top of the FBI in its surveillance of Carter Page.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  This is  what the FBI used to cooperate the dossier which is very, very dangerous to  take political dirt that it was paid for by the Hillary campaign and use it  against your political opponent -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we want to show you this wild morning for futures this  morning. Because this real volatility already and you see the Dow  Industrials, were down 200 earlier, then went positive after nine, 10  points, now down 141.  S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ (INAUDIBLE) negative  territory.  Again just fractionally well-off the lows but still negative.   So we're watching this.  We're also waiting on earnings this morning Walt  Disney, Dow component, and General Motors as well.  Lauren Simonetti with  the preview now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Busy day Maria, we  know some General Motors and Disney comment pivotal times for both of this  company (INAUDIBLE) G.M. first.  Analysts are expecting earnings to rise  about eight percent from the year ago.  Investors listening for what the  company have to say about production levels as sales of G.M.'s new vehicle  fall.  I was also looking today for Disney during (INAUDIBLE) about four  percent when they reported after the closing bell.  </p><p>The results are expected to get a nice lift from \"Thor Ragnarok\" and the  \"Star Wars\" franchise.  We're also listening for any updates about Disneys  upcoming ESPN or streaming services.  Let's take a look, you could see G.M.  is higher by almost three percent in the premarket.  While Disney shares  are down two percent.  Well, stocks aren't the only thing following today.   Oil prices now dropping for day number three.  Likely, crudes at now at 63  - 73 a barrel that is down 43 cents.  But the crude price still positive in  2018.  Experts say the global market selloff actually straightens the US  dollar and arriving dollar is sometimes skimping the price of the  commodity.  Still, we're seeing stock falls, we're seeing oil fall, we're  seeing Bitcoin futures plummet 17 percent, briefly going below 6000, to the  lowest point in two months 6,240 now.  </p><p>Would this decline Bitcoin has lost more than half of its value this year?   This latest selling comes on the hills of reports of potential price  manipulation and hacker activity.  Mind you that the Senate Banking  Committee holds this hearing later this morning 10 a.m. Eastern to explore  regulatory oversight for Bitcoin and virtual currencies, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wild ride that was.  Bitcoin going all the way up to 20,000.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  In December, a few months ago is now under 6000.  It's really  unbelievable.  We knew it was risky but -- but that's very risky.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes it is true.  Lauren, thank you.  We did know it was risky,  didn't we?  And yet we saw people talking about Bitcoin.  Well, you like  the black chain technology.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes I like the black chain technology and Bitcoin here because it  helps people that are un-bankable, right.  So, here in the United States,  we have the -- we have a great banking system that we can rely on.  But in  countries like Venezuela, you want to use Bitcoin to get out of there.   There's hyperinflation, I think what's started to sell off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's your take on this big sell-off?</p><p>KELLY:  So, my big take on this is actually -- this is -- this is actually  really good because this started with Lloyds, actually said they're not  going to allow people to buy Bitcoin using credit cards.  So you're  starting to see credit card companies say: Hey listen, we're not going to  let people buy Bitcoin and currencies using money.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good idea.</p><p>KELLY:  So this is actually really, really good thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was a -- there was a epic level of idiocy though in the  trading of this cryptocurrencies, just based on my own conversations.  They  were even wilder and crazier the conversation I had about.com stocks back  in 2000 where people had strategies about how they were good, they were  trading all these other cryptocurrencies and it's just nonsense.  These are  people who don't even invest in stocks.  But again, get rich quick doesn't  exist.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Other people who don't even invest in stocks.  But again, get  rich quick doesn't exist.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I just want to say something about Venezuela.  They're  actually using eggs as currency in Venezuela.  They're nowhere near being  able to use something like -- something like cryptocurrency.</p><p>KELLY:  Eggs are off 25 percent, too.  So, it's like volatile --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's like -- it's like buy more Republic inflation in Venezuela.   It's insane.</p><p>KELLY:  It's tragic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a really good point.  All right.  We'll take a break.   When we come back, releasing the Democratic memo now.  The House Intel  Committee votes to release the Democratic rebuttal, so the GOP memo which  alleges abuses at the top of the FBI.  We tackle the controversy and the  fallout right after this break.  And we're monitoring the latest breaking  market news development.  Take a look at Futures here.  Dow Industrials  down 145 points right now.  That's two-thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P is down  three-quarters at one point.  It's actually unchanged.  It feels like the  S&amp;P and the NASDAQ want to go higher but there's a push and pull going on.   And it's real volatile this morning, so stay right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Volatility is back for the market this morning.   Take a look at where we stand right here.  Futures down 160 points on top  of a decline of almost 1200 points yesterday.  The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ  are also trading lower, although we have seen a bit of a bounce this  morning.  We are well-off of the lows and the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are going  back and forth between negative and positive territory for the last half an  hour.  I want to turn to the FISA firestorm on Capitol Hill meanwhile.  The  House Intelligence Committee has voted unanimously to release a classified  memo written by the Democrats as a rebuttal to the documents compiled by  Republican Chairman Devin Nunes which, of course, alleges abuses at the top  of the FBI in its surveillance of Carter Page.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NUNES:  This is what the FBI used to cooperate the dossier which is very,  very dangerous to take political dirt that it was paid for by the Hillary  campaign and use it against your political opponent that the FBI used it  and opened up an investigation. </p><p>CARTER PAGE, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER:  Anyone who had any connection  or had ever done any work, positive or otherwise in Russia was constantly  sort of the number one target for attacks.  So, it was a -- you know, it  became a liability pretty quick.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, JR., DONALD TRUMP'S SON:  You have a court that virtually no  one knows anything about, just haphazardly granting full surveillance of  American citizens.  In this case, the duly elected future President of the  United States based on shady information paid for by the opposition party's  candidate in that presidential race.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, a lot was said last night in those interviews on Hannity.   Devin Nunes also stated last night that he is in the middle of an active  investigation looking into the State Department.  Joining us right now is  CRTV.com host Allie Stuckey.  Allie, good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining the conversation here.</p><p>ALLIE STUCKEY, HOST, CRTV.COM:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you expect to hear from this new Democratic memo?   Let's start there.</p><p>STUCKEY:  Yes.  Well, first of all, I am glad that they're releasing the  memo especially after the absolute meltdown that Adam Schiff and the  Democrats have had over the past couple of weeks.  And we have never seen a  party and their cronies in the media pushed back so hard against  transparency.  So, I'm a glad that they're releasing the memo.  I do think  that we might see them address them actually, legitimate concerns that  people have about the Republican memo.  Like was there more information  about Carter Page that justified obtaining a FISA memo and does that  actually mean that the FISA court, the FBI, the DOJ were actually partisan  and bias against President Trump, trying to get him to -- from becoming  president.  </p><p>So, I think to say we'll address that allegation from the Republicans but I  also think that we're going to see some partisan subjectivity from the  Democrats.  They're going to try to cast this as the Republicans trying to  distract from what the Democrats consider to be a very legitimate Russian  investigation.  So, we're going to see some rebuttal of the actual facts  but we're also just going to see some more political posturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we could see some rebuttal, Kevin Kelly.  But the truth  is when you consider the FISA court, this is a court where it doesn't hear  both sides.  It hears the evidence and so it needs all the evidence in  order to, you know, make the proper decisions here, and it wasn't getting  it.  I mean, they didn't -- the FBI did not tell the FISA court that this  dossier was written by -- was, I'm sorry, paid for by Hillary Clinton's  campaign.  And they renewed it three additional times.  So, for four times  they used the same information.  There was no other information used to  actually -- I mean, it was largely based on the dossier.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  And they were even using a Yahoo! article --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which was also based on the dossier.</p><p>KELLY:  Exactly.  The problem that we're having is that there's no  transparency when it comes to FISA court, what the evidence they're looking  at, and it goes back to the -- to the stomping on our fourth amendment  rights, too.  So, I mean, the situation we're having is that you had even  the head of the DNI, right, James Clapper, lied under oath talking about  spying on American citizens, then we start having this.  The question is  becoming when will this end?  When will there be accountability for these  actions?  We're going to be seeing memos come out, but what's going to come  of it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think it's interesting that they are now actively  investigating the State Department.  And obviously, this is Hillary  Clinton's State Department.  You got to -- you got to wonder what comes out  next, Dagen, because I know that there are more texts to be -- to be coming  out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I also point to the judiciary chairman in the Senate, Chuck  Grassley, releasing -- it was an unclassified version of his recent letter  to the Justice Department.  He's urging a criminal investigation into  Christopher Steele, the British spy who put together this dossier with  basically Democrat and Clinton money.  But there is in that -- there are  more problems with what wasn't disclosed to the FISA court threat.  The  fact that Steele was talking to the press in late summer, early fall of  2016.  But Steele acknowledges, according to the Grassley memo, his company  received a report from the U.S. State Department.  But then some of this is  redacted and that the report -- the second in a series was information came  from a foreign sub source who is in touch with redacted a contact and  friend of the Clintons.  So, again, where was the information coming from  and what was told to the FISA court.  The Democrats pushing back on that  but this is -- this is a real -- hopefully, this entire letter is released.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of omissions -- a lot of omissions to the FISA court.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the -- that's the bottom line.  Allie, real quick, final  word from you.</p><p>STUCKEY:  Yes.  Well, I think what the American people want and what we  deserve at this point is transparency.  I think we're a little bit tired of  reading the memos and the competing narratives coming from both sides of  the aisle, I think, that we need to see the underlying information  declassified as well as the FISA warrant and as well as the letter.  More  information, the better.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think people also want to see some accountability here.   We know what has taken place.</p><p>STUCKEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Allie, good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Allie  Stuckey there.</p><p>STUCKEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, surviving the selloff, what investors need to know  right now as we watch volatility ripped this morning.  Dow Industrials down  150 points, the S&amp;P down four points.  And the NASDAQ is now down 20.  10  minutes ago, they were in positive territory.  Plus, say it ain't so, the  end of an era at Best Buy, big news from music lovers.  Back in a moment  right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Volatility is back.  Good morning, everybody.   Breaking news, global markets are selling off again this morning.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us.  It is Tuesday, February 6th, a  bloodbath on Wall Street yesterday, and it spread across the world  overnight.  </p><p>The Dow suffered the worst one-day point ever decline, that would be point  sliding more than four percent that, of course, not among the worst, four  percent, both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 wiping out their 2018 gains, all of  those gains, yesterday alone.  </p><p>Asia following the lead of the U.S. overnight, take a look at Japan, the  Nikkei Average plunged nearly 5five percent on the day.  It is officially  now in correction territory that's down 10 percent from the most recent  high.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, declines across the board once again, the major  markets in London, Paris, Frankfort, all down roughly two percent, as you  see there, the CAC Quarante down two and a quarter percent.  </p><p>It's been a wild morning, though, for Futures, check out what's happening  right now, Dow Industrials now down better than 200 points, down about one  percent, the S&amp;P 500, 10 minutes ago, was positive, it was up nine points,  now it's down 11 points, one half of one percent.  </p><p>Similar story with the NASDAQ, it was up just a few minutes ago, now it's  down 27 points, or one half of a percent.  We've been waiting on volatility  for a year and a half.  We got it going this morning, wild swings for  Futures, right now.  Joining us right now to talk more about that is  William Studebaker, he is the CEO of ROBO Global.  Good to see you,  William, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>WILLIAM STUDEBAKER, CEO, ROBO GLOBAL:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, give us a look behind the curtain.  What has been going  on in terms of robotics and trading in these last two days?  What have you  seen?</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  Well, we've actually seen pretty measured behavior, I would  say for the most parts, investors recognize that this is a long-term trend  and I don't think a lot of our investors are pretty spooked by this.  </p><p>When you think about the growth that's inherent in these technologies -- I  mean, most of our investors are now coming to the conclusion that these are  foundational technologies that are being applied to, you know, all  industries and all markets, so the narrative, really, here is about growth  and what these technologies can do to drive better productivity and better  growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So once again, investors are looking beyond the daily moves and  actually pointing to stuff that we've been talking about, Dagen, and that  is a firmer backdrop in terms of earnings, in terms of economic growth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The market run-up is justified but it's the issue of it got  ahead of itself.  It went up too fast.  And one thing to point out is  because you talk about your investors, but individual investors finally  started getting into this market really in January with more than a $100  billion going into equity, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.  And  that is if you are looking at warning signs that would be something to be  concerned about here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  Well, as you look at our investor base, I think when you think  about this index of companies that we've actually created, less than two  percent of these companies are in traditional indices, this is not really  overly own growth, if you will.  I think we're very in nearly days here and  the awareness is just beginning to, kind of, increase so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sounds like you're bullish.</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  I'm very bullish.  When we think again about these  technologies as an investor, I couldn't be more excited when you think  about the types of innovations that we're going to see in the coming years.   This is unprecedented.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to hear about these innovations.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I was going to say the true testament of an ETF is the  inflows and outflows and you've seen people getting allocations to  robotics, to Artificial Intelligence, and consistently adding to that.  So  when you get a selloff like this, they add more exposure, they actually  don't sell the exposure and when you talk about the two percent overlay and  the exposure they have now, they can't get it anywhere else and can't talk  about what that exposure is, because I see some of these names, Zebra  Technologies, Cognex, I mean, these are traditional names people are  getting exposure to throughout their ETFs.  So what are these companies  doing?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you can't find these companies near the index, you're  saying?</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  Very difficult.  We invest across the entire valued chain of  technologies and applications, everything that supports robotics automation  A.I.  So think about technologies in machine visions, companies in the U.S.  like Cognex or Kiosk in Japan.  Surgical robotics, companies like intuitive  surgical, when you think about the in equators, like Rockwell Automation,  ADB, its fans across the entire universe of technology and applications.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But William, when one thing goes down, they all -- I  mean, we're talking about a market that was down 1100 points yesterday, so  whether you're in robotics or you're in, you know, financials, you got hit.</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  Sure, we can't escape the correlations and markets saw go to  one.  And so, after the self-adjust, people kind of pick up the balls and  figures out where the growth is.  And when you think about it here, this is  really the future growth, technologies like robotics and A.I. are enabling  huge, sort of, innovation prosperity.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I want to ask you about two things, one is the broader market  and other is your specialty on Artificial Intelligence.  On the broader  market, how do you explain what happened yesterday, what are investors  waking up to that they were attuned to a couple weeks ago?  On A.I., tell  us how it's affecting -- how it's actually changing the economy, where are  you seeing these technologies changing the way people do business and work?</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  So you think about the market move, I think, it starts for the  first time, what are we talking about?  We are talking about growth.  I  mean, we've been in an economic stall mode for better part of the last  decade.  </p><p>So I think there's an adjustment process going out here where we are  actually pricing in growth and maybe some potentials in inflations.  So,  you know, it is sort of, you know, change, or adjustment for the market and  I think that's what they're -- that's what we are going through and I think  it's definitely healthy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, one thing to point out, because you were talking about the  stocks not being wildly held and a lot of the other indexes or indices, all  of the major market indexes except for the NASDAQ and the NASDAQ 100 are in  the red for the year.  The hardest hit, so far this year, are smaller  companies.  The very ones that you're talking about, the Russell 2000 is  down almost three percent.  That's -- that of all the major stock market  gauges, that's the hardest hit so far for sure.</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  Our indices actually still, modestly up by the year.  It  certainly had a pretty good adjustment the last, you know, three or four  trading sessions, down probably eight or nine percent, given the move  that's had in the last two weeks, up around 50 percent plus.  </p><p>Again, this is adjustment that we, sort of, welcome, there are a lot of  investors who've been trying to get a foot here in this market,  particularly in our index, if you're watching, it go straight up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you haven't seen individuals or ETF holders get nervous  then, is what you're saying?</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even with the thousand points yesterday?</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  I think, believe it or not, the valuation of our index is  actually 20 -- the median P.E. is 21 times forward earnings.  Certainly not  too demanding relative to the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All the retail trading platforms yesterday, all of the retail  Web sites like mutual fund company Web sites, S-L-O-W, really slow.  It was  hard to execute trades.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's not good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, not just individual --</p><p>KELLY:  So we're talking about investing things here, and I think one of  the things that's being lost is that, if I will invest in robotics and  A.I., I will invest for the long term, will.i.am said that too in Davos,  Maria, where he's investing for 2030 and in this  --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this is not the 90s anymore.  I mean, you're not saying,  oh, like, I want to buy a stock and get rich tomorrow, I mean, maybe you  are in Bitcoin.  But in the stock market, I think people are a lot smarter  today than what we were looking at.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I want to ask, take it back to the economy, tell us how A.I.,  Artificial Intelligence, the companies you're investing in, are actually  changing the economy in the way people do business right?  Now, give us an  example --</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  Well, I think a big thing of what A.I. does, it's smart  automation, it's about automated task, it's about bringing better  productivity.  Think about how it's being used in medical industry in terms  of, you know, medical imagery, when a -- when a doctor can look at a cancer  cell, he probably has a 10 percent error there.  You have a machine through  its A.I. that can look at, you know, a million visions or images of a  cancer cell and can determine basically with 99.99 percent accuracy, you  know, that's a -- you know, that's a cancer cell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Who is doing that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can be done today is incredible.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Pardon me.  Who's doing that?</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  Well, you've obviously got lots of these, beginning to work on  that technology right now.  But this is going to evolve and these  technologies are really exciting, I don't think the people should  underestimate the types of innovations going on and what this world is  going to look like in three to five years from now, I think people are  going to have a hard time predicting it, that's that much change going now.   When you think about what's going, robotics and A.I., then think about ADO  Manufacturing, Material Science, Blockchain Technology --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Is it going to kill jobs in the process?</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  I don't think so.  I think this is all about -- you know,  robots are working alongside people.  Look at the narrative that each  happening in Amazon, Amazon began its, sort of, automation initiative three  years ago, they started out with 45,000 warehouse employees, they've added  100,000 robots, yet they've added 45,000 employees.  So in many cases,  there's a big disconnect between how the perception is of where automation  -- what it's doing employment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.  I think we are at a moment in time right  now where we are going to see a very changed economy in just the next five  years or so, and you are investing in it so, good for you, William, good to  see you.</p><p>STUDEBAKER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, William Studebaker joining us there.  We'll  take a break.  When we come back, unbelievable new drone video to show you,  it's a 50-car pile-up in Missouri, check this picture out, the dramatic  aftermath of the crash caused by a nasty winter storm.  And then saying  goodbye to banks, banks are closing branches at the fastest clip in years.   We will tell you why, yes, it has a lot to do with technology, back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The very latest right now on the markets.  Take  a look at futures, we've been watching a very volatile situation this  morning.  We're now close to the lows again.  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average down 250 points right now, better than one percent.  The NASDAQ and  the S&amp;P 500 were down, up, they were up, and now down again.  The NASDAQ  down 30 points right now, one-half of one percent.  </p><p>We're also watching a community this morning in mourning after a sheriff's  deputy is killed in the line of duty.  Lauren Simonetti with that story  now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, Maria, you know, people lining the streets in Colorado  Springs to pay respect to Deputy Mike Flick, he was shot and killed while  he was investigating a stolen vehicle; the suspect also shot and killed at  the scene.  Two other sheriff deputies and bystander were shot.  Flick,  here he is, was described as an outstanding detective; he leaves behind  wife and 7-year-old twins.  </p><p>Well, a Missouri Fire Department is sharing pretty incredible video from a  drone.  It shows the aftermath of a huge but, unfortunately, deadly pile-up  on Interstate 44.  Look at that!  This all happened during the snowstorm on  Sunday and a very icy condition that ensued.  The crash was near  Springfield and involved several vehicles and tractor trailers; it resulted  in the death of a 63-year-old woman.  </p><p>While banks are closing their branches at a pace we've never ever seen  before.  According to the Wall Street Journal, more than 1700 bank branches  were closed in the 12 months ended in June last year.  Banks are closing in  less profitable regions and adjusting to more people making transactions at  ATM's not using teller.  Capital One Financial shut more than 30 percent of  its branches over a five-year period.  22 percent of SunTrust Bank  franchise were closed during that time as well.  Capital One share, as you  can see, up 15 percent over the past year.  SunTrust up about 20.  </p><p>Well, the end of an era, right?  Best Buy is pulling the CDs from its store  shelf.  It used to be one of the -- but is sets an overwhelming --  decision.  Well, how do people feel about this in social media?  One person  is tweeting, \"Starting July 1st, Best Buy isn't going to be selling C.D.s  anymore.  I feel a bit betrayed.\"  And another writing, \"A sad, awful day  for entertainment.  Best Buy pulling C.D.s in July.  Terrible.  Getting  difficult now to go somewhere and buy a disk.\"  Shares of Best Buy, they  are up 52 percent in the past year but we were just talking about the  success of Apple Music, and Spotify.  Lots of folks are streaming.  So,  where are you going to buy a C.D. now, I don't know?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Remember the days when you had, like, big stores that just sold  C.D.s and albums?  </p><p>KELLY:  What am I going to put in my Walkman?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I'm feeling pretty old because I'm remembering the days when I  was buying record albums.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, Kevin, you were born after the -- right?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my, God, you're busted.  Thank you so much, Lauren.  Coming  up, Iraq (INAUDIBLE).  General Jack Keane will join me next to break down  what this major troop ship has meant.  A drawdown of our soldiers in Iraq.   Then. the very latest on the budget showdown and its impact on military  spending.  Stay right there.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This has been a volatile morning for markets this is morning,  everybody.  Take a look at the Futures and what we're seeing, it's real  volatile.  Dow Industrials' down 243 points; the NASDAQ is firmly in  negative territory once again after trading up about half an hour ago, it  is now down 44 points, and the S&amp;P 500 is weaker by about 15.  We're  watching markets on the heels of an 1100 points selloff in the Dow  yesterday -- the worst point decline ever.  </p><p>Shutdown showdown, meanwhile, with government funding set to expire this  Thursday.  House Republicans are expected to vote on a temporary spending  bill later today, that provides Pentagon funding for a full year.  The  proposal would keep the government open until March 23rd and lift budget  caps to provide $659 billion in defense funding.  President Trump called on  Democrats yesterday to support military spending, that was during his trip  to Ohio.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  But believe it or not, Nancy  Pelosi and those in Congress who want to raise your taxes, they want to  raise your taxes, they don't want to give the money to the military where  we need it.  You know, without the military, we might not be here.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>TRUMP:  Or we might not be here for long, believe me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This coming at the Trump administration is reportedly expected  to ask lawmakers for $716 billion for defense spending in the fiscal 2019  budget.  Let's talk about the 18 budget and 19 budget right now with Fox  News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to  see you, sir.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIST ANALYST:  Good to see  you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, as a four-star general, as a person who has watched, an  expert watch what the military needs, what is your take on what you would  like to see out of this Congress this week and beyond in terms of military  spending, general? </p><p>KEANE:  What we absolutely need is to stop the continuing resolution.  So,  our audience understand as the word continues in resolution applies, what  that means is that we're continuing the old funding level.  So, we're  continuing Obama's old funding levels, which means we only have five out of  58 brigades combat ready.  Half the airplanes are not flying due to spare  parts.  The military is the smallest it's been in 75 years.  Not a single  penny has been added to the budget in 2018 because they haven't passed an  appropriations bill and they continue the resolutions of the past, which  means there is no rebuilding of the military.  Now, we're talking about  going to March which will be six months into this fiscal year with no new  money for the military at all.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why can't they get past March 23rd and why can't they come into  agreement on this when we all know the threats in this country and against  this country have gone straight up?  </p><p>KEANE:  Well, there's a couple of things, there's not consensus on removing  sequestration or the budget caps.  So, what they'll likely do is  temporarily either suspend them or increase the budget cap numbers so the  defense budget can go up.  The Democrats are pushing back on the defense  budget, not in principal -- there's something wrong with increasing  defense, but they want to like increase, Maria, in nondefense domestic  issues and that is where the political impasse is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible to me that the Democrats want to stand on this  not to support the military. yet Defense Secretary Jim Mattis headed to the  Hill, general.  He's going to testify before the House Armed Services  Committee on the national defense strategy.  You were on the Congressional  Commission for National Defense Strategy, what do you want to see there and  what are your expectations from today's hearing?  </p><p>KEANE:  Well, I've been through that strategy in detail as a part of the  commission and we're going to give a preliminary report, and then a final  report in a few months.  And we actually think the new vector that the  administration has and the Defense Department is right on the mark.  We're  in an era of big power competition with Russia and China, emphasis, long- term strategic competitive China to be sure, rogue states North Korea and  Iran, and still maintain the threat of terrorism.  This is looking at the  world, Maria, as it truly is, crafting a strategy to deal with that and  also asking the Congress, give us the resources to cope with that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you would think that that's what they want to do, by  the way.  Let's turn to the war on terror for a moment general.  American  forces are reducing the number of troops in Iraq, that's according to  Associated Press.  An Iraqi government spokesperson attributed the U.S.  drawdown to defeating ISIS militants in the region.  Your reaction,  General, where are we?  </p><p>KEANE:  Well, first of all, a troop deserve a lot of praise on what they're  able to accomplish, helping the Iraqis, take back that country, which has  largely been done.  We're reducing troops but we're not ending our troop  commitment in Iraq, like the Obama did after the Bush surge was so  successful.  We're not going to make that mistake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point, general, that was a huge mistake.  Great to see  you, sir, as always.  You are a superstar, General Jack Keane joining us.   We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.

Good Tuesday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning, I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Happy Tuesday.  It is Tuesday, February 6th.  Your top stories  right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Breaking news this morning the  global sell-off is continuing, futures are indicating a decline at the  start of trading this morning of 182 points as three-quarters of 1 percent.   And I should point out that that is off of the lows this morning.  The  NASDAQ is down 15 and the S&amp;P is down six, this comes of course after  stocks tumbled yesterday with the Dow posting the largest single-day point  decline ever closing down nearly 1,200 points on the day that wasn't the  low.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 wiped out the year's gains with yesterday's  performance alone.  The declines sending shockwaves across the world  overnight and this morning.  </p><p>First overnight take a look at Asia overnight, markets tip a nose-dive the  worst performers were Japan and Hong Kong with the Hang Seng index down  better than five percent and the Nikkei average in Japan down four and  three-quarters percent.  And then there's Europe, markets are open right  now and they are trading down.  You got steep declines across the board in  Europe, the FT 100 down 1.8 percent as you can see the market there hitting  the lowest level in over a year.  The CAC Quarante is down 2-2/3 percent  and the DAX Index down 2-1/4 percent.  The turmoil coming as investors are  watching earnings this morning from some big names.  </p><p>General Motors reported earnings and revenue that were above expectations  for the fourth quarter.  G.M. stock is up 1-1/2 percent, we're also  watching Disney because the Walt Disney company is going to be reporting  its fourth quarter after the close tonight.  We're also watching shares of  I'm sorry Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin is down.  The cryptocurrency fell  below $6,000 in earlier trading.  It is now down half of its value since  just the beginning of the year.  All those stories coming up this morning  and joining me to break it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  the Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath and  Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly.  Rough day at the office.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY &amp; COMPANY:  Yes, it's very interesting  though that, you know, stock are declining and G.M. is beating earnings.  I  kind of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's sort of the story.  It's the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I'll tell you why G.M.  is beating because they sold 20 percent more of their Chevy Equinox as well  as their Chevy Traverses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The SUV?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The SUVs.  They're higher margin products.  So, for example,  the Chevy Equinox, they sold 20 percent more.  The average selling price  was $3,000 more than the previous year's version.  But, you know, when you  look at the markets and we're off the lows right and VIX's hit above VIX  uncertainty indicator and last time it hit 50 was in August of 2015.  And  then the market rebounded from there, so this is really a capitulation and  the bottom could be starting to come in as we started to flesh out some of  the weaker hands in --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you see a bottom?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think -- well there is a couple -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the horizon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  So I see a bottom one because when VIX hits 50 or above  at those extreme levels then it comes down the market rises back up, right?   So the stream uncertainty has hit and then it is over.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  The markets are more stable  than they were last night.  The Dow futures at one point were down 750  points and overnight trading but we still have not seen these market gages  hit correction territory.  The closest would be the Dow transports are down  nine percent from the recent record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  is down eight and a half percent.  So watch for on the Dow 23,955 and  change that would be a 10 percent correction from the recent record.   </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great info, Dagen.  We want to get to this market here because  the Dow posted the largest ever single-day point decline in history  yesterday.  But we have been putting it in context this morning basically  saying, yes, four percent is not in the top in terms of the decline, so on  a point basis yes it was a terrible day but not so when you look at the  overall.  President Trump, of course, has touted tax reform and economic  growth for the last year and a half and he was in Ohio yesterday doing the  same -- Blake Burman is at the White House right now with the  administration's reaction to the stock market sell-off.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to  you.  You are right.  The White House has been touting the stock market at  success at almost a daily clip here but yesterday once this rout settled,  they tried to hit the pause button for a second and instead take a look at  the longer-term picture.  The White House Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders  putting out a statement which said the following, ''The President's focus  is on our long-term economic fundamentals which remain exceptionally strong  with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment and  increasing wages for American workers.  The President's tax cuts and  regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. Economy and continue to  increase prosperity for the American people.''  The Vice President who has  just landed in South Korea when he was in route yesterday was asked about  this and he said the market drop was due to the ebbs and flows of the  market.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The most important  numbers to focus on are the fundamentals.  The fundamentals of this economy  continue to be very strong.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now the Dow precipitous drop came as President Trump was in Ohio  touting tax reform.  This is an event that The President would normally  talk about the stock market successes but yesterday he did not mention the  volatility.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Factoring are coming back,  everything is coming back they all want to be where the action is.  America  is once again open for business.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Maria, as we saw yesterday The White House is planning still on  putting The President out on the road touring this new tax code, new tax  bill but yesterday's event could not have come at a worse time  realistically for this president because it was one of the rare times that  when The President was out there giving a big speech instead the cameras  were turning elsewhere as the market was dipping into the red.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  It's tough day for sure.  Blake, thank you so much.   Blake Burman joining us right now.  A Member of the House Appropriations  Committee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann of Tennessee.  Congressman, good to  see you this morning.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Good morning.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you see in terms of this market sell-off?  What are the  implications here from your standpoint?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well obviously I think we've seen unprecedented highs in the  stock market, the economy is doing well, unemployment is low.  People have  more money in their pockets because of the tax cuts.  I have never seen  fundamentals look so good in a long time.  Now we have to be cognizant that  the stock market is a market and there is speculation, people invest and  then like I think one of the things with the economy doing so well across  the board is some people may look for other places to put their money in  addition to the stock market.  So I think we need to be positive, I think  we need to work together.  And I think as legislators we need to provide a  very conducive environment for business to continue to do well I think  we're doing that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess what I was asking is, you know, Alan Greenspan, Jon,  you know this used to talk about the wealth effect.  And this market is up  $8 trillion since the election.  Well now obviously 4-1/2 trillion since  the election but that was a factor.  Are there implications in terms of  economic growth as a result of the sell-off?  That is my question.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think as long as market settles down and it looks like it  will then that will -- their wealth effect is still in there because we're  still talking about net gains for most people on their 401(k) plans.  And  we're still talking about companies net, seeing their share prices up and  being more optimistic about investing and spending money.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and also 90 percent of workers in this country this month  saying higher wages because of tax cuts so it's not just the stock market  but it's also -- they have real cash on hand because of what Congress has  done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it is great, Congressman I mean you did a good job on  the tax plan.  We're waiting to see the implications of it because we know  that people have more money in their pockets but you've got another issue  on your hands with this short-term measuring to fund the government.   Through March 23rd I've heard another shutdown while funding the defense  department for a full year?  I mean how can you -- how can you -- how do  you justify living from you know one resolution to the next?  One  continuing resolution to the next?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, as a house appropriator as you know last year we passed  all 12 house appropriation bills.  We did our job and we want to get back  to what we could locally call regular order.  In other words, the House and  the Senate appropriations committee is doing job passing budgets and  getting it down.  Unfortunately, we are in an environment largely due to  the Senate rules where they need 60 to get something done, we saw Schumer  shutdown which I thought was detrimental.  It was short thank goodness but  it's not easy to get things done right now in Washington, D.C.  So we just  have to continue to work hard.  On part of the House Republicans and house  appropriator such as myself we're doing our job, we're going to do it again  this year and we're just going to stay at it and we just hope that other  people who serve are the legislators in both parties and both bodies do  their job.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Congressman, two questions for you.  First of all on the  budget, well, how is this year pass a budget resolution and the budget.   Second of all one of the reasons the stock market is falling now is because  long-term interest rates are going up, one of the reasons long-term  interest rates are going up it seems is that we're looking at budget  deficits that are going to exceed a trillion dollars in another year or  two.  What are Republicans in Congress going to do about a trillion-dollar  budget deficits? </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, I think fundamentally we need to look long-term at  mandatory spending issues, we're seeing the effects, the ill effects of the  budget control act which is really squeezed, discretionary spending hurt  defense and hurt other domestic spending.  But the real problem is that we  have seen the dollars available on discretionary side of the budget  equation continue to shrink and that is going to happen unless we address  this in a larger sense.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So what are you going to do to address it?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, I think we need to have everyone from the  administration, the Senate, the House Republicans and Democrats actually  look to fiscal reform.  I think a balanced budget amendment which actually  I had the privilege of voting for would be a step in the right direction.   Let's face it, I come from a state -- the great state of Tennessee that has  a constitutional amendment in a state constitution to balance its budget.   We have no debt in Tennessee, if you look at some other states don't have  that in their constitutions, they are never going to get out of red I  think.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  How would you balance it what would you cut?  You just said  you don't want to cut discretionary spending so what would you cut?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, we have to reform I'd rather use the term reform when  we look at the whole picture, we have to see where we're spending our  dollars that is on the mandatory side of the equation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid?  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, talk about interest on the national debt.  We're  talking about interest rates, pressure on interest rates to go up and I do  think you'll see interest rates go up.  When you were borrowing -- when  you're $20 trillion in debt, if you are a borrow and interest rates go up  that is not good, that is not good if you are an individual borrower, that  is not good if a country that is borrowing and let's face it we are at a  time where other countries like China are buying up our national debt.   That is not good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a point you have made umpteen times, Dagen in terms of  the interest.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but in Congress, what do you do to control the actual  interest rate that's paid on the debt?  That is -- that is a market unless  you are -- unless you are telegraphing to the Federal Reserve that you want  the Federal Reserve to -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And that is rising now because debt is going up so much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It -- the -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, the cost of debt that's actually selling off -- the  price -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the cost of debt, that is right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The interest on the national debt in a few years is going to  surpass what we spend on defense every year.  Just that 80 percent of the  growth in spending is entitlements and the interest on the debt in the --  over the next decade.  So to that point when is anybody going to have the  gumption to step up and say OK it is time to get our arms around  entitlements?  And really you are going to have to -- at some point cut  what people receive from the federal government in terms of Social  Security, Medicare and Medicaid and Republicans couldn't do it with just  Medicaid last year.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I'd rather again use the term reform, we never want the scare  our senior's people 55 and over will be safe and they ought to be safe.   But we got to look at the long-term prospects for our country.  Also, the  numbers are not good, we have baby boomers, people my age and older who are  going on through the Social Security and Medicare every day.  We need to be  protected, we don't need to engage in a game political scare.  Right now we  are in a very -- most of its time politically, a game of one-upsmanship.   So we need to sit down come up with good ideas, we should have done this on  healthcare, Obamacare was a budget buster because most of that spending was  where?  On the mandatory side of the spending equation.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It doesn't sound like -- it doesn't like you want to go there  on Social Security and Medicare and like that, something you want to talk  about actually reforming or cutting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or after their midterm elections probably.  You are going to  cut -- are you going to cut these mandatory things during in an election  year?  I don't think so -- </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When is it -- when is it volatile politically?  Because you guys  are up -- right, you guys are up from re-election every two years.  So it  is -- it is always -- there is always that hot potato, that football if you  will.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, let's look at things that we can all agree on.  If we  have growth and I think we are going to have growth from this tax cut,  we're going to see the economy grow.  So that's going to be good for  everyone.  Employers hiring, unemployment is at an all-time low, we are  going to see people with more money if people who have jobs and are  spending we are going to see a healthier economy and things will go better  that way.  So you will have more dollars actually feeding those kiddies  that need to be fed.  If people are unemployed and we have gone through the  great recession that we did, starting in 2008 and they're not feeding these  programs in terms -- with the revenue, there is going to be a problem.  So  growth is going to be a key term factor in this as well as spending reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So growth is the priority right now we got it.   Congressman, it's good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN  Great to be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chuck Fleischmann, joining us.  We will be right back.  Stay  with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are selling off this morning once again.   We are seeing a continuation of that global meltdown yesterday.  Dow  Industrials down 220 points right now.  And futures were expecting they  said a tough opening for the stock market.  General Motors is out with its  latest quarterly earnings this morning meanwhile.  That stock is actually  up even though we're seeing the rest of the market trade down.  Lauren  Simonetti with the details there.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Maria.  Let's first  take a look how G.M. shares or trading right now in premarket trading after  the company reported better than expected quarterly results on an adjusted  basis, $40.02 of share, that's a gain of 48 cents.  G.M. did take its  charge who does a tax reform $7.3 billion in the quarter.  But they have a  record operating profit.  Thanks to big demand for their profitable pickup  trucks and SUVs.  Vehicle sales did rise about one percent from a year ago  to almost nine million vehicles sold in a quarter.  We're going to get  results from Dow component, Walt Disney after the close today.  Analysts  they're looking for earnings for share at about four percent from a year  ago, the result expected to get a lift from Thor: Ragnarok and from Star  Wars.  </p><p>Investors going to pay close attention to anything the company says about  ESPN, ESPN plus order other streaming services.  Shares a Disney down $1.95  in the premarket right now.  Well, how low will they go?  Bitcoin was  plummeting, briefly below $6,000 earlier this morning but then it actually  turned positive.  So we continue to watch the price of Bitcoin obviously  down sharply from 20,000 back in December.  Bitcoin has lost more than half  of its value this year, there's the chart.  This latest selling comes on  report of potential price manipulation and hacker activity and lawmakers  will explore regulatory oversight for virtual currencies in general at a  hearing later this morning.  </p><p>Let's move on to our final story which has to do with oil prices, they're  dropping for a third day.  Light sweet crude now at $63.00 a barrel,  experts say the global market sell-off actually strengthens the dollar and  arising U.S. dollar makes commodities more expensive for foreign buyers.   Oil still positive in 2018, taking a look at shares of ExxonMobil, shares  of Chevron, both of them are lower in premarket trading.  </p><p>And Vice President Mike Pence in Japan today.  On his way to the Olympics  in South Korea and he's delivering a tough message for North Korea.   Pence's says he doesn't want North Korea to hijack the games because it's  participating on a joint team with South Korea.  The Vice President is  bringing the father of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who was  imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months died last June.  Pence also  visiting a memorial to the 46th South Korean sailors killed in a 2010  torpedo attack which was attributed to the North Korea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Lauren.  We want to take a break  real quick and look at futures as we go to the break.  Take a look at this  performance after Monday's 1,100 points sell-off in the Dow.  We're  expecting the Dow to open down almost 300 points this morning better than  one percent.  The S&amp;P is down three-quarters of a percent as the NASDAQ  right now.  Plus Mark Cuban speaking out on a stock market fly.  Well, the  billionaire entrepreneur says he's not worried about the Dow plunge  yesterday.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The sell-off in stocks continues this morning  after yesterday's historic market plunge, futures are indicating another  rough beginning for this market today.  Dow Industrials down better than  300 points right, that's 1-1/4 percent.  Of course, the Dow suffered its  biggest ever one-day point decline yesterday falling nearly 1200 points at  the close.  Joining us right now is Nancy Tengler, she is Heartland  Financial Chief Investment Officer, she's also the author of The Women's  Guide to Successful Investing.  Nancy, good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>NANCY TENGLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HEARTLAND FINANCIAL:  Thanks,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, your take on the sell-off, what would you be doing  today, what are you telling clients?</p><p>TENGLER:  We are actually buying, we have taken about five percent out of  stocks and bonds on January 2nd, put in non-correlated assets and today  we'll be enabling away at large-cap, big names, you know, some of the  pharma, some of the Industrials  that have -- that didn't --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Why isn't that today the day to buy?</p><p>TENGLER:  Well, we like -- we called -- I mean, I hate to say this because  I'm not a market timer but we had called for a market timer but we had  called for a market correction in July, way too early, we just thought we  were way ahead of ourselves.  I thought the market would sell off in  January, I didn't.  And so now this is the opportunity we have been looking  for.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It went up so much since then, why wouldn't it keep going down  if we thought it was overvalued in July, isn't it still valued today?  </p><p>TENGLER:  I mean, the fundamentals are super strong.  We got earnings  revisions from 11 percent this year up to 17.9.  The market P.E. on an  estimated basis is now at 17 times next year's earnings, if you look at the  10-year it's come down so that's helpful.  And we just think the  fundamentals are very strong and we want to be owners here.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, I think if you -- there's the old market ad, right? You take  the stairs up the elevator down when it comes to the market so when we see  a big fall like this, this gives opportunity to get into a market that's  trading at 17 times earnings but we're seeing earnings grow at 20 percent  and especially with the dollar coming down.  Do you think the dollar is  going to be a big tailwind going into the second half of the year to help a  lot of these corporations because everyone is talking about one time taxes,  you know and we're seeing, you know, that's going to push for the first half  but what's the second half of the story? </p><p>TENGLER:  Yes.  That's a difficult one to measure.  I mean, we've been  beneficiaries of and have written quite a bit about the dollar.  Does it  stay here?  I mean, with cash -- if I'm a CFO, I want the repatriate my  crash at these levels, right?  So, if that happens and we see foreign  investors looking at our yields, I think that becomes a compelling story  for maybe a little push-up in dollar, but I don't think it's going to  return to the levels we saw a year ago so quickly.  </p><p>KELLY:  I have one more -- so this is the important thing I think about the  market, the corporations are buying right now because the blackout periods.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  So this is why you want to buy right now because corporations are  going to come in and start purchasing.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Yes.  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they're not buying back their stock now because they're  reporting earnings.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Right.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes. Blackout period.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Right.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point.  So, it sounds like you're happy that we have  a sell-off because it's giving the investors an opportunity to get back in,  this just a sell-off and the fundamentals backed up for the stock market is  pretty strong.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Yes.  Absolutely.  I mean, we wanted to see this, this is like  pruning, this is a controlled brush fire, I mean, it didn't feel controlled  yesterday on the floor and it a was pretty wild but yes, no, we wanted to  see this and this is what we were waiting for because we had to take a lot  off the table we were way overweighted.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But is there any really way to know given the unprecedented  stimulus that you've had for instance for banks around the globe starting  with the financial crisis in 2008 of how overvalued asset classes and where  people are most exposed.  Again, you only find -- found out who is swimming  naked when the tide goes out.  And that's something with as Federal Reserve  really pares back that giant balance sheet as interest rates continue to  rise, this could be something that plays out literally over years not just  a matter of days. </p><p>TENGLER:  Agreed.  I do agree, Dagen but I do think that we have the  benefit of a strong underlying fundamental economy and corporate CEOs that  are making actually decent decisions and unexpected decisions with the tax  cuts and so I think that's going to provide a floor if you will on-- and  with the stock buybacks, I do think that we're going to see continued moves  up at least for the next 12 months.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nancy, before you go, you got to talk just about this book, the  Women's Guide to Success for Investing, you say that women outperformed men  when it comes to investing.  </p><p>TENGLER:  We did.  We tend to be a little more deliberate, thoughtful and  less risk-focused, not less competitive but less willing to trade and that  generates excess return over the long term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just being patient.</p><p>TENGLER:  Just being patient buying great companies.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll leave it there.  Nancy, great insights from you.  Thanks  so much.  </p><p>TENGLER:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nancy Tengler joining us there.  Coming up, the White House  weighs in on the global stock market decline, futures indicating another  sharp sell-off at the start of trading down 300 points after a stock sell- off yesterday.  White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley will join  me next live.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news this morning.  A global market  sell-off continues this morning.  Thanks for joining us, everybody.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, February 6th.  We're an hour away from  the open on Wall Street.  It has been a volatile morning for stocks.  Take  a look at futures right now down 350 points.  At one point, the S&amp;P and the  NASDAQ this morning were actually up.  The NASDAQ right now is down 61  points and the S&amp;P down 29 points.  So volatility is back and we're  expecting another rough open this morning.  This, of course, one day after  the Dow suffered the worst one-day point decline ever sliding better than  four percent, that was almost 1200 points lower on the day.  As, you know,  1200 points is the worst point ever but four percent is not.  We are seeing  this market trade down having said that more this morning.  The Dow and the  S&amp;P 500 have now wiped out, any gains for 2018 in a day they wiped that out  for the 1200-point sell-off.  That bloodbath spreading across the world.</p><p>Meanwhile, Asia took a cue from the U.S. last night and markets were down  sharply.  The Nikkei Average in Japan plunged nearly five percent, this is  -- this is -- this is not right.  What does this Asian markets 2-1/2  percent?  That was wrong but we want to tell you the specifics because Hong  Kong was down more than five percent overnight and Japan was down almost  five percent, more than four percent.  These are the closing numbers last  night overnight for the Asian markets.  So there you go.  This is the  accurate numbers here.  Sorry about that.  The market is now down 10  percent from the record-high in Japan, so that is correction mode with that  4-3/4 percent sell-off.  In Europe this morning, declines across the board  as you can see, the European indices down about two percent apiece.  The  major markets in London, Paris, Frankfurt all down better than two percent  this morning.  Joining me right now to talk more about these markets is  White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.  Hogan, good to see you.   Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  Great to see you, Maria.   Thanks for the time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So in a statement, the President said he's focused on long-term  economic fundamentals, that was yesterday.  What is the president's  reaction to this market sell-off that we're watching?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Look, the same that we talked about yesterday is the same today.   The fundamentals of the American economy are really strong, some of your  guests have alluded to that very fact.  This morning we've seen, you know,  7,000 percent increase in the stock market.  We heard on the Obama  administration that 1.9 percent GDP was the new normal, manufacturing would  never come back to our shores.  All those things have been turned around in  this -- under this president's policy, not to mention the fact GDP is now  at -- hovering around three percent for the first time in the better part  of the decade.  So the fundamentals of this American economy are strong and  the American people quite frankly are seeing the effect.  He was in Ohio  just yesterday talking to the Schafer Corporation, several companies were  represented there, giving thousand dollar bonuses to their employees, wages  are going up for the first time in eight years, so overall, the soundness  of this economy is indisputable.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, there's no doubt that the economic backdrop  is very strong, we know that, I mean, now for the first time we're hearing  expectations of 5.4 percent growth for the first quarter but we also know  how focused this president has been on the stock market, right?  So does he  need to come out and at least calm people down by saying obviously markets  go up and down or whatever he wants to say.  Billionaire investor Mark  Cuban is calling out the president for cheering on the markets but then  staying silent during the sell-off.  Here is what he said yesterday.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now the argument is that you talk about on the way up,  you own it on the way down.  Do you agree with that?  </p><p>MARK CUBAN, AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN:  No, because they should have owned it on  the way up and they don't own it on the way down.  So, if you're going to  go into the market, do your homework, understand what you're getting into  and understand all the risks.  Where people get hurt is that they don't  really do their homework and they don't understand what's involved,  particularly when a markets gone straight up for so long and it feels like  -- and you have people saying day after that it's going to keep on going  straight up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I think Mark Cuban makes a good point,  Hogan.  What's your take on that? </p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, look, I mean obviously the president did tout the stock  market but I would -- I would hardly say that he focused on it, but let's  be honest, I watched yesterday in my office, we have on what your viewers  may not know as a quad, so there's a cross on my television with four  different networks in the box, I get to watch them all.  They went wall to  wall with coverage of the stock market declining.  Now I understand that's  big news but where were they when it was going up?  They didn't say a word  about that?  So, they're trying to discredit this president and his  economic prowess on what he's been able to do.  You're cutting regulations  at a tune to 22 cuts for everyone increase in regulations, that's  incredible numbers, it businesses the ability to bring in more jobs, to  expand and grow and it gives them a stability they have not had in recent  decades.  But no question, the president was involved and responsible for  the increase in the stock market but also in the overall economy which as  you know has been growing at anemic levels under the Barack Obama  administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  No, you're right on that for sure.  And we're looking  at earnings for 2018, going to be up 20 percent largely because of the tax  plan and these moves to roll back regulations I get that.  Let me -- let me  ask you about the budget, Hogan because House Republicans are set to vote  today on another short-term spending bill to keep the government open  through March 23rd, keep defense spending on track for a year.  But they  won't address the debt ceiling, of course, it's coming as the Democrats are  set to head out for their annual retreat later this week?  The budget  deadline is Thursday.  What's going to happen?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, hopefully, we can get a budget passed as the president has  been clear, many times that we want a two-year budget in place for spending  caps because we have to fund the military, we have to rebuild it, it was  dismantled over the course of the last eight years.  The president wants  that back in place because the American people deserve protection.  We have  to protect our allies around the world and this budget right now, the C.R.,  there's no way to govern long term, the president knows that and he's been  out talking about that publicly multiple times but we have to get something  in place and as we move closer and closer to that deadline hopefully the  Democrats won't hold the budget hostage or the American people hostage for  the -- for the hundreds of thousands of people here, who are here illegally  and unlawfully.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, why can't the Congress understand that the American  people want the both sides to work together?  I mean, this is just  outrageous that you can't get things done without any help on the other  side.  We're waiting on an immigration bill, who knows if they'll come to  the table thereafter the president puts something out which was obviously  three times what they wanted.  And then there is this whole memo story, the  White House has confirmed it received the Democrats' response to the  controversial document which shows abuses at the top of the FBI, your  office has just released a statement saying this, the White House has  received a memorandum from the minority members of the House Select  Permanent Committee on Intelligence, as stated many times the  administration will follow the same process and procedure with the  memorandum from the minority as it did last week when it received the memo  from the majority.  So, Hogan, it didn't take that long with the GOP memo,  are we going to see a swift decision and what is in this second memo? </p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, look, I haven't seen the second memo but I will say it took  five days for the Republican memo and the president did what was prudent.   He brought in the White House Council, he brought in members of National  Security team because it's tantamount to decision he makes at the end of  this whether did he classify or not.  What it does to the American people  if it puts National Security at risk?  This president would never ever put  American lives at risk for politics regardless of what other people may or  may not do.  He did that, he went to the proper channels and process and  procedure with the first memo.  He's going to do the exact same thing with  this memo.  As it relates to immigration if I may go back for a minute.  I  did see that Senators McCain and Coons put out a bill recently and I'm just  going to say it takes a special kind of piece of legislation to be worse  for the American people than the Durbin-Graham bill was.  </p><p>But congratulations to those two Senators, McCain and Coons because they  have constructed something that's much, much worse.  It does not protect  the American people whatsoever, it gives amnesty to scores of people who  are here illegally and it doesn't do anything that the border patrol agent  say they need as far as deportation mechanisms and fortunate mechanism, it  doesn't build the wall at all.  And the secret here is, Maria, walls work,  whether it's the one in San Diego that cut illegal crossings by 95 percent  or the one in Jerusalem that went around the city that cut illegal  crossings by 99 percent, they work and Democrats can't have it both ways,  they can't on one hand say, the wall doesn't work, what do we want it for?   And then complain that it's going to be built.  They know it works because  it solves the problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In fact, the president just tweeting about this right now.  And  here's what he just said a moment ago.  So disgraceful that a person  illegally in our country killed at full a person illegally in our country  killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson.  This is just one of the many such  preventable tragedies.  We must get the Dems to get tough on the border and  with illegal immigration fast.  He goes on to say, my prayers and best  wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson.  A wonderful young man whose  life was so senselessly taken. @Colt.  So, Hogan, the president is tweeting  about this and yet it seems that the Democrats really do not want to  execute anything more from this White House.  I mean, let's face it, they  do not like him and they do not want him to have success.  So what are you  going to do? </p><p>GIDLEY:  Right.  It's hard to deal with people when their hatred for -- their personal hatred for President Trump outweighs their desire to see  America successful.  It kind of blows my mind but look, back to this  immigration point, you remember the fight over the C.R. when the Democrats  shut down the government, hurting 8.9 million American children, defunding  border patrol agents, stopping the funding to military families, they did  all of that to protect hundreds of thousands of people who are here  unlawfully and illegally as opposed to protecting the hundreds of millions  of Americans citizens.  That line was drawn in the sand as we approach this  new deadline and this new shutdown, you will remember the Schumer shutdown,  they wanted -- Democrats said they wanted everything in the C.R., they  refused to vote for it.  The same thing applies here, the president has put  forth policies that are really about a 70 percent in popularity, 80 percent  in popularity in some cases.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Democrats says they want everything in the bill.  So, I don't  understand why in the world they would reject this framework when it gives  them what they want.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Unless they just don't want border security and that's what blows  my mind.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why I think the president has put them in a box a bit  here because he is giving them what they want and if they say no, then that  means I guess they don't want it.  Hogan, real quick in terms of this memo.   Let me end there.  Are we going to see indictments, are we going to see  accountability here?  I mean, it's pretty clear at this point that the FBI  misled the FISA judge and got a warrant to spy on American citizens so that  they could listen in to their competitor, Donald Trump and running the  election.  So are we going to see indictments?  Anybody going to go to jail  or have accountability hearing?  Also, how far high up does this go?  What  about Barack Obama, was he setting the rules?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Well look, it's very obviously that Congress is the investigative  arm here and they're -- they seem to be doing their job as far as looking  into this but I think all Americans are concerned when the highest levels  of the FBI and the DOJ can use the most intrusive invasive surveillance  methods against American citizens based on the fact that a Democrat bought  and paid for document that was a -- that was a campaign document was used  to grant the FISA warrant.  That should be concerning to all Americans but  I think, Maria, that we're seeing the beginning of this quite frankly and  the end.  I think the investigation continues, you've Congressman Nunes say  that, you've heard Congressman Schiff say that.  So I think this is going  to continue.  It's the start, not the end.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think then that there will be accountability? </p><p>GIDLEY:  I hope so and I think the American people deserve that.  They want  to know that their law enforcement arms in the Federal government are not  politically biased, but that they follow the laws and they treat American  citizens as they should under the constitution.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, did the state department follow the laws?  Devin Nunes  says now he's got an active investigation into the state department, that's  Hillary Clinton's state department.  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Right.  Again, that's something that Congress is going to have to  address but I think it's clear the investigation into Hillary Clinton,  there are serious inconsistencies.  When you're giving an exoneration  letter before you even testify, that's a serious problem and I think all  Americans are concerned by that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  All right.  Hogan, thanks very much.  We will see you  soon.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hogan Gidley joining us at the White House.  As we take a  break, take a look at this market, falling out of bed again this morning,  down 270 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.  NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500 also  weaker there or a handful of firms like RBC, telling clients to buy on the  dip after the worst percentage decline yesterday since -- back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Futures are currently trading lower this morning  after the Dow tumbled a record amount yesterday.  Look at where we are,  Futures expected to be down -- the open, rather, expected to be down 250  points on the Dow at the open.  The NASDAQ down 25 points.  This, on top of  yesterday's nearly 1200-point sell-off, the worst point decline on record,  the worst percentage decline of four percent since 2011.  Nicole Petallides  on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this morning, waiting for a  rough open this morning.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   So, as you noted, we've obviously had volatility even in the Futures over  the last several hours.  We're seeing the Futures down 250 points right  now.  Those two days of selling seven percent.  People are already printing  out the circuit breakers this morning.  A level one would be seven percent.   You'd have a 15-minute malt; 13 percent would be the level two; and the 20  percent not that I want that but I'm giving you the news, you shut down for  the day.  </p><p>The big picture also, they're talking about the recent sell-off, why it  happened, we know we have a rising interest rate environment.  A lot of  talk about those who were on the short side of the VIX which jumped 115  percent.  And so, obviously, that move historic and weighing in a lot of  calls on that one.  Margin calls on the -- on the VIX, the people who  played the wrong side of that fear index. </p><p>Then we have earnings, 55 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported, 77  percent beat on earnings per share, 80 percent on revenue.  We're watching  for both -- two names, General Motors which came out, did beat on the  quarterly results.  And they did very well.  They've been cost-cutting  obviously.  The stock is just flat, pretty great in this type of  environment and it's been a winner.  And Disney after the bell, of course,  the $52-billion deal with Fox, revenue rising, and some other news that  we'll be watching for them, so watch for Disney after the bell today --  Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Nic, thank you so much.  We're watching that open,  for sure.  There is a possible upside to this market sell-off.  Joining us  now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney, looking at the glass  half-full, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Look, it's very hard to judge  how the market opens when you're looking at these Futures because an  exceptionally volatile market, I don't think a -220 tells the full story.   I think it's going to be down like a -500 or even a -600 by the time we  actually open up this morning.  But to follow on from your comment, Maria,  I think that might open up the opportunity for some bargain hunting.  Now,  the big tech stocks have been following our tape.  </p><p>They're going to be down at the opening bell, doesn't that open up the  possibility of the pros coming in, as the amateur sell, the pros come in  and buy on what they might think is a bargain price.  Apple at 154, Netflix  247, Facebook 178, Amazon below 1400, they are going to be some pros who  say, OK, the amateurs got panicked out.  We're going to step in, we're  going to buy the big text or buy whatever they think is a bargain, watch it  run up, and then probably sell it again.  What I'm saying is, watch out for  the bargain hunters because they're going to be there, and watch out for  some exceptional volatility, up and down all day long.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  Well, we've been seeing that volatility just  this morning alone, although we had Nancy Tengler earlier, she says she's  buying on the dip.  A couple other firms out there like RBC telling clients  to buy on the dip, so, yes, you're not alone.  People seeing opportunity  here, for sure, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  It's going to be an extraordinary day, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.  We'll see you in 10 minutes, Stu.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  Join Stuart and company, coming up.  First though, an Uber for the  sky.  Why the age of flying taxis could be closer than you think, that's  next.  And then, Futures this morning, looking like 250 points on the  downside at the open this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Welcome back.  Crowds pay tribute to a Colorado deputy killed  in the line of duty, people lining the streets.  And Colorado Springs --  there they are -- to pay respects to Deputy Micah Flick.  He was shot and  killed while investigating a stolen vehicle.  The suspect shot and killed  at the scene.  Two other sheriff's deputies and a bystander were also shot.   Flick was described as an outstanding detective.  He leaves behind his wife  and 7-year-old twins.</p><p>Overseas, prosecutors in Germany searching Audi offices in the  investigation into suspected emission manipulation.  Audi accuse of fraud  and legal advertising for the sales more than 200,000 vehicles in the U.S.,  as well as Europe since 2009.  Investigators say they're focusing on the  use of technical means to manipulate the emission levels of certain V6  diesel engines.  Audi is the biggest contributor to its parent company,  Volkswagen's profit.  If you take a look at shares of Volkswagen up about  24 percent from a year ago.  Well, who knew, McDonald's French fries may  hold the key to treating baldness.  According to a new study that examined  a chemical that's used in the frying oil.  Scientists in Japan say that the  silicon chemical can actually mass produce hair follicles when you put it  on mice.  And they say the simple process is promising and that it could  maybe treat hair loss in men.  So, I don't know, try rubbing it on your  head.  </p><p>And this one no more straight out of the Jetsons space age cartoon, Bell  Helicopter teaming up with Uber to launch the very first air taxes by 2025.   So, initial tests are expected to take place in 2020 in Dallas, also in  Dubai, Bell Helicopter actually showed off their concept at the Consumer  Electronics Show in Vegas last month.  Let's take a look at the parents of  Bell Textron.  Nice chart, shares up 17 percent over the past year.  So, I  don't know where you want to go with that, but McDonald's helping men with  baldness or flying Ubers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All good stories.  I'm smarter after your report.  Thank you so  much.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We try.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But we are poorer.  Take a look at the Futures right now,  we are expecting the sell-off at the start of trading although we are well  off of the lows.  Take a look, down 151 right now, having come off of a  decline of 300 earlier, NASDAQ is now positive, up six points, as we take a  break.  We'll get our final thoughts from this all-star panel as we see  money moving into stocks, and the markets coming off of the lows right now  as we speak.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts.  Kevin Kelly?</p><p>KELLY:  We've seen a disconnect between valuation and fundamentals.  I  think valuation has come down letting credence into the fundamentals in  this economy.  It could be a buying opportunity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, buying opportunity.  Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I agree on the fundamentals.  The economy looks pretty strong.   We had good job's numbers, good wage numbers, good service sector numbers  the other day.  The economy is in pretty good shape, the market just has to  adjust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are some people getting shaken out of this market.  There  were two exchange-traded (INAUDIBLE) that collapsed overnight where people  were betting that volatility would not come back.  Again, we see who was  naked when the tide goes out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's back.  Volatility is back.  Here's Stuart Varney with more  on that.  Stu, over to you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good Tuesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning, I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Tuesday. It is Tuesday, February 6th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Breaking news this morning the global sell-off is continuing, futures are indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning of 182 points as three-quarters of 1 percent. And I should point out that that is off of the lows this morning. The NASDAQ is down 15 and the S&amp;P is down six, this comes of course after stocks tumbled yesterday with the Dow posting the largest single-day point decline ever closing down nearly 1,200 points on the day that wasn't the low. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 wiped out the year's gains with yesterday's performance alone. The declines sending shockwaves across the world overnight and this morning.</p><p>First overnight take a look at Asia overnight, markets tip a nose-dive the worst performers were Japan and Hong Kong with the Hang Seng index down better than five percent and the Nikkei average in Japan down four and three-quarters percent. And then there's Europe, markets are open right now and they are trading down. You got steep declines across the board in Europe, the FT 100 down 1.8 percent as you can see the market there hitting the lowest level in over a year. The CAC Quarante is down 2-2/3 percent and the DAX Index down 2-1/4 percent. The turmoil coming as investors are watching earnings this morning from some big names.</p><p>General Motors reported earnings and revenue that were above expectations for the fourth quarter. G.M. stock is up 1-1/2 percent, we're also watching Disney because the Walt Disney company is going to be reporting its fourth quarter after the close tonight. We're also watching shares of I'm sorry Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin is down. The cryptocurrency fell below $6,000 in earlier trading. It is now down half of its value since just the beginning of the year. All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath and Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly. Rough day at the office.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY &amp; COMPANY: Yes, it's very interesting though that, you know, stock are declining and G.M. is beating earnings. I kind of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's sort of the story. It's the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: I'll tell you why G.M. is beating because they sold 20 percent more of their Chevy Equinox as well as their Chevy Traverses.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The SUV?</p><p>HILSENRATH: The SUVs. They're higher margin products. So, for example, the Chevy Equinox, they sold 20 percent more. The average selling price was $3,000 more than the previous year's version. But, you know, when you look at the markets and we're off the lows right and VIX's hit above VIX uncertainty indicator and last time it hit 50 was in August of 2015. And then the market rebounded from there, so this is really a capitulation and the bottom could be starting to come in as we started to flesh out some of the weaker hands in --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why do you see a bottom?</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think -- well there is a couple --</p><p>BARTIROMO: On the horizon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes. So I see a bottom one because when VIX hits 50 or above at those extreme levels then it comes down the market rises back up, right? So the stream uncertainty has hit and then it is over.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: The markets are more stable than they were last night. The Dow futures at one point were down 750 points and overnight trading but we still have not seen these market gages hit correction territory. The closest would be the Dow transports are down nine percent from the recent record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down eight and a half percent. So watch for on the Dow 23,955 and change that would be a 10 percent correction from the recent record.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great info, Dagen. We want to get to this market here because the Dow posted the largest ever single-day point decline in history yesterday. But we have been putting it in context this morning basically saying, yes, four percent is not in the top in terms of the decline, so on a point basis yes it was a terrible day but not so when you look at the overall. President Trump, of course, has touted tax reform and economic growth for the last year and a half and he was in Ohio yesterday doing the same -- Blake Burman is at the White House right now with the administration's reaction to the stock market sell-off. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you. You are right. The White House has been touting the stock market at success at almost a daily clip here but yesterday once this rout settled, they tried to hit the pause button for a second and instead take a look at the longer-term picture. The White House Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders putting out a statement which said the following, ''The President's focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals which remain exceptionally strong with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment and increasing wages for American workers. The President's tax cuts and regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. Economy and continue to increase prosperity for the American people.'' The Vice President who has just landed in South Korea when he was in route yesterday was asked about this and he said the market drop was due to the ebbs and flows of the market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The most important numbers to focus on are the fundamentals. The fundamentals of this economy continue to be very strong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Now the Dow precipitous drop came as President Trump was in Ohio touting tax reform. This is an event that The President would normally talk about the stock market successes but yesterday he did not mention the volatility.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Factoring are coming back, everything is coming back they all want to be where the action is. America is once again open for business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Maria, as we saw yesterday The White House is planning still on putting The President out on the road touring this new tax code, new tax bill but yesterday's event could not have come at a worse time realistically for this president because it was one of the rare times that when The President was out there giving a big speech instead the cameras were turning elsewhere as the market was dipping into the red. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. It's tough day for sure. Blake, thank you so much. Blake Burman joining us right now. A Member of the House Appropriations Committee Congressman Chuck Fleischmann of Tennessee. Congressman, good to see you this morning. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE: Good morning. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you see in terms of this market sell-off? What are the implications here from your standpoint?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: Well obviously I think we've seen unprecedented highs in the stock market, the economy is doing well, unemployment is low. People have more money in their pockets because of the tax cuts. I have never seen fundamentals look so good in a long time. Now we have to be cognizant that the stock market is a market and there is speculation, people invest and then like I think one of the things with the economy doing so well across the board is some people may look for other places to put their money in addition to the stock market. So I think we need to be positive, I think we need to work together. And I think as legislators we need to provide a very conducive environment for business to continue to do well I think we're doing that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I guess what I was asking is, you know, Alan Greenspan, Jon, you know this used to talk about the wealth effect. And this market is up $8 trillion since the election. Well now obviously 4-1/2 trillion since the election but that was a factor. Are there implications in terms of economic growth as a result of the sell-off? That is my question.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think as long as market settles down and it looks like it will then that will -- their wealth effect is still in there because we're still talking about net gains for most people on their 401(k) plans. And we're still talking about companies net, seeing their share prices up and being more optimistic about investing and spending money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, and also 90 percent of workers in this country this month saying higher wages because of tax cuts so it's not just the stock market but it's also -- they have real cash on hand because of what Congress has done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And it is great, Congressman I mean you did a good job on the tax plan. We're waiting to see the implications of it because we know that people have more money in their pockets but you've got another issue on your hands with this short-term measuring to fund the government. Through March 23rd I've heard another shutdown while funding the defense department for a full year? I mean how can you -- how can you -- how do you justify living from you know one resolution to the next? One continuing resolution to the next?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: Well, as a house appropriator as you know last year we passed all 12 house appropriation bills. We did our job and we want to get back to what we could locally call regular order. In other words, the House and the Senate appropriations committee is doing job passing budgets and getting it down. Unfortunately, we are in an environment largely due to the Senate rules where they need 60 to get something done, we saw Schumer shutdown which I thought was detrimental. It was short thank goodness but it's not easy to get things done right now in Washington, D.C. So we just have to continue to work hard. On part of the House Republicans and house appropriator such as myself we're doing our job, we're going to do it again this year and we're just going to stay at it and we just hope that other people who serve are the legislators in both parties and both bodies do their job.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Congressman, two questions for you. First of all on the budget, well, how is this year pass a budget resolution and the budget. Second of all one of the reasons the stock market is falling now is because long-term interest rates are going up, one of the reasons long-term interest rates are going up it seems is that we're looking at budget deficits that are going to exceed a trillion dollars in another year or two. What are Republicans in Congress going to do about a trillion-dollar budget deficits?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: Well, I think fundamentally we need to look long-term at mandatory spending issues, we're seeing the effects, the ill effects of the budget control act which is really squeezed, discretionary spending hurt defense and hurt other domestic spending. But the real problem is that we have seen the dollars available on discretionary side of the budget equation continue to shrink and that is going to happen unless we address this in a larger sense.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So what are you going to do to address it?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: Well, I think we need to have everyone from the administration, the Senate, the House Republicans and Democrats actually look to fiscal reform. I think a balanced budget amendment which actually I had the privilege of voting for would be a step in the right direction. Let's face it, I come from a state -- the great state of Tennessee that has a constitutional amendment in a state constitution to balance its budget. We have no debt in Tennessee, if you look at some other states don't have that in their constitutions, they are never going to get out of red I think.</p><p>HILSENRATH: How would you balance it what would you cut? You just said you don't want to cut discretionary spending so what would you cut?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: Well, we have to reform I'd rather use the term reform when we look at the whole picture, we have to see where we're spending our dollars that is on the mandatory side of the equation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: Well, talk about interest on the national debt. We're talking about interest rates, pressure on interest rates to go up and I do think you'll see interest rates go up. When you were borrowing -- when you're $20 trillion in debt, if you are a borrow and interest rates go up that is not good, that is not good if you are an individual borrower, that is not good if a country that is borrowing and let's face it we are at a time where other countries like China are buying up our national debt. That is not good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a point you have made umpteen times, Dagen in terms of the interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but in Congress, what do you do to control the actual interest rate that's paid on the debt? That is -- that is a market unless you are -- unless you are telegraphing to the Federal Reserve that you want the Federal Reserve to --</p><p>HILSENRATH: And that is rising now because debt is going up so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. It -- the --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, the cost of debt that's actually selling off -- the price --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the cost of debt, that is right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The interest on the national debt in a few years is going to surpass what we spend on defense every year. Just that 80 percent of the growth in spending is entitlements and the interest on the debt in the -- over the next decade. So to that point when is anybody going to have the gumption to step up and say OK it is time to get our arms around entitlements? And really you are going to have to -- at some point cut what people receive from the federal government in terms of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and Republicans couldn't do it with just Medicaid last year.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: I'd rather again use the term reform, we never want the scare our senior's people 55 and over will be safe and they ought to be safe. But we got to look at the long-term prospects for our country. Also, the numbers are not good, we have baby boomers, people my age and older who are going on through the Social Security and Medicare every day. We need to be protected, we don't need to engage in a game political scare. Right now we are in a very -- most of its time politically, a game of one-upsmanship. So we need to sit down come up with good ideas, we should have done this on healthcare, Obamacare was a budget buster because most of that spending was where? On the mandatory side of the spending equation.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It doesn't sound like -- it doesn't like you want to go there on Social Security and Medicare and like that, something you want to talk about actually reforming or cutting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Or after their midterm elections probably. You are going to cut -- are you going to cut these mandatory things during in an election year? I don't think so --</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: When is it -- when is it volatile politically? Because you guys are up -- right, you guys are up from re-election every two years. So it is -- it is always -- there is always that hot potato, that football if you will.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: Well, let's look at things that we can all agree on. If we have growth and I think we are going to have growth from this tax cut, we're going to see the economy grow. So that's going to be good for everyone. Employers hiring, unemployment is at an all-time low, we are going to see people with more money if people who have jobs and are spending we are going to see a healthier economy and things will go better that way. So you will have more dollars actually feeding those kiddies that need to be fed. If people are unemployed and we have gone through the great recession that we did, starting in 2008 and they're not feeding these programs in terms -- with the revenue, there is going to be a problem. So growth is going to be a key term factor in this as well as spending reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So growth is the priority right now we got it. Congressman, it's good to see you, sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chuck Fleischmann, joining us. We will be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are selling off this morning once again. We are seeing a continuation of that global meltdown yesterday. Dow Industrials down 220 points right now. And futures were expecting they said a tough opening for the stock market. General Motors is out with its latest quarterly earnings this morning meanwhile. That stock is actually up even though we're seeing the rest of the market trade down. Lauren Simonetti with the details there. Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hey, Maria. Let's first take a look how G.M. shares or trading right now in premarket trading after the company reported better than expected quarterly results on an adjusted basis, $40.02 of share, that's a gain of 48 cents. G.M. did take its charge who does a tax reform $7.3 billion in the quarter. But they have a record operating profit. Thanks to big demand for their profitable pickup trucks and SUVs. Vehicle sales did rise about one percent from a year ago to almost nine million vehicles sold in a quarter. We're going to get results from Dow component, Walt Disney after the close today. Analysts they're looking for earnings for share at about four percent from a year ago, the result expected to get a lift from Thor: Ragnarok and from Star Wars.</p><p>Investors going to pay close attention to anything the company says about ESPN, ESPN plus order other streaming services. Shares a Disney down $1.95 in the premarket right now. Well, how low will they go? Bitcoin was plummeting, briefly below $6,000 earlier this morning but then it actually turned positive. So we continue to watch the price of Bitcoin obviously down sharply from 20,000 back in December. Bitcoin has lost more than half of its value this year, there's the chart. This latest selling comes on report of potential price manipulation and hacker activity and lawmakers will explore regulatory oversight for virtual currencies in general at a hearing later this morning.</p><p>Let's move on to our final story which has to do with oil prices, they're dropping for a third day. Light sweet crude now at $63.00 a barrel, experts say the global market sell-off actually strengthens the dollar and arising U.S. dollar makes commodities more expensive for foreign buyers. Oil still positive in 2018, taking a look at shares of ExxonMobil, shares of Chevron, both of them are lower in premarket trading.</p><p>And Vice President Mike Pence in Japan today. On his way to the Olympics in South Korea and he's delivering a tough message for North Korea. Pence's says he doesn't want North Korea to hijack the games because it's participating on a joint team with South Korea. The Vice President is bringing the father of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who was imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months died last June. Pence also visiting a memorial to the 46th South Korean sailors killed in a 2010 torpedo attack which was attributed to the North Korea.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much, Lauren. We want to take a break real quick and look at futures as we go to the break. Take a look at this performance after Monday's 1,100 points sell-off in the Dow. We're expecting the Dow to open down almost 300 points this morning better than one percent. The S&amp;P is down three-quarters of a percent as the NASDAQ right now. Plus Mark Cuban speaking out on a stock market fly. Well, the billionaire entrepreneur says he's not worried about the Dow plunge yesterday. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The sell-off in stocks continues this morning after yesterday's historic market plunge, futures are indicating another rough beginning for this market today. Dow Industrials down better than 300 points right, that's 1-1/4 percent. Of course, the Dow suffered its biggest ever one-day point decline yesterday falling nearly 1200 points at the close. Joining us right now is Nancy Tengler, she is Heartland Financial Chief Investment Officer, she's also the author of The Women's Guide to Successful Investing. Nancy, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>NANCY TENGLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HEARTLAND FINANCIAL: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: First, your take on the sell-off, what would you be doing today, what are you telling clients?</p><p>TENGLER: We are actually buying, we have taken about five percent out of stocks and bonds on January 2nd, put in non-correlated assets and today we'll be enabling away at large-cap, big names, you know, some of the pharma, some of the Industrials that have -- that didn't --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: Why isn't that today the day to buy?</p><p>TENGLER: Well, we like -- we called -- I mean, I hate to say this because I'm not a market timer but we had called for a market timer but we had called for a market correction in July, way too early, we just thought we were way ahead of ourselves. I thought the market would sell off in January, I didn't. And so now this is the opportunity we have been looking for.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It went up so much since then, why wouldn't it keep going down if we thought it was overvalued in July, isn't it still valued today?</p><p>TENGLER: I mean, the fundamentals are super strong. We got earnings revisions from 11 percent this year up to 17.9. The market P.E. on an estimated basis is now at 17 times next year's earnings, if you look at the 10-year it's come down so that's helpful. And we just think the fundamentals are very strong and we want to be owners here.</p><p>KELLY: Well, I think if you -- there's the old market ad, right? You take the stairs up the elevator down when it comes to the market so when we see a big fall like this, this gives opportunity to get into a market that's trading at 17 times earnings but we're seeing earnings grow at 20 percent and especially with the dollar coming down. Do you think the dollar is going to be a big tailwind going into the second half of the year to help a lot of these corporations because everyone is talking about one time taxes, you know and we're seeing, you know, that's going to push for the first half but what's the second half of the story?</p><p>TENGLER: Yes. That's a difficult one to measure. I mean, we've been beneficiaries of and have written quite a bit about the dollar. Does it stay here? I mean, with cash -- if I'm a CFO, I want the repatriate my crash at these levels, right? So, if that happens and we see foreign investors looking at our yields, I think that becomes a compelling story for maybe a little push-up in dollar, but I don't think it's going to return to the levels we saw a year ago so quickly.</p><p>KELLY: I have one more -- so this is the important thing I think about the market, the corporations are buying right now because the blackout periods.</p><p>TENGLER: Right.</p><p>KELLY: So this is why you want to buy right now because corporations are going to come in and start purchasing.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes. Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because they're not buying back their stock now because they're reporting earnings.</p><p>TENGLER: Right.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. Blackout period.</p><p>TENGLER: Right. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the point. So, it sounds like you're happy that we have a sell-off because it's giving the investors an opportunity to get back in, this just a sell-off and the fundamentals backed up for the stock market is pretty strong.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes. Absolutely. I mean, we wanted to see this, this is like pruning, this is a controlled brush fire, I mean, it didn't feel controlled yesterday on the floor and it a was pretty wild but yes, no, we wanted to see this and this is what we were waiting for because we had to take a lot off the table we were way overweighted.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But is there any really way to know given the unprecedented stimulus that you've had for instance for banks around the globe starting with the financial crisis in 2008 of how overvalued asset classes and where people are most exposed. Again, you only find -- found out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out. And that's something with as Federal Reserve really pares back that giant balance sheet as interest rates continue to rise, this could be something that plays out literally over years not just a matter of days.</p><p>TENGLER: Agreed. I do agree, Dagen but I do think that we have the benefit of a strong underlying fundamental economy and corporate CEOs that are making actually decent decisions and unexpected decisions with the tax cuts and so I think that's going to provide a floor if you will on-- and with the stock buybacks, I do think that we're going to see continued moves up at least for the next 12 months.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nancy, before you go, you got to talk just about this book, the Women's Guide to Success for Investing, you say that women outperformed men when it comes to investing.</p><p>TENGLER: We did. We tend to be a little more deliberate, thoughtful and less risk-focused, not less competitive but less willing to trade and that generates excess return over the long term.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just being patient.</p><p>TENGLER: Just being patient buying great companies. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll leave it there. Nancy, great insights from you. Thanks so much.</p><p>TENGLER: Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nancy Tengler joining us there. Coming up, the White House weighs in on the global stock market decline, futures indicating another sharp sell-off at the start of trading down 300 points after a stock sell- off yesterday. White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley will join me next live. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news this morning. A global market sell-off continues this morning. Thanks for joining us, everybody. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, February 6th. We're an hour away from the open on Wall Street. It has been a volatile morning for stocks. Take a look at futures right now down 350 points. At one point, the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ this morning were actually up. The NASDAQ right now is down 61 points and the S&amp;P down 29 points. So volatility is back and we're expecting another rough open this morning. This, of course, one day after the Dow suffered the worst one-day point decline ever sliding better than four percent, that was almost 1200 points lower on the day. As, you know, 1200 points is the worst point ever but four percent is not. We are seeing this market trade down having said that more this morning. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 have now wiped out, any gains for 2018 in a day they wiped that out for the 1200-point sell-off. That bloodbath spreading across the world.</p><p>Meanwhile, Asia took a cue from the U.S. last night and markets were down sharply. The Nikkei Average in Japan plunged nearly five percent, this is -- this is -- this is not right. What does this Asian markets 2-1/2 percent? That was wrong but we want to tell you the specifics because Hong Kong was down more than five percent overnight and Japan was down almost five percent, more than four percent. These are the closing numbers last night overnight for the Asian markets. So there you go. This is the accurate numbers here. Sorry about that. The market is now down 10 percent from the record-high in Japan, so that is correction mode with that 4-3/4 percent sell-off. In Europe this morning, declines across the board as you can see, the European indices down about two percent apiece. The major markets in London, Paris, Frankfurt all down better than two percent this morning. Joining me right now to talk more about these markets is White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley. Hogan, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Great to see you, Maria. Thanks for the time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So in a statement, the President said he's focused on long-term economic fundamentals, that was yesterday. What is the president's reaction to this market sell-off that we're watching?</p><p>GIDLEY: Look, the same that we talked about yesterday is the same today. The fundamentals of the American economy are really strong, some of your guests have alluded to that very fact. This morning we've seen, you know, 7,000 percent increase in the stock market. We heard on the Obama administration that 1.9 percent GDP was the new normal, manufacturing would never come back to our shores. All those things have been turned around in this -- under this president's policy, not to mention the fact GDP is now at -- hovering around three percent for the first time in the better part of the decade. So the fundamentals of this American economy are strong and the American people quite frankly are seeing the effect. He was in Ohio just yesterday talking to the Schafer Corporation, several companies were represented there, giving thousand dollar bonuses to their employees, wages are going up for the first time in eight years, so overall, the soundness of this economy is indisputable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, look, there's no doubt that the economic backdrop is very strong, we know that, I mean, now for the first time we're hearing expectations of 5.4 percent growth for the first quarter but we also know how focused this president has been on the stock market, right? So does he need to come out and at least calm people down by saying obviously markets go up and down or whatever he wants to say. Billionaire investor Mark Cuban is calling out the president for cheering on the markets but then staying silent during the sell-off. Here is what he said yesterday. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now the argument is that you talk about on the way up, you own it on the way down. Do you agree with that?</p><p>MARK CUBAN, AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN: No, because they should have owned it on the way up and they don't own it on the way down. So, if you're going to go into the market, do your homework, understand what you're getting into and understand all the risks. Where people get hurt is that they don't really do their homework and they don't understand what's involved, particularly when a markets gone straight up for so long and it feels like -- and you have people saying day after that it's going to keep on going straight up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, look, I think Mark Cuban makes a good point, Hogan. What's your take on that?</p><p>GIDLEY: Well, look, I mean obviously the president did tout the stock market but I would -- I would hardly say that he focused on it, but let's be honest, I watched yesterday in my office, we have on what your viewers may not know as a quad, so there's a cross on my television with four different networks in the box, I get to watch them all. They went wall to wall with coverage of the stock market declining. Now I understand that's big news but where were they when it was going up? They didn't say a word about that? So, they're trying to discredit this president and his economic prowess on what he's been able to do. You're cutting regulations at a tune to 22 cuts for everyone increase in regulations, that's incredible numbers, it businesses the ability to bring in more jobs, to expand and grow and it gives them a stability they have not had in recent decades. But no question, the president was involved and responsible for the increase in the stock market but also in the overall economy which as you know has been growing at anemic levels under the Barack Obama administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. No, you're right on that for sure. And we're looking at earnings for 2018, going to be up 20 percent largely because of the tax plan and these moves to roll back regulations I get that. Let me -- let me ask you about the budget, Hogan because House Republicans are set to vote today on another short-term spending bill to keep the government open through March 23rd, keep defense spending on track for a year. But they won't address the debt ceiling, of course, it's coming as the Democrats are set to head out for their annual retreat later this week? The budget deadline is Thursday. What's going to happen?</p><p>GIDLEY: Well, hopefully, we can get a budget passed as the president has been clear, many times that we want a two-year budget in place for spending caps because we have to fund the military, we have to rebuild it, it was dismantled over the course of the last eight years. The president wants that back in place because the American people deserve protection. We have to protect our allies around the world and this budget right now, the C.R., there's no way to govern long term, the president knows that and he's been out talking about that publicly multiple times but we have to get something in place and as we move closer and closer to that deadline hopefully the Democrats won't hold the budget hostage or the American people hostage for the -- for the hundreds of thousands of people here, who are here illegally and unlawfully.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, why can't the Congress understand that the American people want the both sides to work together? I mean, this is just outrageous that you can't get things done without any help on the other side. We're waiting on an immigration bill, who knows if they'll come to the table thereafter the president puts something out which was obviously three times what they wanted. And then there is this whole memo story, the White House has confirmed it received the Democrats' response to the controversial document which shows abuses at the top of the FBI, your office has just released a statement saying this, the White House has received a memorandum from the minority members of the House Select Permanent Committee on Intelligence, as stated many times the administration will follow the same process and procedure with the memorandum from the minority as it did last week when it received the memo from the majority. So, Hogan, it didn't take that long with the GOP memo, are we going to see a swift decision and what is in this second memo?</p><p>GIDLEY: Well, look, I haven't seen the second memo but I will say it took five days for the Republican memo and the president did what was prudent. He brought in the White House Council, he brought in members of National Security team because it's tantamount to decision he makes at the end of this whether did he classify or not. What it does to the American people if it puts National Security at risk? This president would never ever put American lives at risk for politics regardless of what other people may or may not do. He did that, he went to the proper channels and process and procedure with the first memo. He's going to do the exact same thing with this memo. As it relates to immigration if I may go back for a minute. I did see that Senators McCain and Coons put out a bill recently and I'm just going to say it takes a special kind of piece of legislation to be worse for the American people than the Durbin-Graham bill was.</p><p>But congratulations to those two Senators, McCain and Coons because they have constructed something that's much, much worse. It does not protect the American people whatsoever, it gives amnesty to scores of people who are here illegally and it doesn't do anything that the border patrol agent say they need as far as deportation mechanisms and fortunate mechanism, it doesn't build the wall at all. And the secret here is, Maria, walls work, whether it's the one in San Diego that cut illegal crossings by 95 percent or the one in Jerusalem that went around the city that cut illegal crossings by 99 percent, they work and Democrats can't have it both ways, they can't on one hand say, the wall doesn't work, what do we want it for? And then complain that it's going to be built. They know it works because it solves the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In fact, the president just tweeting about this right now. And here's what he just said a moment ago. So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed at full a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of the many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the border and with illegal immigration fast. He goes on to say, my prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson. A wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. @Colt. So, Hogan, the president is tweeting about this and yet it seems that the Democrats really do not want to execute anything more from this White House. I mean, let's face it, they do not like him and they do not want him to have success. So what are you going to do?</p><p>GIDLEY: Right. It's hard to deal with people when their hatred for -- their personal hatred for President Trump outweighs their desire to see America successful. It kind of blows my mind but look, back to this immigration point, you remember the fight over the C.R. when the Democrats shut down the government, hurting 8.9 million American children, defunding border patrol agents, stopping the funding to military families, they did all of that to protect hundreds of thousands of people who are here unlawfully and illegally as opposed to protecting the hundreds of millions of Americans citizens. That line was drawn in the sand as we approach this new deadline and this new shutdown, you will remember the Schumer shutdown, they wanted -- Democrats said they wanted everything in the C.R., they refused to vote for it. The same thing applies here, the president has put forth policies that are really about a 70 percent in popularity, 80 percent in popularity in some cases.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: Democrats says they want everything in the bill. So, I don't understand why in the world they would reject this framework when it gives them what they want.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GIDLEY: Unless they just don't want border security and that's what blows my mind.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why I think the president has put them in a box a bit here because he is giving them what they want and if they say no, then that means I guess they don't want it. Hogan, real quick in terms of this memo. Let me end there. Are we going to see indictments, are we going to see accountability here? I mean, it's pretty clear at this point that the FBI misled the FISA judge and got a warrant to spy on American citizens so that they could listen in to their competitor, Donald Trump and running the election. So are we going to see indictments? Anybody going to go to jail or have accountability hearing? Also, how far high up does this go? What about Barack Obama, was he setting the rules?</p><p>GIDLEY: Well look, it's very obviously that Congress is the investigative arm here and they're -- they seem to be doing their job as far as looking into this but I think all Americans are concerned when the highest levels of the FBI and the DOJ can use the most intrusive invasive surveillance methods against American citizens based on the fact that a Democrat bought and paid for document that was a -- that was a campaign document was used to grant the FISA warrant. That should be concerning to all Americans but I think, Maria, that we're seeing the beginning of this quite frankly and the end. I think the investigation continues, you've Congressman Nunes say that, you've heard Congressman Schiff say that. So I think this is going to continue. It's the start, not the end.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you think then that there will be accountability?</p><p>GIDLEY: I hope so and I think the American people deserve that. They want to know that their law enforcement arms in the Federal government are not politically biased, but that they follow the laws and they treat American citizens as they should under the constitution.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, did the state department follow the laws? Devin Nunes says now he's got an active investigation into the state department, that's Hillary Clinton's state department.</p><p>GIDLEY: Right. Again, that's something that Congress is going to have to address but I think it's clear the investigation into Hillary Clinton, there are serious inconsistencies. When you're giving an exoneration letter before you even testify, that's a serious problem and I think all Americans are concerned by that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. All right. Hogan, thanks very much. We will see you soon.</p><p>GIDLEY: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hogan Gidley joining us at the White House. As we take a break, take a look at this market, falling out of bed again this morning, down 270 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average. NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500 also weaker there or a handful of firms like RBC, telling clients to buy on the dip after the worst percentage decline yesterday since -- back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures are currently trading lower this morning after the Dow tumbled a record amount yesterday. Look at where we are, Futures expected to be down -- the open, rather, expected to be down 250 points on the Dow at the open. The NASDAQ down 25 points. This, on top of yesterday's nearly 1200-point sell-off, the worst point decline on record, the worst percentage decline of four percent since 2011. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this morning, waiting for a rough open this morning. Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. So, as you noted, we've obviously had volatility even in the Futures over the last several hours. We're seeing the Futures down 250 points right now. Those two days of selling seven percent. People are already printing out the circuit breakers this morning. A level one would be seven percent. You'd have a 15-minute malt; 13 percent would be the level two; and the 20 percent not that I want that but I'm giving you the news, you shut down for the day.</p><p>The big picture also, they're talking about the recent sell-off, why it happened, we know we have a rising interest rate environment. A lot of talk about those who were on the short side of the VIX which jumped 115 percent. And so, obviously, that move historic and weighing in a lot of calls on that one. Margin calls on the -- on the VIX, the people who played the wrong side of that fear index.</p><p>Then we have earnings, 55 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported, 77 percent beat on earnings per share, 80 percent on revenue. We're watching for both -- two names, General Motors which came out, did beat on the quarterly results. And they did very well. They've been cost-cutting obviously. The stock is just flat, pretty great in this type of environment and it's been a winner. And Disney after the bell, of course, the $52-billion deal with Fox, revenue rising, and some other news that we'll be watching for them, so watch for Disney after the bell today -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Nic, thank you so much. We're watching that open, for sure. There is a possible upside to this market sell-off. Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney, looking at the glass half-full, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Look, it's very hard to judge how the market opens when you're looking at these Futures because an exceptionally volatile market, I don't think a -220 tells the full story. I think it's going to be down like a -500 or even a -600 by the time we actually open up this morning. But to follow on from your comment, Maria, I think that might open up the opportunity for some bargain hunting. Now, the big tech stocks have been following our tape.</p><p>They're going to be down at the opening bell, doesn't that open up the possibility of the pros coming in, as the amateur sell, the pros come in and buy on what they might think is a bargain price. Apple at 154, Netflix 247, Facebook 178, Amazon below 1400, they are going to be some pros who say, OK, the amateurs got panicked out. We're going to step in, we're going to buy the big text or buy whatever they think is a bargain, watch it run up, and then probably sell it again. What I'm saying is, watch out for the bargain hunters because they're going to be there, and watch out for some exceptional volatility, up and down all day long.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. Well, we've been seeing that volatility just this morning alone, although we had Nancy Tengler earlier, she says she's buying on the dip. A couple other firms out there like RBC telling clients to buy on the dip, so, yes, you're not alone. People seeing opportunity here, for sure, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: It's going to be an extraordinary day, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. We'll see you in 10 minutes, Stu. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart and company, coming up. First though, an Uber for the sky. Why the age of flying taxis could be closer than you think, that's next. And then, Futures this morning, looking like 250 points on the downside at the open this morning. Back in a moment.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Welcome back. Crowds pay tribute to a Colorado deputy killed in the line of duty, people lining the streets. And Colorado Springs -- there they are -- to pay respects to Deputy Micah Flick. He was shot and killed while investigating a stolen vehicle. The suspect shot and killed at the scene. Two other sheriff's deputies and a bystander were also shot. Flick was described as an outstanding detective. He leaves behind his wife and 7-year-old twins.</p><p>Overseas, prosecutors in Germany searching Audi offices in the investigation into suspected emission manipulation. Audi accuse of fraud and legal advertising for the sales more than 200,000 vehicles in the U.S., as well as Europe since 2009. Investigators say they're focusing on the use of technical means to manipulate the emission levels of certain V6 diesel engines. Audi is the biggest contributor to its parent company, Volkswagen's profit. If you take a look at shares of Volkswagen up about 24 percent from a year ago. Well, who knew, McDonald's French fries may hold the key to treating baldness. According to a new study that examined a chemical that's used in the frying oil. Scientists in Japan say that the silicon chemical can actually mass produce hair follicles when you put it on mice. And they say the simple process is promising and that it could maybe treat hair loss in men. So, I don't know, try rubbing it on your head.</p><p>And this one no more straight out of the Jetsons space age cartoon, Bell Helicopter teaming up with Uber to launch the very first air taxes by 2025. So, initial tests are expected to take place in 2020 in Dallas, also in Dubai, Bell Helicopter actually showed off their concept at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas last month. Let's take a look at the parents of Bell Textron. Nice chart, shares up 17 percent over the past year. So, I don't know where you want to go with that, but McDonald's helping men with baldness or flying Ubers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All good stories. I'm smarter after your report. Thank you so much.</p><p>SIMONETTI: We try.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But we are poorer. Take a look at the Futures right now, we are expecting the sell-off at the start of trading although we are well off of the lows. Take a look, down 151 right now, having come off of a decline of 300 earlier, NASDAQ is now positive, up six points, as we take a break. We'll get our final thoughts from this all-star panel as we see money moving into stocks, and the markets coming off of the lows right now as we speak. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts. Kevin Kelly?</p><p>KELLY: We've seen a disconnect between valuation and fundamentals. I think valuation has come down letting credence into the fundamentals in this economy. It could be a buying opportunity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, buying opportunity. Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH: I agree on the fundamentals. The economy looks pretty strong. We had good job's numbers, good wage numbers, good service sector numbers the other day. The economy is in pretty good shape, the market just has to adjust.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There are some people getting shaken out of this market. There were two exchange-traded (INAUDIBLE) that collapsed overnight where people were betting that volatility would not come back. Again, we see who was naked when the tide goes out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's back. Volatility is back. Here's Stuart Varney with more on that. Stu, over to you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018020603cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RKF-DKB1-DXH2-63KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8023\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 6, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS713110 AMUSEMENT &amp;

To date, there have been 17,335 confirmed cases of the potentially deadly Sars-like virus, including 362 deaths. Mainland China remains the epicentre of the outbreak, although cases have been reported in more than two-dozen countries including the UK, Japan, Thailand, the U.S., Spain, Australia and Germany. Mr Green says: \"The ongoing upward trajectory of the price of Bitcoin correlates to the spread of the coronavirus. \"The more individual cases that are identified, the more countries around the world that are affected, and the greater the impact on traditional financial markets, the higher the price of Bitcoin has jumped. </p><p>\"In this regard, we can expect Bitcoin's price is likely to continue to rise until the coronavirus peaks which, according to a prestigious research group in Hong Kong, is likely to be in late April or early May.\" He continues: \"Why have investors been piling into Bitcoin recently? Because it is increasingly regarded as a safe-haven asset in times of uncertainty. \"Bitcoin, known as 'digital gold', shares characteristics of the traditional yellow metal including being a store of value, scarce, being perceived as being resistant to inflation, and a hedge against turmoil in traditional markets - many of which have been pushed in a tailspin since the coronavirus outbreak.\" The deVere CEO says: \"Whilst coronavirus and geopolitical tensions have certainly been underscoring the reputation of decentralised, non-sovereign, secure currencies, such as Bitcoin, as safe-havens, they are somewhat peripheral drivers for why cryptocurrencies are now regarded as the future of money. \"These key other factors include that they are digital, they are global, they solve real-life issues, big tech and institutional investors are coming off the sidelines, and worldwide demographics - the growth of the native digital generation - are on the side of crypto, meaning the future is, too.\" Mr Green concludes: \"Whilst there will be minor peaks and troughs - as in all markets - I predict the overall trajectory of Bitcoin to remain upward until such time as coronavirus peaks.\"<br/>t: +44 207 1220 925<br/>Twitter: @PriorConsultsdeVere Group is one of the world's largest independent advisors of specialist global financial solutions to international, local mass affluent, and high-net-worth clients.

Powell's remarks, but the digital currency has surged this year, in part because of Facebook's announcement of its own proposed virtual currency, Libra. Experts say Facebook's momentous entrance could accelerate the adoption of alternative currency and payment systems, lifting the prospects of other cryptocurrencies in the process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite the sudden rise in investor optimism, not everyone was thrilled with Facebook's intentions. When Libra was announced last month, the plans drew immediate scrutiny from regulators in the United States and abroad. The chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), called on Facebook to halt development of its cryptocurrency project until various policy concerns could be addressed.</p><p>On Wednesday, Powell confirmed that the Fed has reservations of its own. \"While the project's sponsors hold out the possibility of public benefits, including improved financial access for consumers, Libra raises many serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability,\" he said. \"These are concerns that should be thoroughly and publicly addressed before proceeding.</p><p>Hours later, President Trump also sharply criticized Facebook's plans to enter the cryptocurrency market, tweeting that the United States has \"one real currency\" and suggesting the social-networking giant may need to submit to heightened banking regulation.</p><p>Bitcoin fell to $11,658 as of Thursday morning, according to market data from Coindesk.</p><p>\"We are very much aligned with Chairman Powell on the need for governments, regulators, central banks, non-profits and others to be able to ask questions, share concerns and provide feedback on this project,\" said Facebook spokesman Andy Stone. \"This is why we, along with the 27 other Founding Members of the Libra Association, made this announcement so far in advance, so that we could engage in such constructive conversations.\"</p><p>Powell said that the Federal Reserve has set up a working group to assess the risks that Libra may pose to the financial system. He added that the Fed is coordinating with other U.S. regulatory agencies and central banks around the world to study the potential effects. \"The process of addressing these concerns, we think, should be a patient, careful one and not a sprint to implementation,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has described its cryptocurrency project as an empowering tool for people who lack access to financial services, especially in the developing world. The company plans to make the currency available to its 2.4 billion global users, with a digital wallet accessible through Messenger and WhatsApp, in addition to a stand-alone app.</p><p>\"With Libra, anyone with a $40 smartphone and connectivity will have the ability to securely safeguard their assets, access the world economy, transact at a much lower cost, and over time access a whole range of financial services,\" David Marcus, the head of Facebook's cryptocurrency initiative, said in a blog post this month.</p><p>Marcus said that Facebook announced plans for Libra well ahead of its release to encourage an \"open discussion.\"</p><p>But Powell's remarks highlight the potential roadblocks ahead. Washington's fresh concerns over Facebook's push into financial services comes as lawmakers and consumer watchdogs are ratcheting up their criticism of Silicon Valley. Democrats and Republicans have expressed heightened concerns over a range of issues that intersect with Facebook's business, from the spread of misinformation online, to consumer privacy and market concentration.</p><p>Last month, Trump continued his attack against big tech companies, suggesting that the federal government should take Google and Facebook to court, potentially on antitrust grounds. Several Democratic candidates vying for the White House have also seized on the backlash against major tech platforms, focusing on concerns of monopoly and labor relations. Presidential hopeful Sen.

Powell told Congress that Facebook's planned cryptocurrency raises \"many serious concerns.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bitcoin, the world's top cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has surged this year, in part because of Facebook's announcement of its own proposed virtual currency, Libra. Experts say Facebook's momentous entrance could accelerate the adoption of alternative currency and payment systems, lifting the prospects of other cryptocurrencies in the process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite the sudden rise in investor optimism, not everyone was thrilled with Facebook's intentions. When Libra was announced last month, the plans drew immediate scrutiny from regulators in the United States and abroad. The chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), called on Facebook to halt development of its cryptocurrency project until various policy concerns could be addressed.</p><p>On Wednesday, Powell confirmed that the Fed has reservations of its own. \"While the project's sponsors hold out the possibility of public benefits, including improved financial access for consumers, Libra raises many serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability,\" he said. \"These are concerns that should be thoroughly and publicly addressed before proceeding.\"</p><p>Hours later, President Trump also sharply criticized Facebook's plans to enter the cryptocurrency market, tweeting that the United States has \"one real currency\" and suggesting the social media giant may need to submit to heightened banking regulation.</p><p>Bitcoin fell to $11,658 as of Thursday morning, according to market data from Coindesk.</p><p>\"We are very much aligned with Chairman Powell on the need for governments, regulators, central banks, non-profits and others to be able to ask questions, share concerns and provide feedback on this project,\" said Facebook spokesman Andy Stone. \"This is why we, along with the 27 other Founding Members of the Libra Association, made this announcement so far in advance.\"</p><p>Powell said the Federal Reserve has set up a working group to assess the risks that Libra may pose to the financial system. He added that the Fed is coordinating with other U.S. regulatory agencies and central banks around the world to study the potential effects. \"The process of addressing these concerns, we think, should be a patient, careful one and not a sprint to implementation,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has described its cryptocurrency project as an empowering tool for people who lack access to financial services, especially in the developing world. The company plans to make the currency available to its 2.4 billion global users, with a digital wallet accessible through Messenger and WhatsApp, in addition to a stand-alone app.</p><p>\"With Libra, anyone with a $40 smartphone and connectivity will have the ability to securely safeguard their assets, access the world economy, transact at a much lower cost, and over time access a whole range of financial services,\" David Marcus, head of Facebook's cryptocurrency initiative, wrote in a July blog post.</p><p>But Powell's remarks highlight the potential roadblocks ahead. Washington's fresh concerns over Facebook's push into financial services comes as lawmakers and consumer watchdogs are ratcheting up their criticism of Silicon Valley. Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed heightened concerns over a range of issues that intersect with Facebook's business, from the spread of misinformation online, to consumer privacy and market concentration.</p><p>Last month, Trump continued his attack against big tech companies, suggesting the federal government should take Google and Facebook to court, potentially on antitrust grounds. Several Democratic candidates vying for the White House have also seized on the backlash against major tech platforms, focusing on concerns of monopoly and labor relations. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a presidential hopeful, has called for the breakup of Facebook and other tech companies that she says have grown too powerful.</p><p>How Washington's souring mood will apply to Facebook's cryptocurrency ambitions may reveal itself soon. Two congressional committees - one in the House and one in the Senate - plan to hold hearings next week to examine Facebook's Libra.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hamza.shaban@washpost.com\">hamza.shaban@washpost.com</email></p><p>Tony Romm contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-2d517488-a413-11e9-bd56-eac6bb02d01d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJC-50S1-DXXY-30CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Powell told Congress that Facebook's planned cryptocurrency raises \"many serious concerns.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bitcoin, the world's top cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has surged this year, in part because of Facebook's announcement of its own proposed virtual currency, Libra. Experts say Facebook's momentous entrance could accelerate the adoption of alternative currency and payment systems, lifting the prospects of other cryptocurrencies in the process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite the sudden rise in investor optimism, not everyone was thrilled with Facebook's intentions. When Libra was announced last month, the plans drew immediate scrutiny from regulators in the United States and abroad. The chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), called on Facebook to halt development of its cryptocurrency project until various policy concerns could be addressed.</p><p>On Wednesday, Powell confirmed that the Fed has reservations of its own. \"While the project's sponsors hold out the possibility of public benefits, including improved financial access for consumers, Libra raises many serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability,\" he said. \"These are concerns that should be thoroughly and publicly addressed before proceeding.\"</p><p>Hours later, President Trump also sharply criticized Facebook's plans to enter the cryptocurrency market, tweeting that the United States has \"one real currency\" and suggesting the social media giant may need to submit to heightened banking regulation.</p><p>Bitcoin fell to $11,658 as of Thursday morning, according to market data from Coindesk.</p><p>\"We are very much aligned with Chairman Powell on the need for governments, regulators, central banks, non-profits and others to be able to ask questions, share concerns and provide feedback on this project,\" said Facebook spokesman Andy Stone. \"This is why we, along with the 27 other Founding Members of the Libra Association, made this announcement so far in advance.\"</p><p>Powell said the Federal Reserve has set up a working group to assess the risks that Libra may pose to the financial system. He added that the Fed is coordinating with other U.S. regulatory agencies and central banks around the world to study the potential effects. \"The process of addressing these concerns, we think, should be a patient, careful one and not a sprint to implementation,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has described its cryptocurrency project as an empowering tool for people who lack access to financial services, especially in the developing world. The company plans to make the currency available to its 2.4 billion global users, with a digital wallet accessible through Messenger and WhatsApp, in addition to a stand-alone app.</p><p>\"With Libra, anyone with a $40 smartphone and connectivity will have the ability to securely safeguard their assets, access the world economy, transact at a much lower cost, and over time access a whole range of financial services,\" David Marcus, head of Facebook's cryptocurrency initiative, wrote in a July blog post.</p><p>But Powell's remarks highlight the potential roadblocks ahead. Washington's fresh concerns over Facebook's push into financial services comes as lawmakers and consumer watchdogs are ratcheting up their criticism of Silicon Valley. Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed heightened concerns over a range of issues that intersect with Facebook's business, from the spread of misinformation online, to consumer privacy and market concentration.</p><p>Last month, Trump continued his attack against big tech companies, suggesting the federal government should take Google and Facebook to court, potentially on antitrust grounds. Several Democratic candidates vying for the White House have also seized on the backlash against major tech platforms, focusing on concerns of monopoly and labor relations. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a presidential hopeful, has called for the breakup of Facebook and other tech companies that she says have grown too powerful.</p><p>How Washington's souring mood will apply to Facebook's cryptocurrency ambitions may reveal itself soon. Two congressional committees - one in the House and one in the Senate - plan to hold hearings next week to examine Facebook's Libra.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hamza.shaban@washpost.com\">hamza.shaban@washpost.com</email></p><p>Tony Romm contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-2d517488a41311e9bd56eac6bb02d01d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJC-1081-JCDY-T0CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><timeReceived>3:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

'We are known as the solicitors people come to for advice. This is such a new concept. It's difficult to explain to a High Court judge what a bitcoin is.'&lt;nl/&gt; Mr Howlett said some of the litigation work was high value, involving sums of over \u00a31m. Along with 39 Mt.Gox clients, he said he had advised almost 50 others on non-contentious bitcoin matters since Selachii was set up in 2013.&lt;nl/&gt;      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.part36insurance.co.uk/&lt;nl/&gt;'Lots\">http://www.part36insurance.co.uk/&lt;nl/&gt;'Lots</url> of clients want to set up in the UK and abroad, and they come to us. </p><p>A group of people flew over from Poland last week for a two-hour meeting, who want to set up a new exchange here.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Our turnover increases every month and it gets busier all the time. We are currently on course to increase turnover by 100% from our first year of trading.'&lt;nl/&gt; Mr Howlett, the HOLP and HOFA of Selachii, said the Notting Hill firm was the first to accept direct payments by bitcoin, using a 'virtual wallet'.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Other firms refer bitcoin payments to a third party, which converts it into normal currency,' he said. 'We don't do that. We hold the bitcoins as investments, in the hope their value will gradually increase. Values can go up and down during the day.'&lt;nl/&gt; Mr Howlett added that Selachii meant 'sharks' in Latin, which he said could be interpreted 'in different ways'.&lt;nl/&gt; Eitan Jankelewitz, associate at another bitcoin pioneer, Sheridans[1] in Soho, said 95% of his work with bitcoins was non-contentious.&lt;nl/&gt; 'We've got loads of work. Business is growing and it shows no sign of stopping. Our clients are generally companies. They could be bitcoin exchanges or 'mining' companies - the companies that process transactions. They could be custodians, who operate secure storage systems, or people who publish consumer 'wallets'. They could also be digital agencies who develop creative media for bitcoin.'&lt;nl/&gt; Mr Jankelewitz said that although bitcoin-related work probably accounted for no more than 25% of his work by fee income, the firm offered discounts to businesses 'because in five years' time we believe these businesses will be successful'.&lt;nl/&gt; He said the big tech firms in the USA were investing in bitcoin, and PayPal and Dell had already done deals involving the currency, while IBM was taking a growing interest.&lt;nl/&gt; The associate added that Sheridans accepted payment by bitcoin, but used a payment processor to take away the 'volatility of the currency'.&lt;nl/&gt; By Nick Hilborne[2]&lt;nl/&gt; Tags: alternative business structure[3], bitcoin[4], High Court[5], niche

Think again.</p><p>One of the few areas where Yahoo has been beating their competition -- Asian markets -- turned into a question mark in May, when a regulatory filing showed that Alibaba, a growing Chinese search company that Yahoo owns a large chunk of, had spun off their online-payment service. The new company would be independent and helmed by Alibaba's CEO, and Yahoo's 43 percent stake in Alibaba would not transfer to the new company.</p><p>Yahoo's investors exploded, not just because they believed that the firm's Asian investments totaled about half of the Sunnyvale company's net worth, but also because of being notified so long after the deal had<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_18057862?\"> taken place </url>. Alibaba CEO <person><nameText>Jack Ma </nameText></person>even      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_18186595?\"> told a conference in May </url>that discussions on Alipay had been ongoing for \"over three years,\" according to the Associated Press.</p><p>Finally, on Friday, a deal was announced. Alibaba will own 37.5 percent of Alipay, and Yahoo will get its share of that ownership percentage, including part of any IPO up to $6 billion.</p><p>But Wall Street thinks the $6 billion cap is less than Alipay could be worth when and if it does go public; basically, investors think Yahoo dropped the ball -- again.</p><p>\"Alipay agreement better than nothing, but not that great,\" J.P Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote Friday, according to AP.</p><p>Yahoo's share price kept falling as a result. They are now at $13.10 after falling $0.40, or 2.96 percent, on Friday. That's near the stock's 52-week low of $12.94,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_18516396?\"> reached just last week </url>. For a little perspective, Yahoo closed on June 30, 2006 at $33, one year before co-founder <person><nameText>Jerry Yang </nameText></person>returned as CEO. Yang's reign was effectively over in November 2008, when he turned down a $33-a-share takeover bid by Microsoft as Yahoo was trading at $14 a share.</p><p>His replacement,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/topics?Carol%20Bartz\"> Carol Bartz </url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2009/01/carol_bartz_to.html\"> stormed into Sunnyvale </url>pledging \"to create value for our shareholders and new possibilities for our customers, partners and employees.\"  On Jan. 9, 2009, the beginning of the week Bartz was named CEO, Yahoo was trading at $13.13 -- nearly the exact same price it closed at Friday.</p><p>Knowing those figures, investors are extremely restless, just as they were after Yang turned down Microsoft's offer.</p><p>Can Bartz survive? Not with more controversies like the Alibaba debacle, or stories<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-hosts-hardcore-porn-and-sells-ads-against-it-advertisers-react-with-outrage-2011-7\"> like this one </url>-- Business Insider reported Friday that Yahoo's Flickr photo-sharing site hosts pornographic pictures, and is placing ads from prominent advertisers next to them. Advertisers contacted by reporter Nicholas Carlson expressed \"outrage.\"</p><p>If you're looking for good news after that depressing Yahoo wrap-up, you'll have to look elsewhere: Friday's economic news was just as bad, if not worse.</p><p>The U.S. economy<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/business-headlines/ci_18575920\"> grew by only 1.3 percent last quarter </url>, the Commerce Department reported, and previous-quarter growth was revised downward sharply, from 1.9 percent to 0.4 percent. The economy needs to grow by about 3 percent a year just to keep up with population growth, AP reported.</p><p>\"It is hard to see the economy getting much stronger,\" Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"In fact, if the debt ceiling is not raised ... we could well have another recession on our hands.\"</p><p>Ah, yes, the Great Recession. The government also took a look back at that period -- officially defined as December 2007 through June 2009, for those without a recent AP Stylebook -- and determined that the 4.1 percent economic shrinkage reported during that period didn't quite cover it. The U.S. economy actually shrank a full percentage point more, 5.1 percent.</p><p>\"The depth of the recession is now clearly so much deeper,\" Nigel Gault, an economist at IHS, told AP.</p><p>So there's your bright news of the day -- it was so much worse a couple years ago.</p><p>The economic reports and the ongoing debt-ceiling debacle in D.C. combined to<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_18577324\"> put a hurt on the stock market </url>-- the Dow Jones lost almost 100 points on the day, its sixth straight day of losses.</p><p>Googlemade a proactive move in the Silicon Valley Patent War on Friday,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-29/google-acquires-inventions-from-ibm-as-it-faces-mounting-patent-litigation.html\"> purchasing more than 1,000 patents </url>from IBM.</p><p>Googlehas been a serious focus of other companies' patent moves -- Microsoft is already getting $5 for every Android phone sold in the U.S.,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/topics?Apple%2C%20Inc.\">Apple</url>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://markets.financialcontent.com/mng-ba.siliconvalley/quote?Symbol=AAPL\"> AAPL </url>) is trying to keep HTC's Android smartphones from being imported, and several big tech companies banded together to outbid the Mountain View company for a bevy of Nortel patents.

Think again.</p><p>One of the few areas where Yahoo has been beating their competition -- Asian markets -- turned into a question mark in May, when a regulatory filing showed that Alibaba, a growing Chinese search company that Yahoo owns a large chunk of, had spun off their online-payment service. The new company would be independent and helmed by Alibaba's CEO, and Yahoo's 43 percent stake in Alibaba would not transfer to the new company.</p><p>Yahoo's investors exploded, not just because they believed that the firm's Asian investments totaled about half of the Sunnyvale company's net worth, but also because of being notified so long after the deal had taken place. Alibaba CEO <person><nameText>Jack Ma </nameText></person>even told a conference in May that discussions on Alipay had been ongoing for \"over three years,\" according to the Associated Press.</p><p>Finally, on Friday, a deal was announced. Alibaba will own 37.5 percent of Alipay, and Yahoo will get its share of that ownership percentage, including part of any IPO up to $6 billion.</p><p>But Wall Street thinks the $6 billion cap is less than Alipay could be worth when and if it does go public; basically, investors think Yahoo dropped the ball -- again.</p><p>\"Alipay agreement better than nothing, but not that great,\" J.P Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote Friday, according to AP.</p><p>Yahoo's share price kept falling as a result. They are now at $13.10 after falling $0.40, or 2.96 percent, on Friday. That's near the stock's 52-week low of $12.94, reached just last week. For a little perspective, Yahoo closed on June 30, 2006 at $33, one year before co-founder <person><nameText>Jerry Yang </nameText></person>returned as CEO. Yang's reign was effectively over in November 2008, when he turned down a $33-a-share takeover bid by Microsoft as Yahoo was trading at $14 a share.</p><p>His replacement,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/topics?Carol%20Bartz\"> Carol Bartz </url>, stormed into Sunnyvale pledging \"to create value for our shareholders and new possibilities for our customers, partners and employees.\"  On Jan. 9, 2009, the beginning of the week Bartz was named CEO, Yahoo was trading at $13.13 -- nearly the exact same price it closed at Friday.</p><p>Knowing those figures, investors are extremely restless, just as they were after Yang turned down Microsoft's offer.</p><p>Can Bartz survive? Not with more controversies like the Alibaba debacle, or stories like this one -- Business Insider reported Friday that Yahoo's Flickr photo-sharing site hosts pornographic pictures, and is placing ads from prominent advertisers next to them. Advertisers contacted by reporter Nicholas Carlson expressed \"outrage.\"</p><p>Economy is still bad, and it was worse before</p><p>If you're looking for good news after that depressing Yahoo wrap-up, you'll have to look elsewhere: Friday's economic news was just as bad, if not worse.</p><p>The U.S. economy grew by only 1.3 percent last quarter, the Commerce Department reported, and previous-quarter growth was revised downward sharply, from 1.9 percent to 0.4 percent. The economy needs to grow by about 3 percent a year just to keep up with population growth, AP reported.</p><p>\"It is hard to see the economy getting much stronger,\" Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"In fact, if the debt ceiling is not raised ... we could well have another recession on our hands.\"</p><p>Ah, yes, the Great Recession. The government also took a look back at that period -- officially defined as December 2007 through June 2009, for those without a recent AP Stylebook -- and determined that the 4.1 percent economic shrinkage reported during that period didn't quite cover it. The U.S. economy actually shrank a full percentage point more, 5.1 percent.</p><p>\"The depth of the recession is now clearly so much deeper,\" Nigel Gault, an economist at IHS, told AP.</p><p>So there's your bright news of the day -- it was so much worse a couple years ago.</p><p>The economic reports and the ongoing debt-ceiling debacle in D.C. combined to put a hurt on the stock market -- the Dow Jones lost almost 100 points on the day, its sixth straight day of losses.</p><p>Google looks to Big Blue for patent help</p><p>Google made a proactive move in the Silicon Valley Patent War on Friday, purchasing more than 1,000 patents from IBM.</p><p>Google has been a serious focus of other companies' patent moves -- Microsoft is already getting $5 for every Android phone sold in the U.S.,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/topics?Apple%2C%20Inc.\"> Apple </url>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://markets.financialcontent.com/mng-ba.siliconvalley/quote?Symbol=AAPL\"> AAPL </url>) is trying to keep HTC's Android smartphones from being imported, and several big tech companies banded together to outbid the Mountain View company for a bevy of Nortel patents.

Also: The Dow closes higher than 13,000 for first time since before financial collapse, and news fromNetflixNFLX ),GoogleGOOG ),YahooYHOO ),Facebook and Microsoft.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">iPad 3 announcement invitations give Apple another record stock price</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Get ready for lines outside Apple stores, excited reports on new features and breathless accounts of sales numbers: The newest iPad is apparently almost ready for release.</p><p>Apple on Tuesday sent media members an invitation to an event at the Yerba Buena Center for Performing Arts in San Francisco on March 7, and the image in the email appears to show a person touching an iPad screen with the words \"We have something you really have to see. And touch.\"</p><p>The timing matches up with previous reports that Apple would announce the iPad 3 in the first week of March, with the U.S. release planned about a week later. That is a similar lag time between announcement and release of the iPad 2, which went on sale nine days after Apple showed it off to the press; Apple refused to comment beyond the invitation's typically cryptic wording.</p><p>Rumors about the new features of the iPad 3 have been rampant almost from the moment the iPad 2 debuted in 2011. The most consistent reports so far, many from blogs that claim to have seen specific parts destined for the iPad 3, have focused on a larger battery that will provide twice the battery power of an iPad 2, as well as a faster processor, more memory and a higher resolution display. Mercury News TechFiles columnist Troy Wolverton's dream additions to the popular tablet computer include a lot more.</p><p>Apple has sold more than 55 million iPads, generating at least $34.5 billion in revenue, since the original Apple tablet was introduced in 2009, Bloomberg News reported. Even after Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble introduced tablets that cost less than half of an iPad's retail starting price late last year, Apple still managed to ship 57 percent of tablets worldwide in the 2011 holiday shopping season, according to IHS iSuppli, leading to record-breaking revenues in the fourth quarter.</p><p>The iPad 3 is almost assured to instantly produce gargantuan sales numbers -- the latest iPhone, the 4S, sold 4 million units in just the first three days of availability -- but a Chinese company is endeavoring to keep Apple from calling it an iPad.</p><p>Proview, which trademarked the name IPAD for a product it released in 2000, has amended a lawsuit it filed in Santa Clara County courts to seek worldwide rights to the name. The company claims that a 2009 deal in which Apple paid for the rights to the trademark was entered into due to Apple's misleading tactics.</p><p>Proview's claims against Apple have led to seizures of iPads in four cities in China, where two courts have ruled in Proview's favor. Apple is appealing a ruling in Proview's favor and won a ruling in a Hong Kong court case.</p><p>Investors certainly seemed to care more about the iPad 3 announcement than the lawsuit, however, as Apple stock closed at another all-time high of $535.41 after increasing $9.65, or 1.8 percent, on Tuesday. Apple remains the most valuable company in the United States in terms of market capitalization -- the total value of all shares in circulation -- and ended Tuesday trading with a market cap just shy of $500 billion.</p><p>Dow finally closes above 13,000, and it may not stop there</p><p>Apple's record share price was not the biggest news Tuesday on Wall Street, however, as the Dow Jones industrial average finally closed higher than 13,000 for the first time since May 2008 -- before the U.S. economy collapsed in the subprime mortgage crisis.</p><p>The Dow had surpassed 13,000 several times during trading sessions starting last week, but had not managed to stay above the milestone mark. Driven by a surprising uptick in U.S. consumer confidence reported Tuesday, however, the blue-chip stock index rallied above the mark and stayed there.</p><p>While the mark means very little in terms of stock market strength -- the Dow increased only 0.2 percent Thursday in order to crack the barrier -- it is huge in terms of the psychology of investors and ordinary Americans, analysts said.</p><p>\"People can see that the markets bounce back and are resilient over time,\" Marc Scudillo, managing officer at financial advice company EisnerAmper, told the Associated Press. \"That's a powerful message.\"</p><p>\"A major milestone like 13,000 wakes up a lot of investors who have missed a lot of this rally,\" Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist for Schaffer's Investment Research, told AP.</p><p>Most importantly, the Dow may not stop at 13,000. While there have been several bears on Wall Street talking of a correction lately, many analysts are taking the opposing viewpoint, saying that the economy is back on track and Wall Street will continue to prosper.</p><p>\"I don't have rose-colored glasses on, but I think the path of least resistance is up,\" Richard Weeks, managing director of VWG Wealth Management, told Bloomberg News. \"The news is generally good. Short-term, all signs say that risks have been reduced.\"</p><p>For Mercury News columnist Mike Cassidy's views on the Dow milestone and Apple's inclusion in the index, click here.</p><p>Netflix stock increases despite loss of Starz content, HBO Go move</p><p>One stock that advanced strongly Tuesday on Wall Street was Netflix, which faces the loss of a substantial portion of its streaming material and competition from its most dreaded competitor, yet says more original content will help assuage threats.</p><p>The Los Gatos-based streaming-video and DVD-by-mail service will lose streaming access to its library from the Starz cable channel Wednesday, as the companies' contract ends. Starz refused to extend its deal with Netflix last year despite reports that Netflix was willing to substantially increase its payments to the content provider.</p><p>Netflix will lose a wealth of movies due to the change, including kid-friendly fare from Disney such as Pixar's \"Toy Story 3.\" For a full list of the content that will no longer be available, organized by user rating, click here</p><p>Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has said that the company's biggest competitor is HBO Go, the online streaming portion of the pay-TV channel. Now, that service is being made available on Xbox 360, giving users an added incentive to use it instead of the Netflix streaming service, which is frequently accessed though video game consoles.</p><p>Hastings, however, did not sound frightened Tuesday during a speech at a conference in San Francisco. He told the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media &amp; Telecom Conference that Netflix is heading toward producing more original content, much like HBO or other cable channels. Netflix has already introduced its first original series, \"Lilyhammer,\" and has several more in the works, including new episodes of the cult comedy favorite \"Arrested Development.\"</p><p>Despite the pending Starz exodus and HBO Go threat, Netflix stock shot up 3.6 percent on Tuesday to close at $113.32.</p><p>More news from big tech companies</p><p>Tuesday was a busy day for business news, especially in the technology sector. Here's some important tidbits:</p><p>-- Yahoo told Facebook on Monday that it had to start paying licensing fees or face lawsuits claiming that it was illegally using patented Yahoo technology on its social network. Yahoo stock rose slightly, 0.3 percent, on Tuesday.</p><p>-- A French regulator announced that he believes Google's new privacy policy breaks the European Union's data-protection laws. In addition, Reuters reported that Microsoft and other companies made antitrust complaints to the EU about the Mountain View company's social network Google+,\u00bf though Microsoft denied the report. Google stock didn't feel the brunt of the negative news, as it increased 1.5 percent Tuesday to close at $618.39.</p><p>-- Microsoft will unveil a beta version of Windows 8 on Wednesday at the Mobile World Congress, where Google ChairmanEric Schmidt gave a keynote address Tuesday.</p><p>Silicon Valley tech stocks</p><p>Up: Netflix,SunPowerSPWRA ), Apple, Gilead, Google,IntelINTC ), Juniper, Advanced Micro Devices</p><p>Down: LinkedIn, Jive, Nvidia, Electronic Arts</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index: Up 20.60, or 0.69 percent, to 2,986.76</p><p>The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average: Up 23.61, or 0.18 percent, to 13,005.12</p><p>And the widely watched Standard &amp;

And touch.\"</p><p>The timing matches up with previous reports that Apple would announce the iPad 3 in the first week of March, with the U.S. release planned about a week later. That is a similar lag time between announcement and release of the iPad 2, which went on sale nine days after Apple showed it off to the press; Apple refused to comment beyond the invitation's typically cryptic wording.</p><p>Rumors about the<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ipad-3-leaked-parts-2012-2\"> new features of the iPad 3 </url>have been rampant almost from the moment the iPad 2 debuted in 2011. The most consistent reports so far, many from blogs that claim to have seen specific parts destined for the iPad 3, have focused on a larger battery that will provide twice the battery power of an iPad 2, as well as a faster processor, more memory and a higher resolution display. Mercury News TechFiles columnist Troy Wolverton's dream additions to the popular tablet computer      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/troy-wolverton/ci_19989526\"> include a lot more </url>.</p><p>Apple has sold more than 55 million iPads, generating at least $34.5 billion in revenue, since the original Apple tablet was introduced in 2010,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-28/apple-to-hold-product-event-march-7-to-unveil-what-s-said-to-be-the-ipad-3.html\">Bloomberg News reported </url>. Even after Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble introduced tablets that cost less than half of an iPad's retail starting price late last year, Apple still managed to ship 57 percent of tablets worldwide in the 2011 holiday shopping season,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.isuppli.com/Display-Materials-and-Systems/News/Pages/Apples-Toughest-Competition-in-the-Fourth-Quarter-Tablet-Market-Was-Apple.aspx\"> according to IHS iSuppli </url>, leading to      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_19812615\"> record-breaking revenues in the fourth quarter </url>.</p><p>The iPad 3 is almost assured to instantly produce gargantuan sales numbers -- the latest iPhone, the 4S, sold 4 million units in just the first three days of availability -- but a Chinese company is endeavoring to keep Apple from calling it an iPad.</p><p>Proview, which trademarked the name IPAD for a product it released in 2000, has<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/business/ci_20061273\"> amended a lawsuit it filed in Santa Clara County courts </url>to seek worldwide rights to the name. The company claims that a 2009 deal in which Apple paid for the rights to the trademark was entered into due to Apple's misleading tactics.</p><p>Proview's claims against Apple have led to seizures of iPads in four cities in China, where two courts have ruled in Proview's favor. Apple is appealing a ruling in Proview's favor and won a ruling in a Hong Kong court case.</p><p>Investors certainly seemed to care more about the iPad 3 announcement than the lawsuit, however, as Apple stock closed at another all-time high of $535.41 after increasing $9.65, or 1.8 percent, on Tuesday. Apple remains the most valuable company in the United States in terms of market capitalization -- the total value of all shares in circulation -- and ended Tuesday trading with a market cap just shy of $500 billion.</p><p>Dow finally closes above 13,000, and it may not stop there</p><p>Apple's record share price was not the biggest news Tuesday on Wall Street, however, as the Dow Jones industrial average<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_20062940\"> finally closed higher than 13,000 </url>for the first time since May 2008 -- before the U.S. economy collapsed in the subprime mortgage crisis.</p><p>The Dow had surpassed 13,000 several times during trading sessions starting last week, but had not managed to stay above the milestone mark. Driven by a surprising uptick in U.S. consumer confidence reported Tuesday, however, the blue-chip stock index rallied above the mark and stayed there.</p><p>While the mark means very little in terms of stock market strength -- the Dow increased only 0.2 percent Thursday in order to crack the barrier -- it is huge in terms of the psychology of investors and ordinary Americans, analysts said.</p><p>\"People can see that the markets bounce back and are resilient over time,\" Marc Scudillo, managing officer at financial advice company EisnerAmper, told the Associated Press. \"That's a powerful message.\"</p><p>\"A major milestone like 13,000 wakes up a lot of investors who have missed a lot of this rally,\" Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist for Schaffer's Investment Research, told AP.</p><p>Most importantly, the Dow may not stop at 13,000. While there have been several bears on Wall Street talking of a correction lately, many analysts are taking the opposing viewpoint, saying that the economy is back on track and Wall Street will continue to prosper.</p><p>\"I don't have rose-colored glasses on, but I think the path of least resistance is up,\" Richard Weeks, managing director of VWG Wealth Management,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-28/u-s-stock-futures-rise-before-consumer-confidence-durable-goods-reports.html\"> told Bloomberg News</url>. \"The news is generally good. Short-term, all signs say that risks have been reduced.\"</p><p>For Mercury News columnist Mike Cassidy's views on the Dow milestone and Apple's inclusion in the index, click<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/mike-cassidy/ci_20063104\"> here </url>.</p><p>Netflix stock increases despite loss of Starz content, HBO Go move</p><p>One stock that advanced strongly Tuesday on Wall Street was Netflix, which faces the loss of a substantial portion of its streaming material and competition from its most dreaded competitor, yet says more original content will help assuage threats.</p><p>The Los Gatos-based streaming-video and DVD-by-mail service will lose streaming access to its library from the Starz cable channel Wednesday, as the companies' contract ends. Starz refused to extend its deal with Netflix last year despite reports that Netflix was willing to substantially increase its payments to the content provider.</p><p>Netflix will lose a wealth of movies due to the change, including kid-friendly fare from Disney such as Pixar's \"Toy Story 3.\" For a full list of the content that will no longer be available, organized by user rating, click<url normalizedValue=\"http://tvandmoviesnow.com/netflix-starz-expiring-2012.html\"> here </url>.</p><p>Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has said that the company's biggest competitor is HBO Go, the online streaming portion of the pay-TV channel. Now, that service is being made available on Xbox 360, giving users an added incentive to use it instead of the Netflix streaming service, which is frequently accessed though video game consoles.</p><p>Hastings, however, did not sound frightened Tuesday during a speech at a conference in San Francisco. He told the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media &amp; Telecom Conference that Netflix is heading toward producing more original content, much like HBO or other cable channels. Netflix has already introduced its first original series, \"Lilyhammer,\" and has several more in the works, including new episodes of the cult comedy favorite \"Arrested Development.\"</p><p>Despite the pending Starz exodus and HBO Go threat, Netflix stock shot up 3.6 percent on Tuesday to close at $113.32.</p><p>More news from big tech companies</p><p>Tuesday was a busy day for business news, especially in the technology sector. Here's some important tidbits:</p><p>--<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_20060925\">Yahoo told Facebook</url>on Monday that it had to start paying licensing fees or face lawsuits claiming that it was illegally using patented Yahoo technology on its social network.

It highlighted the real risk of data dark arts and ignited debates about privacy and regulation. </p><p><br/><br/>The way in which our personal information is collected, stored and used has been under intense scrutiny ever since. While the world unravelled around Cambridge Analytica, the revelations have made the connected population a bit more careful about what they share online. <br/><br/>Even though big tech companies and lawmakers are under due pressure to guard the masses against exploitative actors across the digital spectrum, most applications of customer data are well-intentioned. Big data can be a force for good and effective tool in every digital business. <br/><br/>1. Personalisation<br/><br/>As an online travel start-up, personalisation is one of the best ways we put data to work at Travelcheck. Whether it s a newsletter or ad, personalising the content we place in front of customers can greatly improve its chances of resonating with a prospect. Building a comprehensive single view of the customer helps us segment and focus engagement so that it s relevant to its recipient. <br/><br/>For businesses, personalisation is a crucial differentiator as it becomes progressively more challenging to cut through the onslaught of noise people are subject to every day. Effective use of data sets in motion a continuous experience that is wholly personalised, clear and meaningful to customers.<br/><br/>&lt;!--EMBED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/788/197518.html\">https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/788/197518.html</url> :EMBED--&gt; <br/>2. Automation<br/><br/>Utilising data to automate customer-facing operations is equally important as how it is used to computerise processes and decision-making behind the scenes. Automation accelerates service delivery and reduces blind spots so that businesses can remain a few steps ahead when resolving a customer s query or problem more efficiently. <br/><br/>In practice, automation can facilitate self-serve features and lessen the need for cumbersome human interventions that cost time and money. If you ve ever spent too long in a call centre queue, then you ll appreciate the value automation brings to both businesses and customers. <br/><br/>3. Customer experience<br/><br/>At Travelcheck, for example, data strengthens continuity of the customer experience and informs us from one interaction and one device to the next. How do customers hear about our deals? How do they prefer to communicate with us? What steps did the customer take to book a deal? How did they pay for it and receive confirmation? Data is the crucial piece of the puzzle in the customer s journey and helps us optimise the experience so that it is intuitive, convenient and impressive.<br/><br/>In 2020, we will expand our platform and add verticals beyond flights, hotels, vehicle hire and holiday packages. As customers attach more products to the trips they create, I am interested to see the insights we generate as we work towards a single view of the customer. I believe the information we collect from our customers  travel behaviour will enrich the thoughtful and substantive connections we aim to have with our community.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BIZOTH-1199433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BIZOTH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXR-JB11-DY06-83T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">376648</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bizcommunity Publishing SA (Pty) Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13295\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 7, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Online travel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>travel industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>travel data</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>tourism and travel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Odette Faling</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CM7M</classCode><className>CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000916T</classCode><className>CUSTOMER RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000439</classCode><className>CUSTOMER SERVICE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0008X5U</classCode><className>CALL CENTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DP2L</classCode><className>TRAVEL &amp; TOURISM REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0008X5U</classCode><className>CALL CENTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The two stepped down from their posts in January 2012. Thorsten Heins now heads up the company. </p><p>Fregin, a lesser-known BlackBerry co-founder, served as the company's vice president of operations until he stepped down in March 2007.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2013 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The agency not only ignored the public in trashing the rules, it ignored the nation's startups[1], the people who built the internet[2], and any and all objective data[3]. They also ignored the rampant comment fraud[4] that occurred during the public comment period of the proceeding, a ham-fisted attempt by \"somebody\" to downplay the massive public opposition to the plan. For good measure the agency also blocked a law enforcement investigation[5] into said fraud and even made up a DDOS attack[6]. ISP lawyers and lobbyists know their victory could be short lived if looming lawsuits are able to convince a court that the FCC rushed to pass an \"arbitrary and capricious order\" while disregarding the public and violating FCC procedure. That's why they've begun pushing hard for new net neutrality legislation[7] they're claiming will put the debate to bed, but has one real purpose: to pass flimsy, loophole-filled rules now to prevent the FCC (or a future, less cash-compromised Congress) from passing tougher, better rules down the road. </p><p>Just days after Comcast began pushing harder for such legislation[8], the telecom industry's most loyal ally in the House, Tennessee Representative Marsha Blackburn, began pushing a law that perfectly mirrors everything Comcast asked for[9]. Namely, it makes everything but the most ham-fisted abuses (like outright blocking of websites) legal, effectively codifying federal apathy on net neutrality into law. The law doesn't ban paid prioritization, zero rating, interconnection shenanigans, or any of the areas the modern net neutrality debate currently resides. To push her fake Comcast and AT...ritten law, Blackburn keeps pushing violently misleading editorials like this one[10] (warning: autoplay video), where she doubles down on a decade of net neutrality falsehoods pushed by the telecom sector. That includes all of your favorite AT...Verizon, and Comcast talking points on the subject, ranging from the false canard[11] that the FCC's fairly modest rules destroyed sector investment, to the idea that the real villain here are Silicon Valley tech giants:\"The heavy-handed regulations imposed in 2015 have hurt innovation and decreased broadband investment, and only served to bolster the Big Tech special interests that pose a threat to online free speech.\"Again: SEC filings, ISP earnings reports, and countless statements by nearly a dozen ISP CEOs[12] contradicts the claim that the rules hurt broadband investment, but that doesn't stop Blackburn:\"With strong, permanent consumer protections and fewer burdensome federal regulations, internet service providers (ISPs) will again be able to innovate and invest. This will stand in stark contrast to the past two years, when network investment decreased by billions of dollars. We absolutely must reverse that trend, and we will do it with an approach that fits the new, and dynamic digital economy.\"But again, the broadband industry is lobbying for changes that go well beyond just killing net neutrality. They're (quite successfully) convincing the government to simultaneously gut FTC, FCC and state authority over broadband providers almost entirely[13], creating a massive accountability vacuum for companies that were already some of the least ethical, and least competitive in America. But they're worried that none of this can happen if the courts overturn the FCC's recent vote to repeal the rules, which is where loyal foot soldiers like Blackburn come in. Like Ajit Pai recently did[14], Blackburn goes out of her way to malign internet companies like Twitter, throwing a little red meat to a partisan base still upset by the platform's completely-unrelated efforts to rein in the nation's neo-nazi flare up. It's not the massive telecom duopolies with a decade of anti-competitive behavior to their names you should worry about, notes Blackburn, it's Twitter:\"These companies, with market caps that are two to four times that of service providers like Verizon or AT...go unregulated when it comes to neutrality - yet they spend millions advocating for heavy-handed regulations to be imposed on the ISPs that actually connect millions of Americans to the internet. This is not simply disingenuous, but it also has the potential to harm consumers.\"While Silicon Valley giants have problems of their own (though it's worth clarifying that Google doesn't truly support net neutrality and hasn't for the better part of this decade[15]), Blackburn once again ignores the fact that net neutrality is just a symptom of a lack of competition in broadband. Users angry with Google (with some exceptions, like advertising) can simply switch to another search engine or e-mail platform. Users don't have to use Twitter. But most users only have access to one or two broadband ISPs, which is where this entire problem originates. Net neutrality violations are just a symptom of a lack of competition in broadband, a problem Blackburn has repeatedly made worse by supporting ISP-written state laws hamstringing competition[16]. Blaming a problem she actively, repeatedly makes worse by pandering to AT...nd Comcast, then blaming Twitter for it is simply obnoxious. Blackburn, whose blind fealty to giant ISPs helped land her a role as chairman of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, proceeds to insist that anybody that tries to block her fake net neutrality law is the real enemy:\"You'll know who the real bad actors are when they try to block or throttle this important legislative effort in 2018.\"In reality, the \"bad actors\" are the ones supporting a ham-fisted repeal of incredibly popular rules that completely ignored the public interest. Blackburn won't be the last lawmaker to push such flimsy legislation. Expect a flurry of similar legislation proposals with tractor-trailer sized loopholes as ISP executives grow increasingly nervous that the looming FCC court battle may not go their way.Permalink[17] |

Correspondence that just a few years ago would have taken paper, pen, and postage, is now sent and received with the click of a mouse.</p><p>Everything happens online, from shopping to party planning to campaigning. We share our photos and milestones with our \"friends\"and with the companies who have built multibillion dollar empires based on their ability to convince us to surrender just one more unique piece of data.</p><p>Beyond social media, we live our everyday, transactional lives online, too. We bank via apps, sign up for credit cards using codes we received in an email, and manage our finances with cloud-based software.</p><p>Information we once would have locked securely in a desk drawer, we now plug into an online form without a second thought.</p><p>We have contributed to our own \"virtual you\" that is, our personal online footprint by trusting these platforms to keep our data secure.</p><p>In a way, this level of connectivity and trust has made life a lot easier, but it has also made us vulnerable to exploitation and exposure.</p><p>I have spoken before about consumers' justifiable expectation of a right to privacy online.</p><p>This year I introduced the BROWSER Act in an effort to codify this right. BROWSER gives Big Tech basic guidelines to follow when collecting and selling user data.</p><p>But protecting an individual's data is only part of the picture.</p><p>Last week, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Technology held a hearing to address the role digital services play in the distribution of violent and extremist content.</p><p>We welcomed testimony from Facebook, Twitter, and Google detailing what they're doing to remove extremist content from their platforms.</p><p>But I will tell you, before we talk about policing content, we as members of this Body need to make sure we understand how the American people view their use of social media and the internet.</p><p>Whether social media platforms should be regulated under the First Amendment is beside the point.</p><p>Americans view these services as open public forums, where they can speak their minds on everything from defense funding to the Emmy awards.</p><p>These consumers don't want the wild west; nor do they want to be censored based on a content reviewer's subjective opinion.</p><p>What they want is an \"objective cop on the beat\" who is equipped to identify incitement, threats, and other types of speech that could put lives at risk.</p><p>This, of course, is easier said than done. In the case of Facebook, for example, that translates to creating a set of standards that 30,000 in-house engineers and analysts, and 15,000 content reviewers will be able to apply.</p><p>45,000 people. And that's just one platform.</p><p>You know, there is a reason why, time and again, Big Tech executives ask Congress to exact more regulatory control over the way they do businessand it's this:</p><p>Policing legitimately dangerous content is a big joband policing \"awful but lawful\" content, as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg likes to call it, is an even bigger, more daunting task.</p><p>It takes 45,000 people to do a bare-minimum job for one company: imagine trying to create easy to understand, bright-line standards that 45,000 employees will be able to digest and apply quickly enough to keep up with the flow of content.</p><p>That has got to be an intimidating task.</p><p>But I will tell youif those executives think the government can do a better job deciding, down to the letter, what those standards should be, they are sorely mistaken.</p><p>Only the engineers and innovators know their companies well enough to set their own internal policies for acceptable uses of their platform.</p><p>But that's not to say I won't be taking an interest in their ideas.</p><p>For example: Facebook is in the process of putting together a \"content oversight board\" to adjudicate appeals from users whose posts have been deemed in violation, and taken down.</p><p>They've pledged to make the identities of the moderators and their decisions publicbarring any safety risksand to choose a diverse panel.</p><p>The biggest unanswered question here is, will the moderators really reflect the American political spectrum? How will they be chosen?

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. She's on a Judiciary Committee informal privacy legislative working group (see 1903180038), one of several ongoing efforts to draft a bill. Also at Wednesday's Free State Foundation event, FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips urged Congress to not adopt privacy legislation that would allow a private right of action.</p><p>Blackburn said final privacy legislation is likely \"going to end up being very narrow\" with \"one set of rules for the entire internet ecosystem,\" and that would bar companies from denying service to consumers who refuse opt-in consent to collection of personal information. There will also be language to address data security that will \"put a framework in place\" on data breach issues, she said. Blackburn touted her Balancing the Rights of Web Surfers Equally and Responsibly (Browser) Act (S-1116), which would make the FTC the privacy regulator for ISPs and edge companies and would require opt-in consent even for web browsing data (see 1904110052).</p><p>\"It's becoming increasingly obvious that tech companies absolutely cannot self-regulate,\" Blackburn said. Congress' job now is to give the sector \"a guide\" to move forward. Part of the solution must involve requiring major tech companies to be \"transparent with the American consumer,\" she said. \"Big tech needs to trust the American consumer to make a wise decision.\"</p><p>A new federal privacy law \"must provide for rules and regulation, but it should do so in a way that best permits for future growth and innovation and that encourages investment and risk-taking,\" Phillips said. Allowing a private right of action \"will have a substantial and unwarranted negative impact, particularly on small, innovative, businesses\" because they will have to \"prioritize lawsuit avoidance over doing what they do best.\" Government enforcement of a privacy law \"is the best way to balance\" regulation and innovation, Phillips said.</p><p>Phillips urged that Congress seek legislation that avoids the approach used in the EU's general data protection regulation and toward \"incorporating [the U.S.'] traditional harm-focused, risk-based approach to privacy protection.\" There's \"some evidence that ... investment in startups is down in Europe and more market share is flowing to the largest companies\" as a result of GDPR implementation, he said. GDPR gives U.S. lawmakers some important concepts to consider, including \"determining democratically a set of legitimate data uses where companies are free to operate, where even consent is not necessary.\"</p><p>CTIA Senior Vice President-Government Affairs Kelly Cole and others argued for a federal law to pre-empt state-level privacy statutes. \"We have some real concerns with\" the California Consumer Privacy Act, which CTIA believes was \"pulled together in days\" without consulting private sector stakeholders, said Cole: \"I would certainly not recommend\" Congress use that statute as the \"base\" for a federal law. Center for Democracy and Technology Privacy and Data Project Director Michelle Richardson believes the sort of \"patchwork\" of state-level privacy laws \"is still a year or two away,\" which in itself might \"inspire Congress to move faster.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG4-9F21-DYRJ-014B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"582\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 27, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Of adults, 68% use Facebook, 73% use YouTube, and a quarter use Twitter. The numbers are much higher for adults under 50. Two-thirds of adults and roughly 4 in 5 under 50 use social media to consume news. Three-quarters of Facebook users are on the site every day, and Twitter users have a disproportionate influence on the media because so many journalists are on the service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The size and scale of social media companies exploded primarily because they presented themselves as open platforms \u2014 blank slates. Google, Facebook, and Twitter all characterized their products as engines for social improvement. \u201cWe think of Twitter as the global town hall,\u201d said former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. \u201cWe are the free speech wing of the free speech party.\u201d</p><p>Costolo was Twitter\u2019s chief executive from 2010 until 2015 and the immediate predecessor of current CEO Jack Dorsey. Twitter\u2019s general manager in the United Kingdom, Andy Yang, likewise described Twitter as the \u201cfree speech wing of the free speech party\u201d in March 2012. Google became a multibillion-dollar company by offering a portal for free, unrestricted information to anyone with access to the internet; famously, its original motto was \u201cDon\u2019t be evil.\u201d An internal Facebook memo circulated in June 2016 stated that at Facebook, \u201cwe believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good.\u201d</p><p>The public has given these three tech companies (and others) enormous power to select the information we read, share, and discuss with our neighbors and friends. We\u2019ve gotten so accustomed to the role they play in our lives that we fail to notice that Big Tech is sifting through the available information and narrowing, and prioritizing, our choices. Although Facebook, Google, and Twitter once touted themselves as bastions of democracy and free speech, they are now openly moving toward direct censorship and media manipulation \u2014 and specifically targeting conservative ideas and personalities.</p><p>They have already acquiesced to their new censorship fetish. In March 2018, Google circulated an internal memo that instructed employees on the benefits of censorship. In the memo, which was titled \u201cThe Good Censor,\u201d Google conceded that while the internet was \u201cfounded upon utopian principles of free speech,\u201d free speech is no longer en vogue. \u201cTech companies are adapting their stance towards censorship\u201d in direct response to \u201cthe anxiety of users and governments.\u201d The memo said that \u201ctech firms have gradually shifted away from unmediated free speech and towards censorship and moderation\u201d but framed that shift as a positive development. One major way that tech companies are \u201cstepping into the role of moderator\u201d is by \u201csignificantly amping up the number of moderators they employ \u2014 in YouTube\u2019s case increasing the number of people on the lookout for inappropriate content to more than 10,000.\u201d It argued that censorship was necessary partly because of users \u201cbehaving badly.\u201d</p><p>The most alarming part of the missive, however, was that it spoke approvingly of foreign governments that were censoring online speech. Google framed the acts as \u201ctaking steps to make online spaces safer, more regulated, and more similar to their offline laws. Protected from hate speech on the street? Now you are on the net too ...\u201d Twitter has completely and publicly abandoned its brand as the \u201cfree speech wing of the free speech party,\u201d with Dorsey claiming the whole \u201cfree speech wing\u201d thing was one giant \u201cjoke.\u201d His company, once seemingly devoted to the free expression of its users, now says it is prioritizing making users feel safe from others\u2019 speech. Facebook, too, is openly rebranding itself as a benevolent censor. Here\u2019s what Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees in April 2018 (emphasis added):</p><p>Overall, I would say that we\u2019re going through a broader philosophical shift in how we approach our responsibility as a company. For the first 10 or 12 years of the company, I viewed our responsibility as primarily building tools that, if we could put those tools in people\u2019s hands, then that would empower people to do good things. What I think we\u2019ve learned now across a number of issues, not just data privacy, but also fake news and foreign interference in elections, is that we need to take a more proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility. It\u2019s not enough to just build tools. We need to make sure that they\u2019re used for good. And that means that we need to now take a more active view in policing the ecosystem and in watching and kind of looking out and making sure that all of the members in our community are using these tools in a way that\u2019s going to be good and healthy.</p><p>Three forces are driving Big Tech\u2019s online censorship. Two are external and related: market pressures and de-platforming campaigns by liberal activists and journalists. The third pressure is internal: Silicon Valley is staggeringly one-sided politically. Profit margins and market pressures are crucial levers that left-wing ideologues use to pull tech giants and other corporations in the direction of censorship. Companies want to avoid controversy, and, in the era of outrage mobs, that means avoiding offending the Left, which controls most of the cultural institutions in America. That\u2019s part of the reason why massive companies are embracing left-wing politics in advertising, such as what Gillette did with its \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d ad. Left-wing activists amplify those pressures with smear campaigns and boycotts intended to rattle advertisers and investors, forcing the hands of tech companies. If you convince corporate marketing agencies that advertising on Facebook is risky, you can be certain that Facebook will take some form of action to shed controversy and reassure investors.</p><p>The external pressures of left-wing activists are compounded by the internal pressures of the companies\u2019 employees, who want Big Tech to embrace censorship against nonliberal opinions as a moral and political necessity. The internal office cultures at Facebook, Google, and Twitter have always been overwhelmingly left-leaning, but the election of Donald Trump as president has made them far more radical. I told one Silicon Valley insider that I thought tech culture now resembled the left-wing, activist culture on college campuses. He replied, \u201cThey\u2019re the exact same people.\u201d Their political opinions are certainly monochromatic. Of the $8.1 million that tech industry workers donated to presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign, 95% of it went to Hillary Clinton. Among donations from the Silicon Valley area specifically, 99% went to Clinton.</p><p>So, maybe it\u2019s not surprising that Google, Facebook, and Twitter have all become vehicles for left-wing activism. The companies encourage employees to bring their \u201cauthentic selves\u201d to work. One Silicon Valley executive told me, \u201cWe want people to ... bring their entire perspective and all their values to work, and in the positive sense, that means getting rid of a huge distinction between my professional life and my personal life.\u201d For left-wing activists in Silicon Valley, their professional, personal, and political lives are all one. That\u2019s why Twitter launched an \u201cintersectionality\u201d initiative for its employees and Google gives millions to left-wing causes \u2014 to signal its allegiance to the tribe. </p><p>In 2017, the nonprofit Lincoln Network conducted a survey of tech workers in Silicon Valley, including those employed at Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. The political leanings of those surveyed were more politically diverse than Silicon Valley\u2019s overall population: 29% were liberal, 24% were libertarian, 22% were conservative, and 16% were centrist. But on one thing, they agreed: 75% of the liberals and 70% of the conservatives characterized their workplace as either \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cvery liberal\u201d and fewer than 2% of the survey-takers said their places of work were conservative.</p><p>Even some of the liberal respondents thought that left-wing intolerance had gone too far. One liberal tech worker said, \u201cI witnessed repeated calls from managers and nonmanagers alike for people to be fired for the political views they expressed.\u201d Another liberal employee said, \u201cThere are people who are looking for a reason to be offended, and any sort of disagreement would make them wonder if I\u2019m a secret Trump supporter. The idea of \u2018I agree with you 90%\u2019 is not enough.\u201d One self-identified libertarian said, \u201cI have lost multiple talented colleagues who resigned rather than continue in the face of an increasingly extreme, narrow-minded, and regressive environment here at Google. It\u2019s terrifying here. A real horror show. Every day could be my last.\u201d </p><p>Eighty-nine percent of respondents who identified as \u201cvery conservative\u201d said they didn\u2019t feel comfortable expressing their opinions at work. \u201cIt\u2019s a postmodern, secularist Silicon Valley viewpoint. Highly liberal. It\u2019s motivated by changing the world masquerading as intellectualism,\u201d said one conservative tech employee. A libertarian said \u201cthere were many groups devoted to identity politics\u201d in his company, and every one of them was leftist. \u201cIf you\u2019re not part of the liberal Democrat crowd, you\u2019re an outsider. Talks are often politicized, whether overtly or not. The entire executive team leans in a certain direction, and you don\u2019t want to be the odd one out for fear of being ostracized ... Nobody who didn\u2019t fit the company\u2019s mold talked about their political views. The company was very homogenous in that sense.\u201d One conservative employee said, \u201cThere is overwhelming internal support for leftist political candidates, policies, and ideas, and they are frequently expressed ... There are zero to very few senior people who dare to speak up or represent an alternative (more conservative) point of view in company debates or policy decisions.\u201d</p><p>This groupthink affects everything that Big Tech does, every decision it makes, every program it releases. As a former Google engineer noted, Google\u2019s algorithms reflect the assumptions and biases of their creators. The discussion about tech platforms and political bias often (and understandably) centers on what is or isn\u2019t allowed on Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, but the other half of the picture is what is and isn\u2019t prioritized on a platform. Broadly speaking, tech companies censor users and content in two ways. The first, which we\u2019ll call \u201chard censorship,\u201d is pretty straightforward: deleting content or suspending users. The second method, which we\u2019ll call \u201csoft censorship,\u201d involves tech companies making content harder to find. Hard censorship is tearing down a roadside billboard; soft censorship is making the billboard difficult to see by erecting other billboards in front of it. Soft censorship by tech companies can be just as effective as hard censorship. Studies show that people rarely click past the first page of Google or YouTube results. Even fewer click past the second or third page. So, pushing a link off the first page (or two or three) of Google is nearly the same as removing it from Google results altogether. The same is true with your Facebook and Twitter feeds: Companies don\u2019t have to delete content to make sure you don\u2019t see it. </p><p>Since 2016, every major tech company, including Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter, has been busy retooling algorithms or news feeds or monetization standards in ways that benefit liberals and sideline conservatives. Big Tech also partners with left-wing groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center to \u201cflag\u201d supposedly problematic content. The group falsely labels individual conservatives as \u201cextremists\u201d and conservative organizations as \u201chate groups\u201d and then promotes more restrictive content policies against alleged \u201chate speech.\u201d</p><p>To give you some idea of the advocacy group\u2019s standards, it once accused Ben Carson of being an \u201cextremist\u201d for stating his belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. Immersed in scandals of its own, the organization has been widely discredited. But it still works closely with Google engineers who design the digital tools and algorithms to police hate speech on YouTube as part of Google\u2019s \u201cTrusted Flaggers\u201d program. Google kept its collaboration with the Southern Poverty Law Center a secret, hidden behind a confidentiality agreement, and the group only admitted the partnership after I broke the story. All of these partnerships are occurring while the advocacy group publicly keeps pressure on Facebook, Google, and Twitter, calling for them to do more to combat \u201chate speech\u201d on their platforms, which invariably means giving the organization more power in its private dealings with the companies. The Southern Poverty Law Center led five other left-wing groups in forming a coalition called \u201cChange the Terms\u201d that aims to pressure all major technology service providers into setting speech codes governing what their clients say both on and off their platforms.</p><p>The coalition demands that each company agree to implement a specific set of policies already drafted by the activists. Among the required changes: empowering third-party organizations (such as, say, the Southern Poverty Law Center) to flag \u201chateful\u201d actors. The activists\u2019 targets aren\u2019t limited to Facebook, Google, and Twitter (although those companies are certainly on the list) but also include credit card companies and crowdfunding sites. Once a company caves to the pressure and agrees to adopt the left-wing contract, it has essentially deputized the coalition to decide who can stay on its platform or use its services and who must leave. Once the contract is official, the activists immediately shift gears to identify the users or customers the company is now required to ban from its platform. Left-wingers\u2019 plan for weaponizing tech platforms bears a resemblance to the \u201csocial credit score\u201d system adopted by the Chinese government. Only instead of the government monitoring your private behavior and limiting your access to society as a result, it\u2019s a collective of left-wing advocacy groups partnered with multinational corporations.</p><p>First Amendment rights do not protect you from private organizations\u2019 limitations on speech. It\u2019s a devious strategy, and it\u2019s working. Media Matters is a left-wing political group devoted to silencing conservative viewpoints in the media. For much of its history, it focused on attacking Fox News, but in recent years, it targeted conservative voices online as well. Media Matters presented a 44-page memo to liberal donors at a January 2017 summit that bragged about its plans to work with Facebook and Google to destroy nonliberal media outlets. The memo argued that enlisting Big Tech in the left-wing campaign to eliminate conservative media is essential if liberals hope to defeat Trump in 2020. Media Matters promised to accomplish exactly that. \u201cKey right-wing targets will see their influence diminished as a result of our work,\u201d it promised.</p><p>Leftists don\u2019t need to banish every conservative from social media; they only need to dominate social media the way they dominate the mainstream media. They\u2019re OK with discussion that takes place within boundaries they set (as on MSNBC) and so long as they win the elections that matter to them (such as the White House). Since Nov. 8, 2016, they have shifted the digital landscape against conservative voices. By Nov. 3, 2020, they will have transformed (or rigged) social media in ways that will have far-reaching implications for America.</p><p>Peter Hasson is an editor at the Daily Caller News Foundation and author of The Manipulators, from which this essay is adapted.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2348730199</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3R-FW91-JBHT-D4JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Now everyone protesting for police reform needs to hold the companies to it. Like dominoes in a lineup of corporate public relations stunts, first IBM, then Amazon and finally Microsoft (at a Washington Post Live event) each said it won't sell or would at least pause police use of its facial recognition technology until there are federal laws on the matter. Never mind that none of these companies were actually major players in the police facial recognition market. (Microsoft admitted it didn't sell the tech to U.S. police at all.) </p><p>But civil rights leaders and privacy advocates I've spoken to this week tell me what they need is for big tech to stop arresting their legislative efforts to make the technology off-limits. So far, Silicon Valley's record has mostly put it at odds with groups like Color of Change, the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union. A Microsoft employee literally wrote a new facial recognition law in Washington state opposed by many civil rights groups for not being tough enough. What happens next will impact the lives of many Americans. Facial recognition technology uses photos to help computers identify people. You might have already encountered it to unlock your phone or board an airplane. It can also be used to identify people who don't even know they're being watched, like at a protest. It's one of the most powerful surveillance tools ever invented, but even a federal government study found it to be less accurate at identifying minorities and women. Ramping up its use could, in theory, help keep criminals from escaping arrest - but it also opens a slippery slope to a world of supercharged policing that's likely to disproportionately impact people of color through misidentification or just more surveillance of minority communities. Amazon also owns the connected doorbell maker Ring, which privacy groups have criticized for partnering with hundreds of police forces, granting them potential access to camera footage of many American streets. Ring doesn't currently offer facial recognition, but its video can be shared with police who have it. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) There's no evidence of police using facial recognition technology to make arrests of people protesting the death of George Floyd, though it may take time for those records to emerge. Police in dozens of U.S. cities have access to the tech, and in several have explicitly asked citizens to share images of protesters. What changed this week is that facial recognition got linked to police racism, the issue that's gotten Americans angry enough to protest during a pandemic and made the tech politically toxic. Previously, privacy advocates (including me) had linked it to less urgent-sounding concerns like surveillance and squashed speech. To be clear, this week's announcements alone likely won't do much to stop the use of this technology by law enforcement. The most important players in the murky market, such as NEC Corp, Idemia and Clearview AI, are lesser-known companies that have not joined in on the voluntary moratoriums. \"Clearview AI is also committed to the responsible use of its powerful technology and is used only for after-the-crime investigations to help identify criminal suspects,\" the company said in a statement. NEC said its technology could combat racism, by helping to \"correct inherent biases, protect privacy and civil liberties, and fairly and effectively conduct investigations for social justice.\" Idemia didn't immediately reply to requests for comment. The only thing that's really going to stop police from using the tech is new laws. That's why the announcements by IBM, Amazon and Microsoft were a success for activists - a rare retreat by some of Silicon Valley's biggest names over a key new technology. This came from years of work by researchers including Joy Buolamwini to make the case that facial recognition software is biased. A test commissioned by the ACLU of Northern California found Amazon's software called Rekognition misidentified 28 lawmakers as people arrested for a crime. That happens, in part, because the systems are trained on data sets that are themselves skewed. Yet facial-recognition opponents say the problems go far beyond bad software. \"Yes, accuracy disparities mean already marginalized communities face the brunt of misidentifications,\" said Buolamwini, founder of an organization called the Algorithmic Justice League. \"But the point isn't just that facial recognition systems can misidentify faces, it's that the technology itself can be used in biased ways by governments or corporations.\" For example, more cameras could be pointed at minority neighborhoods, used to target immigrants or even people who join protests about police brutality. Buolamwini has asked tech companies to sign a pledge that would prohibit the use of the their technology in contexts where lethal force may be used, including by police or the military. (So far, none of the big ones have.) \"There are too many ways in which it can be recklessly applied, and too few examples of the ways in which it serves a fundamental public good,\" said Brandi Collins-Dexter, Senior Campaign Director with the organization Color of Change, which opposed the California bill. That's why she and others are calling for not just better facial recognition tech, but a stop to its use by governments. A half-dozen cities such as San Francisco already have those sorts of laws. On Tuesday, Boston held a hearing about adopting its own ban, during which Police Commissioner William Gross said he didn't want to use the tech because it was faulty. The challenge, say opponents of facial recognition, is that tech companies want to say they support civil rights without actually putting significant limits on potential business upside. There are potential military, international and corporate contracts at stake, largely missing from this week's promises. And weak laws could end up legitimizing police use of the tech. Microsoft, in particular, has been trying to have it both ways. Last week CEO Satya Nadella told employees in a blog post the company would support racial justice to honor the death of Floyd. A day earlier, the company was fighting some 65 civil rights organizations in California to push a law authorizing police and companies to use facial recognition tech with some restrictions that fall far short of a moratorium. Microsoft didn't get its way in California: AB 2261 failed in the state's legislature last week. Microsoft was the first big tech company to call for facial recognition laws back in 2018, and has been the most visible in state house and city hall hearings. It says it opposes use of facial recognition for mass surveillance, racial profiling or other violations of basic human rights and freedoms. \"We need to use this moment to pursue a strong national law to govern facial recognition that is grounded in the protection of human rights,\" said Microsoft president Brad Smith at The Post event Thursday. \"If all the responsible companies in the country cede this market to those that are not prepared to take a stand, we won't necessarily serve the national interest or the lives of the black and African American people.\" But the company's legislative stance so far has boiled down to: Put some rules in place, sure - but not a moratorium on it. The devil is in the details. In Washington state, Microsoft supported facial recognition legislation - sponsored by Microsoft employee State Sen. Joe Nguyen - that outlines some of how the government can use the tech, and requires agencies to produce accountability reports. And it addresses accuracy concerns by saying government agencies can only use the tech if it comes from a developer that makes its software available for testing. But opponents said the Washington law comes with too few limits and enforcement measures. \"Agencies may use face surveillance without any restrictions to surveil entire crowds at football stadiums, places of worship, or on public street corners, chilling people's constitutionally protected rights and civil liberties,\" said the ACLU of Washington. Microsoft's announcement this week that it is wouldn't sell to police until there is a federal law \"should feel like winning but it feels more like a thinly veiled threat,\" said Liz O'Sullivan, the technology director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. The Washington law, she said, would be a bad model for Congress. \"They're seeding the conversations around facial recognition regulation in a number of states by lobbying for bills that might look to a lot of people like they've got really strict protections. But then, if you actually look at them, they don't really actually regulate the technology much as it's used,\" said Jameson Spivack, a policy associate at Georgetown Law School's Center on Privacy &amp; Technology. \"It's their way of getting ahead of the opposition and co-opting the movement.\" Amazon, which didn't reply to my requests for comment, has said less in public about its legislative goals, aside from calling for federal privacy and facial-recogntion legislation. One pressing issue for any national legislation is whether it would overrule state and local laws that might be more strict. \"Legislatures and activists and civil rights groups are already leading on this issue,\" said Matt Cagle, Technology and Civil Liberties attorney for the ACLU of Northern California. \"We just hope that companies like Microsoft see that and stand with us rather than against us.\"\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NTION-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTION2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DH-FWM1-DYTP-P24Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nation News Network Co., Ltd.

Now everyone protesting for police reform needs to hold the companies to it. Like dominoes in a lineup of corporate public relations stunts, first IBM, then Amazon and finally Microsoft (at a Washington Post Live event) each said it won't sell or would at least pause police use of its facial recognition technology until there are federal laws on the matter. Never mind that none of these companies were actually major players in the police facial recognition market. (Microsoft admitted it didn't sell the tech to U.S. police at all.) </p><p>But civil rights leaders and privacy advocates I've spoken to this week tell me what they need is for big tech to stop arresting their legislative efforts to make the technology off-limits. So far, Silicon Valley's record has mostly put it at odds with groups like Color of Change, the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union. A Microsoft employee literally wrote a new facial recognition law in Washington state opposed by many civil rights groups for not being tough enough. What happens next will impact the lives of many Americans. Facial recognition technology uses photos to help computers identify people. You might have already encountered it to unlock your phone or board an airplane. It can also be used to identify people who don't even know they're being watched, like at a protest. It's one of the most powerful surveillance tools ever invented, but even a federal government study found it to be less accurate at identifying minorities and women. Ramping up its use could, in theory, help keep criminals from escaping arrest - but it also opens a slippery slope to a world of supercharged policing that's likely to disproportionately impact people of color through misidentification or just more surveillance of minority communities. Amazon also owns the connected doorbell maker Ring, which privacy groups have criticized for partnering with hundreds of police forces, granting them potential access to camera footage of many American streets. Ring doesn't currently offer facial recognition, but its video can be shared with police who have it. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) There's no evidence of police using facial recognition technology to make arrests of people protesting the death of George Floyd, though it may take time for those records to emerge. Police in dozens of U.S. cities have access to the tech, and in several have explicitly asked citizens to share images of protesters. What changed this week is that facial recognition got linked to police racism, the issue that's gotten Americans angry enough to protest during a pandemic and made the tech politically toxic. Previously, privacy advocates (including me) had linked it to less urgent-sounding concerns like surveillance and squashed speech. To be clear, this week's announcements alone likely won't do much to stop the use of this technology by law enforcement. The most important players in the murky market, such as NEC Corp, Idemia and Clearview AI, are lesser-known companies that have not joined in on the voluntary moratoriums. \"Clearview AI is also committed to the responsible use of its powerful technology and is used only for after-the-crime investigations to help identify criminal suspects,\" the company said in a statement. NEC said its technology could combat racism, by helping to \"correct inherent biases, protect privacy and civil liberties, and fairly and effectively conduct investigations for social justice.\" Idemia didn't immediately reply to requests for comment. The only thing that's really going to stop police from using the tech is new laws. That's why the announcements by IBM, Amazon and Microsoft were a success for activists - a rare retreat by some of Silicon Valley's biggest names over a key new technology. This came from years of work by researchers including Joy Buolamwini to make the case that facial recognition software is biased. A test commissioned by the ACLU of Northern California found Amazon's software called Rekognition misidentified 28 lawmakers as people arrested for a crime. That happens, in part, because the systems are trained on data sets that are themselves skewed. Yet facial-recognition opponents say the problems go far beyond bad software. \"Yes, accuracy disparities mean already marginalized communities face the brunt of misidentifications,\" said Buolamwini, founder of an organization called the Algorithmic Justice League. \"But the point isn't just that facial recognition systems can misidentify faces, it's that the technology itself can be used in biased ways by governments or corporations.\" For example, more cameras could be pointed at minority neighborhoods, used to target immigrants or even people who join protests about police brutality. Buolamwini has asked tech companies to sign a pledge that would prohibit the use of the their technology in contexts where lethal force may be used, including by police or the military. (So far, none of the big ones have.) \"There are too many ways in which it can be recklessly applied, and too few examples of the ways in which it serves a fundamental public good,\" said Brandi Collins-Dexter, Senior Campaign Director with the organization Color of Change, which opposed the California bill. That's why she and others are calling for not just better facial recognition tech, but a stop to its use by governments. A half-dozen cities such as San Francisco already have those sorts of laws. On Tuesday, Boston held a hearing about adopting its own ban, during which Police Commissioner William Gross said he didn't want to use the tech because it was faulty. The challenge, say opponents of facial recognition, is that tech companies want to say they support civil rights without actually putting significant limits on potential business upside. There are potential military, international and corporate contracts at stake, largely missing from this week's promises. And weak laws could end up legitimizing police use of the tech. Microsoft, in particular, has been trying to have it both ways. Last week CEO Satya Nadella told employees in a blog post the company would support racial justice to honor the death of Floyd. A day earlier, the company was fighting some 65 civil rights organizations in California to push a law authorizing police and companies to use facial recognition tech with some restrictions that fall far short of a moratorium. Microsoft didn't get its way in California: AB 2261 failed in the state's legislature last week. Microsoft was the first big tech company to call for facial recognition laws back in 2018, and has been the most visible in state house and city hall hearings. It says it opposes use of facial recognition for mass surveillance, racial profiling or other violations of basic human rights and freedoms. \"We need to use this moment to pursue a strong national law to govern facial recognition that is grounded in the protection of human rights,\" said Microsoft president Brad Smith at The Post event Thursday. \"If all the responsible companies in the country cede this market to those that are not prepared to take a stand, we won't necessarily serve the national interest or the lives of the black and African American people.\" But the company's legislative stance so far has boiled down to: Put some rules in place, sure - but not a moratorium on it. The devil is in the details. In Washington state, Microsoft supported facial recognition legislation - sponsored by Microsoft employee State Sen. Joe Nguyen - that outlines some of how the government can use the tech, and requires agencies to produce accountability reports. And it addresses accuracy concerns by saying government agencies can only use the tech if it comes from a developer that makes its software available for testing. But opponents said the Washington law comes with too few limits and enforcement measures. \"Agencies may use face surveillance without any restrictions to surveil entire crowds at football stadiums, places of worship, or on public street corners, chilling people's constitutionally protected rights and civil liberties,\" said the ACLU of Washington. Microsoft's announcement this week that it is wouldn't sell to police until there is a federal law \"should feel like winning but it feels more like a thinly veiled threat,\" said Liz O'Sullivan, the technology director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. The Washington law, she said, would be a bad model for Congress. \"They're seeding the conversations around facial recognition regulation in a number of states by lobbying for bills that might look to a lot of people like they've got really strict protections. But then, if you actually look at them, they don't really actually regulate the technology much as it's used,\" said Jameson Spivack, a policy associate at Georgetown Law School's Center on Privacy &amp; Technology. \"It's their way of getting ahead of the opposition and co-opting the movement.\" Amazon, which didn't reply to my requests for comment, has said less in public about its legislative goals, aside from calling for federal privacy and facial-recogntion legislation. One pressing issue for any national legislation is whether it would overrule state and local laws that might be more strict. \"Legislatures and activists and civil rights groups are already leading on this issue,\" said Matt Cagle, Technology and Civil Liberties attorney for the ACLU of Northern California. \"We just hope that companies like Microsoft see that and stand with us rather than against us.\"\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NTION-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTION2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-6N51-JCBN-00X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nation News Network Co., Ltd.

That happens in part because the systems are trained on data sets that are themselves skewed.</p><p>Yet opponents of facial recognition technology say the problems go far beyond bad software. \"Yes, accuracy disparities mean already marginalized communities face the brunt of misidentifications,\" said Buolamwini, who founded an organization called the Algorithmic Justice League. \"But the point isn't just that facial recognition systems can misidentify faces, it's that the technology itself can be used in biased ways by governments or corporations.\"</p><p>For example, more cameras could be pointed at minority neighborhoods, used to target immigrants or even people who join protests about police brutality.</p><p>Buolamwini has asked tech companies to sign a pledge that would prohibit the use of the their technology in contexts in which lethal force may be used, including by police or the military. (So far, none of the big ones have.)</p><p>\"There are too many ways in which it can be recklessly applied, and too few examples of the ways in which it serves a fundamental public good,\" said Brandi Collins-Dexter, senior campaign director at Color of Change.</p><p>That's why she and others are calling for not just better facial recognition tech but a stop to its use by governments.</p><p>A half-dozen cities, such as San Francisco, already have those sorts of laws. On Tuesday, Boston held a hearing about adopting a ban, during which Police Commissioner William Gross said he didn't want to use the tech because it was faulty.</p><p>The challenge, say opponents of facial recognition technology, is that tech companies want to say they support civil rights without actually putting significant limits on potential business upside. There are potential military, international and corporate contracts at stake, largely missing from this week's promises. And weak laws could end up legitimizing police use of the tech.</p><p>Microsoft in particular has been trying to have it both ways. Last week, chief executive Satya Nadella told employees in a blog post that the company would support racial justice to honor the death of Floyd. A day earlier, the company was fighting some 65 civil rights organizations in California to push a bill to authorize police and companies to use facial recognition tech with some restrictions that fall far short of a moratorium.</p><p>Microsoft didn't get its way in California: AB 2261 failed in the state's legislature last week.</p><p>Microsoft was the first big tech company to call for laws on facial recognition technology back in 2018 and has been the most visible in statehouse and city hall hearings. It says it opposes use of facial recognition software for mass surveillance, racial profiling or other violations of basic human rights and freedoms.</p><p>\"We need to use this moment to pursue a strong national law to govern facial recognition that is grounded in the protection of human rights,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said at The Post event Thursday. \"If all the responsible companies in the country cede this market to those that are not prepared to take a stand, we won't necessarily serve the national interest or the lives of the black and African American people.\"</p><p>But the company's legislative stance so far has boiled down to: put some rules in place, sure, but not a moratorium on it.</p><p>The devil is in the details. In Washington state, Microsoft supported legislation - sponsored by state Sen. Joe Nguyen, a Microsoft employee - that outlines some of how the government can use the tech and requires agencies to produce accountability reports. It also addresses accuracy concerns by saying government agencies can only use the tech if it comes from a developer that makes its software available for testing.</p><p>But opponents said the Washington law comes with too few limits and enforcement measures. \"Agencies may use face surveillance without any restrictions to surveil entire crowds at football stadiums, places of worship, or on public street corners, chilling people's constitutionally protected rights and civil liberties,\" the ACLU of Washington said.</p><p>Microsoft's announcement this week that it wouldn't sell to police until there is a federal law \"should feel like winning, but it feels more like a thinly veiled threat,\" said Liz O'Sullivan, technology director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. The Washington law, she said, would be a bad model for Congress.</p><p>\"They're seeding the conversations around facial recognition regulation in a number of states by lobbying for bills that might look to a lot of people like they've got really strict protections. But then, if you actually look at them, they don't really actually regulate the technology much as it's used,\" said Jameson Spivack, a policy associate at Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology. \"It's their way of getting ahead of the opposition and co-opting the movement.\"</p><p>Amazon, which didn't reply to my requests for comment, has said less in public about its legislative goals, aside from calling for federal privacy and legislation on facial recognition tech. One pressing issue for any national legislation is whether it would overrule state and local laws that might be more strict.</p><p>\"Legislatures and activists and civil rights groups are already leading on this issue,\" said Matt Cagle, technology and civil liberties attorney for the ACLU of Northern California. \"We just hope that companies like Microsoft see that and stand with us rather than against us.\"           </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-121343cff49646359bab20aa9f1fac9a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6043-KD71-DXKP-J181-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1620\"/><timeReceived>3:14 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 12, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DLDV</classCode><className>IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000184</classCode><className>BIOMETRICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000302</classCode><className>CIVIL RIGHTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp;

The year is [insert date distant enough to be plausible, yet near enough to be worrisome]. The barista hands you your coffee and you walk out the door. No need to pay manually\u2014the facial recognition system has already subtracted the correct amount of cryptocurrency from your PersonalCoin account.Yeah, the future is pretty nice!The next stop is renewing your government ID at the local security branch. </p><p>It only takes a few seconds to check your fingerprints, criminal record, address, and other personal details, all stored securely on the CitizenChain.No paperwork necessary. Your changes of address, employment status, travel, and Hulazonflix viewing history all get updated in real time, and since no security guards have turned up you figure your behavioral patterns haven't triggered any smart contracts that would raise an enhanced screening alert.The system deducts the renewal fee from your StateCoin balance and you're free to go. On the way home, you're careful not to jaywalk\u2014your Civility score is still recovering from that time you accidentally parked a bicycle in a designated scooter space, and you don't want your transportation privileges knocked down another tier.Hold on, though-what's with all this 1984 stuff?It's not that I'm blaming blockchains for potentially ushering in a dystopian future; it's just that the road to serfdom is material-agnostic and can be paved with pretty much anything.There's a justifiable amount of excitement around blockchain tech, as it's decentralized, transparent, secure, and resilient, and it can be a fantastic tool for distributing power and fighting censorship.Hopefully, the applications will skew towards the positive, but taking a peek at the darkest timeline is something that advocates of any new technology should do every now and then, if only to remind us what we need to avoid.So here's the blockchain Black Mirror update: dictators are issuing cryptocurrencies, China is exploring national ID blockchains (among others) and a social credit score system, and a lot of the corporations doing blockchain research actively make money off your data.The ideals that drive a technology's development don't often survive scaling. Government-issued cryptocurrency Governments that issue or endorse a cryptocurrency as legal tender aren't likely to make it decentralized or private.Done well, a CBDC (Central Bank-issued Digital Currency) could be more efficient, secure, and flexible than current financial systems, but it's doubtful that most governments would resist the temptation to create something that they would be able to control even more tightly than their fiat currency. Just look at the first two countries to actually issue a cryptocurrency: Venezuela (the Petro): While the whole thing is too disorganized to be taken seriously, you'd better believe the Venezuelan government would abuse their ability to track transactions and alter the blockchain if it would make any difference.Iran (Covenant/PayMon): While it's being developed in order to help avoid international sanctions, the Iranian government has a long history of strict controls on technology, their economy, and social behaviors. This isn't saying that cryptocurrency could never work on a national level\u2014just that any serious government implementation is likely to be highly traceable and include backdoors.As a way to digitize public assets and conduct government-related business, a transparent cryptocurrency could be great, but the dystopian potential of a cash supply that governments can control and track in real time is pretty clear.Russia and China have both made occasional noises[1] about possibly creating their own state-backed cryptocurrencies as well, and especially given China's strong regulatory environment and punishing capital controls, it's pretty likely that the results would have some severe privacy issues.Even countries with good rule of law and citizen protections wouldn't be exempt here\u2014the Five Eyes is composed entirely of strong liberal democracies, after all. Something like marijuana, currently legal on the US state level and illegal on the US federal level, might run into problems with a centrally-controlled digital currency.Is it that much of a leap to imagine a national cryptocurrency with built-in controls on where it can be spent and which currencies it can be exchanged into? Blockchain with Chinese characteristics I'll just come right out and say it: China is an authoritarian surveillance state with a thriving (if highly-regulated) crypto scene, and they're definitely going to use blockchain to track and control people[2].They're currently trialing social credit systems[3] (electronic logs of citizen behavior that can lead to reward or punishment), are leaders in AI facial recognition and other civilian surveillance tactics, have their internet locked down, and aren't known for their human rights record or respecting their citizens' privacy.One Chinese social insurance project, 'THEKEY[4],' is already drawing hundreds of millions of peoples' personal data[5] (government-related, biometric, even behavioral[6]) from government databases into its own blockchain (built on NEO), and that number is only likely to grow. Combine real-time surveillance with smart contracts connected to the ID blockchain and you're looking at a pretty effective means of tracking and enforcement.China has also already implemented a parolee-tracking system[7] in several cities, and there's been noise about a government-backed crypto-renminbi[8] for quite some time.The National Audit Office[9] is considering a blockchain solution, it might help detect tax fraud in Shenzhen[10], and it's the number one country in the world for blockchain patents[11].Meanwhile, official government statements have explicitly said that decentralization is not an aspect of blockchain that China appreciates. The PRC taught us that the internet doesn't have to be free, and they're likely to drive the same lesson home about blockchains and crypto.Currently, they're the only place that's working on this at any serious scale, but that's 1.4 billion people ruled by a government that is actively trying to expand its sphere of influence and export its methods of social control.They're not the only ones playing this game, either: India implemented nationwide biometric IDs, Singapore is putting facial recognition on lampposts, and the US is probably still developing surveillance tools that can see pretty much everything about your electronic activity.Notably, none of those last three directly involve blockchains\u2014it's not like they were the missing link and now that they're here governments are suddenly free to pursue their authoritarian dreams.It's just one of those things that will probably make mass surveillance a little easier, the same way pretty much every other information technology already has.Again, though, there's a qualifier: identity blockchains can be great. There are tons of ideas out there about using encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and other methods to help people maintain ownership of their data.Well-implemented, this would be a huge improvement over many of our current systems. There's just not as much weight behind that type of system as there is behind China's need to keep tight control over 1/6 of the world's population, though. Corporate blockchains: not ideal, but not that bad either The FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) companies and those like them are unquestionably wonders of the modern world. But that doesn't mean we have to like everything about them\u2014particularly the troves of data many of them gather on their users.Again, this works pretty well with conventional database technologies and blockchain probably isn't making things much worse. Still, let's say your behavior is tracked, stored, and linked to smart contracts, with other pieces of information gradually trickling in to make that hole in the internet look increasingly like you.The data brokers that already deal in user information will probably get an efficiency boost, enabling real-time micropayments in return for data.As much as we don't like to believe it, the more a company knows about us the better they can manipulate us. Maybe we can't be reduced entirely to neurochemical triggers, but we can't pretend they don't exist.Imagine your user data one day gets linked to that DNA test you took (or your family member took) without reading the fine print. It would probably yield fantastically interesting results for science, and maybe, just maybe, some effective ways to prod you into buying new stuff.Big banks and big tech are two of the main corporate blockchain adopters, and while blockchain could help put them on the right track as far as data protection and transparency goes, are the incentives really aligned for that?I get the feeling Facebook wouldn't have taken quite so many steps to separate itself from Libra if they weren't the poster-child for user-data misuse.Worst-case scenario: corporate blockchains are just a more efficient way to collect and exploit vast amounts of information about people.Darkest corporate timeline notwithstanding, though, companies are probably the least concerning category of potential blockchain-villains. As with everything, they'll inevitably make mistakes and act against user interests on occasion, but faced with public pressure and at least some need to stay trustworthy, a lot of them could very well go the other direction and implement blockchain solutions that improve user privacy and control.Projects like Basic Attention Token[12] are already looking to make advertising less intrusive, for example, and the beauty of industry (versus government) is that there's generally at least a possibility of a competitor out-innovating you and taking your place. The future doesn't depend on blockchain; blockchain depends on the future Saying that blockchain tech enables a trustless economy and transparent governments, is like saying that the Internet promotes free and democratic civil discourse.It can do that, and it does do that, but it also does very much the opposite of that, and some people are working very hard to build versions of it that eliminate the original vision altogether. That's going to happen regardless of the systems we build, so sometimes it's good to take a step back from the technology and ask 'What kind of world would use these tools well? Which institutions should we be trying to strengthen?'Those are big questions that tend to draw some pretty polarized responses, but staying critical, updating our priors, and getting a little loud when we see something going wrong is how we make intellectual and social progress.Facebook's data policies notwithstanding, they at least seem to have internalized public opinion to the extent that they made some actual good calls with their cryptocurrency, which is at least a partial victory for people who make a fuss about that sort of thing.New technologies don't exist in a vacuum\u2014they both shape and are shaped by external forces, and that relationship is where things can really start to go wrong. Remaining aware of how blockchain and crypto are being misused is vital so we can find ways to strengthen alternative platforms and institutions. <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton\">https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro\">https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro</url> eToro Risk Warning: 66% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

Less frequent reporting might be helpful to real estate developers with a penchant for bankruptcy, but three monthly numbers are adequate for mainstream capital markets. That doesn't mean, however, that the system is perfect.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not much unites <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>carbon-spewing president of the United States, who is happily trying to reopen coal mines and drill for more oil, with \"St Paul\" Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, a Davos regular who's made corporate sustainability the centrepiece of his nine years in charge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both, however, distrust quarterly reporting for public companies. Polman has argued against quarterly reporting for Unilever since he took over, claiming investor time horizons had become too short and turnover too rapid. Trump, meanwhile, tweeted last week that he'd asked the Securities and Exchange Commision to consider whether US public companies ought to be forced to report every three months. Jay Clayton, Trump's chosen SEC chairman, confirmed the agency was looking at the changes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One suspects their motivations for disliking regular reports may be somewhat different. Unilever is the very definition of a mature, defensive stock. Returns on capital are high, the dividend is rock solid, and leverage is low. Trump's tangles with the capital markets, cluster at the, ahem, \"higher beta\" end of the scale, featuring mainly non-recourse loans against speculative commercial property, with a couple of bankruptcies thrown in to boot.</p><p>Regular reporting is certainly an irritant. GlobalCapital finds it to be so, and we simply have to read quarterly reports, not make investment decisions or worse, prepare them. It clearly takes management time and resources to meet quarterly deadlines, manage guidance, meet analysts and the like, and that may well take attention away from running the business.</p><p>Private equity firms, indeed, claim this is a big part of the reason take-privates can be a success (they'd rather blame quarterly reporting than talk about their penchant for adding a ton of leverage). Businesses can be restructured and efficiencies extracted out of the public gaze. For some firms, quarterly reporting undoubtedly does deter them from raising funds in the public markets.</p><p>But it is an annoyance rather than a fatal flaw. The number of otherwise healthy businesses brought low by an excess of quarterly reporting is dwarfed by the number of investors who've been able to get out of positions in a timely fashion thanks to the disclosure forced by regular, audited updates.</p><p>To put it another way, it's an asymmetric pay-off. To cut the annoyance down a little for everyone will lead to an increased number of serious failures to slip through and sandbag investors. Companies large enough for main market listings ought to easily be able to hand much of the pain of reporting to dedicated IR departments.</p><p>The claims of short-termism hold even less water. Simple stats like average holding time are deceptive \"\" they measure an average of investment horizons that span from high frequency trading firms with long-only real money. The buy-side has become more passive and more concentrated in the past decade, and that means longer term holdings where it really matters, even if average holding time has gone down.</p><p>The top holders of almost any large cap stock are drawn from among the usual institutional investors suspects, split between active and passive holdings, and none of these buyers are in the habit of vast lurches in positioning over quarterly reports.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, activism is on the rise. And while this might involve pushing for shareholder-friendly moves like special dividends or buy-backs, it's hard to think of it as short-termist. Activist hedge funds have typically done deep dives and due diligence on their target, looking at multiple public and private sources to figure out a position. They're not in the habit of being fooled by a couple of heavily juiced non-GAAP numbers in a specific quarter.  </p><p> Moral architecture</p><p>But the system does need a tune-up. There's little reason to end quarterly reporting for the biggest, most established firms, but there's no reason why it should be standard one-size-fits-all for any public firm.</p><p>Private markets, especially for tech firms, are now large and liquid, and can support companies at scales once thought impossible. Uber's valuation is harder to compute than if it were public, but it's likely north of $50bn, and clearly hasn't been hamstrung by a lack of listing. Insiders can sell stock, and investor reporting does leak out.</p><p>Big tech is increasingly opting to stay private, perhaps in part because of reporting \"\" though also because the menu of options involved in going public doesn't suit them.</p><p>Stock market regulation has not kept pace with the blossoming of the private market \"\" firms are either public or not, with few fine gradations along the way. Frequency and depth of reporting could be seen as something akin to control rights \"\" a feature for the market to price, rather than an essential piece of the moral architecture of markets.</p><p>The most serious problem of quarterly reporting, however, comes largely in the bond market, not the equity markets. A big bond market borrower can easily be in the market 10 times a year or more, and every time, it must navigate around the blackout periods, which come four times a year.</p><p>As well as blackouts, strip out the thin markets in mid-August and late December or the week before investors have their own quarter-end, drop a few weeks with big central bank announcements expected, ditch a month or two for the the political crisis du jour, consider Golden Week, Catholic saint's days, Thanksgiving and the various other drawn out US public holidays, UK bank holidays, and then see how many market windows are left.</p><p>That leaves bond markets frequently lurching from feast to famine and back again. Borrowers can find themselves paying up because they're jostling for attention, or twisting and turning through niche currencies and private placements in an attempt to avoid clogging up markets.</p><p>Blackouts make bond markets more prone to indigestion, less able to price risk correctly, and less efficient as a venue to raise finance.</p><p>They're also a disproportionate response to a tiny and trivial problem. Investors asked to buy a bond during the weeks before a reporting period are indeed taking a risk \"\" the numbers could be starkly better or worse than expected. But they're always taking essentially the same risk outside blackout periods. Treasury teams inside a corporate always have better business information than third-party investors, and, if investors are worried about that during blackout, then let them price it, rather than enforcing closed periods. If final reported debt figures need updating because of last minute issuance, that's why God invented footnotes.</p><p>Blackouts also purport to manage insider trading by those with knowledge of the upcoming results \"\" but that's easy enough to solve too. Regulations already exist to manage trading by corporate insiders, and, anyway, its perfectly possible to stop management, say, ditching stock ahead of bad numbers, while still allowing routine funding trades to go ahead. Improved artificial intelligence and ever-more detailed transaction reporting ought to be better than ever at ferrreting out individuals who don't stick to these rules.</p><p>Unlike in the nebulous claims about management focus and short termism, there is, then, a real problem to solve here, and one which could really boost the functioning of capital markets. It's related to quarterly reporting, but can be separated, and it should be.</p><p>Numbers every three months set a good balance. But quarterly reports are not for everyone, and they do have negative effects. But rather than scrap it entirely, or set the balance at six months market-wide, we should think about specific problems, such as blackout, and focus on solving those.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROWK-b19lkwqqz0cc5h</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROWK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7B-5VC1-F0GS-H1H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318064</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1284\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global Capital Euroweek</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 20, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS325620 TOILET PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS325611 SOAP &amp;

Normal day-to-day operations that kept such large enterprises running smoothly could be downed, leaving behind an industry in crisis. </p><p>'We're going to have people sheltered in place and without power,' Carl Guardino, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, told Bloomberg. </p><p>Part of the reason Silicon Valley's Big Tech firms avoided blackouts last year was the type of power lines that fuel their operations,</p><p>'What PG&amp;E is doing is blacking out the kind of low-voltage wires that deliver power to homes,' Michael Wara, head of the climate and energy policy program at Stanford University's Woods Institute told Wired. </p><p>'But, typically, big commercial customers, like a tech headquarters ... tend to be located closer to the bulk transmission system [and] the high-voltage lines, which are much less impacted by this outage.'</p><p>The types of power lines typically found in residential neighborhoods are more prone to wildfires because of their proximity to the ground and vegetation.</p><p>The bulky transmission lines often find at commercial businesses aren't impacted in the same way.</p><p> 'The lines in the South Bay where the tech headquarters are, like in Mountain View and Santa Clara County, are [surrounded by] wide open space - there's basically no vegetation. It's flat,' said Wara.</p><p>Facebook was among several Silicon Valley firms that pivoted operations from in-person at large corporate buildings to remote work after California's lockdown guidelines closed businesses. </p><p>In March, Facebook advised its 50,000 staffers to work from home to avoid spreading the coronavirus.</p><p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg later announced that the company had extended its work-from-home plan until 2021, allowing employees to avoid the Menlo Park office for the next several months. </p><p>Zuckerberg continued to push for remote working in April when he revealed via livestream that he expects about 50 per cent of staffers to work remotely within the next five to 10 years.</p><p>Certain employees will be allowed to work remotely full time, but need to notify Facebook of any location changes by January 1, 2021. </p><p>Employees were permitted to work remotely through the remainder of 2020. The office is scheduled to reopen July 6, but at a limited capacity.</p><p>Similarly, Twitter, which reported 5,100 employees in its most recent earnings report, ordered employees to work from home . </p><p>It was later revealed by CEO Jack Dorsey that the company will allow most of its employees to work from home permanently.</p><p>'Opening offices will be our decision. When and if our employees come back, will be theirs,' a spokesperson for the company said. </p><p>Google, with some 118,000 staffers, announced that it extended remote working from the original June 1 end date to December 31 in May. </p><p>The majority of Google workers are expected to work from home during this time, according to CEO Sundar Pichai.</p><p>But Pichai added that some employees can work from its Mountain View office on July 6.</p><p>Tech companies Apple and Microsoft followed suit. Apple told all 12,000 employees at their office in Cupertino to work remotely and Microsoft did that same for 150,000 workers.</p><p>Between those five Silicon Valley firms, around 336,000 Big Tech workers could be impacted by power cuts. </p><p>In 2019, more than three million people were affected by rolling blackouts as local utility companies tried to prevent live wires from sparking wildfires. </p><p>The reason utility companies shut off power is solely to 'significantly reduce catastrophic wildfire risk to our customers and communities,' Michael Lewis, PG&amp;E's senior vice president for electric operations, told The New York Times. </p><p>Blackouts also threaten to halt California's course to revive the economy.</p><p>California state and utility workers told Bloomberg they're working to minimize the threat. </p><p>Last month, regulators adopted new shutoff rules that would require companies to restore electricity within 24 hours after threatening weather occurs. </p><p>PG&amp;E, the state's largest utility company, set a personal goal of 12 daylight hours after strong winds ease, and doubled the number helicopters it will use to find downed power lines. </p><p>Even so, new developments in California's landscape have the potential to make wildfires more widespread and dangerous. </p><p>California was drought-free last summer, but now almost 50 per cent of the state is riddled with drought, according to a June assessment from the U.S. Drought Monitor.</p><p>The means there's an 'above normal significant large fire potential,' the National Interagency Fire Center said. </p><p>Since January, more than 6,600 acres in the state have already been scorched. </p><p>Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic has still gripped California in an unprecedented health crisis.</p><p>'The reality is Mother Nature hasn't changed her mind with respect to wildfires because of covid,' Don Daigler, director of business resiliency for Edison's Southern California Edison utility, told Bloomberg</p><p>'We still face the same fire risk as communities as we did last year.'</p><p>So far, California has recorded around 149,000 confirmed cases and a death toll of 5,063. </p><p>Utility companies, whose intentional blackouts sparked widespread backlash, understand the concern, but don't want the number of new remote workers to influence power shutoffs when needed.</p><p>Conditions like high winds, low humidity, hot temperatures and dry vegetation should still be the main deciding factor.</p><p>'The approach we take is different, but the calculus really hasn't changed,' said Daigler.</p><p>They're working to reduce the need for power cuts, as well as make them shorter and smaller when they do occur.</p><p>'We want to reduce the impact of public safety power shutoffs on customers whether they are working from home or not,' according to Matt Pender, director of the community wildfire safety program with PG&amp;E. </p><p>PG&amp;E ha begun installing switches and other devices to isolate blackouts to avoid mass power cuts like last year.</p><p>It also gained mobile diesel generators that can be found at 48 substations. </p><p>PG&amp;E was forced to file bankruptcy last year after an investigation found its equipment was responsible for sparking deadly fires. </p><p>A $13.5billion settlement was reached between PG&amp;E and the state California this month.</p><p>PG&amp;E and Edison have also reinforced their field equipment by installing stronger poles and snaking some power lines underground. </p><p>Edison is installing 600 miles of power lines with a special coating that prevents sparks if touched by tree branches.</p><p>PG&amp;E predicts that these steps could cut the number of residents affected by blackouts by one-third. </p><p>Both utility companies are also working to build more pop-up community resource centers during blackouts to adhere to public health guidelines. </p><p>Vans with charging stations will be sent into neighborhoods darkened by blackouts to assist residents who don't want to to travel to resource centers. </p><p>Some counties in April sought to impose new regulations on utility shutoffs, but officials argued that final decisions should be delegated to those companies.</p><p>'Based on these rules and standards, it is appropriate for the utilities to have the final say over shutting down power and for the [California Public Utilities Commission]to hold them accountable,' said spokeswoman Terrie Prosper.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Wien, Vice Chairman together with Joe Zidle, Chief Investment Strategist in the Private Wealth Solutions group at Blackstone, today issued their list of Ten Surprises for 2020. This is the 35th year Byron has given his views on a number of economic, financial market and political surprises for the coming year. Byron defines a \"surprise\" as an event that the average investor would only assign a one out of three chance of taking place but which Byron believes is \"probable,\" having a better than 50% likelihood of happening. Byron started the tradition in 1986 when he was the Chief U.S. Investment Strategist at Morgan Stanley. Byron joined Blackstone in September 2009 as a senior advisor to both the firm and its clients in analyzing economic, political, market and social trends. In 2018, Joe Zidle joined Byron Wien in the development of the Ten Surprises.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Byron and Joe's Ten Surprises for 2020 are as follows:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. The economy disappoints the consensus forecast, but a recession is avoided. Federal Reserve Chair Powell lowers the Fed funds rate to 1%. Without a comprehensive trade deal in hand, President Trump exercises every executive authority he has to stimulate growth and ward off recession. He cuts payroll taxes to put more money in the hands of consumers.</p><p>2. Inequality and climate change become important election themes, but centrist ideas prevail. The House of Representatives sends articles of impeachment to the Senate, but Donald Trump is not convicted or removed from office. Enough information is revealed in the proceedings to cause some of his supporters, as well as many independents, to throw their support to liberal candidates in 2020 state races. The Democrats take the Senate in November.</p><p>3. There is no comprehensive Phase Two trade deal that limits China's ability to acquire intellectual property. National interests result in the balkanization of technology. The development of separate standards for 5G and other tech hardware proves to be bad news for the future of world economies. The move toward \"decoupling\" gains traction in negotiations with China.  US economic co-dependence with China erodes. Both China and the US keep their hands off Hong Kong and let the protest settle down by itself.</p><p>4. The prospect of a self-driving car is pushed further into the future. A series of accidents with experimental vehicles causes a major manufacturer or technology company to issue a statement that it is no longer developing self-driving technology.</p><p>5. Emboldened by the pain of economic sanctions, Iran takes advantage of America's unwillingness to intervene and steps up acts of hostility against Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Strait of Hormuz is closed and the price of oil (West Texas Intermediate) soars to over $70/barrel.</p><p>6. Even though some observers believe valuations are stretched, a surge in investor enthusiasm pushes the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 above 3500 at some point during the year. Earnings increase only 5%, and S&amp;P 500 multiples remain elevated because monetary policy is easy and investors become more comfortable that intermediate interest rates will rise slowly. Volatility increases and there are several market corrections greater than 5% throughout the year.  </p><p>7. Big tech companies face growing political scrutiny and social blowback. Once the market leaders, certain FAANG stocks underperform and the equal-weighted S&amp;P 500 outperforms. A proposal to break up the largest social media platforms and increase regulation and government oversight gains popularity.  This has greater success than prior government efforts against Apple, Microsoft and IBM, because it has widespread support from the American people.  A millennial in New York City puts a phone down and makes eye contact with another human and finds it non-threatening and refreshing.   </p><p>8. Having secured a workable Brexit deal, the United Kingdom turns out to be the winner in its divorce from the European Union. The equity market rises and the pound rallies. The UK benefits from a long transition period, and growth exceeds 2% as foreign direct investment resumes now that the outlook is clarified. The EU economy remains soft, and European markets other than the UK underperform the US and Asia.   </p><p>9. The bond bubble starts to leak, but negative rates continue abroad. Even though the US economy is slowing, the 10-year Treasury yield approaches 2.5% and the yield curve steepens. Japan and China pull away from the Treasury auctions. Rather than economic fundamentals or inflation, supply and demand drive yields higher.    </p><p>10. The problems with Boeing's 737 Max are fixed and deliveries begin. The plane becomes a mainstay around the world, enabling airlines to operate more efficiently and increase profits. The stocks become market leaders.  </p><p> \"Also Rans\"</p><p>Every year there are always a few Surprises that do not make the Ten, because we either do not think they are as relevant as those on the basic list or we are not comfortable with the idea that they are \"probable.\"</p><p>11. Fears of an economic crisis in India are allayed. The emerging markets continue to have uneven performance but India recovers from decelerating growth.  The Modi government continues business-friendly growth reforms, the economy grows at 6% and the market rises 20%.   </p><p>12. Artificial intelligence begins to be viewed as a paper tiger.  The AI jobs apocalypse fails to materialize, much as the Y2K bug failed to undermine the US economy 20 years earlier.  Manufacturing jobs have already been automated and it proves harder to eliminate service jobs by using computer-based applications.   </p><p>13. Economic problems in Russia intensify even though the price of oil rises.  As a result, social unrest begins to spread.  Putin's cozy relationship with his circle of oligarchs becomes an issue and his influence as a world leader diminishes.  He attempts to maintain his stature on the world stage through a closer association with China.  In spite of serious differences, China and Russia appear prepared to face off against Europe and the United States.</p><p>14. Populism and inward-thinking continue to spread globally, particularly in emerging markets. Anarchy and disharmony spread throughout the world, creating turbulence in financial markets everywhere. Investors turn away from emerging market local currency debt, forcing spreads higher.   </p><p>15. North Korea agrees to suspend its nuclear development program after another meeting with President Trump, but does not give up its existing stockpile. Kim Jong-un halts work on a long-range missile capable of reaching the United States. North Korea continues to be a threat, but not an imminent danger.  </p><p>About Blackstone</p><p>Blackstone is one of the world's leading investment firms.

Wien, Vice Chairman together with Joe Zidle, Chief Investment Strategist in the Private Wealth Solutions group at Blackstone, issued their list of Ten Surprises for 2020. This is the 35th year Byron has given his views on a number of economic, financial market and political surprises for the coming year. Byron defines a \"surprise\" as an event that the average investor would only assign a one out of three chance of taking place but which Byron believes is \"probable,\" having a better than 50% likelihood of happening. Byron started the tradition in 1986 when he was the Chief U.S. Investment Strategist at Morgan Stanley. Byron joined Blackstone in September 2009 as a senior advisor to both the firm and its clients in analyzing economic, political, market and social trends. In 2018, Joe Zidle joined Byron Wien in the development of the Ten Surprises.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Byron and Joe's Ten Surprises for 2020 are as follows:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. The economy disappoints the consensus forecast, but a recession is avoided. Federal Reserve Chair Powell lowers the Fed funds rate to 1%. Without a comprehensive trade deal in hand, President Trump exercises every executive authority he has to stimulate growth and ward off recession. He cuts payroll taxes to put more money in the hands of consumers.</p><p>2. Inequality and climate change become important election themes, but centrist ideas prevail. The House of Representatives sends articles of impeachment to the Senate, but Donald Trump is not convicted or removed from office. Enough information is revealed in the proceedings to cause some of his supporters, as well as many independents, to throw their support to liberal candidates in 2020 state races. The Democrats take the Senate in November.</p><p>3. There is no comprehensive Phase Two trade deal that limits China's ability to acquire intellectual property. National interests result in the balkanization of technology. The development of separate standards for 5G and other tech hardware proves to be bad news for the future of world economies. The move toward \"decoupling\" gains traction in negotiations with China. US economic co-dependence with China erodes. Both China and the US keep their hands off Hong Kong and let the protest settle down by itself.</p><p>4. The prospect of a self-driving car is pushed further into the future. A series of accidents with experimental vehicles causes a major manufacturer or technology company to issue a statement that it is no longer developing self-driving technology.</p><p>5. Emboldened by the pain of economic sanctions, Iran takes advantage of America's unwillingness to intervene and steps up acts of hostility against Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Strait of Hormuz is closed and the price of oil (West Texas Intermediate) soars to over $70/barrel.</p><p>6. Even though some observers believe valuations are stretched, a surge in investor enthusiasm pushes the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 above 3500 at some point during the year. Earnings increase only 5%, and S&amp;P 500 multiples remain elevated because monetary policy is easy and investors become more comfortable that intermediate interest rates will rise slowly. Volatility increases and there are several market corrections greater than 5% throughout the year.</p><p>7. Big tech companies face growing political scrutiny and social blowback. Once the market leaders, certain FAANG stocks underperform and the equal-weighted S&amp;P 500 outperforms. A proposal to break up the largest social media platforms and increase regulation and government oversight gains popularity. This has greater success than prior government efforts against Apple, Microsoft and IBM, because it has widespread support from the American people. A millennial in New York City puts a phone down and makes eye contact with another human and finds it non-threatening and refreshing.</p><p>8. Having secured a workable Brexit deal, the United Kingdom turns out to be the winner in its divorce from the European Union. The equity market rises and the pound rallies. The UK benefits from a long transition period, and growth exceeds 2% as foreign direct investment resumes now that the outlook is clarified. The EU economy remains soft, and European markets other than the UK underperform the US and Asia.</p><p>9. The bond bubble starts to leak, but negative rates continue abroad. Even though the US economy is slowing, the 10-year Treasury yield approaches 2.5% and the yield curve steepens. Japan and China pull away from the Treasury auctions. Rather than economic fundamentals or inflation, supply and demand drive yields higher.</p><p>10. The problems with Boeing's 737 Max are fixed and deliveries begin. The plane becomes a mainstay around the world, enabling airlines to operate more efficiently and increase profits. The stocks become market leaders.</p><p>\"Also Rans\"</p><p>Every year there are always a few Surprises that do not make the Ten, because we either do not think they are as relevant as those on the basic list or we are not comfortable with the idea that they are \"probable.\"</p><p>11. Fears of an economic crisis in India are allayed. The emerging markets continue to have uneven performance but India recovers from decelerating growth. The Modi government continues business-friendly growth reforms, the economy grows at 6% and the market rises 20%.</p><p>12. Artificial intelligence begins to be viewed as a paper tiger. The AI jobs apocalypse fails to materialize, much as the Y2K bug failed to undermine the US economy 20 years earlier. Manufacturing jobs have already been automated and it proves harder to eliminate service jobs by using computer-based applications.</p><p>13. Economic problems in Russia intensify even though the price of oil rises. As a result, social unrest begins to spread. Putin's cozy relationship with his circle of oligarchs becomes an issue and his influence as a world leader diminishes. He attempts to maintain his stature on the world stage through a closer association with China. In spite of serious differences, China and Russia appear prepared to face off against Europe and the United States.</p><p>14. Populism and inward-thinking continue to spread globally, particularly in emerging markets. Anarchy and disharmony spread throughout the world, creating turbulence in financial markets everywhere. Investors turn away from emerging market local currency debt, forcing spreads higher.</p><p>15. North Korea agrees to suspend its nuclear development program after another meeting with President Trump, but does not give up its existing stockpile. Kim Jong-un halts work on a long-range missile capable of reaching the United States. North Korea continues to be a threat, but not an imminent danger.</p><p>* * *</p><p>About Blackstone</p><p>Blackstone is one of the world's leading investment firms.

We have so far ended investing $15 billion (in India)  We are planning on doubling our investments in real estate. We are very happy here, Stephen A Schwarzman, chairman of Blackstone Group, said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a conversation on Creating Sustainable Businesses at the ET GBS, Schwarzman said, We are not very mechanistic. We respond to opportunities.</p><p>Revealing the groups innate ability to make big bets, Schwarzman appeared unfazed by tremors being felt in the financial markets. Dislocations will provide more opportunities, he said.</p><p>The outbreak of Covid-19 in China, for one, will force companies to diversify sourcing. India could benefit from the move if it smoothens out regulatory hurdles. People will look for modifications...supply chains will become more diversified. There will be a list of other places to go. There will be reshoring even if it is more expensive. For countries like India it is a great potential opportunity, he said.</p><p>Our Indian operations gives us our highest returns in the entire world. So, thank you, he added.</p><p>Schwarzman founded Blackstone in the 1980s with partner Pete Peterson. Blackstone today manages investments of more than $500 billion across asset classes such as private equity, real estate, credit and others. It is the worlds largest alternative asset manager by assets under management.</p><p>Schwarzman, who regaled the audience with his self-deprecating humour, recounted several anecdotes from the many interactions he had had with world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Schwarzman is in the news for his book, What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence.</p><p>When we started doing transactions, every set of communication we got showed growth at 9.5% every year. We see growth at half of that really; inflation is higher, the financial system seems to be having difficulty in terms of extensions of credit...Globally, economies are slowing down and financial systems are having difficulties...one example is European Union. They have a banking system which was never fixed since the banking crisis, he said.</p><p>Though bullish on India, he felt more could be done. ...we see the growth somewhere around 4.5%, he said, adding that the government has to make regulatory changes.</p><p>He said, (What) I would look for is, sort of, addressing the issue of how do we get more capital into the banking system to enable the country to grow faster, thats for the benefit of everyone in society.</p><p>...whenever you see an economy slowing, and you see a financial sector that is having some difficultyyoure reminded that economic growth and credit expansion are correlated almost one-to-one, he said, drawing a comparison with the European economy.</p><p>On peer Masayoshi Son, chief executive of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, Schwarzman turned politically correct when asked whether the Japanese financier would succeed. He is a friend of mine, so wont answer that, he said.</p><p>Schwarzman termed Son raising $100 billion an astonishing thing.</p><p>There are a lot of big tech startups. Amazon made no profit for 20 years. They kept growing, pricing products so well that it forced other people out of business. They have taken enormous market share. Might be an attractive model, Schwarzman said, possibly revealing his investment strategy. Lot of these companies started in the last cycle are called unicorns now. They dont make money, he lamented.</p><p>His strategy was simple. Where I come from, not making money is bad. Some of these will never turn positive, he predicted.</p><p>According to the Blackstone founder, what the SoftBank founder saw were venture capital firms with half a billion dollars funding some unicorns that had racked up $4 billion of losses. Many of these VCs had no funds and banks would not lend to loss-making unicorns.</p><p>What Son saw was that if he could deploy enormous amounts of money, SoftBank would be the only place to go, he said. It is a stroke of genius now. Some companies havent been done at the right time, right place, but thats execution, but the strategy is so clever. No one else thought about it, he said. 2020 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RESTMW-169531079</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RESTMW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCS-PXR1-JDJN-64G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Real Estate Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35472\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 9, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002L7A</classCode><className>BLACKSTONE GROUP LP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS525990 OTHER FINANCIAL VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523999 MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BX (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

It was widely observed by beard stroking deep thinkers who listen to Radio 4 around the clock but did you celebrate it?</p><p>You should've done as this particular birthday marked the invention of something which has changed the lives of the vast majority of us, except those of us who live in caves. I am, of course, banging on about it now being 30 years since the idea for the world wide web was first conceived.</p><p>As we know all too well, the man responsible for this generation defining innovation is Sir Tim Berners-Lee and he is somebody who everybody should be personally thanking for the difference that he has made to our lives.</p><p>It is thanks to him that almost nobody uses desk spikes anymore or that strangers no longer need to meet up underneath the clock at mainline railway stations.</p><p>Sir Tim is rightly lauded for the genius of his achievements but he is also acutely aware of the unintended consequences of his efforts.</p><p>Last week he told reporters that as well as giving  \"marginalised groups a voice\" and generally making our lives easier, the web had also enabled the \"spread of hatred\" and made \"all sorts of crime easier to commit\". </p><p>He is also working on a solution to the problem of companies using our precious data how they please. He says that there is lots of work to be done before all of these problems can be fixed but believes one of the solutions is for users to agree to a contract, effectively establishing global online laws and standards.</p><p>Who can argue with him? </p><p>The web has long been described as a digital Wild West and, although there is some regulation, it does appear that anything goes.</p><p>Last week the world bore witness to the horrors of the Christchurch terror attacks, which were broadcast on social media by the alleged perpetrator.</p><p>If that was not horrific enough, thousands upon thousands of social media users thought it perfectly okay to share footage of murder on their timelines. </p><p>While these platforms did remove this footage, it was still reasonably easy to find later in the day of the attacks.</p><p>Big tech companies are hives of innovation and home to some of the brightest minds on the planet but can only play catch up in situations such as the aftermath of the horrors in New Zealand. It doesn't really make any sense to this particular social media user.</p><p>Nor does it make sense that there are so many unpleasant people allowed to peddle their unpleasant thoughts with very little consequence most of the time.</p><p>There was a time when sending a poison pen letter required a certain amount of effort to pull off, which is why they weren't especially common, but these days online trolls can spread their bile in a matter of seconds.</p><p>When Sir Tim first drew up his first plans for a network which would be used to share ideas, he could not have envisaged how this concept would evolve and, in some cases, be abused.</p><p>It is absolutely right that we celebrate the web and the difference it has made but we all have a duty to use more responsibly than we do. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YEPST-0CF35FDE0DFB4D598441F86CE512F91AASH106965464NLEP</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YEPST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR6-MH61-JDPH-B1YR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252816</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"508\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Johnston Press Plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Yorkshire Evening Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61414\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Columnists</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>human interest</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Web Display</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000093</classCode><className>ANNIVERSARIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009IZW</classCode><className>COMPUTER &amp;

The tech-heav...</p><p>(Bloomberg) -- Every day is the same in the stock market. The biggest equity benchmarks trade sideways, while megacap tech marches upward.   The Nasdaq 100 has beaten the S&amp;P 500 for seven straight days, five straight weeks, 10 straight months. The tech-heavy gauge is up 23% this year, and since June 8 has beaten the broader market by 10 percentage points.   While that\u2019s manna for bulls who own market proxies, it is also -- at best -- a mixed economic signal. As stirring as the rally has been, the whole thing can also be read as proof investors see the pandemic lockdown hanging around. Every time an automated, algorithmic Fang stock rallies, the theory goes, hopes for a speedy recovery in employment and consumer spending take a hit.   Stated differently: the main thing that could stand in the way of more outperformance is an end to the recession.   \u201cIf things get better, if the broader investment environment looks more attractive, then investor appetite for risk, for value, a broader swath of securities will improve,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, economist and multi-asset portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments. \u201cSo you\u2019d see tech lose on a relative basis.\u201d   Plotting the Nasdaq 100\u2019s velocity against the S&amp;P 500 shows its ascent has been interrupted twice since the pandemic outbreak. Tech shares fell behind at the bear market\u2019s bottom in March, when Federal Reserve\u2019s stimulus eased concern over insolvencies. Tech also trailed from mid-May to early June, with hopes for economic reopenings prompting investors to scoop up airlines and companies hit the most during the Covid crash.   Both times, tech stocks -- the stay-at-home trade -- rebounded once fears over the economy or a second wave of virus infections resurfaced.   Lori Heinel, deputy global chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, says looking out over the long-term, there\u2019s potential for a sharp recovery in economic data and corporate earnings, especially if a vaccine is developed.   \u201cIf we\u2019re right about the idea that we\u2019ll see a bit of an improvement in the economic backdrop in the balance of this year and into 2021, we think that there\u2019s just better opportunities in other sectors,\u201d Heinel told Bloomberg TV this week. Her team is generally underweight FANG stocks but overweight tech.   What else could trip up tech? Though it hasn\u2019t mattered to date, valuation remains a concern. At 31 times forecast earnings, the Nasdaq 100 is trading at the highest multiple since 2004. By most traditional absolute measures, the index\u2019s valuation is \u201cextreme,\u201d according to Michael Purves, chief executive officer if Tallbacken Capital Advisors.   \u201cClearly there has been a lot of good news built into valuations at this point -- they\u2019re going to have to deliver on that good news,\u201d said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management. If there are signs from earnings calls and releases that the new environment hasn\u2019t been as favorable to tech stocks as investors seem to be pricing in, \u201cthat would be the most likely cause that would give people pause.\u201d   Many tech firms are scheduled to post quarterly results before the end of the month. Netflix is reporting next week. But given their monster run-ups, analysts are already starting to express some skepticism. Deutsche Bank strategists this week, for instance, conveyed surprise about the speed and magnitude of Apple\u2019s rebound, adding that it \u201chas us nervous.\u201d Raymond James echoed that tone, citing uncertainty around the firm\u2019s forecast given expected delays in the iPhone 12.   Read more: Runup in Tech Mega-Caps Sows Doubt Before Key Earnings Reports   Also omnipresent for the tech sector is the risk of regulations, taken up by policy makers on both sides of the political spectrum. The breakup of big tech firms, especially, has become a focal point. Apple faces antitrust probes in the European Union and U.S. over rules it imposes on developers. In May, Bloomberg News reported that the U.S. Justice Department is drafting a lawsuit against Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, accusing the internet giant of violating antitrust laws. The department is on track to file a complaint this summer.   Read more: Google Search a Target of U.S. Antitrust Probes, Rival Says   More recently, Facebook has come under fire for its market power, its failure to protect privacy, police hate speech and curb political disinformation. A backlash by major advertisers, including Unilever NV, Coca-Cola Co. and Starbucks Corp., sprung up over concerns about ads appearing next to inappropriate content on the platform -- with some analysts arguing that it could embolden Congress to take its own action.   To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., regulatory scrutiny could intensify, especially as the presidential election starts to heat up. Policy makers have been \u201cholding back on these things so far this summer because their proposals would have been lost among the Covid and social tension issues,\u201d said the firm\u2019s chief market strategist. \u201cOnce the real campaigns begin after the conventions, this bipartisan issue will be pushed in a more prominent way by our members of Congress.\u201d   \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42560352849</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609Y-KHB1-F07F-84K8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>BNN Bloomberg</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Press Release</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000293F</classCode><className>NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC6311 LIFE INSURANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>US Federal Reserve System</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwQTBCNEI1REYxNDExMDgzQzVBNTc4NzgwN0YzQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

So yes, that's to look forward to next week. All right. Thank you, Laura.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM: Have a great show.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BREAM: Thanks. Tonight, the President's critics claim he only cares if red states see upticks in the coronavirus as House Democrats spend the day berating Attorney General Bill Barr, claiming his DOJ did nothing about lockdown protests at the Michigan State Capitol but argue weeks later. Federal agents sent to Portland are the ones sparking violence there. Attorney General Barr and President Trump say they're about law and order.</p><p>As presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden says they're the ones dividing America. Well, Election Day is less than 100 days away. Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS AT NIGHT, I'm Shannon Bream in Washington. We began with Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel, and where we stand tonight after today's fireworks on Capitol Hill. Hey, Mike.</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good evening. It was a very tense hearing in House Judiciary today. Democrats fired their questions on a range of issues at Attorney General Barr, but most didn't allow him to answer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: He said he found --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Reclaiming my time without political bias.</p><p>BARR: He said he had enough evidence --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Reclaiming my time, Mr. Attorney.</p><p>EMANUEL: The interruption of the Attorney General did not stop there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Barr --</p><p>BARR: Yes, but this is a hearing, I thought I was the one that's supposed to be heard.</p><p>EMANUEL: The panel's top Republican suggested Democrats should stop being rude.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): I want the Attorney General to be able to have enough time to respond to accusations and questions asked him and you guys not cut him off.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What you want is irrelevant, and irrelevant to the rules.</p><p>EMANUEL: But late in the session, there was even more tension.</p><p>BARR: Well, I don't accept your characterization of what happened. But as I explained, the effort there was --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Barr, I just asked for a yes or no. So, let me just tell you a -- I'm starting to lose my temper.</p><p>MANUEL: When he had the time, Barr pushed back.</p><p>BARR: But what makes me concerned for the country is this the first time in my memory that the leaders of one of our great two political parties, the Democratic Party, are not coming out and condemning mob violence and the attack on federal courts.</p><p>EMANUEL: Barr was asked if excessive force was used in Portland.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think Americans who show up to peacefully protest should expect to be beaten and pepper sprayed and have their bones broken by federal offices?</p><p>BARR: Well, I don't think that what was happening immediately around the courthouse was a peaceful protest.</p><p>EMANUEL: Chairman Jerry Nadler tried to suggest Barr is focused on politics.</p><p>BARR: I'm a member of the cabinet and there's an election going on obviously, the topic comes up. The topic comes up and cabinet meetings and other things. OK, it shouldn't be a surprise that, the topic of the election.</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): I didn't say I was surprised, I just asked if he'd done that.</p><p>EMANUEL: One of the key players for Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee during impeachment, Daniel Goldman, panned it, tweeting: \"Ineffective opening line of questioning by Rep. Jerry Nadler. The low point was not allowing a bathroom break.\"</p><p>BARR: All right, Mr. Chairman, could we take five-minute break?</p><p>NADLER: Deed is recognized.</p><p>BARR: Sorry, Mr. Chairman, can we take a five-minute break? Can we take a five-minute, Mr. Chairman?</p><p>NADLER: No.</p><p>EMANUEL: Former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara called it a disappointing hearing and getting worse.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EMANUEL: Barr did not back down and seem to roll with most of the interruptions if there was any doubt it is clearly election season. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Mike Emanuel, thank you very much. Well, it appears one of the things left and right do agree on is the use of the Defense Production Act to get corporate America engaged in fighting the pandemic. The president touting the 33rd use of the DPA today, nurses protest for more PPE earlier this year and New York demanded the Trump administration do more of this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULLIAN PRIMIANO, WYCKOFF HOSPITAL E.R. NURSE: Defense Production Act now. Mass production of ventilators, mass production of unnecessary medications, mass production of N95 masks, gowns, other protective equipment that we need in the hospital. Cancel rent so that people in New York City can stay home.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: All right, Correspondent Rich Edson is with us with all the latest details tonight. Hey, Rich.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. A major moment for an iconic American brand. The administration has awarded Kodak, once a global leader in photography, a $765 million loan to help it make pharmaceuticals.</p><p>President Trump announced this afternoon he's invoking the Defense Production Act to provide the government loan to launch Kodak pharmaceuticals, producing ingredients for generic drugs and reduce us reliance on foreign drug manufacturers.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'll be competitive with almost all countries and soon with all countries.</p><p>EDSON: The President was also scheduled to meet today with top pharmaceutical companies, though Politico reports the executives cancelled after the President signed Executive Orders late last week, aimed at reducing drug costs. The pharmaceutical industry opposes the orders. As the coronavirus surges across the country, the President retweeted comments critical of the government's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, including one claim he's misleading the public. Fauci denied to ABC News he's misled Americans under any circumstance.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, MEMBER OF THE WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE: I just will continue to do my job.</p><p>EDSON: The President then wondered why polls show Fauci has a much higher coronavirus approval rating than him.</p><p>TRUMP: A man works for us, with, us very closely, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx, also highly thought of, and yet they're highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality, that's all.</p><p>EDSON: Top administration officials and Democratic Congressional leaders are now negotiating the next coronavirus economic package. Republicans have just released their plan. Democrats say it's insufficient.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): If we stay strong. I have good hope and realistic chance that Republicans a decent chance that Republicans will move in our direction and we'll get much of what we want.</p><p>EDSON: Democrats and Republicans are about two and a half trillion dollars apart. Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: That is not insignificant. All right, Richardson, thank you. In a summer, that seen the political conventions all but shuttered due to pandemic fears, now new restrictions on how police can do their jobs could impact the conventions in a totally different way. More than 100 police agencies pulling out of security agreements for the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee.</p><p>The reason: the city recently ordered police to stop using tear gas and pepper spray as non-lethal crowd control measures. (INAUDIBLE) now say they're looking at asking for help from the federal government as well as the National Guard and although they the Democratic Convention will mostly be held online; law enforcement is preparing for an influx of protesters.</p><p>President Trump continues to be accessible to the media, something he seems to enjoy even when it turns combative, maybe mostly one. By contrast, former Vice President Joe Biden has stayed in his basement citing safety concerns over the coronavirus, mostly refusing to take media questions even when he does make rare public appearances. Well, that changed today, and Correspondent Doug McKelway was there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to have a choice in the first week in August, and I promise, I'll let you know when I do.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Back on the trail but sticking close to home at an Inner-City Community Center in Wilmington, Joe Biden said he will reveal his running mate next week. The announcement came as the former V.P. unveiled the fourth and final plank of his build back better economic recovery plan to today.</p><p>BIDEN: It's about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people's struggles, and building a future worthy of their courage and their ambition to overcome.</p><p>MCKELWAY: It's a 26-page wish lists covering everything from helping black and brown farmers purchase land, to providing 100 and $50 billion in new capital for small businesses who've been quote, structurally excluded for generations. How to pay for it, it's doubtful any Republican Congress would agree Biden's counting on Democrats taking control.</p><p>BIDEN: If I'm elected in this pass, I'm going to be good to go down to the most progressive presidents in American history.</p><p>MCKELWAY: He accused President Trump's remedies as favoring the rich.</p><p>BIDEN: Right now, we're in the midst of one of the greatest threats to small businesses our country has ever seen. What Donald Trump doing about it was given big banks, the greenlight, the loan millions of dollars.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I support him 100 percent.</p><p>MCKELWAY: The Biden campaign also held separate events with Native Americans and other with African American Virginia Congressman Bobby Scott, and a virtual fundraiser with President Obama and George Clooney.</p><p>The virus is defining two very different agendas on how to rebuild the economy. The Biden approaches the expansion of government aid and regulation. The Trump approach is to free up businesses from that kind of regulation. Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: Doug McKelway, thank you.</p><p>BREAM: Barr, Trump Biden, here's how the Wall Street Journal puts them all together tonight, with fewer than 100 days until the election. The main threat to Democrats is overconfidence, which can breed recklessness. For the most part, the Biden campaign has avoided this trap. But on the issue of federal law enforcement officers in American cities, the presumptive Democratic nominee risks losing his balance. So, let's unpack that nowadays news with GOP Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana. Senator, welcome back to the program.</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, the Attorney General had to answer a lot of questions on the Hill today about federal agents, their role in these cities and what's going on. I want to play a little bit of an exchange between him and Congressman Hank Johnson. This went to the Roger stone sentencings and the accusations that bill Barr is doing the bidding of President Trump and not serving the American people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. HANK JOHNSON (D-GA): You think the American people don't understand that you were carrying out Trump's?</p><p>BARR: I was not. I had not discussed my sense and recommendation with anyone at the White House or anyone -- or anyone outside the department.</p><p>JOHNSON: Would your President -- or wanted you to do. And that's what you did.</p><p>BARR: No.</p><p>JOHNSON: Attorney. Attorney Bill Barr --</p><p>BARR: Let me ask you, do you think it's fair? Do you think it is fair for a 67-year-old man reclaimed may be sent to prison for seven to nine years?</p><p>JOHNSON: It was in accordance with the sentencing? No, it was not.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: All right, right. So, Senator, it's a lot of what we saw today is that when the Attorney General did want to give have been flushed out his answers, the members has generally said reclaiming my time and didn't seem like they wanted to hear from him at this hearing today, what do you make of it?</p><p>KENNEDY: I've watched bits and pieces of the hearing, Shannon, but I finally turned it off because it was triggering my gag reflex. It wasn't a hearing. It was an attempted persecution. I think the American people saw that. The point that some of my Democratic colleagues seem to be trying to make was it the Attorney General was out of control. But what they really mean is that he's out of their control. Bill Barr is guided by the rule of law, and he doesn't do anyone's bidding. He calls it like he sees it. I thought he was his, for the most part, his usual, unflappable self. And he's tough, you got to be tough to be in that job. He's tough upon as a (INAUDIBLE) and I respect that about him as well.</p><p>BREAM: He had to answer a lot of questions about a number of things and face a lot of accusations that he wasn't allowed to answer. There were some disturbing allegations that were made today. Congresswoman Jayapal tweeted that, she said: \"Bill Barr is aggressive towards Black Lives Matter protests but not armed right wing extremists threatening to lynch a governor, why? Because white men with swastika storming a Capital are part of Trump's agenda while people of color protesting injustice are seen as terrorists.\"</p><p>It appears she's making a comment regarding protesters at Michigan State Capitol. There were swastikas but as Rich Lowry points this out. He says, \"A few protesters in particular a widely photographed woman with a Heil Witmer sign use swastikas to depict the governor as a fascist, obviously ridiculously over the top chart not to identify themselves as Nazis.\"</p><p>It is an important distinction but what do you make about Congresswoman Jayapal's accusation that the A.G. wants to protect white racists and not people raising the concerns of black lives matter?</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, I would say that she is very well-versed in the stuff that she makes up. That's just, that's just not true. I've said this many times, but I'm going to keep repeating it. The American people are not morons, model people in Washington, D.C., treat them like that. But they can see what's going on, on television. These are anarchists who hate America. They think America was wicked in its in its founding, and it's even more wicked today. And they want to tear it down.</p><p>And unfortunately, we have some Democratic mayors they seem to be mostly Democrats, who are who are holding the police back. And if we were not sending in federal law enforcement officials, the anarchists would burn down every single building in the city. And I don't understand that, I just, that's not the rule of law. And if that's right -- And if that's what the people had fought and won, I guess they're getting what they want. But to me, it's not what the American people supports.</p><p>BREAM: All right, let me ask you, are you making a distinction between what she referred to the black versus those who are calling anarchists? Are you calling those two different groups? Are you putting them together?</p><p>KENNEDY: No, I am talking about -- look, I'm responding to the first week that you that you read to me. I think that what we see going on in places like Portland, and like Seattle and like Atlanta, these are not peaceful protests. There needless guns, and say they say that bill Barr is a racist and is a white supremacist is just not accurate.</p><p>BREAM: Let me ask you this. We have heard later this evening that more than 100 police agencies are no longer going to respond and assist when it comes to the DNC. In part, they're worried about the fact that they can't use pepper spray, pepper spray, tear gas, other, other crowd control tools that they think they're going to need potentially in that situation. A quick comment from you on that news tonight.</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, that's happens when you defund the police. That's what happens when you when you itemize criminals and you demonize law enforcement officials. And, and I have no doubt that our local law enforcement officials could safely protect every one of us if the mayors of these cities will allow them but they're not allowing them. Hence, the need to send me an additional help in the terms of federal law enforcement. That's not racist, that's called obeying and upholding the law.</p><p>BREAM: Well, that is a point that the attorney general made numerous times today. It probably was very frustrating for a lot of people involved in that hearing today on all sides. But as you noted, it was an interesting day on Capitol Hill as it often is, Senator, thanks for coming back.</p><p>KENNEDY: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: Well, Milwaukee Police to release photos of a suspect in the shooting death of a Rastafarian Community Fixture who happened to be a supporter of President Trump. Bernard Trammell was stumping for the President when he was killed. Two of the photos show the suspect riding a bicycle which police say was his mode of transportation.</p><p>Tensions running high again tonight in New York. The NYPD says its warrant division used an unmarked gray minivan to apprehend a suspect wanted for allegedly damaging police cameras. The NYPD says the incident turned ugly with a suspect allegedly resisting arrest and bottles being thrown at officers.</p><p>We are monitoring in another night of volatile clashes brewing right now on the streets of Portland, as Democrats they're blamed the federal agents sent to quell the violence. The Director of the U.S. Marshal Service, Donald Washington, is live next.</p><p>BREAM: In today's combative hearing featuring Attorney General Bill Barr, House Democrats continue to argue that federal agents sent in to help riot- stricken cities like Portland are actually targeting peaceful protesters and inciting violence, and that the Trump administration is using that violence to instill fear in the protesters for what Democrats are calling \"obvious political objectives.\" Fox News got access inside the Portland Federal Courthouse last night. Rick Leventhal joins us with a look at what we learned. Hey, Rick.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, for more than eight weeks now, we've seen protesters attacking the federal courthouse in Portland and squaring off with U.S. Marshals assigned to protect the property. Now, we have another angle after Fox News was embedded with those Marshals inside the building.</p><p>Monday night is like most others for the federal agents protecting the Marco Hatfield Federal Courthouse in Portland, a final warning to the crowd. And out they come, firing smoke gas and pepper balls, or taking a barrage of projectiles including fireworks, rocks, ball bearings, bottles and garden sprayers filled with urine and bleach.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By no means is that's peaceful protest. It starts to knock the night off like that. But eventually, it's taken over by where you know there are violent opportunists who are using this peaceful protest to take over to just kind of start in an anarchy.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Anarchy, the fed say, on display for 61 consecutive nights, with some in the crowd wearing protective gear similar to the officers bringing weapons including bats, hockey sticks, and slingshots and equipment to cut through metal fencing, launching fireworks setting fires and shining laser pointers reportedly causing permanent damage to some agents' eyes.</p><p>BARR: We are on the defense. We're not out looking for trouble. And if the state and the city would provide the law enforcement services in other jurisdictions, still we wouldn't have no need to have additional martial in the courthouse.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Protesters say the feds are the problem escalating tensions, calling their actions unnecessary excessive and dangerous.</p><p>WOLFGANG TAYLOR, PROTESTER: That's pepper and tear gas, saturate through my mass.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: We're told more agents may be on the way not to increase the size of the force but provide relief to the guys who've been on the job for most of the past 62 days and nights, and Shannon that includes tonight.</p><p>BREAM: It does. All right, Rick Leventhal from the West Coast. Thank you.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Sure.</p><p>BREAM: House Democrats are portraying federal agents as the ones who are stifling free speech and causing violence.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): Your failure to respect the role of peaceful protest in this country is a disgrace, it's un-American, and it's important to remember what these protests are about, Black Lives Matter.</p><p>BARR: I don't understand why a small contingent of marshals inside the court poses a threat to anybody's first amendment rights.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: We are joined now by the Director of the U.S. Marshal Service, Donald Washington. Director, good to have you with us tonight.</p><p>DONALD WASHINGTON, DIRECTOR, U.S. MARSHALL SERVICE: Hello, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, you were there in Portland, do you think it is important for you to be there at this moment in time? You're trying to meet with local community leaders and organizers so that you can get to a peaceful resolution of some kind, what do you hope to accomplish?</p><p>WASHINGTON: Well, let me just back up one step if I could and tell you about the U.S. Marshal Service, so we'll put this in the proper context. The United States Marshal Service, its primary function since 1789, has been to protect the federal judicial function. So, what we're doing in Portland is nothing new. We've been doing it for 230 years. And in terms of Portland itself, we've been in Portland here for 16 decades, 160 years.</p><p>So, the men and women who are here, the 40 that are stationed here permanently are folks who are parts of this community, their husbands and wives, they are raising children here, they live and die here in Portland. This is their state, this is their home. So, we're not some outside invading force, if you will. This is where this is where we should be, and we don't have the option to not be in here.</p><p>That courthouse is the, the symbol of justice in this community, at least federal justice from which many important decisions have, have come. So, we are here as, as the protectors, if you will, of Article Three of our Constitution. That's our primary duty and function. And so, that's, that, that's why we're here. And what do I intend to or what do I hope to accomplish over the next couple of days?</p><p>I am here to work with whoever is willing to work toward a, a reasonable resolution in whatever aspect that we can provide that resolution and I'll say that because this is a very complex issue, that, that the local leaders who you're trying to address. But from my perspective, as leader of the U.S. Marshal Service, that institution of justice is represented by that courthouse.</p><p>If you walk inside of the courthouse, you'll see a huge sentence that's written in gold. And it states, \"The first duty of society is justice.\" So, this is where people who are protesting will ultimately end up going in order to get some of the things that they're asking for. It's my job to ensure that peaceful protesters are protected. We think that we do that, and we do that in a very professional way.</p><p>But it's also our job to enforce federal law, because this peaceful protest in many respects has been hijacked by violent extremist, who have no intent to arrive at any solution, other than to continue to create chaos. So, I'm going to meet with members of the community over the next couple of days. Members of the faith community, the business community and others who wouldn't have to talk about what next.</p><p>In terms of the deputies in the courthouse, though, I think they're doing a magnificent job under very hostile circumstances. So, as we look forward, we hope we can make some progress.</p><p>BREAM: And you have a very interesting background. You've been in private law practice and public, you've served as a U.S. Attorney. Quickly, this moment in time, because of your, your law enforcement background on many different levels. Are you worried this country is at a tipping point, or do you see beyond that to a resolution?</p><p>WASHINGTON: Yes, I'm a, I am the eternal optimist in terms of the United States. I'm a firm believer in our Constitution. I think it is the thing that separates us from other countries in the world. I think it holds great promise, but just like any other thing, we're always looking for a better day. And so, as we look at these protesters, I would encourage the public to separate the good from the bad, the wheat from the chaff as some would say.</p><p>In my experience as a law enforcement officer, we want law and order. We want justice, but we won't equal justice under the law. So, I'll have to tell you that just from a Black Lives Matter standpoint, in terms of the, the precepts of that movement, it's hard to, it's hard to argue against the concept of equal rights for everybody, which should be our, should be something that we should all strive for. And then, we should also strive for what, what I refer to as equal justice under law.</p><p>Because if you look at this concept of racial inequality, and this idea that we should, we should engage in a discussion about police conduct, I think those are all good and healthy kinds of things. I do, however, believe that we should not be burning down courthouses or attempting to burn down courthouses. We should not be engaging in assaults against federal officers who are trying to protect that institution and things of that sort. So, there are some serious things here that need to be addressed.</p><p>BREAM: Yes.</p><p>WASHINGTON: But this country itself, we're strong and I think in the long run, this will be another one of those things that happened in American history that made us a, a better Republican and a stronger, a stronger union.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, well, I, I share your optimism, Director, and I'm glad that you're there on the ground. We wish you the best with your efforts and coming to a peaceful resolution. As you said, it's important always to separate the good from the bad. We're out there on the streets trying to share a message. U.S. Marshals Director, Donald Washington. Thank you, sir.</p><p>WASHINGTON: Thank you very much, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, back to school breaking news on potential teacher strikes and educator and a medical doctor joins us next to discuss the facts about coronavirus and your kids going back to class, next.</p><p>BREAM: Teachers and lawyers in color-coded shirts in Portland protesting what they call racial injustice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a movement that's growing because, I mean, in every city, you know, you know, America, you know, in a lot of ways is a failed experiment as far as racial equity. And it's, it's, it's too long, it's been too long.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Protests like these could soon be directed at reopening schools and so-called safety strikes. Correspondent Alex Hogan is tracking that story. Good evening, Alex.</p><p>ALEX HOGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. Good to be with you. School districts and parents across the nation navigating how to start the school year and how to keep their families safe with some parents now even holding their kids from their old schools, and some even creating educational programs themselves.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But at this point, we're not completely sure I think what we did in the start of the spring, that's not going to work again.</p><p>HOGAN: Back to school, unlike ever before, parents worried about too much screen time and not enough socializing, finding alternative options. Some saving up for private schools with open campuses, while others getting creative by bringing school home and forming pods of children to learn together in person.</p><p>ANDREA TOCH, \"POD\" PARENT: The pods will allow us to have one parent or we're even looking into hiring a tutor that can really sit down with our kids and focus on all of their individual learnings in small group setting.</p><p>HOGAN: But economically, that's not an option for all families.</p><p>MALINDA DAY, CHILD AND FAMILY EXPERT: Individuals and lower income communities don't have access to each other, let alone each other to pot and provide the same level of educational experience.</p><p>HOGAN: According to a Fox News poll, two-thirds of parents want their children to attend public schools this fall in person to some extent, even if that happened, little would feel usual. Kids would learn from six feet apart, unable to play or even sit near each other at lunch.</p><p>FRANK BROGAN, ASSISTANT EDUCATION SECRETARY: Develop multiple plans, because you're going to be surprised to find out nothing is going to work for a one size fits all approach to this thing is during the pandemic.</p><p>HOGAN: With so much uncertainty, the American Federation of Teachers Union, which represents 1.7 million school workers, sharing their new safety requirements and threatening strikes if they're not met.</p><p>RANDI WEINGARTEN, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: Nothing is off the table at advocacy or protests, negotiations, grievances or lawsuits, or if necessary, and authorized by a local union, as a last resort, safety strikes.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOGAN: In Boston, a representation of nurses on behalf of these teachers will sit in at city hall to demand changes to the city's reopening plan. And in Salt Lake City, Utah, the largest teachers' union in this state is also calling on a delay to re-openings for these schools. And just today in Philadelphia, the city announcing that all students there will learn online, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Alex Hogan for us in New York tonight, thank you. So, to discuss this let's bring in Kathleen Porter-Magee, Superintendent of partnership schools, it's a nonprofit that manages seven New York City Catholic schools in Harlem in the South Bronx, and Dr. Martin Makary, a Fox News Medical Contributor. Welcome to you both.</p><p>KATHLEEN PORTER-MAGEE, SUPERINTENDENT, THE PARTNERSHIP FOR INNER-CITY EDUCATION: Thanks for having me, Shannon.</p><p>DR. MARTIN MAKARY, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: OK, so the New York Post editorial has this, it says, that in the headline: \"Science says (again): Open the schools.\" \"Most studies show the coronavirus poses few health risks to children, mitigate the health risks and the educational risks at once. Open schools with additional safety measures. Our kids cannot afford to lose yet more months of learning.\" So, Kathleen, I'll start with you, what are your concerns in trying to balance these two risks that, you know, obviously it helps us to, you know, staffing kids and everybody involved, but the educational deficit that many kids will miss if they're left at home again.</p><p>MAGEE: It's real. The schools that I get to serve in New York City serve some of the most disadvantaged communities in the nation. We have four Catholic schools in Harlem and three in the South Bronx. Our students are from two of the poorest congressional districts. And so, when we were forced to shut down, I was so proud of the work that our teachers did, that our principals did, but we know that our kids learn better when we can bring them together in community. And so, as we're looking, we're trying to balance the safety protocols.</p><p>Also, with, with parent choice, so we're doing two things: so one, we are implementing the CDC guidelines to make sure that we're doing everything that we can to mitigate the spread of the virus to keep our students safe, to keep our faculty and staff safe. But we're also giving parents options, they can opt in to five days a week in person instruction, or they can opt into a robust learning online learning option. So, that way parents are involved in the conversation as well. And I think that's really important because as you know, people have said, there is no one size fits all strategy that's going to work for everyone.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, and they want information. They want transparency about what their options are and what the science is. I want to read a couple of reactions from the hill where there are very different reactions on opposite sides. A tweet from congressman Andy Biggs, he's a Republican, he says: \"If you're following the science and data on reopening schools, you can clearly see that schools across the country can be reopened safely and quickly for children, teachers and parents. We cannot let politics and fear dictate our inability to reopen schools.\"</p><p>Now, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat says this: \"This is willfully endangering our kids and entire communities for political gain. Forcing schools to reopen without providing them with the resources they need to do so safely is reckless, dangerous, and the last thing we should do.\" I mean, Marty, it actually sounds like there would be some common ground for these two, they're almost talking past each other, but it sounds like nearly everyone agrees this has to be a locally made decision where school districts closest to their issues know what their communities are dealing with, but yet it seems like such a political issue when maybe it doesn't need to be.</p><p>MAKARY: Well, that's right, Shannon. And you know, when the American Academy of Pediatrics made a statement on this, it wasn't political when President Trump then and the administration then affirmed what the American Academy of Pediatrics said, that's when we started to see the divide.</p><p>And the reality is, we've got to look at the totality of data around closings. And when you're closed, there are consequences to health, and yes, it does affect deaths. 1750 kids have died from child abuse in the last year for which we have annual statistics. 90 kids, by comparison have died from COVID-19 to date in totality, and that is comparable to that of seasonal flu, pneumonia, viral meningitis.</p><p>So, we need to think about the entire realm of data. 42 percent of kids get their mental health therapy and treatments through the schools, calls the child abuse hotlines are way down. It's implausible to think there's less child abuse. It's just there's less eyes on the kids. And 12 million people get their meals, including breakfast from schools because they don't have good adequate nutrition at home.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, and as we've talked about, in you know, Kathleen, you know more about this than anybody, when you -- when we see that a lot of folks and parents who are able to or either hiring teachers just to form small pods or putting their kids into private schools. We know for millions of parents that is not going to be an option. So, Kathleen, Dr. Martin Makary it's great to have you both to talk about this and as parents try to make good decisions. Thank you both.</p><p>MAGEE: Thank you.</p><p>MAKARY: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: All right. How Portland businesses derailed by the pandemic are now dealing with growing unrest? Hear from the business owners themselves, next.</p><p>BREAM: According to local reports, recent destruction in downtown Seattle seemed targeted at big businesses like Amazon and Starbucks, public buildings, courthouses and police precincts. But small businesses like Victrola Coffee Roasters didn't get out unscathed. Seattle business leaders are complaining that city police need to take a firmer stand even as the Democratic Mayor tweeted out the city does not need or want federal help.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JON SCHOLES, DOWNTOWN SEATTLE ASSOCIATION: We can't allow this to take place. We need to identify who these folks are and make sure they don't feel like they can come to the middle of our city on, on a beautiful Sunday summer afternoon and kind of have their way. It's just not acceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: for a local business viewpoint from another city now dealing with weeks of protests. Let's talk with Stacey Gibson in Portland, she owns five fast food restaurants, including one in downtown. Stacey, good to have you with us.</p><p>STACEY GIBSON, RESTAURANT OWNER: Thank you, Shannon. Nice to be here.</p><p>BREAM: So, you've had a one two punch. I think your notes said that when COVID hit sales were down 60 percent, then when the protests and the unrest showed up, that was another 20 percent. And you say, listen, you've been very supportive of a lot of the protesters' basic messages, the underlying messages, do you feel in some ways though, they've been hijacked by the more, you know, aggressive and violent protesters who now kind of leave a lot of downtown businesses in limbo?</p><p>GIBSON: Absolutely. Yes, so the messages getting lost because it's certainly not the Black Lives movement that is causing all this damage on the federal buildings and everything else. It's just people taking advantage of an opportunity, and it's hurting a lot of people. I mean, not just the businesses, but the residents and everybody that's trying to be down here. I mean, it's just destroyed Portland, in my opinion.</p><p>BREAM: I know when you you've said that you have -- the branches of your subway restaurants that you have that are outside of downtown are doing well, or at least they're surviving. How would you contrast that with your downtown location?</p><p>GINSON: Substantially different. I mean, we've got one store that's well over last year sales, it says it, you know, everybody's just doing really great, and then the stores in the other area around Portland here. I mean, we're still down, obviously, but we've got reduced hours, so that kind of explains some of that.</p><p>But downtown I mean, we're just, you know, when we boarded up, it was absolutely devastating financially, we had to make a really tough decision on whether or not we wanted to just close the store and wait for everything to kind of be over.</p><p>And then we decided against that because we wanted to keep our people employed, and do what we could to, you know, make their lives a little bit better and security wise and so we just pulled this, pulled all the boards down and just are crossing our fingers that we don't get the damage. The business next to us was just completely destroyed, and we were very fortunate the past nights.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, you're 60 plus nights into these protests in Portland, what do you see? Or what do you hope will happen as you're trying to move forward as a business owner in a really crazy year?</p><p>GIBSON: Well, I certainly hope that we can get this resolved, first of all. I mean, it's just not fair that people can break laws and not have any kind of consequence. I mean, that just needs to be resolved. There's just -- it's just not something that should be going on.</p><p>As far as a business owner, I mean, we're just crossing our fingers and trying to get through as best as we can, keeping people working, trying to keep them safe. Hopefully, something comes along and we can, you know, just deal with the COVID and trying to get through all of that mass, but it's terrifying as a business owner. I'm just not really sure what to expect and this is just unprecedented situations.</p><p>BREAM: It is. It is and listen, you as the American entrepreneur and business owner out there are the heart of this country. So, we wish you all the best in trying to put things back together. Stacey Gibson, thank you for your time.</p><p>GIBSON: Thank you. You have a great night.</p><p>BREAM: You too. All right, President Trump and his slogan promises made, promises kept, did he deliver? FOX NEWS AT NIGHT investigates right after this break.</p><p>BREAM: Now for an examination of what then candidate Donald Trump promised in 2016, and how it's turned out. Correspondent Kristin Fisher takes a look from the White House tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Before the pandemic put a stop to the President's rallies, he often delivered remarks in between banners that read, promises made and promises kept. Without question, the most successful and perhaps consequential promise that he kept from the 2016 campaign has been to fill the judiciary with conservatives.</p><p>TRUMP: The justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life, they will have a conservative bent.</p><p>FISHER: In addition to Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the Senate has confirmed 198 other judicial appointments, a record for a first term president. Another promise kept renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and replacing it with the USMCA.</p><p>TRUMP: Today, we're finally ending the NAFTA nightmare.</p><p>FISHER: But the president struggled to secure a trade deal with China. He also didn't secure quite as many tax cuts as he promised. But he came close with the tax cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and then there's his signature campaign issue from 2016.</p><p>TRUMP: We will build that great wall and Mexico will pay for that great wall.</p><p>FISHER: Last month, the president celebrated the completion of 200 miles of border wall, but Mexico did not pay for it.</p><p>TRUMP: We're going to rebuild our infrastructure.</p><p>FISHER: But three and a half years in, the President has yet to put forward an infrastructure plan, though the White House says he may announce one soon. Another promise broken, repealing the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>TRUMP: We will do it and we will do it very, very quickly.</p><p>FISHER: But President Trump is still trying to keep that promise. Just last month, his administration asked the Supreme Court to overturn Obamacare, but the justices have decided to not hear those arguments until after the election. At the White House, Kristin Fisher, Fox News.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: All right. That is it for us here in Washington. Tomorrow, we'll have an eye on the big tech hearing on Capitol Hill, you won't want to miss that. Fox has full coverage. Most-watched, most trusted, most grateful you spent the evening with us. Good night from Washington. I'm Shannon Bream.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020072801cb259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G2-K0V1-DXH2-60D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6929\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Hearing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bill Barr</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>One-sided</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GOP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Judiciary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jerry Nadler</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DPA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kodak</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Portland</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Black Lives Matter</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Marshal</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Courts</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Teachers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Schools</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Safety Strikes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Teachers Union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pods</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>GATT &amp;

She is currently writing a book about textile artisans. The WSJ published a comprehensive investigation Friday, How Google Interferes With Its Search Algorithms and Changes Your Results[1], that provides fodder forongoing or new antitrust investigations of the company, both in the US, and worldwide: THE JOURNAL'S FINDINGS undercut one of Google's core defenses against global regulators worried about how it wields its immense power\u2014that the company doesn't exert editorial control over what it shows users. Regulators' areas of concern include anticompetitive practices, political bias and online misinformation. </p><p>Permit to me quote from the WSJ's takedown at length - although I encourage readers, if possible, to read the entire (paywalled) version, for it contains a wealth of information, as well as lots of cool graphics: Google's evolving approach marks a shift from its founding philosophy of 'organizing the world's information,' to one that is far more active in deciding how that information should appear. More than 100 interviews and the Journal's own testing of Google's search results reveal: \u2022 Google made algorithmic changes to its search results that favor big businesses over smaller ones, and in at least one case made changes on behalf of a major advertiser, eBay[2]Inc., contrary to its public position that it never takes that type of action. The company also boosts some major websites, such as Amazon.com[3] Inc. and Facebook[4] Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. \u2022 Google engineers regularly make behind-the-scenes adjustments to other information the company is increasingly layering on top of its basic search[5] results. These features include auto-complete suggestions, boxes called 'knowledge panels' and 'featured snippets,' and news results, which aren't subject to the same company policies limiting what engineers can remove or change. \u2022 Despite publicly denying doing so, Google keeps blacklists to remove certain sites or prevent others from surfacing in certain types of results. These moves are separate from those that block sites as required by U.S. or foreign law, such as those featuring child abuse or with copyright infringement, and from changes designed to demote spam sites, which attempt to game the system to appear higher in results. \u2022 In auto-complete, the feature that predicts search terms as the user types a query, Google's engineers have created algorithms and blacklists to weed out more-incendiary suggestions for controversial subjects, such as abortion or immigration, in effect filtering out inflammatory results on high-profile topics. \u2022 Google employees and executives, including co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have disagreed on how much to intervene on search results and to what extent. Employees can push for revisions in specific search results, including on topics such as vaccinations and autism. \u2022 To evaluate its search results, Google employs thousands of low-paid contractors whose purpose the company says is to assess the quality of the algorithms' rankings. Even so, contractors said Google gave feedback to these workers to convey what it considered to be the correct ranking of results, and they revised their assessments accordingly, according to contractors interviewed by the Journal. The contractors' collective evaluations are then used to adjust algorithms. Biases Big vs. Small. One major bias: a preference for big versus small. The WSJ notes that at least for shopping results, Google made the tweak as it believed consumers are more likely to find what they want at larger vendors. But this bias looks to me like it stymies, rather than promotes competition. The bias is not limited to shopping, as WSJ reader James West noted incomments (agreeing implicitly with my interpretation of the anti-competitive effect of the Google practice): James West  Our company, an independent publisher of financial coverage of small cap Canadian companies, has routinely been the target of what can only be explained as 'manual downgrades' in Google search results. Our tests indicate a persistent pattern where Google is awarding search visibility increasingly to large US media enterprises, even where ours is local to the issue, and more detailed. Google's founders Page and Brin have built the company to thwart contact from its users, and now, as evidenced by WSJ's coverage, there are widespread issues with Google's monopoly on search. Thanks to WSJ's coverage, we will commence a request process with Canada's competition bureau to investigate Google for anti-competitive practices. This company needs to be more closely regulated, as they are systematically eviscerating entire industries but reserving the bad behaviour it claims to police for its own financial gain. Political Conservative sites often claim their sites are disadvantaged compared to 'liberal' or 'mainstream' sites. This is not exactly news. Yet the bias extends beyond rightwing sites. Yves has written about how changes to Googles's search algorithm have whacked Naked Capitalism's traffic (see Google Algorithm Change Whacks Naked Capitalism[6]; Naked Capitalism is Back! Google Whackage Reversed[7] (note the recovery in traffic was due to remedial measures Naked Capitalism undertook, rather than a Google reversal and upranking; and Google Further Crapifies Search, Exploiting Both Users and Advertisers[8]). As the World Socialist Web Site wrote in 2017 in Google's new search protocol is restricting access to 13 leading socialist, progressive and anti-war web sites[9]: New data compiled by the World Socialist Web Site, with the assistance of other Internet-based news outlets and search technology experts, proves that a massive loss of readership observed by socialist, anti-war and progressive web sites over the past three months has been caused by a cumulative 45 percent decrease in traffic from Google searches. The drop followed the implementation of changes in Google's search evaluation protocols. In a statement issued on April 25, Ben Gomes, the company's vice president for engineering, stated that Google's update of its search engine would block access to 'offensive' sites, while working to surface more 'authoritative content.' The World Socialist Web Site has obtained statistical data from SEMrush estimating the decline of traffic generated by Google searches for 13 sites with substantial readerships. The results are as follows: * wsws.org fell by 67 percent * alternet.org fell by 63 percent * globalresearch.ca fell by 62 percent * consortiumnews.com fell by 47 percent * socialistworker.org fell by 47 percent * mediamatters.org fell by 42 percent * commondreams.org fell by 37 percent * internationalviewpoint.org fell by 36 percent * democracynow.org fell by 36 percent * wikileaks.org fell by 30 percent * truth-out.org fell by 25 percent * counterpunch.org fell by 21 percent * theintercept.com fell by 19 percentAlso on point is a Naked Capitalism crosspost of this 2018 Paul Jay interview, Matt Taibbi on Facebook and Google Playing the Censor[10];Ffom the intro by Yves: I'm glad to see Taibbi speaking out in this Real News Network interview[11] on this issue of growing censorship by Facebook and Google and hope that more journalists join him. With the help of so many of your readers sharing our post and encouraging your friends and family members to check us out, we've managed to stay on an even keel, while other 'deemed to be leftie' sites have taken a traffic hit due to Google downgrading non-MSM sites greatly in their search rankings. Even the Intercept, hardly a blog-scale operation, got whacked. The problem is only getting worse. The WSJ notes that Google is increasing the aggregate number of changes to its algorithms, to about 3,200 tweaks in 2018, up from more than 2,400 in 2017, and further from about 500 in 2010. Influence of Advertisers: Blacklisting; Paywalled Sites The WSJ investigation discusses how Google caters to the interests of big advertisers: Some very big advertisers received direct advice on how to improve their organic search results, a perk not available to businesses with no contacts at Google, according to people familiar with the matter.In some cases, that help included sending in search engineers to explain a problem, they said. In another incident, the WSJ documents how Google reversed a decision that demoted the search results of certain e-Bay pages, in response to lobbying by the company, a significant advertiser. Yves discussed the influence of advertisers blacklisting 'controversial' content in this August post, Advertisers Blacklisting News, Other Stories with 'Controversial' Words Like 'Trump'[12] (a piece that also keyed to a WSJ story): It's no longer paranoid to say that 'they' are out to kill news. First it was the Internet almost entirely displacing classified ads, which had accounted for roughly half of newspaper industry revenues in the US. The Internet also turned most people save those who are now oldsters off print newspapers, even though nothing is so efficient to scan, taking with it higher subscription rates and display ads. Then Facebook and Google sucked most online advertiser revenues to themselves. To add insult to injury, Google implemented algos hostile to smaller sites, first targeting those that did what Google deemed to be too much aggregation, like our daily Links feature. Google deemed those sites to be 'low quality'. One wonders if the real issue was that they competed with Google News. Then Google downgraded sites it deemed not to be 'authoritative,' whacking not only many left and right leaning sites but even The Intercept. Facebook's parallel action was to change its search and newsfeed algos[13], supposedly to combat fake news, but also hurting left-leaning publishers. Now, as the Wall Street Journal reports, many major advertisers have created blacklists, nixing ad placements that appear next to or in stories with headlines using naughty words like 'bomb' that amount to a partial or total ban on news content. It isn't isn't just fluffy feel good brands that want to steer clear of controversy. Startlingly, even some financial services companies like Fidelity want to stay away from hot words like 'Trump' even though 'Trump' appears regularly in business news headlines, such as ones discussing his China trade spat, his tax cuts, his deregulatory efforts, and today, his interest in buying Greenland. In the interests of keeping my post short, I've limited my quotation; I encourage interested readers to read Yves in full. Despite maintaining in Congressional testimony that it doesn't use blacklists, the WSJ account found that Google does. Google tries to wiggle around this apparent contradiction by relying on a narrow interpretation of what constitutes a 'political' blacklist: Google's first blacklists date to the early 2000s, when the company made a list of spam sites that it removed from its index, one of those people said. This means the sites wouldn't appear in search results. Engineers known as 'maintainers' are authorized to make and approve changes to blacklists. It takes at least two people to do this; one person makes the change, while a second approves it, according to the person familiar with the matter. The Journal reviewed a draft policy document from August 2018 that outlines how Google employees should implement an anti-misinformation blacklist aimed at blocking certain publishers from appearing in Google News and other search products. The document says engineers should focus on 'a publisher misrepresenting their ownership or web properties' and having 'deceptive content'\u2014that is, sites that actively aim to mislead\u2014as opposed to those that have inaccurate content. 'The purpose of the blacklist will be to bar the sites from surfacing in any Search feature or news product sites,' the document states. The process for creating such blacklists is opaque, so it's difficult to determine whether there is indeed a political motivation for so doing. And finally, the Journal discussed its own efforts to change a Google policy to disfavor outlets, such as itself, that charge for subscriptions: (The Wall Street Journal is owned by News Corp[14], which has complained publicly about Google's moves to play down news sites that charge for subscriptions. Google ended the policy after intensive lobbying by News Corp and other paywalled publishers. More recently, News Corp has called for an 'algorithm review board' to oversee Google, Facebook and other tech giants. News Corp has a commercial agreement to supply news through Facebook, and Dow Jones ...., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple[15] services. Google's Ms. Levin and News Corp declined to comment.) The Bottom Line To sum it all up: Thomas Ferguson notes in an email 'the last third of the WSJ articlebasically describes 'electronic corporatism' in whichbig private tech concerns look out for each other. Everyone else can't even get an answer.' What Is to be Done? Some if not much of this info is well known to at least some antitrust regulators. Yet by publishing it, the WSJ increases pressure on them to address the problems Google's dominance raises. The company currently captures more than 90% of the market share for all search engines. As to those ongoing antitrust investigations, Matt Stoller, writing in the Guardian a few months ago, The great breakup of big tech is finally beginning,[16] summarized the then-state of play: Last week, state attorneys general, led by Texas and New York, announced investigations into Google and Facebook for possible antitrust violations. This is a big deal. No society has ever centralized control of information as we have in big tech, and this is the first real American strike at the problem. As Scott Galloway frequently notes in his podcast with tech journalist Kara Swisher, the big tech breakup has finally begun. Note that this is one of many areas where Trump inattention or inaction doesn't really matter. The feds aren't the only game in town, and attorney general from US states, as well as the EU and many other countries, are on the case - not to mention Congress critters. Over to Stoller: Normally, antitrust enforcement would come from the federal government, but Trump enforcers have proved irrelevant at best. Instead these investigations are being led by the states. The Republican attorney general of Texas and the Democratic attorney general of New York are informal leaders, meaning that the investigations are bipartisan. The state attorneys general complement an important investigation by the House antitrust subcommittee led by David Cicilline. Such leadership suggests the rule of law, absent from American business for several decades, may be on its way back. There are also important investigations, hearings or cases by enforcers in Germany, France, the European Union, Israel, India, Singapore, Russia, Mexico and Australia, among others. (I should mention Stoller here has a new book out, Goliath: The 100-Year War between Monopoly Power and Democracy[17],which I've purchased (from my friendly independent bookstore). It's next up in my to-read queue after I finish William Dalrymple's The Anarchy, The Relentless Rise of the East India Company[18]. I got sidetracked and polished off Matt Taibbi's Hate, Inc. after seeing John Siman's rave review, Manufacturing Fear and Loathing, Maximizing Corporate Profits! A Review of Matt Taibbi's Hate Inc.: Why Today's Media Makes Us Despise One Another[19]). From WSJ comments: Steve W. Bell This is a terrific piece of Journalistic work - just when I thought the WSJ no longer was capable of it, comes this which is a Pulitzer class expose'. It is fair and objective., and introduces strong evidence. A 4th Grader could easily discern that Google search results are sharply biased and shaped to suppress legitimate Conservative speech that Google doesn't like (that is, most all of it) from search results. Google took a dark turn, in my view, 2-3 years ago. I do not believe that their many great mid-level employees are the reason. They changed out the Sr. management team 3 years back. Now, two immense anti-trust investigations underway. Google has also turned sharply arrogant, e.g. on Jan 1st shifting all support calls - even from Agencies, to barely-trained staff in India. Breaking up Google into 2 or 3 regulated entities would be great for Google, it's employees AND consumers. Although they enjoy a dominant market position, Google is a commodity - EASILY replaced. To repeat what I said above, the political bias extends beyond downranking conservative sites, to obscuring the output of other sites that also may have something to say.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/11/blockbuster-wsj-investigation-how-google-interferes-with-its-search-algorithms-and-changes-your-results.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/11/blockbuster-wsj-investigation-how-google-interferes-with-its-search-algorithms-and-changes-your-results.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Banana republic[20], Guest Post[21], Politics[22], Regulations and regulators[23], Ridiculously obvious scams[24], Surveillance state[25] on November 17, 2019[26] by Jerri-Lynn Scofield[27].

But while its origin is shadowy, the technology that made it possible, which we now call blockchain, did not arise out the blue. Nakamoto combined established cryptography tools with methods derived from decades of computer science research to enable a public network of participants who don't necessarily trust each other to agree, over and over, that a shared accounting ledger reflects the truth. This makes it virtually impossible for someone to spend the same bitcoin twice, solving a problem that had hindered previous attempts to create digital cash. And, crucially, it eliminates the need for a central authority to mediate electronic exchange of the currency.</p><p>Bitcoin's popularity began to grow quickly in 2011, after a Gawker article exposed Silk Road, a Bitcoinpowered online drug marketplace. Imitators called \"altcoins\" began to emerge, often using Bitcoin's opensource code. Within two years, the total value of bitcoins in circulation had passed $1 billion.</p><p>Soon, technologists realized that blockchains could be used to track other things besides money. In 2013, 19-year-old Vitalik Buterin proposed Ethereum, which would record not only currency transactions but also the status of computer programs called smart contracts. Launched in 2015, Ethereum-and now a host of competitors and imitators-promises to make possible a new generation of applications that look and feel like today's web apps but are powered by decentralized cryptocurrency networks instead of a company's servers.</p><p>What is it for?</p><p>It's a new way of answering an old question: how can we create enough trust between one another to peacefully exchange something of value?</p><p>ENFORCEMENT</p><p>Early civilizations used threat of force as retribution for dealing in bad faith when engaging in trade.</p><p>INSTITUTIONS</p><p>The emergence of governments and banks provided organized, central authorities to which we could outsource trust-as long as we trusted them.</p><p>THE NETWORK</p><p>Blockchains distributed across thousands of computers can mechanize trust, opening the door to new ways of organizing \"decentralized\" enterprises and institutions.</p><p>1 A transaction is born</p><p>WHAT IS A TRANSACTION?</p><p>In Bitcoin, a transaction is the transfer of cryptocurrency from one person (Alice) to another (Bob). In Ethereum, which includes a built-in programming language that can be used to automate transactions, there are multiple kinds. Alice can send cryptocurrency to Bob. Or someone can create a transaction that places a line of code, called a smart contract, on the blockchain. Alice and Bob can then send money to an account this program controls, to trigger it to run if certain conditions encoded in the contract are met. A smart contract can also send transactions to the blockchain in which it is embedded.</p><p>2 The transaction is broadcast to a peer-to-peer network</p><p>VERIFYING TRANSACTIONS</p><p>Let's say Alice wants to send some money to Bob. To do so, Alice creates a transaction on her computer that must reference a past transaction on the blockchain in which she received sufficient funds, as well as her private key to the funds and Bob's address. That transaction is then sent out to other computers, or \"nodes,\" in the network. The nodes will validate the transaction as long as it has followed the appropriate rules. Then mining nodes (more on those in step 3) will accept it, and it will become part of a new block.</p><p>3 The race to create new blocks</p><p>MINERS COMPETE FOR CASH</p><p>A subset of nodes, called miners, organize valid transactions into lists called blocks. A block in progress contains a list of recent valid transactions and a cryptographic reference to the previous block. In blockchain systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, miners race to complete new blocks, a process that requires solving a labor-intensive mathematical puzzle, which is unique to each new block. The first miner to solve the puzzle will earn some cryptocurrency as a reward. The math puzzle involves randomly guessing at a number called a nonce. The nonce is combined with the other data in the block to create an encrypted digital fingerprint, called a hash.</p><p>4 Completing a new block</p><p>YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR IT</p><p>The hash must meet certain conditions; if it doesn't, the miner tries another random nonce and calculates the hash again. It takes an enormous number of tries to find a valid hash. This process deters hackers by making it hard to modify the ledger. While some blockchain entities use other systems to secure their chains, this approach, called proof of work, is the most thoroughly battle-tested.</p><p>5 Adding a new block to the chain</p><p>ANOTHER LINK IN THE CHAIN</p><p>This is the final step in securing the ledger. When a mining node becomes the first to solve a new block's crypto-puzzle, it sends the block to the rest of the network for approval, earning digital tokens in reward. Mining difficulty is encoded in the blockchain's protocol; Bitcoin and Ethereum are designed to make it increasingly hard to solve a block over time. Since each block also contains a reference to the previous one, the blocks are mathematically chained together. Tampering with an earlier block would require repeating the proof of work for all the subsequent blocks in the chain.</p><p>This tech is about way more than money.</p><p>A whole host of industries could- emphasis on the \"could\"-be revolutionized by blockchains.</p><p>ENERGY</p><p>* Why you should buy in: Energy trading is a byzantine process riddled with middlemen taking cuts (the name \"Enron\" may ring a bell). Making energy resources into digital assets that can be traded on a blockchain could open new investing and trading opportunities, letting little guys in. Like, really little: down to an individual apartment building that generates excess solar power, or an electric vehicle with battery storage capacity to spare. For larger companies, a blockchain could streamline trading and record-keeping. The result could involve whole new asset classes, like cryptotokens backed by oil or renewable resources.</p><p>* The fine print: Of late, the power grid has become a target for state-sponsored hackers. Securing all that transaction data will be a complicated cybersecurity challenge.</p><p>* Players: Power Ledger, Grid Singularity, Grid+, the Energy Web Foundation, the Enerchain project</p><p>INTERNET ADVERTISING &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA</p><p>* Why you should buy in: If you could easily control your personal data and decide whether the likes of Facebook, Google, and others get to exploit it for profit, you would, right? Put it on a blockchain, which will encrypt and store your data in a decentralized network, instead of on company-owned servers. You can surf the internet anonymously, manage your own sensitive and identifying data, and control which sites can access it. Ahhhh, the internet as it was meant to be.</p><p>* The fine print: Despite revelations that big tech companies are pulling all manner of shenanigans with user data, people have yet to #deletefacebook or abandon web services in large numbers. The vision of a decentralized web could be a tough sell.</p><p>* Players: Blockstack, Protocol Labs</p><p>FOOD &amp; AGRICULTURE</p><p>* Why you should buy in: How do you know if that meat you bought is really grass-fed, organic, and free of antibiotics and has never been anywhere near a cage or feedlot? You don't-unless a blockchain tells you so. Having a digital ledger that no one can mess with means everything from turkeys to chocolate to mangoes can be tracked literally from farm to table-or at least to the grocery store shelf. And if something does go wrong, a blockchain can cut the time it takes to track, and stop, the spread of a foodborne illness.</p><p>* The fine print: A few pilot projects have been tried, but that's it so far. A large-scale system would probably mean giving farmers, distributors, and others keys to access and modify the blockchain, and we'd have to trust that they wouldn't misuse them.</p><p>* Players: IBM, Walmart, Nestl\u00e9, Unilever, Cargill</p><p>MEDICINE</p><p>* Why you should buy in: Sharing x-rays, blood test results, and other intensely private medical data is no easy task, and there are piles of regulations, differing data formats, and other hurdles to contend with besides. A blockchain could provide a tamper-proof record of important events like prescription refills, while smart contracts could give patients precise control over who can access which parts of their medical record and when, without all the red tape.</p><p>* The fine print: Hospitals, clinics, doctor's offices, pharmacies, insurers ... the list of who may need access to your medical records is long. Who should be allowed to change the record? Who will run the computer network that runs the blockchain? How will the system be governed?</p><p>* Players: MIT's MedRec project, Massachusetts General Hospital, Kaiser Permanente, IBM, the Mediledger Project, SimplyVital Health</p><p>ELECTIONS</p><p>* Why you should buy in: The proliferation of electronic voting systems and the practice of keeping sensitive information like voter rolls in internetconnected databases translate to one thing: risk that an election could be compromised. Distributed ledgers could, in theory, make electronic voting as secure as any physical paper trail.</p><p>* The fine print: There are many more tough questions than easy answers. Will votes be recorded on a public blockchain like those used by Bitcoin or Ethereum? If so, how will ballots be kept anonymous? If it's done on a permissioned system, how do we make sure people don't misuse their access?</p><p>* Players: Agora, Voatz, Democracy Earth</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECRVW-2039125003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECRVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WX6-D921-DY0W-40NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381140</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Technology Review, Inc.

In Ethereum, which includes a built-in programming language that can be used to automate transactions, there are multiple kinds. Alice can send cryptocurrency to Bob. Or someone can create a transaction that places a line of code, called a smart contract, on the blockchain. Alice and Bob can then send money to an account this program controls, to trigger it to run if certain conditions encoded in the contract are met. A smart contract can also send transactions to the blockchain in which it is embedded.</p><p>2 The transaction is broadcast to a peer-to-peer network</p><p>VERIFYING TRANSACTIONS</p><p>Let's say Alice wants to send some money to Bob. To do so, Alice creates a transaction on her computer that must reference a past transaction on the blockchain in which she received sufficient funds, as well as her private key to the funds and Bob's address. That transaction is then sent out to other computers, or \"nodes,\" in the network. The nodes will validate the transaction as long as it has followed the appropriate rules. Then mining nodes (more on those in step 3) will accept it, and it will become part of a new block.</p><p>3 The race to create new blocks</p><p>MINERS COMPETE FOR CASH</p><p>A subset of nodes, called miners, organize valid transactions into lists called blocks. A block in progress contains a list of recent valid transactions and a cryptographic reference to the previous block. In blockchain systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, miners race to complete new blocks, a process that requires solving a labor-intensive mathematical puzzle, which is unique to each new block. The first miner to solve the puzzle will earn some cryptocurrency as a reward. The math puzzle involves randomly guessing at a number called a nonce. The nonce is combined with the other data in the block to create an encrypted digital fingerprint, called a hash.</p><p>4 Completing a new block</p><p>YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR IT</p><p>The hash must meet certain conditions; if it doesn't, the miner tries another random nonce and calculates the hash again. It takes an enormous number of tries to find a valid hash. This process deters hackers by making it hard to modify the ledger. While some blockchain entities use other systems to secure their chains, this approach, called proof of work, is the most thoroughly battle-tested.</p><p>5 Adding a new block to the chain</p><p>ANOTHER LINK IN THE CHAIN</p><p>This is the final step in securing the ledger. When a mining node becomes the first to solve a new block's crypto-puzzle, it sends the block to the rest of the network for approval, earning digital tokens in reward. Mining difficulty is encoded in the blockchain's protocol; Bitcoin and Ethereum are designed to make it increasingly hard to solve a block over time. Since each block also contains a reference to the previous one, the blocks are mathematically chained together. Tampering with an earlier block would require repeating the proof of work for all the subsequent blocks in the chain.</p><p>This tech is about way more than money.</p><p>A whole host of industries could- emphasis on the \"could\"-be revolutionized by blockchains.</p><p>ENERGY</p><p>* Why you should buy in: Energy trading is a byzantine process riddled with middlemen taking cuts (the name \"Enron\" may ring a bell). Making energy resources into digital assets that can be traded on a blockchain could open new investing and trading opportunities, letting little guys in. Like, really little: down to an individual apartment building that generates excess solar power, or an electric vehicle with battery storage capacity to spare. For larger companies, a blockchain could streamline trading and record-keeping. The result could involve whole new asset classes, like cryptotokens backed by oil or renewable resources.</p><p>* The fine print: Of late, the power grid has become a target for state-sponsored hackers. Securing all that transaction data will be a complicated cybersecurity challenge.</p><p>* Players: Power Ledger, Grid Singularity, Grid+, the Energy Web Foundation, the Enerchain project</p><p>INTERNET ADVERTISING &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA</p><p>* Why you should buy in: If you could easily control your personal data and decide whether the likes of Facebook, Google, and others get to exploit it for profit, you would, right? Put it on a blockchain, which will encrypt and store your data in a decentralized network, instead of on company-owned servers. You can surf the internet anonymously, manage your own sensitive and identifying data, and control which sites can access it. Ahhhh, the internet as it was meant to be.</p><p>* The fine print: Despite revelations that big tech companies are pulling all manner of shenanigans with user data, people have yet to #deletefacebook or abandon web services in large numbers. The vision of a decentralized web could be a tough sell.</p><p>* Players: Blockstack, Protocol Labs</p><p>FOOD &amp; AGRICULTURE</p><p>* Why you should buy in: How do you know if that meat you bought is really grass-fed, organic, and free of antibiotics and has never been anywhere near a cage or feedlot? You don't-unless a blockchain tells you so. Having a digital ledger that no one can mess with means everything from turkeys to chocolate to mangoes can be tracked literally from farm to table-or at least to the grocery store shelf. And if something does go wrong, a blockchain can cut the time it takes to track, and stop, the spread of a foodborne illness.</p><p>* The fine print: A few pilot projects have been tried, but that's it so far. A large-scale system would probably mean giving farmers, distributors, and others keys to access and modify the blockchain, and we'd have to trust that they wouldn't misuse them.</p><p>* Players: IBM, Walmart, Nestl\u00e9, Unilever, Cargill</p><p>MEDICINE</p><p>* Why you should buy in: Sharing x-rays, blood test results, and other intensely private medical data is no easy task, and there are piles of regulations, differing data formats, and other hurdles to contend with besides. A blockchain could provide a tamper-proof record of important events like prescription refills, while smart contracts could give patients precise control over who can access which parts of their medical record and when, without all the red tape.</p><p>* The fine print: Hospitals, clinics, doctor's offices, pharmacies, insurers ... the list of who may need access to your medical records is long. Who should be allowed to change the record? Who will run the computer network that runs the blockchain? How will the system be governed?</p><p>* Players: MIT's MedRec project, Massachusetts General Hospital, Kaiser Permanente, IBM, the Mediledger Project, SimplyVital Health</p><p>ELECTIONS</p><p>* Why you should buy in: The proliferation of electronic voting systems and the practice of keeping sensitive information like voter rolls in internetconnected databases translate to one thing: risk that an election could be compromised. Distributed ledgers could, in theory, make electronic voting as secure as any physical paper trail.</p><p>* The fine print: There are many more tough questions than easy answers. Will votes be recorded on a public blockchain like those used by Bitcoin or Ethereum? If so, how will ballots be kept anonymous? If it's done on a permissioned system, how do we make sure people don't misuse their access?</p><p>* Players: Agora, Voatz, Democracy Earth</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECRVW-2039125003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECRVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SC1-V3T1-DY0W-43T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381140</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Technology Review, Inc.

While some blockchain entities use other systems to secure their chains, this approach, called proof of work, is the most thoroughly battle-tested.</p><p>5 Adding a new block to the chain</p><p>ANOTHER LINK IN THE CHAIN</p><p>This is the final step in securing the ledger. When a mining node becomes the first to solve a new block's crypto-puzzle, it sends the block to the rest of the network for approval, earning digital tokens in reward. Mining difficulty is encoded in the blockchain's protocol; Bitcoin and Ethereum are designed to make it increasingly hard to solve a block over time. Since each block also contains a reference to the previous one, the blocks are mathematically chained together. Tampering with an earlier block would require repeating the proof of work for all the subsequent blocks in the chain.</p><p>This tech is about way more than money.</p><p>A whole host of industries could- emphasis on the \"could\"-be revolutionized by blockchains.</p><p>ENERGY</p><p>* Why you should buy in: Energy trading is a byzantine process riddled with middlemen taking cuts (the name \"Enron\" may ring a bell). Making energy resources into digital assets that can be traded on a blockchain could open new investing and trading opportunities, letting little guys in. Like, really little: down to an individual apartment building that generates excess solar power, or an electric vehicle with battery storage capacity to spare. For larger companies, a blockchain could streamline trading and record-keeping. The result could involve whole new asset classes, like cryptotokens backed by oil or renewable resources.</p><p>* The fine print: Of late, the power grid has become a target for state-sponsored hackers. Securing all that transaction data will be a complicated cybersecurity challenge.</p><p>* Players: Power Ledger, Grid Singularity, Grid+, the Energy Web Foundation, the Enerchain project</p><p>INTERNET ADVERTISING &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA</p><p>* Why you should buy in: If you could easily control your personal data and decide whether the likes of Facebook, Google, and others get to exploit it for profit, you would, right? Put it on a blockchain, which will encrypt and store your data in a decentralized network, instead of on company-owned servers. You can surf the internet anonymously, manage your own sensitive and identifying data, and control which sites can access it. Ahhhh, the internet as it was meant to be.</p><p>* The fine print: Despite revelations that big tech companies are pulling all manner of shenanigans with user data, people have yet to #deletefacebook or abandon web services in large numbers. The vision of a decentralized web could be a tough sell.</p><p>* Players: Blockstack, Protocol Labs</p><p>FOOD &amp; AGRICULTURE</p><p>* Why you should buy in: How do you know if that meat you bought is really grass-fed, organic, and free of antibiotics and has never been anywhere near a cage or feedlot? You don't-unless a blockchain tells you so. Having a digital ledger that no one can mess with means everything from turkeys to chocolate to mangoes can be tracked literally from farm to table-or at least to the grocery store shelf. And if something does go wrong, a blockchain can cut the time it takes to track, and stop, the spread of a foodborne illness.</p><p>* The fine print: A few pilot projects have been tried, but that's it so far. A large-scale system would probably mean giving farmers, distributors, and others keys to access and modify the blockchain, and we'd have to trust that they wouldn't misuse them.</p><p>* Players: IBM, Walmart, Nestl\u00e9, Unilever, Cargill</p><p>MEDICINE</p><p>* Why you should buy in: Sharing x-rays, blood test results, and other intensely private medical data is no easy task, and there are piles of regulations, differing data formats, and other hurdles to contend with besides. A blockchain could provide a tamper-proof record of important events like prescription refills, while smart contracts could give patients precise control over who can access which parts of their medical record and when, without all the red tape.</p><p>* The fine print: Hospitals, clinics, doctor's offices, pharmacies, insurers ... the list of who may need access to your medical records is long. Who should be allowed to change the record? Who will run the computer network that runs the blockchain? How will the system be governed?</p><p>* Players: MIT's MedRec project, Massachusetts General Hospital, Kaiser Permanente, IBM, the Mediledger Project, SimplyVital Health</p><p>ELECTIONS</p><p>* Why you should buy in: The proliferation of electronic voting systems and the practice of keeping sensitive information like voter rolls in internetconnected databases translate to one thing: risk that an election could be compromised. Distributed ledgers could, in theory, make electronic voting as secure as any physical paper trail.</p><p>* The fine print: There are many more tough questions than easy answers. Will votes be recorded on a public blockchain like those used by Bitcoin or Ethereum? If so, how will ballots be kept anonymous? If it's done on a permissioned system, how do we make sure people don't misuse their access?</p><p>* Players: Agora, Voatz, Democracy Earth</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECRVW-2039125003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECRVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKT-36Y1-DY0W-403V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381140</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Technology Review, Inc.

The anonymous online survey, conducted November 14 through December 1, reached 522 senior executives at organizations with $500 million or more in annual revenue. Of those, 214 individuals (39 percent) said they had little-to-no knowledge of blockchain technology. </p><p>But of the remaining 308 who identified themselves as blockchain-knowledgeable, a surprising 21 percent said they already have blockchain projects up and working (that's 12 percent of the original 522-person sample). And another 25 percent said they have projects planned for the coming year. Those figures are surprisingly high given how young blockchain technology is. And these aren't just small pilot investments we're talking about. Twenty-eight percent of the 308 blockchain-knowledgeable executives surveyed said their organizations have invested over $5 million; 10 percent have invested over $10 million. And 25 percent said they plan to invest over $5 million in blockchain tech over the next year. 'Fifty-five percent of those surveyed said their company would be at a competitive disadvantage if it failed to adopt the technology,' Deloitte reports. 'Forty-two percent believe it will disrupt their industry.' Given how high these numbers are, I queried Deloitte on how it had conducted the anonymous survey. 'Respondents were sourced from two specialized and highly reputable B2B online panels. Quality checks were implemented to identify and remove respondents who were suspect,' a spokesperson informed me. And when asked whether multiple execs from the same organization could have been captured in the survey, skewing the results, the spokesperson said, 'It is possible but highly unlikely given there were only 308 respondents, across specific titles, and thousands of companies that could have qualified.' We've seen other big moves on the blockchain front recently. IBM announced just a few days ago[1] that it was launching a developer ecosystem and a kind of app store around its own blockchain offering, launched in February. Intel is likewise heavily invested. Microsoft has a blockchain-as-a-service offering on its Azure cloud platform. And 100 or more big tech players and large public enterprises have come together to form the Hyperledger Project[2], which is developing standards and best practices for business blockchain use. Meanwhile, separate from the Hyperledger group, we're seeing numerous new independent blockchains emerge[3] each month to serve a wide range of purposes \u2014 from secure, transparent voting to registering what music tracks you own, to confirming real-estate transactions. So what do Deloitte's survey respondents plan to use blockchain tech for? '[They] have diverse views about blockchain's main advantage compared to conventional transactional technology,' Deloitte's announcement states. 'Over a third (36 percent) of respondents credit blockchain with the potential for improving systems operations, either by reducing costs or increasing speed (18 percent each). More than a third (37 percent) cite blockchain's superior security features as the main advantage of the technology. And almost a quarter (24 percent) of executives surveyed highlight the potential for blockchain to enable new business models and revenue streams.' 'This diversity may be a testament to the versatility of the technology,' said Deloitte managing director David Schatsky. 'But it is likely also a reflection of the fact that, despite the hype, the impact that blockchain will likely have on businesses in various industries is not yet fully understood.' The report indicates that consumer products and manufacturing are the 'most bullish' on blockchain. Forty-two percent of surveyed execs from consumer product/manufacturing companies said they planned to invest over $5 million in the year ahead. 'Technology, media, and telecoms execs follow at 27 percent, and financial services at 23 percent,' the report states. While 30 percent of respondents from the consumer product, tech, media, and telecom industries said they have already rolled out blockchain projects, that figure was only 12 percent among respondents in the financial services industry \u2014 another surprise, given that, when blockchain first emerged in the public eye a year or two ago, it was seen primarily as a tool for recording financial transactions. A number of the most active blockchain user organizations surveyed also reported they had filed patents related to the technology: 'Twenty-one percent of respondents stated that their organizations have filed for blockchain patents. [And in consumer products and manufacturing,] 38 percent of respondents say their company has filed patents.' Regulation around blockchain remains a key concern, though, Deloitte reports, with almost half of respondents saying that the government's response to this technology \u2014 whether, for example, a blockchain-based smart contract will be considered legally binding in court \u2014 will be a major deciding factor on how widespread blockchain use becomes.

Finovate acknowledges the potential and opportunity for Dubai to lead the region in innovation and Fintech.\"</p><p>With Expo 2020 Dubai preparations in full swing, the growth curve is inevitable. Blockchain implementations in financial services remains a leader in fintech predictions and will see the institutional adoption of crypto currency or digital assets to facilitate social necessities and financial inclusion requirements. Also more partnerships in fintech between startups, as well as mergers and acquisitions between fintechs will create a distinctive player. The big tech collaboration with fintech will beat the banks at the consumer game.</p><p>The key findings of Al Mazrouei's panel was that fintech collaboration with financial institutions creates bigger opportunities for impact; and that banks are changing, adapting and understanding what is happening in financial innovations. \"Collaboration saves time for all parties; when planned properly it is usually very successful and partnering with acceleration programmes increases credibility for the banks and enables fast track to proof of concepts,\" added Al Mazrouei.</p><p>Serhat Yildirim, chief digital officer, ADIB, said: \"Fintech Hive at DIFC has played a key role in promoting the development of Fintech ecosystem in the UAE and ADIB is proud to be part of this journey. For events like Finnovate to take place in the Dubai, reaffirms the role of the UAE not just as a leading centre for financial services but also for Fintech and innovation. Fintechs and incumbent banks can enter into a symbiotic relationship whereby banks can leverage cutting edge and innovative solutions and offer Fintechs the opportunity to test their solutions at scale. The result of this partnership ultimately benefits the end customer and helps contribute to the creation of a vibrant and diverse financial services environment. ADIB looks forward to exploring partnership opportunities with Fintechs to help deliver its goal of making banking simple, friendly and convenient for customers.\"</p><p>Fintechs are now firmly established as a key part of the financial services and digital ecosystem not just in the region but also globally. The rapid pace of innovation and customer expectations means that complacency is not an option. Partnerships and co-creation between Fintechs and Incumbents will become more and more essential.</p><p>It may be recalled that the Dubai Future Council for Blockchain launched the Dubai Blockchain Policy at ninth Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona, which also concluded on Thursday. \"Blockchain is undoubtedly one of the most prominent and promising of these breakthrough technologies. With that in mind, the Dubai Future Council for Blockchain sought to develop a policy to support government entities and private companies to implement the technology and form value-creating blockchain networks,\" said Dr Aisha bint Butti bin Bishr, who chairs Dubai Future Council for Blockchain.</p><p>The launch of the Dubai Blockchain Policy complements Smart Dubai's efforts to implement the Dubai Blockchain Strategy, which was launched in 2016. The strategy seeks to make the Dubai Government the first in the world to conduct 100 per cent of applicable transactions via blockchain by 2020.</p><p>Blockchain adoption has increased significantly in the UAE this past year. The UAE Government is championing the adoption of blockchain across the country, as can be seen by the Emirates Blockchain Strategy 2021, which aims to put 50 per cent of government transactions on the blockchain by 2021. Several banks in the UAE are also embracing blockchain adoption such as Emirates NBD, Al Hilal Bank, ADCB and Mashreq Bank. Some of the top global brand such as Emirates airline, Emaar, Etihad Airline and Adnoc are beginning to adopt blockchain.</p><p>Saeed Al Darmaki, managing director of Alphabit and Novelty Curve, said: \"All sectors falling under the financial services industry will benefit the most from blockchain, as the technology has already proven to enable numerous cost, time and resource efficiencies. Such sectors include banking, remittances, payments and transaction settlement. Blockchain is also one of the primary technologies driving Fintech.\"</p><p>Blockchain adoption will continue to grow throughout the course of 2020 in the sectors of infrastructure, as well as an increase in awareness of the technology through education and a growth in the ecosystem. \"The most significant growth for blockchain use in digitising/tokenising assets such as real estate and bonds, which are assets that are currently illiquid and complex in nature. Finally, I expect that we will see the release of onshore regulation for blockchain and crypto assets and foresee regulation to be finalised by the end of 2020. I believe that this onshore regulation will be instrumental in ensuring the UAE maintains a leading global position in blockchain technology,\" added Al Darmaki. - <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sandhya@khaleejtimes.com\">sandhya@khaleejtimes.com</email></p><p><br/>Sandhya D'Mello Journalist.
