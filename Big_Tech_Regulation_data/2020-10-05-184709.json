You see, Elon Musk told the world he'd have a million fully autonomous robotaxis by the end of 2020, and we wanted to see how many he's managed to produce so far.</p><p><br/>Let's count together. One, two, three, zero: He's developed exactly zero production model robo-taxis. We know this because \"zero\" is exactly how many fully-autonomous production cars there are in the world.<br/>\u00a0This bodes well for world-renowned AI experts Rodney Brooks and Kai Fu Lee. They took to Twitter right after Musk made prediction to challenge the timeline.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Brooks tweeted, \"Let's count how many truly autonomous (no human safety driver) Tesla taxis (public chooses destination &amp; pays) on regular streets (unrestricted human driven cars on the same streets) on December 31, 2020. It will not be a million. My prediction: zero. Count &amp; retweet this then.\"<br/>His assertion was taken up by Lee, who responded with \"If there are a million Tesla robo-taxis functioning on the road in 2020, I will eat them. Perhaps Rodney Brooks will eat half with me?\"<br/>And the bet was sealed with Brook's response: \"Hi Kai-Fu, absolutely. I will share the feast with you. If there are a million Tesla robo-taxis on the road next year we will eat them all together! And while I am normally worried about indigestion I think the conditional in this challenge will mean that both will be fine!!\"<br/>Since a deal's a deal, we wanted to make sure we had it in the record - no take-backs now!<br/>If you're unfamiliar with the intimate machinations of the AI community, it's likely you're more familiar with Musk than Lee or Brooks. But, the divide between the two camps doesn't come at the expense of one or the other's expertise. In this case, all parties are correct (some just more so than others).<br/>Musk's assertion is that robo-taxis are imminent, and most experts agree. Just not in the timeline he's given.\u00a0He envisions a world where, by the year 2021, you come home from work, your Tesla drops you off, and then it goes out and makes more money for you on its own. It's the ultimate turn-key business (you need a car anyway right?). The \"end of 2020\" seemed like a pretty good near-future term to set in early 2019, so here we are.<br/>Unfortunately for Musk, AI technology isn't up to snuff yet. There are dozens of companies from Waymo to Uber that claim to have autonomous vehicle technology, but all of it gets an asterisk. To be clear: to date, there is no autonomous vehicle capable of operating on any street, without a safety driver, without external connectivity to the cloud or other networks, in any weather, and with pedestrians and human-driven vehicles in traffic. This isn't just an AI problem, it'll take a suite of services and infrastructure (not to mention policy and regulation) to pull off truly-autonomous vehicles.<br/>Cars that drive themselves as well as humans don't exist yet, and we could be a decade or more away from them. The good news is that there are numerous AI technologies in use, such as Tesla's poorly-named Autopilot, that work as driver-assistance features enabling near-autonomous transportation.<br/>Companies across the globe are engaged in efforts to build infrastructure - such as smart roads and autonomous traffic lights - that will ease the transition from driver assistance to driverless AI. And, clearly, big tech is pouring tens of billions of dollars in R&amp;D to produce cutting-edge vehicle technology. Eventually, the dam will break and the combination of AI technology and civil engineering will lead to robo-taxis that make our cities safer for everyone.<br/>But, barring the kind of technological breakthroughs that science fiction writers usually just give up and attribute to aliens, we're probably not within 12 months of fielding a single fully-autonomous robo-taxi, much less a million.<br/>That's not to say various companies won't demonstrate them this year, the hype cycle alone demands that Tesla, Waymo, Apple, and other companies knee-deep in the hoopla have at least some product to show for\u00a0their investment and work. But that product, like a lot of early tech gadgets (looking at you Hololens) will almost certainly fail to deliver on its target. We'll see a lot of cars advertised as having \"fully-autonomous capabilities,\" but you're unlikely to see any driving unconstrained on regular roads without a safety driver in 2020.<br/>On the other hand, Musk also has more inroads with the US government than most big tech companies. He's working closely with the Trump administration through his SpaceX company, as NASA attempts to privatize more and more of its taxpayer funded duties. And he's got friends in Conservative places as his former pal, from Pay Pal, Peter Thiel's managed to become the belle of ICE's ball. If anyone can convince the federal government to step in slash regulations on behalf of a dangerous pipe dream, it's Elon Musk.<br/>At least for now. The 2020 elections may make things harder for AI companies in the US hoping to avoid safety regulations. If a Democrat replaces Donald Trump as president, it's likely we'll see AI regulated for public safety. Letting the same technology that powers Autopilot (into the backs of police cars, the sides of semi trucks, and the backs of more police cars) loose on city streets without human safety drivers seems like a bad idea, but Conservative lobbyists have a way of keeping government regulations from interfering with company bottom lines.<br/>All Musk has to do is hope Democrats don't regulate AI, invent an AI capable of doing things no other system currently can, produce or retrofit a million Teslas, and deploy them on roads that currently don't have a regulatory structure for governing their operation. All in the next 12 months. Sending people to Mars might be easier.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-432726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSS-FR81-DYDW-70H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"974\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 20, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzlBQTcxNUI4NTU0NDdGQkE4MjE1NTA0QjU1RTVDNjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjY1RENBNzc2NUE5NDgzOEI1MDEwMDVFMjI4QjFDMDQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N336100CC</classCode><className>AUTOMOTIVE MFG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DEB2</classCode><className>ELON MUSK</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

You see, Elon Musk told the world he'd have a million fully autonomous robotaxis[1] by the end of 2020, and we wanted to see how many he's managed to produce so far. Let's count together. One, two, three, zero: He's developed exactly zero production model robo-taxis. We know this because 'zero' is exactly how many fully-autonomous production cars there are in the world. This bodes well for world-renowned AI experts Rodney Brooks and Kai Fu Lee. They took to Twitter right after Musk made prediction to challenge the timeline.If there are a million Tesla robo-taxis functioning on the road in 2020, I will eat them. Perhaps @rodneyabrooks[2] will eat half with me? </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/NEVnU4Jjgy\">https://t.co/NEVnU4Jjgy</url>[3] \u2014 Kai-Fu Lee (@kaifulee) May 8, 2019[4] Brooks tweeted, 'Let's count how many truly autonomous (no human safety driver) Tesla taxis (public chooses destination ...ys) on regular streets (unrestricted human driven cars on the same streets) on December 31, 2020. It will not be a million. My prediction: zero. Count ...tweet this then.' His assertion was taken up by Lee, who responded with 'If there are a million Tesla robo-taxis functioning on the road in 2020, I will eat them. Perhaps Rodney Brooks will eat half with me?' And the bet was sealed with Brook's response: 'Hi Kai-Fu, absolutely. I will share the feast with you. If there are a million Tesla robo-taxis on the road next year we will eat them all together! And while I am normally worried about indigestion I think the conditional in this challenge will mean that both will be fine!!' Since a deal's a deal, we wanted to make sure we had it in the record - no take-backs now! If you're unfamiliar with the intimate machinations of the AI community, it's likely you're more familiar with Musk than Lee or Brooks. But, the divide between the two camps doesn't come at the expense of one or the other's expertise. In this case, all parties are correct (some just more so than others). Musk's assertion is that robo-taxis are imminent, and most experts agree. Just not in the timeline he's given.He envisions a world where, by the year 2021, you come home from work, your Tesla drops you off, and then it goes out and makes more money for you on its own. It's the ultimate turn-key business (you need a car anyway right?). The 'end of 2020' seemed like a pretty good near-future term to set in early 2019, so here we are. Unfortunately for Musk, AI technology isn't up to snuff yet. There are dozens of companies from Waymo to Uber that claim to have autonomous vehicle technology, but all of it gets an asterisk. To be clear: to date, there is no autonomous vehicle capable of operating on any street, without a safety driver, without external connectivity to the cloud or other networks, in any weather, and with pedestrians and human-driven vehicles in traffic. This isn't just an AI problem, it'll take a suite of services and infrastructure (not to mention policy and regulation) to pull off truly-autonomous vehicles. Cars that drive themselves as well as humans don't exist yet, and we could be a decade or more[5] away from them. The good news is that there are numerous AI technologies in use, such as Tesla's poorly-named Autopilot, that work as driver-assistance features enabling near-autonomous transportation. Companies across the globe are engaged in efforts to build infrastructure - such as smart roads[6] and autonomous traffic lights[7] - that will ease the transition from driver assistance to driverless AI. And, clearly, big tech is pouring tens of billions of dollars in R...o produce cutting-edge vehicle technology. Eventually, the dam will break and the combination of AI technology and civil engineering will lead to robo-taxis that make our cities safer for everyone. But, barring the kind of technological breakthroughs that science fiction writers usually just give up and attribute to aliens, we're probably not within 12 months of fielding a single fully-autonomous robo-taxi, much less a million. That's not to say various companies won't demonstrate them this year, the hype cycle alone demands that Tesla, Waymo, Apple, and other companies knee-deep in the hoopla have at least some product to show fortheir investment and work. But that product, like a lot of early tech gadgets (looking at you Hololens) will almost certainly fail to deliver on its target. We'll see a lot of cars advertised as having 'fully-autonomous capabilities,' but you're unlikely to see any driving unconstrained on regular roads without a safety driver in 2020. On the other hand, Musk also has more inroads with the US government than most big tech companies. He's working closely with the Trump administration through his SpaceX company, as NASA attempts to privatize[8] more and more of its taxpayer funded duties. And he's got friends in Conservative places as his former pal, from Pay Pal, Peter Thiel's managed to become the belle of ICE's ball[9]. If anyone can convince the federal government to step in slash regulations on behalf of a dangerous pipe dream, it's Elon Musk. At least for now. The 2020 elections may make things harder for AI companies in the US hoping to avoid safety regulations. If a Democrat replaces Donald Trump as president, it's likely we'll see AI regulated for public safety. Letting the same technology that powers Autopilot (into the backs of police cars[10], the sides of semi trucks[11], and the backs of more police cars[12]) loose on city streets without human safety drivers seems like a bad idea, but Conservative lobbyists have a way[13] of keeping government regulations from interfering with company bottom lines. All Musk has to do is hope Democrats don't regulate AI, invent an AI capable of doing things no other system currently can, produce or retrofit a million Teslas, and deploy them on roads that currently don't have a regulatory structure for governing their operation. All in the next 12 months. Sending people to Mars might be easier. We think it's safe to say Lee and Brooks won't be eating any cars. And, if we're wrong, we'll put our Teslas where our mouth is:If @Tesla[14] releases a fully autonomous car, I'll join @kaifulee[15] and @rodneyabrooks[16] and eat it. Bumper to bumper. With @CholulaHotSauce[17]. \u2014 Tristan Greene (@mrgreene1977) October 24, 2019[18] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url

The often-intense debates about these policies aren't just important because they could reshape the U.S. economy. They also reflect a larger, more fundamental disagreement about capitalism itself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., believe that the American system of extractive capitalism is fundamentally broken - Sanders to the point of identifying as a democratic socialist - and see its failure as one of the forces that carried President Donald Trump to the White House. Former Vice President Joe Biden voices an opposing view: At an October fundraiser in Silicon Valley, he characterized Trump not as a product of American capitalism but rather a threat to it. \"You don't need some radical, radical socialist kind of answer to any of this - you've just got to make capitalism work like it's supposed to work,\" he said. \"We've got to save capitalism from this guy.\"</p><p> Last week, as part of the Munk Debates series in Toronto, I had the opportunity to debate capitalism and the potential alternatives to it alongside Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis, former American Enterprise Institute president (and current Washington Post contributor) Arthur C. Brooks and New York Times columnist David Brooks. I argued that the American system is broken in three ways.</p><p> First, it is fueling extreme inequality. Four decades of stagnant wages and upward flows of wealth in the United States have supercharged the existing wealth divide and other inequalities rooted in racial, gender and geographic differences. Productivity gains have flowed to the investor class, not to workers, and social mobility has declined. In his latest column (prepared for the debate), David Brooks countered that \"capitalism has brought about the greatest reduction of poverty in human history.\" But Oxfam International highlights a more nuanced reality: While there has been a meaningful decline in extreme poverty, hundreds of millions more people could have been lifted out of poverty if not for extreme inequalities within and across countries.</p><p> Second, capitalism is undermining democracy. In the Citizens United era, the amount of money in politics has exploded, resulting in elected officials from both parties who are more beholden to wealthy donors - and their business interests - than ever before. Corporate concentration is reducing competition and rendering both workers and consumers increasingly powerless against rising plutocracy. And this is happening as the forces of private equity and big tech conspire to annihilate the local and independent journalism that is vital to maintaining a democratic society.</p><p> It doesn't take a socialist to see capitalism's corrosive impact on democracy. In fact, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a former McKinsey consultant who was forced on Monday to finally agree to disclose his campaign bundlers, used to recognize it earlier in the campaign, saying, \"There's tension between capitalism and democracy, and negotiating that tension is probably the biggest challenge for America right now.\"</p><p> And, third, capitalism is destroying nature. As corporate lobbyists work to dismantle the regulatory apparatus, the companies they represent are irrevocably harming our environment, our health and our collective future. In pursuit of profits at any cost, corporations continue to ravage public lands, demolishing ecosystems, and poisoning the water we drink and the air we breathe. Meanwhile, even as corporate America has become more vocal about the importance of sustainability and the perils of climate change, it has opposed the dramatic policy changes needed to prevent catastrophe.</p><p> American politics is finally having a long-overdue debate about how to respond to these trends. Many of the ideas being discussed in the presidential race are undoubtedly part of the solution. But tweaking around the economy's edges won't be enough. We need a deep, structural redesign of basic institutions and functions; we need a new system to better serve the common good.</p><p> In this system, there will continue to be individual freedoms, private enterprises and small businesses. But, unlike today, those businesses will be protected from monopoly power. There will be new models of corporate ownership and governance that protect workers' rights and increase their power. There will be limits on excessive consumption. And there will be a \"plutocracy prevention\" program - not to be punitive, but to ensure that billionaires pay more in taxes than teachers and nurses, and that we have the revenue needed to rebuild decaying infrastructure, combat climate change, reverse declining social mobility and more.</p><p> Brooks writes that one of capitalism's strengths is \"creating a learning process to help people figure stuff out.\" On that we agree. But I've learned over four decades of observing and writing about the economy that capitalism as we've known it doesn't work. Time is of the essence. For the sake of our economic, democratic and ecological survival, it's time for something better.</p><p> Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor and publisher of the Nation magazine, writes a weekly column for The Washington Post.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Dec. 5.

There are a number of uncertainties businesses in the U.S. are facing right now. Everyone\u2019s simultaneously dealing with a global pandemic, a recession, a volatile political climate ahead of a national election and the next civil rights movement.    As chaotic as all of that is, nothing has interfered with the progress of two evolving data privacy regulations designed to protect the privacy of consumer information. Enforcement of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect at the start of the year, officially started July 1 . Meanwhile, the latest provision of the New York SHIELD Act took effect this past spring.      Many companies may be tempted to ignore these laws under the assumption that they won\u2019t be applicable to them or that regulators wouldn\u2019t bother paying attention to them because they aren\u2019t a big tech company. But businesses across the country would be well advised to fully comply with those new rules for several reasons. First, the size of these two coastal states makes it likely that they\u2019re in scope. While the regulations apply only to companies holding data of residents from those respective states, the sheer number of potential customers in those states (combined) is nearly 18% of the country\u2019s total population.     Much has been written about the CCPA, which gives consumers the right to know what data a company has about them, whom it\u2019s shared with and the ability to delete or opt out of the sale of their data. But the SHIELD Act (Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security) is less well known but just as impactful. The biggest difference between them is that CCPA is a data privacy law while the SHIELD Act is a security regulation.     The SHIELD Act is technically an amendment to the state\u2019s data breach disclosure law. The legislation \u201cexpands the definition of a breach to include any unauthorized access to private and/or personal information\u201d and broadens the very definition of what is considered \u201cprivate information.\u201d It\u2019s also the first regulation in the country to codify security practices.    Under CCPA, consumers can sue for a data breach and violators face penalties of up to $7,500 per intentional violation. The SHIELD Act does not provide a right to sue, but the state Attorney General can bring a civil action and seek up to $250,000 in damages. There have already been more than a dozen class-action lawsuits filed under the CCPA, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).    I recently interviewed New York Senator Kevin Thomas , who sponsored the SHIELD Act, on the BigIDeas on the Go podcast. Thomas pointed out that one of the most prominent aspects of the SHIELD Act is that it broadens the definition of \u201cprivate information\u201d and the types of data that are considered identifiable personal information.     Security Measures And Data Definitions    The SHIELD Act expands the situations that necessitate disclosure and offers prescriptive security measures that can reduce penalties in the event of a breach. Many states only require disclosure to customers if data was actually stolen in a breach, but this requires businesses to disclose even if the data was only accessed but not necessarily stolen.    It also requires companies to use \u201creasonable\u201d safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of the information. It doesn\u2019t specify what those measures should be but provides some examples of best practices. Measures include conducting security risk assessments, training employees on security practices, detecting, preventing and responding to intrusions and attacks, and deleting data when no longer needed.     While the SHIELD Act forces companies to strengthen their security posture, it also requires them to change the way they manage and identify data. Specifically, it significantly expands the definition of what is considered \u201cprivate information\u201d \u2014 a subset of \u201cpersonal information\u201d \u2014 to include: biometric information, account numbers and credit or debit card numbers, and user credentials. It further expands the type of data that\u2019s covered to combinations: a username may be seemingly benign data on its own, but when combined with a password or security code? It\u2019s now considered private information under the SHIELD Act.    So, what does this mean for the data that companies process and manage? To comply with the SHIELD Act, companies first need to be able to identify the different types of data that constitute \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cprivate\u201d information and determine whether that information is tied to a New York state resident. Companies in scope are served best when they can automate their knowledge and processes around this data \u2014 by creating a data inventory of relevant data, classifying personal identifiers and identifying broader personal data points, establishing how to correlate related data to an individual and determining residency. This will enable them to better manage and protect personal and private information while also establishing a more streamlined approach to the breach notification process in the event of an incident.     Thankfully, there is a silver lining. Companies that meet the provisions of both the California and New York laws will have advantages as the regulatory landscape evolves going forward. CCPA is a strong model for handling user data rights and requests, and the SHIELD Act can serve as the north star for security practices. Achieving compliance with those rules will make companies that much more prepared for data regulations that may be enacted in other states and even the federal government.    For instance, this will eliminate a lot of the heavy lifting businesses will face in order to comply with potential future data protection and privacy laws, such as the NY Privacy Act , which is in limbo; the CA Privacy Rights Act ( CPRA ), which would amend the CCPA if voters approve it in the California general election in November; any one of several coronavirus-related privacy measures that have been introduced in Congress; and a federal U.S. privacy law akin to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Last year the S&amp;P 500 recorded its first perfect calendar year of monthly total returns. But the bull run has failed to soothe one of the biggest and most intractable conundrums on Wall Street: the dearth of companies going public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last year was a respectable one in the US for initial public offerings. According to Dealogic, 189 companies floated on the US sharemarket and raised nearly $US50 billion, almost twice the amount in 2016, a particularly poor year. Last year's showing has provided hope but concerns remain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the 1980s, the US averaged more than 200 IPOs a year, and during the dotcom boom - when the focus was on going public quickly on a prospectus of ideas and enthusiasm rather than a record of success - US markets saw 547 listings in 1999 and 439 in 2000. Now companies seem to delay going public indefinitely rather than listing too soon.</p><p>This is particularly stark in the technology sector, which has powered the US sharemarket's ebullient run. Snap, the owner of the Snapchat photo-sharing app, proved to be the only major tech listing of the year, raising questions about whether some of the large, well-known names of the gig economy, such as Uber and Airbnb, will ever list.</p><p>Bankers once talked about unicorns: companies whose valuations exceeded $US1 billion ($1.25 billion) through private funding rounds with venture capital firms. Now they have had to invent the term \"decacorns\" for businesses whose private valuations exceed $US10 billion. But the fact that IPO activity is essentially average when markets are so welcoming indicates there are factors at work beyond investor sentiment about stocks. \"If you cannot go public with Nasdaq at 7000 for a tech company, I don't know when you can,\" says Deepak Kamra, a partner at Canaan, a venture capital firm.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons to want to avoid the frenzy of the dotcom bubble, when more than two-thirds of all tech IPOs went bust within five years of listing, according to research from University of Florida business professor Jay Ritter. Yet the downward trend in the number of IPOs is raising concerns about both the appeal of America's public markets and the way that the benefits from the new technology boom are being distributed.</p><p>Although tech companies get the most attention, the issue is not confined to that sector. The broad pool of US listed companies is in long-term decline. After peaking at nearly 7500 in 1997, the number of public companies fell to about 3600 at the end of 2017, the lowest level since the early 1970s, according to Wilshire Associates, which compiles a benchmark for the US sharemarkets.</p><p>Exchanges, investors, regulators, business groups and politicians have all expressed worries that the ability to take stakes in young and potentially exciting companies is being disproportionately enjoyed by small groups of insiders and elite investors rather than the wider investing public. Some fear that a less vibrant IPO market will sap the US economy of some of its vim.</p><p>\"The importance of IPOs to the US economy cannot be overstated,\" Michael Piwowar, a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a speech last year. \"A robust IPO market encourages entrepreneurship, facilitates growth, creates jobs, and fosters innovation, while providing attractive opportunities for investors to increase their wealth and mitigate risk.\"</p><p>The SEC, under new chairman Jay Clayton, a lawyer who worked on Alibaba's $US25 billion US listing in 2014, has made solving the listings decline a priority.</p><p>\"It's about improving investor opportunities,\" Clayton told a recent meeting of Sifma, the main US securities industry group. \"A broader portfolio of public companies is important to retail investors. A broader portfolio, and [one] more exposed to the growth stage, that would be better. If you continue to shrink that pool, you are going to shrink their opportunities.\"</p><p>The shrinking pool of US listings is blamed on a series of factors. For some, the self-image of the founders as tech visionaries intent on changing the world clashes with the short-term demands of investors in public markets.</p><p>The experience of Snap, which was the largest US tech deal since Facebook in 2012, resonates. Out of the gate the stock rallied sharply, but less than a year on, shares are trading nearly 20 per cent below the offer price of $17 as competition from Facebook has proved intense and early results failed to meet expectations.</p><p>The attraction is further lessened by time-consuming and expensive regulatory requirements, say some market participants and pro-business groups. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 was meant to ease the path for small companies by loosening securities regulation and there are calls for further reforms.</p><p>The same act removed one of the main reasons for companies to bring forward their IPOs - the rule that forced them to publish financial information once they had more than 500 shareholders. Spared that requirement, which helped trigger both the Google and Facebook IPOs, the latest batch of tech stars has been freer to stay private longer.</p><p>For smaller companies - another area where the decline in listings is marked - the regulatory burdens of being public can be onerous. About 60 per cent of all IPOs in the 1980s raised less than $US30 million, but by the 1990s this proportion has shrunk to about 30 per cent, according to the SEC. Since the turn of the millennium small IPOs have accounted for only 10 per cent of the total.</p><p>\"I don't think people are choosing to go public or not based on [regulatory costs]. But if you are a small company, a few million dollars a year in compliance costs does impact the bottom line,\" says Adam Smith, head of capital markets at KKR, the private equity firm.</p><p>It reflects the reality that the entire market ecosystem has become less hospitable to small IPOs. In other words, if a company valued at $US10 million is going public and an individual fund would only buy a maximum of 10 per cent, the work required to invest at most $US1 million wouldn't be worth it for most multibillion-dollar mutual investment funds.</p><p>Smaller companies also tend to trade less often, and their chances of being followed by analysts, who mostly focus on companies that can offer lucrative advisory work for their investment bank, have receded over the years.</p><p>Prof Ritter sees mergers and acquisitions as the defining factor. He notes that between 1990 and 1998, 50 per cent of the sales of successful venture-backed companies were via M&amp;A - typically to a larger company in the same industry - while the other half were IPOs. By 2001-17 M&amp;A's share jumped to about 90 per cent.</p><p>The most often cited reason for the drop in tech deals is that the increasing availability of private capital has allowed companies to stay private for much longer than in the past. Once the sole domain of venture capital funds, the private market now includes hedge funds, mutual funds like T Rowe Price and Fidelity, sovereign wealth funds and family offices - all of whom have flooded the market with cash.</p><p>The lure, says a banker at a large US bank, \"is a bit like when you go to a club on a Saturday night. You not only want to get behind the velvet rope, but get into the VIP lounge. People want to have access to unique ideas to generate alpha [returns above the average] versus seeing the ideas that everyone else is seeing.\"</p><p>The phenomenal growth in this type of investing occurred in the aftermath of the financial crisis when central banks were intent on keeping interest rates at historic lows. The monetary policy designed to stimulate the economy has also driven investors of all stripes into riskier assets.</p><p>\"Rates are low and everyone is in search of yield,\" says Pat Grady, a partner at Sequoia, a venture capital firm. \"When you cannot find yield, you look for growth and growth exists in technology and change.\"</p><p>A decisive move by central banks to dial back stimulus could be a catalyst for the pendulum on private versus public funding to start swinging back. \"If and when central banks tighten the money supply, and the availability, cost or terms of capital in the private market deteriorates and volatility increases, that may push more private companies to the public markets,\" says Paul Donahue, head of equity capital markets Americas at Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Bankers argue that most entrepreneurs, even headstrong technologists, ultimately want to run public companies - or will have to.</p><p>David Ludwig, head of Americas equity capital markets for Goldman Sachs, predicts that the US will see a \"significant\" number of big tech IPOs. \"While the private markets have allowed these innovative companies to grow into leaders without going public until later in their life cycles, we expect the vast majority will be public at some point in the next few years.\"</p><p>Smith of KKR points out that his firm helped to list six companies last year, and thinks fear over the death of the American IPO is overwrought. \"People have been staying private for longer, not forever, and that's an important distinction,\" he says.</p><p>The dynamics of the funding markets may have changed, but the benefits of public ownership have not, many argue. It is a way for early backers, executives and employees to cash out holdings, it provides a currency for M&amp;A deals and a certain level of legitimacy and scrutiny.</p><p>\"Would Uber have been a better company today had it been public? There are a lot of conversations going on at the board level about the difference between serving a couple of folks at the top or a broader shareholder base,\" says one banker who requested anonymity. \"Bigger companies see the public markets as a better governor.\"</p><p>In one sign that sentiment in Silicon Valley is turning, Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's new CEO, said in September that he hoped to take the company public within the next three years.</p><p>Spotify, the Stockholm-based music streaming service, aims to list on the New York Stock Exchange by the end of the first half of the year, in an unconventional \"direct listing\" where shares can trade without the formal IPO process.</p><p>Excitement, too, is building about large Chinese tech companies coming to the public markets, although it is unclear whether these companies will list in the US.</p><p>In the meantime, some executives on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley suggest that the trend of companies staying private longer is a good thing. They contrast the current era with the dotcom bubble when IPOs were viewed more as branding events and ways to cash out quickly.</p><p>The downside for investors in public markets, however, is that they will sometimes be buying into businesses that have already seen explosive growth in revenues and valuations. And with companies having reached high valuations in private deals, those levels are hard to match or exceed in the public markets.</p><p>Private markets have allowed these innovative companies to grow into leaders without going public.

Whether it is Steve Bannon bashing Pope Francis, Matteo Salvini attacking the \"do-gooders\" in humanitarian NGOs or Marine Le Pen venting against the dull technocrats in Brussels, the populists go after a predictable, well-calculated set of targets. If anyone chooses their enemies well, it's them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there's one issue on which there's no agreement between American rightwing populists and their peers in the rest of the world: what to make of Silicon Valley. On the one hand, its services and platforms have been a boon to the populists everywhere, greatly boosting their audience numbers and allowing them to target potential voters with highly personalized messages; the Cambridge Analytica fiasco has made it quite clear. Today, upstart and new rightwing parties like Spain's Vox instinctively understand the primacy of digital battles; Vox already <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2018/12/12/actualidad/1544624671_005462.html\">leads</url> all other Spanish parties in terms of Instagram followers.</p><p>Steve Bannon called people leading 'evil' Silicon Valley 'complete narcissists' and 'sociopaths'</p><p>This pragmatic embrace of digital platforms is where the populist consensus ends; the intellectual evaluation of Silicon Valley's significance is rather cacophonous. The American wing of the movement sees big tech as an attractive target of attack; for them, Silicon Valley is a bizarre mix of greedy capitalists and \"cultural Marxists\", keen on indoctrinating their users into leftwing ideas while getting filthy rich off everyone's data. Populists in the rest of the world, in contrast, see Silicon Valley's platforms as their best chance of escaping the intellectual hegemony of their own domestic \"cultural Marxists\", firmly ensconced in elite institutions, such as the media, the academia, and the Deep State.</p><p>In an August 2018 <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2018/12/12/actualidad/1544624671_005462.html\">interview</url> with CNN, Steve Bannon called people leading \"evil\" Silicon Valley \"complete narcissists\" and \"sociopaths\"; the data grabbed by their companies, he insisted, should be \"put in a public trust\". He also predicted that big tech would be one of the main themes of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>Given that the anger towards Silicon Valley is also growing on the left - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the latest sensation of American leftist politics, memorably <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2018/12/12/actualidad/1544624671_005462.html\">attacked</url>New York City's $3bn welcome package to Amazon - it seems like a reasonable prediction. Silicon Valley appears to be a perfect enemy for non-centrist forces in America, as bashing it helps to delegitimize the legacy of Obama and Clinton, seen as its primary enablers.</p><p>Others on the right endorse Bannon's opinions. Brad Parscale, the digital media director of Trump's 2016 campaign, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2018/12/12/actualidad/1544624671_005462.html\">complained</url> that \"Big tech monsters like Google and Facebook have become nothing less than incubators for far-left liberal ideologies and are doing everything they can to eradicate conservative ideas and their proponents from the internet.\" Recent bans on far-right and conservative personalities by social media and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2018/12/12/actualidad/1544624671_005462.html\">online fundraising platforms</url> have only amplified such perceptions of Silicon Valley. Even Donald Trump complained that Google was \"suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good\" - a \"very serious situation\" that, he promised, \"will be addressed\".</p><p>To see the sharp contrast with how rightwing populists elsewhere perceive Silicon Valley, one could turn to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2018/12/12/actualidad/1544624671_005462.html\">viral clip</url> from Bolsonaro's recent inauguration in Brazil, where a crowd of his supporters were filmed chanting \"WhatsApp, WhatsApp! Facebook, Facebook!\" This is hardly an atypical feeling. In 2017, when he was still a member of the European Parliament, Matteo Salvini delivered a feisty speech against attempts to crack down on fake news, declaring that the old elite ways of setting the public agenda were over. He       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2018/12/12/actualidad/1544624671_005462.html\">concluded</url> with \"Long Live Facebook!\" (he likewise       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2018/12/12/actualidad/1544624671_005462.html\">thanked</url> the site after the party did well in the 2018 elections).</p><p>The European Union Copyright Directive nicely illustrates the bizarre friendship between Silicon Valley and European populists</p><p>Salvini's coalition partners, the Five Star Movement, have distanced themselves from the likes of Bannon and Bolsonaro. But, as a movement started by a blogger and propelled by social media, they, too, are enamored of big tech. Its culture of disruption is precisely what they hope to emulate with their rhetoric of turning Italy into a \"smart nation\" - for example, by <url normalizedValue=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2018/12/12/actualidad/1544624671_005462.html\">endorsing</url> the further Italian expansion of Amazon justified on the grounds that the data of Italian enterprises handled by the firm will now be stored locally.</p><p>Last year's battle about a controversial piece of legislation - the European Union Copyright Directive - nicely illustrates the bizarre friendship between Silicon Valley and European populists. The directive is universally hated by the digital platforms as it would require them to increase enforcement of uploaded content (many civil society groups have also complained that it might criminalize memes and even sharing of links). During the September 2018 vote in the European Parliament, most of the opposition to the directive came from Poland's Law and Justice party, Italy's Five Star Movement and Lega, and UKIP - Silicon Valley's few odd allies in Brussels.</p><p>Absent a major geopolitical and trade rupture with Washington, European populists are unlikely to change their views of big tech. Rather, they'll keep building political capital by accusing establishment politicians of regulating digital platforms with the sole goal of censoring their populist opponents. Macron's actions with regards to the online mobilization tactics used by the giletsjaunes movement are of critical importance here: any meddling in the digital platforms by the French state, already keen on enacting a stringent fake news law, would spectacularly backfire.</p><p>But neither will the American populists lower their tone and find another target. On the issue of Silicon Valley and its power, Steve Bannon will remain closer to George Soros than to Matteo Salvini. This is a paradox that clever progressives ought to be able to exploit, if only by asking non-American rightwing populists to explain their great love for an industry that even Steve Bannon considers to be \"evil\".</p><p>No answer would be forthcoming as rightwing populists, whatever their rhetoric, have no sound analysis of either the global economy or of tbig tech's role in it (nor, alas, do many of their non-populist opponents). The sooner this absence gets revealed, the better.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-51048867</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V7Y-3G41-F021-62G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1096\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

International expansion requires international thinking. As U.S. tech companies consider new opportunities abroad, they must consider not only potential profit but also customer sentiment, operational ease and regulatory friendliness.    With threats like climate change and economic unrest, I believe only regions that prioritize sustainability can offer both the security and the profitability that businesses require for long-term commitments.     For context, \" sustainability \" refers to efforts that focus on meeting today's needs without compromising future generations. Sustainability is comprised of three pillars \u2014 economic, environmental and social \u2014 which are also known as profits, planet and people.    Some societies have a higher awareness of and willingness to act on sustainability goals. If your company agrees that sustainability is important and that companies increasingly will be measured on their ability to meet sustainability goals, I believe such efforts could translate into sound long-term investments with positive ripple effects on many levels. Indeed, the world's most sustainable companies have a higher return on investment than their peers that are less focused on sustainable development goals.    Why Sustainability Matters Now    I help international companies enter the Norwegian market, and through this experience, I have seen hundreds of businesses becoming increasingly focused on their environmental impact. These companies are concerned about their environmental footprint and what they can do to reduce it, rather than creating specific products to sell that help climate mitigation efforts. We are already seeing the effects of climate change in many regions, such as the fires in California, the increased number of hurricanes in the Atlantic, and the coastal flooding in the U.S. and around the world. Therefore, my team is seeing an increased demand to expand to sustainable regions.    Countries that prioritize sustainability can help businesses get a clearer picture of their short-term and long-term opportunities in the region. Nations that do not prioritize sustainability might attempt to woo international investment by downplaying environmental issues, but business leaders should be wary of such pitches.    I believe countries that address issues like climate change by tackling them head-on instead of sweeping them under the rug are worth considering if you're expanding your business. In my experience, the best regions for investment accomplish this by defining sustainability metrics that tie into business goals, helping companies draw a direct line from sustainability to long-term financial returns.    Sustainability does not refer only to environmental concerns, however. Economic sustainability plays a factor as well. Countries with thriving middle classes, for example, demonstrate an ability to withstand economic turmoil than countries with major issues of wealth inequality. New generations want to work for and buy from businesses that take their positions as stewards of the world's resources seriously.    CEOs and other leaders must think about the entire length of the value chain as it stretches across the world. Local outreach matters, but so do global concerns like sustainable supply chain management, fair labor practices, recycling policies and environmental stewardship. For example, goliaths in big tech, like Microsoft and Amazon , are competing for talent and the hearts and minds of consumers by pledging their commitment to sustainability.    From my perspective, sustainability will grow in importance in the future. I predict that consumers and workers will continue to demand better from businesses, and they will reward the most sustainable enterprises with their talent and their spending. Businesses with an eye for expansion should take this opportunity to expand in the right direction.    Tips For Expansion    There are a number of countries you can consider expanding into, such as France, Norway, the U.K. and more. Wherever you choose, it's important to keep a few best practices in mind:    1. Adapt to the local business culture by employing local staff to complement experienced company representatives. Make sure to align the country's culture with your company's culture. Both must align.    2. Employees will want you to live your values of sustainability both in terms of the products and services you sell and your internal business operations. Don't only focus on the environment; it's just as important to view sustainability through a well-rounded lens that addresses other important issues.    3. Involve your employees in innovation and decision-making. Particularly within traditional industries, I've found that trade unions are often highly valued resources in sustainable countries. There are many good examples of how good collaboration between union leaders and executives results in better bottom- and top-line results for the organization, as well as talent retention of motivated employees.    4. Build trusted local relationships, particularly company to company. If a foreign company enters a region such as Norway, a good brand name internationally is a good start to kick off the company-to-company relations.    5. Look at your business processes to find opportunities to incorporate the local community. For example, the waste heat from your data center could be used to heat local homes or warm up the local aquaculture product. Each location will have its natural advantages and challenges; your business will benefit from one and could help address the other.    Sustainable Businesses Looking Ahead    It's easy to feel overwhelmed about where to go next when considering business opportunities.

As the 2020 forecasts start dribbling out, it has become clear that the market is focused on one risk factor: Sen. Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>I visited an admittedly unscientific sample of three market-outlook conferences in the past week, and the Democratic presidential candidate's name came up every time, mentioned either by a panelist or an audience member. Yet not once did anyone mention Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg or Andrew Yang. Nor was the potential re-election of President Donald Trump discussed as a market risk. I didn't hear anyone bring up Michael Bloomberg either, though one supposes his presidency would be popular with the Wall Street crowd.</p><p>I imagine one reason Warren has Wall Street's full attention, even though she's trailing in the latest Iowa and New Hampshire polls, is that she isn't interested in raising money from bankers or money managers. Indeed, she seems to take more pleasure in their antipathy toward her than any presidential candidate since Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</p><p>She also wants to raise taxes on the wealthy to help pay for Medicare for All and other social programs. The Wall Street crowd likes how Trump cut tax rates for corporations and partnerships, hedge funds, private equity and real estate investment firms, enabling executives to keep more of their wealth. But it's worth remembering that there are plenty of Wall Street-friendly Democrats in Congress who perhaps wouldn't go along with President Warren raising taxes as much as she would like.</p><p>Even without the cooperation of Congress, there still would be plenty Warren could do to make Wall Street unhappy, though.</p><p>First, she could-and almost surely would-tighten regulation on big banks by requiring them to hold more capital to cushion against potential losses.</p><p>She has vowed to break up big tech companies. But even if she couldn't do that, she surely would tighten antitrust enforcement, which would make it tougher for big companies in a variety of sectors to pair up and get even bigger.</p><p>And even if she were unable to abolish private health insurers, she certainly would take steps to prevent them from dropping poor clients or minimizing coverage.</p><p>And yet she persisted</p><p>Apart from what she might do, perhaps the biggest reason money managers and investors worry about a Warren presidency is she has a history of getting things done that Wall Street really doesn't like.</p><p>First and foremost, she was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and she compromised to make it a reality. In 2010, as lawmakers were putting together the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that created the CFPB, she recognized the totally independent bureau she wanted wasn't possible and settled for having it funded by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Before the Trump administration effectively neutered the CFPB, it was a tough regulator that forced credit-card companies and debt- collection firms to treat their customers fairly.</p><p>The CFPB's greatest achievement was uncovering the sham-accounts scandal at Wells Fargo. Wells' reputation has not recovered, and regulators have put constraints on how much the bank can grow until management demonstrates it has its act together.</p><p>Maybe you forgot about all that. Wall Street definitely hasn't.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYBUS-4976826</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYBUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM3-DTH1-DYFH-V1HB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8102</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Crain Communications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crain's New York Business</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23761\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 35</volume><edition>Print Version</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 25, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Authorities &amp;

Congress cannot break up companies under existing laws, but it could cook up new ones -- and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who's established herself as Democrats' big ideas leader in 2020, already has a plan to break up the largest tech monopolies.</p><p>Warren's gripe is that the largest tech companies favor their own products, something known as \"platform privilege,\" which crowds out every other player.</p><p>Larger frustrations with tech companies</p><p>But the problems are much bigger than that, and go way beyond antitrust investigations.</p><p>Even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, after Russia's internet attack on the US election in 2016, said this year that the internet should be regulated to ensure the integrity of people's privacy and of free elections.</p><p>The same internet that has made the world smaller and brought people across continents closer together for commerce and communication has brought together extremists bent on terrorism and has spread conspiracy theories and other disinformation that is driving society apart.</p><p>One person's meme is another's fake news, however. President Donald Trump has long groused, without concrete proof, that social networks bury conservative content -- and even invited Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to the White House to complain about it.</p><p>The House probe will also focus on the effect tech companies have had on local journalism and other aspects of American life.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are everywhere in US life now, providing the phones Americans use to shop and connect with one another, the speakers that listen for their commands and questions, the cameras that watch their homes. Smaller companies like Uber, Lyft, Twitter and others are playing their own roles in reshaping how we move through the world around us and how we understand what happens in it. Unless and until they are swallowed or ended by something larger.</p><p>\"The open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment and new pathways for education online,\" House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler said Monday. \"But there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content and communications.\"</p><p>More frustrations with tech companies</p><p>A backlash to big tech has been festering for some time.</p><p>People in cities have proved willing to fight tech companies and the inequality their fabulous salaries bring.</p><p>Earlier this year Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats in New York used a grassroots political campaign to kill Amazon's plans to locate half of its new HQ2 in New York after a highly publicized beauty contest among cities vying for the right to host the company.</p><p>Part of the gripe was the tax benefits and goodies Amazon had extracted in exchange for jobs from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio -- who is now running for president.</p><p>That came after Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont led the effort to get Amazon to pledge to pay its workers $15 per hour.</p><p>Amazon in particular plays a huge role in bringing automation to American life, which helps get products to your doorstep more quickly but is worrying many people that robots will replace human workers.</p><p>But now we also find that the IRS is auditing Uber for two tax years, which the company disclosed in filings Tuesday before its IPO. Uber doesn't pay much tax, however, because it's never turned a profit. Amazon, despite its size, gets away with some amazing tax magic.</p><p>The Supreme Court is letting iPhone users sue Apple for violating antitrust laws and creating a monopoly with its app store.</p><p>It's not just consumer companies. The chipmaker Qualcomm was found in May by a federal judge to have violated antitrust law for overcharging phone makers.</p><p>Falling out of fashion</p><p>Time was, tech companies were the darlings of the American economy, and therefore of American politics. President Barack Obama dined with tech execs and happily took their campaign contributions. He used the Silicon Valley mentality to try to rethink government. Zuckerberg interviewed him at Facebook Headquarters in 2011 and the event was streamed live.</p><p>Republican presidential candidates in 2016 bought into Uber and the gig economy. Jeb Bush said it would change the workforce and let Americans \"customize their lives.\"</p><p>Now there's a backlash on the lack of worker protections, lack of benefits and low wages that make gig workers and American workers soak up more risk.</p><p>And the public is starting to see the darker side of omnipresent tech companies that own their photographs, read their emails, know their habits and locations and serve up ads creepily related to their internet searches.</p><p>Now more lawmakers and candidates are turning their scrutiny on tech.

Congress cannot break up companies under existing laws, but it could cook up new ones -- and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who's established herself as Democrats' big ideas leader in 2020, already has a plan to break up the largest tech monopolies. </p><p>Warren's gripe is that the largest tech companies favor their own products, something known as \"platform privilege,\" which crowds out every other player.</p><p>Larger frustrations with tech companies</p><p>But the problems are much bigger than that, and go way beyond antitrust investigations.</p><p>Even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, after Russia's internet attack on the US election in 2016, said this year that the internet should be regulated to ensure the integrity of people's privacy and of free elections.</p><p>The same internet that has made the world smaller and brought people across continents closer together for commerce and communication has brought together extremists bent on terrorism and has spread conspiracy theories and other disinformation that is driving society apart.</p><p>One person's meme is another's fake news, however. President Donald Trump has long groused, without concrete proof, that social networks bury conservative content -- and even invited Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to the White House to complain about it.</p><p>The House probe will also focus on the effect tech companies have had on local journalism and other aspects of American life.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are everywhere in US life now, providing the phones Americans use to shop and connect with one another, the speakers that listen for their commands and questions, the cameras that watch their homes. Smaller companies like Uber, Lyft, Twitter and others are playing their own roles in reshaping how we move through the world around us and how we understand what happens in it. Unless and until they are swallowed or ended by something larger. </p><p>\"The open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment and new pathways for education online,\" House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler said Monday. \"But there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content and communications.\"</p><p>More frustrations with tech companies</p><p>A backlash to big tech has been festering for some time.</p><p>People in cities have proved willing to fight tech companies and the inequality their fabulous salaries bring. </p><p>Earlier this year Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats in New York used a grassroots political campaign to kill Amazon's plans to locate half of its new HQ2 in New York after a highly publicized beauty contest among cities vying for the right to host the company. </p><p>Part of the gripe was the tax benefits and goodies Amazon had extracted in exchange for jobs from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio -- who is now running for president.</p><p>That came after Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont led the effort to get Amazon to pledge to pay its workers $15 per hour.</p><p>Amazon in particular plays a huge role in bringing automation to American life, which helps get products to your doorstep more quickly but is worrying many people that robots will replace human workers.</p><p>But now we also find that the IRS is auditing Uber for two tax years, which the company disclosed in filings Tuesday before its IPO. Uber doesn't pay much tax, however, because it's never turned a profit. Amazon, despite its size, gets away with some amazing tax magic.</p><p>The Supreme Court is letting iPhone users sue Apple for violating antitrust laws and creating a monopoly with its app store.</p><p>It's not just consumer companies. The chipmaker Qualcomm was found in May by a federal judge to have violated antitrust law for overcharging phone makers.</p><p>Falling out of fashion</p><p>Time was, tech companies were the darlings of the American economy, and therefore of American politics. President Barack Obama dined with tech execs and happily took their campaign contributions. He used the Silicon Valley mentality to try to rethink government. Zuckerberg interviewed him at Facebook Headquarters in 2011 and the event was streamed live.</p><p>Republican presidential candidates in 2016 bought into Uber and the gig economy. Jeb Bush said it would change the workforce and let Americans \"customize their lives.\"</p><p>Now there's a backlash on the lack of worker protections, lack of benefits and low wages that make gig workers and American workers soak up more risk. </p><p>And the public is starting to see the darker side of omnipresent tech companies that own their photographs, read their emails, know their habits and locations and serve up ads creepily related to their internet searches. </p><p>Now more lawmakers and candidates are turning their scrutiny on tech. A turning point was the Trump election victory in 2016. Democrats still shout about the rise of fake news on Facebook, Twitter and Google. Conservatives have leaped to defend fringe voices kicked off social platforms as the companies have responded to fake news complaints.</p><p>Democrats have seized on inequality as a campaign issue and tech billionaires like Zuckerberg and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos embody the excess of a gilded age for tech success.</p><p>The Microsoft example</p><p>In the 1990s the government launched an epic antitrust case against Microsoft, which was forcing its web browser on PC users.</p><p>That case lasted for a dozen years and ended with a settlement. But the fallout created space for the rise of Google and Facebook, now under scrutiny of their own.</p><p>The European Union has previously fined Google $5 billion for requiring Google apps to be installed on phones running its Android operating system, solidifying its dominance.</p><p>Sally Hubbard of the Open Markets Institute has argued on CNN that tech companies have helped chip away at antitrust law by arguing in court cases that consumers are not harmed by their anti-competitive practices.</p><p>\"But consumers pay for tech platforms' services with data, not dollars,\" she wrote back in January, explaining the view that tech companies are violating laws.</p><p>She argued that while there are other social media platforms, it's not correct to argue Facebook doesn't have a monopoly.</p><p>\"The closest substitute to Facebook is Instagram, which isn't much of a choice since Facebook owns it,\" she wrote.

Israeli publication The Globes says the search giant is about to close to a deal to buy Waze, a relatively small Israeli company with a mapping app that crowd-sources user data for up-to-the-minute traffic information. The price would be about $1.3 billion, topping Facebook's rumored $1 billion attempt, and making it the 4th largest Googleacquisition to date.</p><p>Waze continually collects GPS data from its roughly 45 million users' phones, helping them \"outsmart traffic\" and find \"the best route to work and back, every day,\" says the company's website. Users can edit maps in real-time, warning other drivers about traffic accidents, and sharing gas prices and locations of speed-sensing cameras.</p><p>Waze, with about 100 employees in Israel and Palo Alto, Calif., is still relatively small, and has yet to generate a reliable revenue stream. So why might Google, already the King of Maps, spend over a billion to own it?</p><p>First, to defend its throne. Though GoogleMaps is dominant, Waze is the world's \"fastest-growing community-based traffic navigation app,\" says its website. And it's expanding quickly, with 45 million users spread across 190 countries, many in developing regions like Southeast Asia and Latin America. Additionally, the \"'social' component differentiates Waze from the leading mobile map apps, which happen to come from Googleand Apple,\" says TIME. In buying the competition, Googlewould be also stamping it out.</p><p>Second, a Google-Waze deal would stymie Facebook and Apple, both of which were recently eyeing Waze. Apple, which introduced the widely ridiculed Apple Maps for iPhones and iPads last year, already uses Waze data to update traffic information. Whether that relationship will continue after a Google acquisition is unclear, but the deal \"underscores the growing importance of mapping in the battle for consumer loyalty to mobile devices,\" says The Wall Street Journal. TechCrunch explains:</p><p>See, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and any other big tech player will be focusing on location technology as a way to bolster other services. Maps is the spinal cord of the mobile ecosystem. It affects advertising, other social tools and apps, and e-commerce.

[Tech Crunch]</p><p>Still, the deal isn't sealed. Because GoogleMaps is already massive, the acquisition may bump up against anti-trust regulators, who could force GoogleMaps and Waze to remain separate apps. But they'd still be able to share data, and with GoogleMaps' size and Waze's user-updates, GoogleMaps could grow into a kind of giant, ever-evolving Wikipedia of traffic maps (and win the Game of Maps, of course).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UNIBAN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UNIBAN2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58N1-3FK1-JB1X-W4P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"485\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 United News of Bangladesh All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>United News of Bangladesh</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>June 10, 2013 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The use of newer technologies, such as wearable devices, is being considered as a way to assist with some of the issues businesses are facing during COVID-19, including adhering to social distancing expectations.  Generally speaking, the use of wearables in the workplace has been attracting increased interest for some time, as such devices can be used to improve organisation efficiency, increase employee productivity, monitor staff health and wellbeing (for example, track heart rate and manage fatigue), and create an overall safer work environment.  Wearable technology has been applied to proximity monitoring and detection applications which can assist with workplace safety.  The mining industry, in particular, has been a leading sector to adopt wearable technologies for proximity detection as well as collision avoidance. Mine operators can attach devices to vehicles or clothing that will alert the employee when they are too close to other equipment or machinery.  Workplace wearable safety solutions may also be the key for some businesses to continue operating in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Most businesses will be required to implement a COVIDSafe plan, as mandated by the government, and will be expected to enforce social distancing measures.  To assist with this, there are specific solutions emerging that can help to monitor physical proximity between employees in real-time and provide contact tracing data.

It does not have a definitive end date, and as such, businesses in Australia are making changes in order to adapt, comply with restrictions, and continue operating as best they can.  The use of newer technologies, such as wearable devices, is being considered as a way to assist with some of the issues businesses are facing during COVID-19, including adhering to social distancing expectations.  Generally speaking, the use of wearables in the workplace has been attracting increased interest for some time, as such devices can be used to improve organisation efficiency, increase employee productivity, monitor staff health and wellbeing (for example, track heart rate and manage fatigue), and create an overall safer work environment.  Wearable technology has been applied to proximity monitoring and detection applications which can assist with workplace safety.  The mining industry, in particular, has been a leading sector to adopt wearable technologies for proximity detection as well as collision avoidance. Mine operators can attach devices to vehicles or clothing that will alert the employee when they are too close to other equipment or machinery.  Workplace wearable safety solutions may also be the key for some businesses to continue operating in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Most businesses will be required to implement a COVIDSafe plan, as mandated by the government, and will be expected to enforce social distancing measures.  To assist with this, there are specific solutions emerging that can help to monitor physical proximity between employees in real-time and provide contact tracing data. This can be achieved by using wearables connected to ultra-wideband short-range wireless technologies (Bluetooth and WiFi) or wireless local area networks (WLANs). The application may alert an employee via a buzzer or similar alert when they get too close to one another.  One of the solutions recently launched in Australia has been developed by Zebra Technologies and is designed specifically for enterprises. It is called Zebra MotionWorks Proximity solution and it combines cloud technology with devices enabled with WiFi or Bluetooth. It monitors if a social distancing breach has occurred for longer than 60 seconds and alerts an employee. It then continues with the alert at one-minute intervals until the employees separate.  It also has the ability to recognise regularly occurring events of more than five minutes and will gather data on the duration of such meetings and the identities of those involved. Web-based reports can subsequently be generated that will provide data for contact tracing purposes.  Another proximity solution is being developed by Australian IoT operator The National Narrowband Network Co in partnership with Belgium-based applications and solutions provider WMW.  The solution was initially developed with the construction and mining industry in mind and it has a number of safety applications, including alerting on-site employees when they get too close to dangerous objects, equipment or out-of-bounds areas.  But a further solution is being developed for COVID-19, which will assist with monitoring staff social distancing behaviour. It can be used in a broader range of workplaces including aged-care homes and hospitals.  Privacy and security are primary concerns surrounding any tracing or tracking system and many of the solutions emerging are addressing these issues by incorporating the ability to collect or report personal data anonymously (perhaps by assigning a unique identifier, rather than an employee's name).  Businesses considering using wearable devices in the workplace should check the current Australian privacy laws and regulations.  The COVID-19 pandemic has fast-tracked the use of a number of digital solutions for society, both in Australia and around the world, such as telehealth and distance learning for schools.  It may be that workplaces are becoming the next frontier for a digital revolution, and this time, it will not just be large enterprises that are the beneficiaries, but also small and medium businesses looking for new solutions to new problems.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/analysis/how-big-tech-is-using-covid-19-to-change-lives/\">NOW READ: The control revolution: How big tech is using COVID-19 to push the \"warp-speed\" button on changing our lives</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/people-human-resources/social-distancing-officer/\">NOW READ: Does your business need a social distancing officer?</url></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MT-TTR1-F0NT-H0S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><timeReceived>10:02 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00024HE</classCode><className>ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS561499 ALL OTHER BUSINESS SUPPORT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7389 BUSINESS SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7373 COMPUTER INTEGRATED SYSTEMS DESIGN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>ZBRA (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N923120GC</classCode><className>COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DP79</classCode><className>DISEASE CONTACT TRACING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOZB</classCode><className>SOCIAL DISTANCING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001948</classCode><className>LABOR &amp;

It does not have a definitive end date, and as such, businesses in Australia are making changes in order to adapt, comply with restrictions, and continue operating as best they can.  The use of newer technologies, such as wearable devices, is being considered as a way to assist with some of the issues businesses are facing during COVID-19, including adhering to social distancing expectations.  Generally speaking, the use of wearables in the workplace has been attracting increased interest for some time, as such devices can be used to improve organisation efficiency, increase employee productivity, monitor staff health and wellbeing (for example, track heart rate and manage fatigue), and create an overall safer work environment.  Wearable technology has been applied to proximity monitoring and detection applications which can assist with workplace safety.  The mining industry, in particular, has been a leading sector to adopt wearable technologies for proximity detection as well as collision avoidance. Mine operators can attach devices to vehicles or clothing that will alert the employee when they are too close to other equipment or machinery.  Workplace wearable safety solutions may also be the key for some businesses to continue operating in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Most businesses will be required to implement a COVIDSafe plan, as mandated by the government, and will be expected to enforce social distancing measures.  To assist with this, there are specific solutions emerging that can help to monitor physical proximity between employees in real-time and provide contact tracing data. This can be achieved by using wearables connected to ultra-wideband short-range wireless technologies (Bluetooth and WiFi) or wireless local area networks (WLANs). The application may alert an employee via a buzzer or similar alert when they get too close to one another.  One of the solutions recently launched in Australia has been developed by Zebra Technologies and is designed specifically for enterprises. It is called Zebra MotionWorks Proximity solution and it combines cloud technology with devices enabled with WiFi or Bluetooth. It monitors if a social distancing breach has occurred for longer than 60 seconds and alerts an employee. It then continues with the alert at one-minute intervals until the employees separate.  It also has the ability to recognise regularly occurring events of more than five minutes and will gather data on the duration of such meetings and the identities of those involved. Web-based reports can subsequently be generated that will provide data for contact tracing purposes.  Another proximity solution is being developed by Australian IoT operator The National Narrowband Network Co in partnership with Belgium-based applications and solutions provider WMW.  The solution was initially developed with the construction and mining industry in mind and it has a number of safety applications, including alerting on-site employees when they get too close to dangerous objects, equipment or out-of-bounds areas.  But a further solution is being developed for COVID-19, which will assist with monitoring staff social distancing behaviour. It can be used in a broader range of workplaces including aged-care homes and hospitals.  Privacy and security are primary concerns surrounding any tracing or tracking system and many of the solutions emerging are addressing these issues by incorporating the ability to collect or report personal data anonymously (perhaps by assigning a unique identifier, rather than an employee's name).  Businesses considering using wearable devices in the workplace should check the current Australian privacy laws and regulations.  The COVID-19 pandemic has fast-tracked the use of a number of digital solutions for society, both in Australia and around the world, such as telehealth and distance learning for schools.  It may be that workplaces are becoming the next frontier for a digital revolution, and this time, it will not just be large enterprises that are the beneficiaries, but also small and medium businesses looking for new solutions to new problems.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/analysis/how-big-tech-is-using-covid-19-to-change-lives/\">NOW READ: The control revolution: How big tech is using COVID-19 to push the \"warp-speed\" button on changing our lives</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/people-human-resources/social-distancing-officer/\">NOW READ: Does your business need a social distancing officer?</url></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MK-VH11-JD6R-T0RW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><timeReceived>10:02 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00024HE</classCode><className>ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS561499 ALL OTHER BUSINESS SUPPORT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7389 BUSINESS SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7373 COMPUTER INTEGRATED SYSTEMS DESIGN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>ZBRA (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N923120GC</classCode><className>COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DP79</classCode><className>DISEASE CONTACT TRACING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOZB</classCode><className>SOCIAL DISTANCING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001948</classCode><className>LABOR &amp;

Thus stammered Richard Hendricks, the bedraggled, beleaguered founder and CEO of Pied Piper, a fictional Internet company at the heart of the HBO comedy Silicon Valley, in his surprisingly eloquent testimony before a hostile congressional committee investigating the abuses of Big Tech. \u00e2??These companies are kings, and they rule over kingdoms far larger than any nation in human history. They won, we lost.\u00e2?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But far from giving up, Hendricks suggested a path toward victory: \u00e2??The way we win is by creating a new, democratic, decentralized Internet, one where the behavior of companies like this will be impossible forever. One where it is the users, not the kings, who have sovereign control over their data. This I promise to you: I will help you end this journey by building an Internet that is of the people, by the people, and for the people, so help me God,\u00e2? Hendricks concluded, to the rousing applause of his employees watching on TV.</p><p>Only one small problem: viewers later learn that Pied Piper itself was engaging for years in the very practice Hendricks so roundly condemned, as a popular video game operating under its umbrella had been collecting and exploiting customer data. It turns out it\u00e2??s not as easy as we think to turn off the information spigot, for we have more or less accepted the fundamental bargain of the Internet: In exchange for our personal data, we gain access to an unprecedented cornucopia of digital goods.</p><p>Shoshana Zuboff picks up Hendricks\u00e2??s mantle in examining the fraught relationship between Internet companies, their users, and those users\u00e2?? data in Surveillance Capitalism, a term she succinctly defines as \u00e2??a new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales.\u00e2? Fundamentally, she worries that our \u00e2??rights to privacy, knowledge, and application have been usurped by a bold market venture powered by unilateral claims to others\u00e2?? experience and the knowledge that flows from it.\u00e2? While Zuboff provides an impassioned, eloquent, and thought-provoking analysis of the interplay between technology and personal autonomy, her book suffers from deep flaws, largely ignoring the tremendous benefits Big Tech companies have conferred on society, failing to reckon with Americans\u00e2?? choice to accept this tradeoff, and neglecting to offer any serious or realistic solutions.</p><p>ZUBOFF TRAINED IN PHILOSOPHY at the University of Chicago and in social psychology at Harvard, and in the 1980s became one of the first tenured female professors at the Harvard Business School. There she conducted pioneering scholarship on how the information society was changing culture and economics. Her 1988 book In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power foresaw the growth of AI and machine learning, and anticipated the core contention of Surveillance Capitalism that digital technology is upending traditional ownership roles and concepts, fundamentally transforming the nature of the market.</p><p>The strongest articulation of her claim arrives early on, where she seeks to slaughter certain sacred cows of the digerati in order to reveal the true nature of the tech industry:</p><p>\u00e2??Surveillance capitalism\u00e2??s products and services are not the objects of a value exchange. They do not establish constructive producer\u00e2?\"consumer reciprocities. Instead, they are the \u00e2??hooks\u00e2?? that lure users into their extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others\u00e2?? ends. We are not surveillance capitalism\u00e2??s \u00e2??customers.\u00e2?? Although the saying tells us \u00e2??If it\u00e2??s free, then you are the product,\u00e2?? that is also incorrect. We are the sources of surveillance capitalism\u00e2??s crucial surplus: the objects of a technologically advanced and increasingly inescapable raw-material-extraction operation. Surveillance capitalism\u00e2??s actual customers are the enterprises that trade in its markets for future behavior.\u00e2?</p><p>In Zuboff\u00e2??s telling, the technology industry extracts nothing short of actual human experience from its users, denuding our existence of its richness and manipulating our behavior toward the industry\u00e2??s own commercial ends. What initially began as a laudable effort to liberate information and improve customer experience rapidly degenerated into a naked power grab that threatens the very foundation of democratic society.</p><p>Worse, Zuboff argues, tech companies have managed to harness the power of government to their voracious, avaricious engine. Far from meaningfully regulating or curbing the companies\u00e2?? malign influence, entities like the National Security Agency only supercharge their efforts by conspiring to further eradicate privacy and individual autonomy.</p><p>IN SOME WAYS, ZUBOFF\u00e2??S TRUCK with digital companies has less to do with their being digital than their being companies. She gives away the game early in the book, where she labels surveillance capitalism \u00e2??parasitic and self-referential\u00e2? and likens it to \u00e2??Karl Marx\u00e2??s old image of capitalism as a vampire that feeds on labor, but with an unexpected turn. Instead of labor, surveillance capitalism feeds on every aspect of every human\u00e2??s experience.\u00e2? And she points the finger at economists like Friedrich Hayek, who plowed the ground for digital exploitation by envisioning the \u00e2??self-regulating market as a natural force of such complexity and perfection that it demanded radical freedom from all forms of state oversight.\u00e2? (This would come as a surprise to Hayek, who argued in The Road to Serfdom that \u00e2??coercive interference ... may very considerably assist\u00e2? economic competition, which \u00e2??requires certain kinds of government action.\u00e2?)</p><p>Digital companies in particular are uniquely guilty of feeding on human experience. Whereas old-economy companies regarded us as \u00e2??the subjects of value realization,\u00e2? digital companies treat us as \u00e2??the objects from which raw materials are extracted and expropriated.\u00e2? Think of a traditional transaction, like a car sale. Old-economy companies see mutual beneficiaries in this value exchange: You get the car, I get the money. But in the Google economy, Zuboff says, ordinary people are no longer the consumers; advertisers are. And what they consume is products based on data about users. \u00e2??This new market form declares that serving the genuine needs of people is less lucrative, and therefore less important, than selling predictions of their behavior.\u00e2?</p><p>But it\u00e2??s not obvious what is genuinely new in this form of capitalism. Zuboff is right that most of Google\u00e2??s users are not its actual customers -- yet they are nevertheless engaged in an exchange from which both parties derive real benefit. Even if what we trade is now data about our online behavior rather than money, in getting a reliable search engine we are plainly still subjects of value realization. Might we also be objectified? Clearly so -- but then, every profit-maximizing company to some extent treats us as objects from which it extracts revenue, just as we treat companies as tools to be used for our own benefit. This instrumentalist approach, after all, is fundamental to capitalism writ large, not simply to surveillance capitalism. The arrangement of the players in the digital exchange may be novel, but its fundamental nature is not.</p><p>Coupled with what she repeatedly calls \u00e2??neoliberal ideology,\u00e2? Zuboff\u00e2??s central objection appears to be to capitalism, not just to surveillance.</p><p>WHAT IF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY is far more straightforward and less sinister than Zuboff allows? After all, she acknowledges that companies like Google and Facebook promised to apply their products to \u00e2??new domains of critical importance, rescuing information and people from the old institutional confines, enabling us to find what and whom we wanted, when and how we wanted to search or connect.\u00e2? This amounted to nothing less than the \u00e2??promise that quickly lodged at the very heart of the commercial digital project.\u00e2?</p><p>This promise has indeed largely been realized, thanks to relentless innovation by the industry Zuboff castigates. Take, for example, the tracking of driving behavior through vehicle telematics -- like the tracking devices some car insurance companies offer that promise lower rates for less aggressive drivers. Zuboff derides this emerging form of data-gathering as a greedy, overweening, micromanaging technological trend, or \u00e2??behavioral control\u00e2? by nefarious insurance companies. But this use of our data is voluntary, and it is a feature, not a bug, financially incentivizing safe driving, and ultimately saving lives. While Zuboff waxes at length about the dangers posed by Big Tech\u00e2??s exploitation of user data, she breezily brushes aside the benefits we can gain from such data-driven technologies as fitness tracking, electronic gathering and analysis of public health data, automated transportation, traffic management, and many others.</p><p>Elsewhere, in fact, Zuboff concedes that digital companies have been reasonably upfront about the tradeoffs involved in using their products: \u00e2??Privacy, they said, was the price one must pay for the abundant rewards of information, connection, and other digital goods when, where, and how you want them.\u00e2? This isn\u00e2??t just what tech companies say. It is also true.</p><p>For instance, in exploring the meteoric rise of Google, whose revenues surged by a whopping 3,600 percent in four years after introducing its advertising platform -- from $86 million in 2001 to over $3 billion by 2004 -- Zuboff laments a colossal missed opportunity: \u00e2??What other pathways to sustainable revenue might have been explored or invented? What alternative futures might have been summoned to keep faith with the founders\u00e2?? principles and with their users\u00e2?? rights to self-determination?\u00e2?</p><p>But we more or less know the answer to that question: Without commercializing its search engine, Google would most likely either have gone out of business or shifted to a non-profit model along the lines of the Mozilla Foundation, a highly respected and thoughtful entity with only marginal impact on the lives of Americans, the many virtues of its Firefox browser notwithstanding. Absent a monetization of Google\u00e2??s search engine, it would not have transformed the ways we in the digital world interact with maps, products, culture, books, and one another -- innovations we have all come to expect to be both reliable and free.</p><p>ZUBOFF\u00e2??S COLORFUL AND CHARGED language maintains the reader\u00e2??s interest throughout nearly 700 pages of exposition, but at times it also oversells her thesis. At one point she likens Google\u00e2??s adoption of its advertising strategy to a transformation from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde. At another she labels Sheryl Sandberg, the onetime Google executive whom Mark Zuckerberg hired to serve as Facebook\u00e2??s chief operating officer, as the \u00e2??\u00e2??Typhoid Mary\u00e2?? of surveillance capitalism,\u00e2? alluding to the Irish immigrant first identified as a carrier of the disease in the United States. Her writing tends toward the overdramatic, even the bombastic, as when she labels surveillance capitalism a \u00e2??Faustian compact\u00e2? because \u00e2??it is nearly impossible to tear ourselves away, despite the fact that what we must give in return will destroy life as we have known it.\u00e2? While these piquant characterizations undoubtedly spice up her prose, which is zesty enough without them, they also undermine its seriousness.</p><p>But by far the most problematic facet of Surveillance Capitalism is its fundamental, even philosophical, misapprehension -- whether accidental or intentional -- of the nature of digital companies\u00e2?? acquisition of data, which Zuboff cleverly, repeatedly, but inaccurately casts as \u00e2??dispossession.\u00e2? She discusses what Hannah Arendt called the \u00e2??original sin of simple robbery\u00e2?? -- the idea that capitalism first became possible by grabbing land and natural resources and turning them into capital. Zuboff argues that Google committed this sin again when it realized that \u00e2??human experience ... could be extracted.\u00e2? User information, photos of public spaces, traffic patterns can all be \u00e2??rendered as behavioral data,\u00e2? creating a surplus that can be sold for profit.</p><p>Google dispossesses us, per Zuboff, by way of its relentless \u00e2??incursion\u00e2? into our lives: \u00e2??your laptop, your phone, a web page, the street where you live, an e-mail to your friend, your walk in the park,\u00e2? and so on. \u00e2??Incursion moves down the road ... laying claim to decision rights over whatever is in its path. \u00e2??I\u00e2??m taking this,\u00e2?? it says. \u00e2??These are mine now.\u00e2??\u00e2? When we take Google to court, it \u00e2??seduces, ignores, overwhelms, or simply exhausts its adversaries.\u00e2?</p><p>Consider Google Street View, for which \u00e2??the company did not ask permission\u00e2?:</p><p>\u00e2??It simply repeated the \u00e2??original sin of simple robbery\u00e2?? and took what it wanted, waiting for resistance to run its course as it devoured and datafied the world\u00e2??s public spaces, streets, buildings, and homes.\u00e2?</p><p>In her telling, personal information and human experience itself aren\u00e2??t simply accessed but captured, extracted, seized.</p><p>Yet robbery and dispossession are deeply flawed terms to describe these \u00e2??takings\u00e2? precisely because the user does not in any meaningful sense lose her data or experiences or photos or tweets or political opinions. Unlike plundering diamond mines or extracting natural gas, where every gemstone or cubic foot of methane changes hands, using \u00e2??behavioral surplus\u00e2? -- the models of human behavior generated from user data -- is not a zero-sum game. True, Big Tech companies have accessed this information, but quite apart from the question of whether they did so with public consent, there has been no dispossession, because the public -- as a whole, and as individuals -- still very much continues to possess the information, even if not in the exact same form. Put differently, we may be unhappy when Facebook serves us a targeted trattoria advertisement on the basis of a video we posted of our children cavorting at the Trevi Fountain, but it strains credulity to suggest that we have somehow lost that video, or the underlying experience and sentiments it reflects, simply because Facebook has used it.</p><p>SO IF ZUBOFF MISDIAGNOSES AND EXAGGERATES the problems created by what she ominously calls Big Other, how do her proposed solutions stack up? Not well. At a high level, Zuboff appears to believe the problem unsolvable by conventional methods. She blames the absence of a way out on consumers\u00e2?? \u00e2??radical indifference,\u00e2? and on the interest the government and the military share with industry in expanding the surveillance apparatus. She even likens surveillance capitalism, for whose destruction she yearns, to the Berlin Wall, and her advice boils down to an exhortation \u00e2??to rekindle the sense of outrage and loss over what is being taken from us.\u00e2?</p><p>But while a comprehensive fix to surveillance capitalism isn\u00e2??t forthcoming, Zuboff does advance several partial solutions. First, Zuboff homes in on Internet companies\u00e2?? exploitation of a legal scheme supposedly designed to shelter them. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act shields certain websites from liability for the content posted on them by others, under the theory that these sites function more as neutral platforms than as publishers. This notion, of course, has recently come under heavy fire from left and right alike, with Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introducing legislation to unwind this protection on the grounds that by imposing certain limits on offensive or otherwise harmful posts, sites like Facebook and Twitter have eschewed their neutral intermediary status and more closely resemble content providers, like traditional publishers.</p><p>Here Zuboff joins forces with Hawley, although on slightly different grounds, noting that \u00e2??Section 230\u00e2??s protection of the \u00e2??intermediaries\u00e2?? now functions as another bulwark that shelters this extractive surveillance capitalist operation from critical examination.\u00e2? In her telling, because Google, Facebook, and the like depend so heavily on the content their users upload to the sites, they should also bear responsibility as publishers of that content. But she fails to explain how the mere fact that digital companies profit from content voluntarily posted by their customers requires them to bear culpability for that content, such as defamation lawsuits or tortious remedies like pain and suffering caused to other users who encounter it. Her proposed approach would be akin to imposing liability on a for-profit book-of the-month club for the offensive content of one of its books simply because the club uses its members\u00e2?? data -- with their permission -- to target them for additional sales.</p><p>More substantively, she champions a beefed-up \u00e2??right to be forgotten,\u00e2? currently in vogue in Europe following a May 2014 European Court of Justice ruling that empowered ordinary individuals to request that Internet companies delete damaging information about them. If they can prove this information is \u00e2??inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive,\u00e2? the digital platform must delist it. Zuboff hails this ruling and highlights a predecessor decision four years earlier by the Spanish Data Protection Agency to elevate the right to be forgotten as a binding legal principle. Last year\u00e2??s enactment by the European Union of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enshrined this right into EU law, signifying its full maturation.</p><p>Yet this right enjoys far more popularity in Europe than in the United States, and is hardly without its detractors even on the continent. Data on public opinion is scant; much of what we know comes from a five-year-old survey of 500 respondents that suggests that fewer than 40 percent of Americans support a European-style right to be forgotten, while another 15 percent favor a limited such right for minors only. Americans largely recognize that privacy is no unalloyed good and instead must be balanced against other societal goods. At the same time, when tech giants overreach, they provoke a backlash even among Americans, as Zuboff acknowledges was the case with Google Glass, which at least until now has proven too creepy and invasive for all but the most enthusiastic of tech nerds.</p><p>More broadly, both in the United States and abroad, the tension between an individual\u00e2??s desire to avoid scrutiny for past indiscretions and the public\u00e2??s right to know about others\u00e2?? dangerous or problematic acts is difficult to resolve, especially when someone has, for instance, been charged with an offense but never convicted. One recent New York Times article illustrated this tension through the troubling story of an Italian journalism website dedicated to exposing corruption, in a country notorious for corruption, that wound up having to shutter itself after numerous court rulings required it to delete information about locally prominent individuals who had been arrested but whose charges had been dropped.</p><p>For its part, Google claims to have complied with nearly half of GDPR requests to delist specific websites from its search engine. It contends that the decision to reject the remaining requests involves factors such as \u00e2??the requester\u00e2??s professional life, a past crime, political office, position in public life, or whether the content is self-authored content, consists of government documents, or is journalistic in nature.\u00e2?</p><p>NEVERTHELESS, FOR ALL OF ZUBOFF\u00e2??S INFLATION of the putative predations in which the tech industry indulges, for all her analytical and rhetorical excesses, and for all her profoundly problematic suggested remedies for those harms, she identifies troubling trends requiring redress. Surveillance Capitalism challenges readers who, like myself, often wax enthusiastic about the tremendous benefits and value created by Google, Facebook, and others to reconsider their prior assumptions and examine whether our society should recalibrate itself in favor of greater protection over user data.</p><p>Dangers abound in this realm, to be sure. Nobody wants Alexa accidentally recording their private conversations and sending them out to acquaintances, or Target inadvertently informing a teenager\u00e2??s father that she was pregnant by mailing out maternity clothes coupons. We may find it jarring to receive push notifications from supermarkets urging us to buy Green Giant frozen peas when we approach strip malls, unaware that one or more apps on our phones had been tracking our location. There is no shortage of changes that tech companies can make to improve user experience and safeguard our information, such as shorter and clearer privacy policies, more definitive opt-outs for location tracking, more regular destruction of aging or leftover user records, and more transparent disclosure of which third-party applications have access to our information.</p><p>But in the end, on the question of technology and privacy, American consumers have voted with their thumbs and fingers and pocketbooks: We\u00e2??re fundamentally willing to exchange some measure of privacy for great gobs of technology. And condemning this popular practice as \u00e2??surveillance\u00e2? is unlikely to alter that deep-seated truth.</p><p>***</p><p>Michael M.

With that in mind, consider this; research from Nielsen[1] showed that around half of all digital consumption takes place on either Google or Facebook-owned platforms, and the two businesses demand an estimated 84% share of global advertising spend[2]. Often referred to in the advertising world as the 'digital duopoly', these titans of tech have a stronghold over a digital ad industry worth approximately $209bnworldwide[3]. As Big Tech companies grow and continue to hold endless amounts of personal data, it's clear that they should be subject to some form of regulation to protect consumers and businesses from a storm of data breaches, excessive monopolistic behaviour and unfair business practices.  While a regulatory watchdog exists in most industries - in advertising we have the ASA for example - incredibly there still isn't one in place for Big Tech. </p><p>While some argue these businesses would be better off regulating themselves, a watchdog would serve to scrutinise their powers, adjust their market power to allow competition to thrive, and demand greater transparency to build trust, resulting in a more positive online environment for all.Acceptance is the first stage of recovery It certainly now seems that there are winds of change sweeping through the technology industry and the wider business world. Shaping the idea of a 'Global Britain' into a reality Even the tech titans themselves are calling for change. Just this month execs from Google, Amazon, and Twitter approached the US Senate asking for regulation. Mark Zuckerberg admitted that some regulation of this industry is[4] inevitable, whilst Apple's Tim Cook acknowledged that well-crafted legislation is necessary[5]. Meanwhile, European tech companies - from Spotify to Deezer - collaborated in a joint letter pushing the EU government[6] to toughen laws against the tech giants in order to rebalance the relationship between apps and vendors that are reliant on platforms such as Facebook and Google for their services.The growing global appetite for regulationThere have already been regulatory moves to limit the information, and therefore power, that the tech giants hold on us. In the UK we have GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), a new law implemented by the European Union to protect personal data and privacy online. The US, India, and Brazil are all announcing similar legislation to GDPR to protect consumers. This includes California's new privacy law[7], which will come into force in 2020 to establish a consumer right of privacy, including the option to have data deleted if consumers chose to do so. Being the home of Silicon Valley, the well-known hub for start-ups and global technology companies, this is a very significant move for the US state. To improve workplace wellness, build a supportive community We are also seeing a shift in China, where there is a growing push to strike the right balance between allowing home-grown internet giants like Alibaba and Tencent the room to evolve and expand, whilst also being wary of how these technology companies will transform and impact the industry landscape. Whilst these are all positive steps in the right direction, for a watchdog to make a positive and measurable impact, it needs to have a global outlook. The world of big tech is borderless, and consumers are increasingly global in the way they interact with businesses and with each other. Therefore, internet regulation should not become a purely local issue, subject to local legislation, but treated within a global context.Re-adjusting the power balanceI believe we will see this demand for regulation increase over the coming months, as smaller tech businesses and creative industry leaders seek to rock the tech titans' stronghold to level the playing field and make it fairer for all. We still have a long way to go to readjust the balance of power when it comes to the tech titans. However, one thing is clear - self regulation is not working and is causing unrest to brew in the tech world. As a result, we will begin to see a significant shift in the way that the global digital advertising industry is viewed and managed - and it could only start with regulation. However, in today's world, a governing body that is able to implement suitable regulations - that are sensible and fair - is now our only solution to keeping unfair practices in check. A well-crafted regulatory watchdog would ensure that the activity of Facebook and other similar tech businesses is investigated and examined fairly and would be reassuring for many of us by making the industry far more transparent.

Recent events, where mass privacy breaches have occurred, have raised public awareness of the pitfalls of big data and the elevation of profit over privacy by some corporate actors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a consequence, public authorities are now demanding more comprehensive answers from big tech, and a healthy public policy discussion has finally begun. Many have rightly observed that data is becoming a powerful economic engine in an increasingly digitized world. Data is now a highly sought-after commodity, and many big tech companies have built their business models on monetizing data.</p><p>With artificial intelligence on the verge of becoming the next force in big data, everyone should be concerned about what some have called \"surveillance capitalism.\"</p><p>One only has to consider the future implications for fin tech, health care, autonomous vehicles and how we will build smart cities. Should we allow corporate interests to monetize personal data and dictate the rules of the game?</p><p>The implications are not just economic but also sociological and political, potentially undermining the democratic principles upon which modern societies operate. As we have seen, digital platforms can be used for nefarious purposes. The use of automated algorithms makes monitoring potential abuse even more challenging to those charged with oversight.</p><p>How we collectively decide what the rules of the game for this new data-driven economy is, I would argue, one of the most important issues facing global policymakers today.</p><p>At the core of these considerations is the fundamental issue of data ownership. Who owns and controls data, for what purpose and to what end is it being employed?</p><p>As a CEO of a company that made security and privacy not only a priority but a core element and value proposition of its business, I feel we have a collective responsibility to tackle this issue. At BlackBerry, our mission is to protect data, not to exploit it. It is my strong belief that every individual should own their own data. It should be yours, and yours only.</p><p>Data protection and security should be paramount. Privacy should be embedded by design in the development of products and services. This is what we do - and beyond - as a global company.</p><p>There are important global governance elements to data protection. Do we need global rules regulating the trade of data? With the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union has just set a new regulatory standard for customer privacy. Increasingly, regulatory frameworks based on privacy - what experts call data realms - are creating different playing fields.</p><p>We should aim at setting the bar high, abide by strong data protection principles and welcome responsible and balanced regulatory enforcement mechanisms that permit consumers to take advantage of cutting edge technologies.

It's clear the AI revolution will impact society drastically, both for good and bad. Recently, using natural-language processing and machine-learning techniques, Canadian company BluDot sifted through global news reports, airline data, and reports of animal disease outbreaks to issue an alert about the current Coronavirus outbreak[3], days ahead of official organizations such as the World Health Organization. But an AI survey[4] last year found about 70% of the public and technology leaders believe AI will lead to greater social isolation and a loss of human intellect and creativity. Already, data collected about us without our knowledge and processed by AI applications manipulate[5] our wants and beliefs, effectively controlling people for commercial or political purposes. </p><p>Deepfake videos created with readily available AI tools pose an additional challenge, further undermining[6] our ability to know what is real and what is fake. And, of course, AI is expected to take many of our jobs.Governments are at cross purposesGiven the force of this technology, shouldn't governments be bracing for its effect with robust regulations? The U.S. government so far is taking a mostly hands-off approach. U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios warned[7] federal agencies against over-regulating companies developing artificial intelligence. There are views[8], too, that the U.S. government doesn't want to issue meaningful regulation, that the administration finds regulation antithetical to its core beliefs. There is greater movement underway by the European Union (EU), which will issue a paper[9] in February proposing new AI regulations for #8216;high-risk sectors,#8217; such as healthcare and transport. These rules could inhibit AI innovation in the EU, but officials say they want to harmonize[10] and streamline rules in the region.China is pursuing a different strategy designed to tilt the playing field to its advantage as exemplified by its standards efforts[11] for facial recognition[12]. Ultimately, it is in the worldwide public interest for the AI superpowers, the U.S. and China, to collaborate on common AI principles. But at present it appears there is no ongoing dialog[13], effectively creating a regulatory standoff. Perhaps that is okay, as the just released 2020 Edelman Trust Barometer[14] highlights a lack of faith from the public in the ability of government to understand how to regulate AI and other emerging technologies.<url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tech_out_of_control.jpg?resize=633%2C345&amp;strip=all?strip=all\">https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tech_out_of_control.jpg?resize=633%2C345&amp;strip=all?strip=all</url> Above: Source: 2020 Edelman Trust Barometer This governance lag is due both to conflicting national and regional interests and to the high velocity with which AI technologies have progressed. These twin drivers are at the crux of the challenge for how to regulate this revolution. Government may try but is largely unequipped to create and enforce meaningful regulation for public benefit. That leaves private industry to foster regulation. But will they do it?Big Tech wants a light touchThose leading the AI revolution are the giant technology companies #8212; what Amy Webb, the Founder of theFuture Today Institute[15], refers to as #8216;The Big Nine.#8217; These include U.S. firms Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and Apple plus China's Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. Arguably, it's not only the future of AI that they control but possibly the future of humanity[16]. Taken together, they form a global oligopoly with near total control of the technology and its underlying data. While there is growing consensus among them on the need for some form of regulation, they've voiced different views[17] on how to go about it. At Davos this year. Ginni Rometty, now the former IBM CEO, called for #8216;precision regulation[18],#8217; to allow for AI technical advancement and the ability to compete in a global marketplace. This view is similar to one espoused by Tom Wheeler of the Brookings Center for Innovation[19]. He says regulation should focus on the technology's effects[20] rather than chase broad-based fears about the technology itself. They are both basically saying that companies should have the freedom to create leading technologies without regulations slowing them down. Alphabet's Pichai recently advised[21] the European Commission to take a #8216;proportionate approach#8217; when drafting AI rules and followed this with an op-ed[22] in which he argued that AI technology needs to be harnessed for good and available to everyone. Microsoft president Brad Smith said the world #8216;should not wait[23]for the technology to mature#8217; before regulating AI. While it's possible the Big Nine companies have the public's interest at heart when they propose regulation strategies, it's equally plausible that they see regulations as a way to increase barriers to entry[24] into the AI space, further cementing their leadership positions while fending-off potential anti-trust[25] lawsuits. Speeches at Davos and op-eds are all well and fine and perhaps heartfelt, but real actions point to the conflicting interests of these companies. Mostly they support regulation that is light on specifics[26], and they often oppose[27] more encompassing (or what they see as restrictive) efforts. The regulations that emerge over the next several years are likely to be a patchwork, varying by geography and degrees of specificity, open to interpretation and with enough loopholes to be largely ineffective.The public is just trying to adaptThis gives rise to a larger question about whether the AI revolution can be effectively regulated at all. In the meantime, Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff said in a recent op-ed[28]: #8216;Without law, we scramble to hide in our own lives, while our children debate encryption strategies around the dinner table and students wear masks to public protests as protection from facial recognition systems built with family photos.#8217; The AI revolution is underway. Conventional wisdom is that people are ultimately in control. There may still be time and opportunity for meaningful worldwide regulation, however the conflicting views between governments make this unlikely, and vast[29] industry lobbying will strive to keep rules effectively weak. In a fast-moving revolution, however, the notion of control may only be an illusion.Gary Grossman is the Senior VP of Technology Practice atEdelman[30]and Global Lead of the Edelman AI Center of Excellence.

Despite delays caused by bad weather, the police believes the\u00a0technology could be the solution to catching criminals with fewer\u00a0officers.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But mounting privacy concerns over use of the\u00a0technology have\u00a0prompted\u00a0legal action from\u00a0campaigners, who claim that it violates human rights.</p><p>The\u00a0technology isn't just being used by the police. If you are on social media, go to a concert or travel abroad, odds are your face has been recorded hundreds and perhaps\u00a0thousands\u00a0of times.</p><p>The technology that most maps your face is likely to be in your pocket. If you use your face to unlock your screens or make payments on apps, or even use social media applications such as Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook, your face is being analysed and stored.</p><p>Banks including\u00a0HSBC, Barclays and Lloyds have already launched facial recognition software to provide an additional layer of security to their online banking services. Chinese giant Alibaba launched a \"pay with a smile\" function earlier this year while\u00a0some US insurance companies prompt users to take a photo of themselves to get a quote for their services.</p><p>But that's not all. If you use the \"e-passport\" lane at Heathrow, facial recognition-enabled gates are enabling you to cut\u00a0queues in exchange for a quick scan of your face.</p><p>Soon, facial recognition will power the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/12/14/police-test-controversial-facial-recognition-technology-central/\">largest automation project so far in the UK</url>, as Heathrow plans to replace passport queues and check people in with the technology before they depart to verify their identity.</p><p>\"This is a good example of where facial recognition will blur the lines between convenience and surveillance,\" says Zak Doffman, chief executive of facial recognition technology company Digital Barriers. \"The same cameras that check whether you are booked into a flight can also check whether you are on a no-fly list.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/12/14/police-test-controversial-facial-recognition-technology-central/\">Facial recognition technology | At a glance</url></p><p>He believes this technology is going to \"truly take off\" in 2019 and will be a focus for law enforcement and\u00a0private companies. After all, this technology has become a powerful security tool -\u00a0casinos have begun to use it to stop gambling addicts from entering the premises, Doffman explains, while some schools in the US have started using it\u00a0to reduce the risk of\u00a0mass shootings.</p><p>\"That whole space is going to be exacerbated by the availability of cameras,\" he says.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/12/14/police-test-controversial-facial-recognition-technology-central/\">UK retailers\u00a0including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Marks &amp; Spencer, Boots, and WHSmith</url> started using facial recognition technology in their self-service tills for the first time last year, in an effort to dissuade shoplifters\u00a0and provide age verification without needing to interact with a human being.\u00a0</p><p>Amazon has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/12/14/police-test-controversial-facial-recognition-technology-central/\">criticised for patenting\u00a0facial recognition technology</url> that would record other people's faces through their smart doorbells, and match them to a database of suspicious people. The e-commerce giant has come under fire for its \"rekognition\" technology, as US shareholders       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/12/14/police-test-controversial-facial-recognition-technology-central/\">become uncomfortable</url> with its ties to law enforcement and immigration officers.\u00a0</p><p>Even churches are starting to use facial recognition technology to try to find out how often people in the congregation go to mass.</p><p>US facial recognition technology company Churchix, which claims to work with many churches around the world, allows them to upload pictures of their community to a system that matches them automatically as they walk through the door.</p><p>This system is capable of identifying \"members, suspects, employees, students and basically anyone you have interest in\", according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/12/14/police-test-controversial-facial-recognition-technology-central/\">the product description</url> .</p><p>In fact\u00a0anywhere in the UK equipped with any of the estimated\u00a05.9 million CCTV cameras,\u00a0including 500,000 in London, has likely recorded your face. A\u00a0station, a bus or a train, for example - can easily be wired up to facial recognition software and used \u00a0to analyse people's faces to combat crime, or find missing people.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/12/14/police-test-controversial-facial-recognition-technology-central/\">Facial recognition, fake views and virtual excursions - is this the cruise ship of the future?</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/12/14/police-test-controversial-facial-recognition-technology-central/\">Is this a problem</url> ?

We are still horrified to see how quickly this technology is expanding in use throughout the private sector into retail environments,\" she says.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/12/14/police-test-controversial-facial-recognition-technology-central/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>Evan Selinger, professor in the Department of Philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, argues that private sector use of facial recognition technology is just as problematic in the hands of private companies as the Government.</p><p>\"Face recognition technology is an especially dangerous surveillance tool for governments and big tech companies to weaponize, with the links between public and private sector use growing stronger by the day and not simply because data can flow between one sector to the other,\" he argues.</p><p>\"Consumers are seduced into using a range of products and services that, in some cases, aren't necessarily problematic in themselves but, collectively, work together to produce a harmful result -one that tech companies don't acknowledge, much less take responsibility for, and whose power, for the most part, remains outside the topics covered in policy debates.\"</p><p>The danger, he argues, is the \"normalisation\" of facial recognition technology, which could \"dampen the public's capacity to appreciate the threats face surveillance poses to privacy and civil liberties\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-51379410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VB3-NCS1-F021-64R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><timeReceived>3:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

They were also grilled about what their companies did to exclude criminal networks (human trafficking and drug dealing) from their platforms.</p><p>These appearances came hot on the heels of US President Donald Trump voicing his outrage about how he and his Republican agenda were treated by Google. He felt that he featured neither prominently nor positively enough in Google search results.</p><p>There is good reason for the focus on new media. We should look at three themes, which are important to us all.</p><p>The first one is privacy and how we can protect our personal data. The second is how news is reported in new media. The third is how to stop interference by foreign governments and non-state actors in democratic processes, and how to prevent people such as human traffickers and drug dealers from using new media as a means to their their criminal ends. The common denominator underlying all these themes is the role of algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI). This is precisely where things become difficult, because these phenomena of technology have an ever-increasing influence on our daily lives, which we \u2014 and at times the tech giants themselves \u2014 fail to sufficiently understand.</p><p>When it comes to personal data, is clear that the big tech companies have an obligation to protect our identities, but that is more easily said than done. They are businesses with shareholders, which means they need to generate profit; as long as users can post their texts and photos free of charge, the money has to come from somewhere. This is where the advertisers come in. Clever algorithms match users with products they may be interested in, which is a slippery slope. New-media platform owners have an obligation to explain to users that as long as they do not pay to use these networks, they are not customers \u2014 they are the product. It is an inescapable fact that products are bought and sold in any marketplace, but that does not absolve tech companies from doing their utmost to protect users' personal data.</p><p>Trump's pet peeve about how he is portrayed on Google is again underpinned by algorithms, which determine Google search results. When it comes to news rankings, Trump may actually have a point. Anyone can post pretty much anything they want on Twitter or Facebook, but where it appears in Google search results is then determined by our friend, the anonymous algorithm. Few people know exactly how these algorithms work, but broadly, Google ranks articles according to how often users link to them. It therefore follows that established and trusted sources such as The New York Times, the Washington Post and, in the UK, The Guardian, have an inbuilt advantage \u2014 and none is particularly noted for being a Trump cheerleader.</p><p>In addition, traditional media such as newspapers or television stations employ editors and armies of fact checkers to ascertain the veracity of an article or a package. When that \"human lens\" is replaced by anonymous AI and algorithms, we lose context, and with it objectivity. (By the way, in my experience Arab News has one of the best editorial and fact-checking departments; for instance, no statistic is published without the writer submitting its source.)</p><p>Lastly we are dealing with foreign state and non-state actors trying to influence elections and the political process. In her testimony, Sandberg admitted that Facebook had ignored this problem for too long. Here again it is difficult for the tech companies to control the political ramifications of what is posted as long as algorithms and AI do the checking. They would need armies of human checkers of sources and facts to deal effectively with this issue. Facebook and the others are going down that route and it will have an impact on their bottom line, which Wall Street will not like.</p><p>The common denominator of the technology companies' woes is, perversely, technology itself; how much are we as users willing to delegate to artificial intelligence and the algorithms underlying it? This is where tech companies and academia have to do a lot more to understand how these factors will influence our future. They also have to engage with regulators, politicians and the general public to help them become comfortable with this brave new world.</p><p>Prof. Jim Al-Khalili, incoming president of the British Science Association, declared recently that AI was bigger that all other issues facing humanity. While he may perhaps have erred on the side of hyperbole, it is certain that we need to understand better how AI, algorithms, blockchain, etc. will influence our lives. This goes beyond the scope of what tech companies can do into a broader debate reaching all corners of society.</p><p>*Cornelia Meyer is a business consultant, macro-economist and energy expert.\u00a0Twitter: @MeyerResources</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-125504235</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T75-1PC1-JDJN-6456-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 9, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Soulless corporations pollute the planet, overpay their bosses and gouge consumers. Big tech turns us into screen addicts. Big Pharma makes life-saving drugs unaffordable. Big banks sell us dodgy mortgages. One cannot help wondering, listening to the chatter on social media, whether corporations ever do anything right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Actually, they do, says Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University in Virginia. In his latest book \"Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero,\" he argues that many of the gripes about business are ill-informed. And where there are real concerns, such as fraud or excessive concentrations of power, he believes that wise regulation can minimise the harm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Cowen has earned a reputation as a shrewd and iconoclastic thinker. In his blog Marginal Revolution he relishes debunking junk economics with data. The Economist's Open Future initiative is publishing an excerpt from \"Big Business\" that presents the arc of his argument. We probe it further in a short interview that follows.</p><p>*       *      *</p><p>From \"Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero\" by Tyler Cowen (St. Martin<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'</emphasis>s Press, 2019)</p><p>We live in an age when the reputation of business is under siege. Among Democrats, for instance, the word \"socialism\" now polls better than does \"capitalism.\" But Republicans, while they pay greater lip service to some business ideals, are not in practice much better. Many of them have quite readily followed President Donald Trump into his attacks on free trade, immigration, outsourcing, and the American media (which is labeled \"the enemy of the people\")--all fundamentally anti-business stances.</p><p>Business, quite simply, has become underrated, and thus I am writing a contrarian book that ought not to be contrarian at all. All of the criticisms one might mount against the corporate form--some of which are valid--pale in contrast to two straightforward and indeed essential virtues. First, business makes most of the stuff we enjoy and consume. Second, business is what gives most of us jobs. The two words that follow most immediately from the world of business are \"prosperity\" and \"opportunity.\"</p><p>Without business we would not have:</p><p>* Ships, trains, and cars</p><p>* Electricity, lighting, and heating equipment</p><p>* Most of our food supply</p><p>* Most of our lifesaving pharmaceuticals</p><p>* Clothes for our children</p><p>* Our telephones and smartphones</p><p>* The books we love to read</p><p>* The ability to access, more or less immediately, so much of the world's online information</p><p>And let's not forget your paycheck. \"Meeting payroll,\" to invoke a now old-fashioned phrase, is nothing less than a heroic act. Someone or some group put in the hard work and thought up the innovations required to create a company from scratch--I know it's easy enough to take this for granted if you aren't the one who did it. On top of the paycheck, jobs are among our biggest sources of pride and a significant way to meet friends and establish social networks.</p><p>[...]</p><p>We can all admit that we are a nation sorely in need of virtue, specifically in our political realm. The growing polarization of today's politics has made our government at best hopelessly sclerotic and at worst prone to unpredictable lurches. This polarization has also spurred out-of-control political correctness and censorship, rampant racism and injustice, new waves of violent marches and shootings, and an array of indictments and corruption charges. Many features of contemporary America are wonderful, including the high level of trust in the corporate sector, but the weirdness in our government has been rising.</p><p>In contrast, the world of American business has never been more productive, more tolerant, and more cooperative. It is not just a source of GDP and prosperity; it is a ray of normalcy and predictability in its steady focus on producing what can be profitably sold to customers. Successful businesses grow dynamically, but they also try to create oases of stability and tolerance in which they can perfect their production methods. These oases help to attract and retain talent and make it possible for businesses to offer consumers a steady stream of \"comfort products.\" Business helps carve out spaces for love, friendship, creativity, and human caring by producing the resources that make our lives not just tolerable but comfortable.</p><p>American big business in particular has led the way toward making America more socially inclusive. McDonald's, General Electric, Procter &amp; Gamble, and many of the major tech companies, among others, were defining health and other legal benefits for same-sex partners before the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. Apple, Pfizer, Microsoft, Deutsche Bank, PayPal, and Marriott, among others, spoke out or protested the North Carolina law that sought to specify which restrooms transgender people had to use; the outcry led to the eventual repeal of that law. This push for tolerance shouldn't come as any surprise. Big business has lots of customers and relies on the value of brand names. It doesn't want any group of those customers to feel put out or discriminated against or to have cause for complaint, not least because we live in an age of social media. Profit maximization alone--not to mention the consciences of some CEOs--puts big business these days on the side of inclusion and tolerance.</p><p>Larger firms, in particular, which you can think of as wildly successful businesses and thus embodiments of the logic of business, tend to be more tolerant of employee personal tastes than smaller firms. A local baker might be reluctant to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, but Sara Lee, which tries to build very broadly based national markets for its products, is happy to sell to all. The bigger companies need to protect their broader reputations and recruit large numbers of talented workers, including those from minority groups. They can't survive and grow just by cultivating a few narrow networks of local white men.</p><p>I have a complaint about America today, and it is simple: we don't love business enough.</p><p>[...]</p><p>I'm here to speak up for business, to persuade you that it deserves more of your love and less hate. Perhaps, like you, I am not entirely comfortable with ceding so much of the daily human realm to apparently selfish, profit-maximizing, and even sometimes corrupt entities, but on closer examination this is a better bargain than it might seem at first. Indeed, at its best, business gives our lives more scope for the heroic and the noble, as we can use the outputs of business to satisfy our own creative desires and to better our lives.</p><p>I'll argue that a lot of the most common criticisms of American business don't stand up to scrutiny. For instance, it's often claimed that American business is too focused on quarterly earnings statements, at the expense of a longer-run perspective. But in fact there is plenty of evidence that companies can think long-term when appropriate. Sometimes short-run problems are easier or more important to solve, or they are the bridge to longer-run success, and the evidence at hand indicates that American business does a pretty good job of looking to the future.</p><p>Then there's the question of American CEO pay, which Edward Luce, a Financial Times columnist (and a friend of mine), described on Twitter as \"unconscionable.\" American CEOs are paid much more than they used to be, but these pay hikes have pretty much moved in tandem with the size and valuations of the firms they manage. Contrary to common claims, it is hard to establish that CEOs as a whole are ripping off their shareholders with manipulated pay packages, as a look at the numbers will show that high compensation is the price of attracting top talent. Running a large corporation involves taking on more roles than ever before, including media, government, and public relations, formulating a vision, understanding consumers and communicating to them, building cross-cultural global strategies, working with governments, and keeping the company out of trouble, in addition to having a lot of sector-specific expertise. That limits the number of eligible candidates who might succeed at the job and thus it boosts their pay, according to basic principles of supply and demand. Today's CEOs are literally superachievers, and it should come as no surprise that they are compensated accordingly.</p><p>One of the most frequently cited whipping boys is the financial sector, which is portrayed as too large and out of control. The reality is that the financial sector has held to a fairly constant 2 percent share of American wealth, though of course that wealth has grown and so has finance with it. The ability of American finance to mobilize savings into riskier forms of equity and venture capital has brought Americans hundreds of billions of dollars in value each year, and those gains significantly outweigh the costs typically attributed to the financial sector. Nor is the financial sector draining the American economy of all its talent for other endeavors, as evidenced by the rise of American manufacturing output to ever higher levels.</p><p>Most of all, business is criticized for being fraudulent and ripping us off. While there is plenty of fraud in business, the commercial sector isn't any more fraudulent than individuals in other capacities, and it may even be somewhat less fraudulent. Business can make us better people--for example, by teaching us how to cooperate better--and the best evidence indicates that, on net, businesses do not make us worse compared with our participation in other institutions. A lot of us were somewhat dishonest to begin with, and if you have doubts, just look at the individual lies and misrepresentations in online dating profiles.</p><p>So many of the problems with business are in fact problems with us, and they reflect the underlying and fairly universal imperfections of human nature. Yet we respond to this truth somewhat irrationally. While we suspect business of wrongdoing, at the same time we expect corporations to give us jobs and take care of us, to give us a network of friends, to solve our social problems, and to give us risk-free consumption experiences.</p><p>[...]</p><p>Particularly now in the age of social media, which allows direct connections with consumers and offers them the chance to provide direct feedback when things go wrong, the most successful businesses have a kind of messianic view of their role in society--venerating the delivery of goods and services to the consumer, or perhaps promoting a particular vision of how society ought to be. Workers wish to believe their toil is saving the environment, fighting poverty, and strengthening America as a nation. A business that instills in its workers and managers a sincere belief in such goals has a better chance of building a durable competitive advantage than a business that does not. It will attract more consumer loyalty and better and more cooperative partners at the business-to-business level. Think of it this way: Who wants to marry someone who is always selfishly seeking to optimize happiness from the marriage?</p><p>Ayn Rand showed a deep insight into the character of successful business when she emphasized that it can be a vehicle for the achievement of heroic goals. The character of Hank Rearden in Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged stressed the dignity, honor, and reason involved in good productive work, and he came to see it as the very foundation of America's greatness.</p><p>It is often those business leaders who are religious or have strong ideologies of another kind who grasp most clearly the relevance of a business having a mission above and beyond profit. They understand that the business and religious or ideological sides of their lives are by no means totally separate. They understand they can do best by their shareholders--and the broader society--by tying together the business, religious, ethical, and ideological perspectives in one bundle. [...]</p><p>In other words, business at its best is a fundamentally ethical enterprise.</p><p>__________</p><p>Excerpted from \"Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero\" by Tyler Cowen. Copyright \u00a9 2019 by the author and reprinted with permission of St. Martin's Press.</p><p>*       *      *</p><p>An interview with Tyler Cowen</p><p>The Economist: The concentration of power of business seems intense. Do we need to make capitalism more competitive, and if so, how?</p><p>Tyler Cowen: I see concentration of business in some sectors as a problem, but by no means all. For most goods and services, Americans have far more choice, choice of supplier and diversity of product than ever before. Consumers know this intuitively and it has turned out that recent claims about increased concentration in the American economy are largely wrong on a factual basis. In most sectors there is more actual competition, and the dominant players we do have, such as Amazon and Walmart, typically are lowering rather than raising prices when they enter markets. For the tech sector, there are dominant product suppliers such as Google and Facebook, but they are hardly following the old monopolist playbook of higher prices and restricted output.</p><p>There is too much concentration in the hospital sector, and in K-12 education: it's a government semi-monopoly, and it's hard to compete with the free government product unless you are selling to wealthy families. We also have some outrageously high prices for real estate and higher education, but those are due to supply constraints and excess regulation, rather than private monopoly. In all of these cases I would consider legal remedies to give consumers a better deal.</p><p>The Economist: What do you fear most about the effects of the anti-business sentiment?</p><p>Mr Cowen: For a start, I fear we will split up our big tech companies, or at the very least severely distract senior management with antitrust suits. An alternative route we might go down is to enact severe privacy legislation which raises costs to new market entrants, and cements in the power of the incumbents. Either of those two paths would be a mistake.</p><p>Most generally, I fear that the status of going into business will fall, as it already has in much of Europe. It would hurt America greatly to lose its genius and distinct preference for business activity. Culture really does matter, and America stands at risk of losing its pro-business, pro-entrepreneurship leanings.</p><p>The Economist: What do businesses need to do to improve their image, other than PR?</p><p>Mr Cowen: Business has to realise it always will be held to a higher standard, perhaps unjustly so, but still that is a reality. That means business ought to opt for less fraud, less lobbying for crony capitalism, more social conscience when it comes to pollution and climate change, and also bolder, less bureaucratic decision-making procedures. We are pretty far from that world.</p><p>As I stress in the book, a lot of business is pretty fraudulent. The thing is, human beings are fraudulent too; maybe more so outside of a business context. Ask a simple question: who lies more, the company Match.com, or the online daters filling out their profiles? The answer is both obvious and sad.</p><p>The Economist: What can individuals and groups do to hold businesses to account?</p><p>Mr Cowen: Search for the best price; it benefits the whole market. Speak up when you are unhappy, noting that the internet makes the monitoring of business quality easier than ever before. When it comes to health care, educate yourself. So much of the waste in the American economy is in that sector. And, if you really see persistent business failures in a particular area, consider starting a business yourself to fix them. Or recommend the business idea to someone else. All of the best businesses today were at some point in the past unrealised dreams.</p><p>The Economist: If we can't look to the political sphere for leadership to address global challenges, are we right to turn to business for that leadership? Ought they to rise to that mission, even if it strays from their central remit of making and selling their widgets?</p><p>Mr Cowen: Most of the biggest global challenges will require contributions from both government and business. Take climate change. Yes, governments need to regulate more and tax carbon emissions. But we also need businesses to step up and innovate. We're seeing a systematic tendency to villainise the role of business in carbon emissions and pollution. Yes, business has had a major role in this, but so have consumers, so have voters, so have all of us. The reality is that we will need the help of business to solve the problem, and we should not make this a question of us versus them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W66-SJ21-F03B-T1WS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">251202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2804\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Economist Newspapers, NA, Incorporated All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economist.Com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37727\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 24, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XKR</classCode><className>BUSINESS ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook are being accused of a wide variety of sins: promulgating fake news, stifling innovative competitors, and crushing mom-and-pop shops, to name a few. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some critics have gone so far as to call for these powerful companies to be converted into public utilities. Others want the government to use its antitrust powers to break up big tech.</p><p>This borders on the absurd.</p><p>For the past half century, the U.S. government has followed the best standard that economists and legal scholars have come up with to define anti-competitive behavior: Are these companies threatening or reducing the welfare of consumers as determined by the prices, quality of products and services, and choices consumers face and the benefits of economic innovation that consumers enjoy?</p><p>This is the right standard. Another standard that could be used in antitrust enforcement is essentially \"big is bad\" - the presumption that large and powerful companies should be suspect because of the political and economic influence they wield. </p><p>This vague, fuzzier standard is inferior. It ignores the good things that come from size, including the ability to produce output at lower cost. It also invites regulatory mischief. And it weakens the focus on the benefits competitive markets offer to consumers.</p><p>By the standard of consumer welfare, big tech is a blessing. I have been using Gmail every day for over a decade. It operates flawlessly. And its search feature is so good that it acts as a virtual diary, allowing me to revisit correspondence from years ago with just a few keystrokes. Google, the creator and operator of Gmail, has charged me exactly zero dollars for this fantastic product. </p><p>Amazon is pushing prices so low that some believe it is reducing the rate of price inflation for the overall economy. Apple put a sleek computer - and the ability to access previously unimaginable quantities of knowledge - in our pockets.</p><p>In short, by the standards of consumer welfare - providing a variety of high-quality products, innovation, low prices - big tech is one of the best things to happen in the economy in decades.</p><p>A more subtle argument against big tech involves the future: Yes, many new and innovative products are given away free today. But what effect is big tech having on tomorrow's prices and innovation?</p><p>This argument assumes that big tech is stifling the competition today that tomorrow would lead to innovation or lower prices. I'm not sold. It is certainly true that consumer welfare can be harmed by the absence of products that might have been created if a market had had more competition. </p><p>But look at what is actually happening: Big tech firms plow revenue into research and development in order to continue creating new and better products. These companies are innovation powerhouses, and there are no signs that that will change.</p><p>Are they stifling competition in news and information? Hardly. It wasn't long ago that the average American's choice in news consumption was the morning paper and three networks for the nightly news. Thanks to Google, for example, you can type in a few keywords and read dozens of news stories on your topic of choice.</p><p>Because of the importance of network size and upfront investment, does the tech sector naturally tend toward concentration? This is a reasonable argument. But it must contend with the fact that the web browser Netscape fell to Internet Explorer, that Hotmail was displaced by Gmail, that America Online declined, that many speculate Apple's ability to innovate is descending, and that Facebook \"is losing its teenage users\" because - in the words of The Guardian - \"parents killed it.\"</p><p>In other words: These companies haven't been dominant for that long, there were dominant tech companies before them, and we shouldn't assume that the current market leaders will dominate forever.</p><p>Yet another concern is that the tendency of tech giants to gobble up startups is suppressing innovation - Facebook's purchase of Instagram and Google's purchase of YouTube, as examples. </p><p>But it's just as possible that the opportunity for an entrepreneur to create something great and sell it to big tech encourages more innovation than it suppresses. And by the standards of consumer welfare, it is not clear that it matters whether Facebook or shareholders or the founders own Instagram.</p><p>And let's assume for the sake of argument that Amazon's master plan actually is to dominate all retail sales - including groceries - by charging low prices that squeeze the profit margins of its competitors (again, a great thing for your pocketbook) and then, at some point in the future, jacking up prices and harvesting outsize profits.</p><p>Even if that lay in store, the appropriate regulatory response would be to wait until much more evidence accumulates that Amazon actually might harm consumers and reduce competition. Online sales make up less than 10 percent of all retail sales. Walmart's revenue is more than twice Amazon's. It's not time to call in the trust busters.</p><p>This is not to say that big tech is without concern. There is a conversation to be had about the influence that social media companies like Facebook have on the public debate and in our political system. Its guiding light must be the preservation of free speech. </p><p>But issues like the role of bots, the hosting of political content, and the amount of responsibility Facebook has over the content on its platform should be discussed. In addition, it is reasonable to be concerned about consumer ownership of social network data and search and purchasing histories, and about data security.</p><p>But break up big tech? No. That would shatter some of the greatest achievements of the American economy.</p><p>Michael R.

Although NSO has been damaged by claims its technology has been used by rogue governments to target human rights activists, journalists and politicians, they're part of a regulated and flourishing multi-million pound intercept industry that sells this kind of tech to law enforcement and intelligence agencies across the world. But before anyone feels sorry for WhatsApp, let's consider the double standards at play.</p><p>Last month WhatsApp published a statement saying it had filed a complaint in the US federal courts against NSO, drawing heavily on genuine public concerns about privacy. \"Mobile phones provide us with great utility, but turned against us they can reveal our locations and our private messages and record sensitive conversations we have with others...governments and companies need to do more to protect vulnerable groups and individuals from these attacks.\" But the same accusation could easily be levelled at WhatsApp.</p><p>Last year, inspired by an interview given by the former director of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, on the BBC's Today programme, I examined WhatsApp terms and conditions to see exactly what happens when we click to accept. Mr Hannigan's view is that Facebook's primary goal is to squeeze every drop of profit from its users' data. \"This isn't a kind of fluffy charity providing free services,\" he said, \"It's a very hard-headed international business and these big tech companies are essentially the world's biggest global advertisers, that's where they make their billions.\"</p><p>I would go further: if we're talking about technology that can be turned against us, then frankly WhatsApp is the world leader in information exploitation and bulk data collection. </p><p>Most people, of course, don't read the terms and conditions. Why would we when WhatsApp's extend to 29 pages of legalese? The first condition we, as users, agree to is that \"WhatsApp works and shares information with other Facebook companies.\" This means our details are shared with dozens of other companies, all in the field of data user collection.</p><p>Another reads: \"You provide us ...t he phone number of WhatsApp users and other contacts in your mobile address book on a regular basis.\" In other words, this is the entirety of your business and social network, your intellectual property and that of your employers and/or employees. This is the reason companies, corporations and governments need to be wary when permitting the use of platforms like WhatsApp - it's all too easy to simply click away company data.</p><p>WhatsApp's privacy policy covers \"the collection, use, processing and sharing of...information to the United States and other countries globally where we have or use facilities, service providers, affiliated companies and partners ... you grant WhatsApp a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty free ... licence to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, display and perform the information (including your content) you upload, submit, store, send or receive...\".</p><p>In the US, the lawsuits against Facebook over data privacy issues are piling up, which might explain why it's working so hard to shift the debate in its favour. One, Zellmer vs Facebook, is a class action that highlights the case of Clayton Zellmer who, despite never registering for a Facebook account, says the firm has still built a facial biometric profile for him based on photos uploaded by other users. </p><p>According to the legal papers, Facebook has used advanced facial recognition technology to create and store detailed face templates from more than 1 billion users, potentially putting us at risk from identify theft if these identifiers fall into the wrong hands.</p><p>All of this hardly makes WhatsApp the protector of privacy and security. But there is another reason Facebook is keen to flex its muscles by taking on NSO. Founder Mark Zuckerberg wants to establish end-to-end encryption across all three of its apps, including Messenger and Instagram, a move which the US and the UK governments warn will allow paedophiles, terrorists and other serious criminals to conceal their activities. The US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children have estimated that 70 per cent of the illegal content and activity would be lost with encryption.</p><p>The simple fact is that all those in Silicon Valley have engineered us to agree, on a mass scale, to the bulk collection of our data. When playing the privacy card to galvanise support, Will Cathcart might start a little closer to home.</p><p>Paul Manister is a communications security consultant.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GHERLD-NQ228427423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GHERLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFR-YCP1-F0PR-908M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142728</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Herald (Glasgow)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51350\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

(S), could have far-reaching implications for many in the world of wireless, if approved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) and\u00a0big tech companies\u00a0such as Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) may have to take a closer look at how they fit into a consolidated wireless industry, according to one wireless industry executive.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alex Gellman, CEO of wireless infrastructure company Vertical Bridge LLL, said in an interview\u00a0that a cable\u00a0operator, satellite TV provider or even a Silicon Valley power could be enticed to enter the wireless business themselves as the mobile carriers merge.</p><p>\"A lot of the ingredients are in the primordial soup and its waiting for a bolt of lightning to create life,\" said Gellman, regarding the potential for an outsider to enter the wireless business.\u00a0</p><p>Cable companies, big tech firms and other ancillary telecoms will need to decide whether they want to buy, invest or partner more closely with a wireless company to stay competitive.</p><p>Comcast, for instance, sells wireless through Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) is preparing to launch a similar service, which is dubbed a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, in wireless industry lingo.\u00a0A Comcast spokesman said the company's mobile pact with Verizon is \"off to a great start\" and has added 577,000 subscribers since it's launch in June.</p><p>\"It's difficult to control your fate and have a profitable business when you're going through an MVNO or a re-seller type structure,\" Gellman said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dish Network Corp. (DISH) has purchased wireless spectrum over the last decade or so, and has told the Federal Communications Commission that it plans to launch a 5G service.\u00a0</p><p>Dish has been looking for an investor or partner to build out a network, and the company's wireless ambitions have been the subject of lengthy speculation.</p><p>Charlie Ergen's company, alone or with a partner, is the most likely candidate to launch a fourth network given its spectrum holdings, MoffettNathanson LLC analyst Craig Moffett suggested in a report following the Sprint merger announcement.</p><p>\"Having a wireless industry with three players rather than four would increase the odds that a new fourth player might enter the market,\" Moffett wrote. Regulators could ask T-Mobile and Sprint to make a concession that would help a new carrier inter the market, the analyst added, which presumably could include divestitures.\u00a0</p><p>Dish\u00a0declined to comment, though the topic will surely come up when the company reports earnings next Tuesday.</p><p>Mobile networks are increasingly important to\u00a0Google, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and other tech companies\u00a0that reach more\u00a0users over mobile devices and even--in the case of Amazon--potentially deliver goods by drones.\u00a0Google and Amazon did not respond to queries about whether they might look to invest in, partner with or buy wireless operations.</p><p>\"It's going to create more pressure on\u00a0these companies that are dependent on wireless access to the customer,\" Gellman said.\u00a0\"When you have the carrier world consolidating from four to three, that can't be good from their perspective.\"</p><p>Boca Raton, Fla.-based Vertical Bridge has over 61,000 cites through wireless towers or cites placed on rooftops, billboards or other infrastructure. The company's backers include Digital Bridge Holdings LLC, The Jordan Company, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.'s (GS) GS Infrastructure Partners and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners.</p><p>Gellman was a former Chief Operating Officer of\u00a0Global Tower Partners, which sold to American Tower Corp. (AMT) for $4.8 billion in 2013.</p><p>Global Tower executives and others formed Vertical Bridge-backer Digital Bridge following the sale.\u00a0Digital Bridge\u00a0invests in a range of telecom infrastructure companies, including\u00a0ExteNet Systems, which designs and operates alternative wireless infrastructure systems; data center operators DataBank\u00a0 and Vantage Data Centers; as well as infrastructure companies that operate in Columbia, Mexico and Peru.</p><p>\"We look at this as a real estate business,\" Gellman said of wireless infrastructure. Vertical Bridge's criteria for acquisitions include ground rights, title rights and whether the property can be mortgaged. Another is the quality of the physical assets, and whether Vertical Bridge can add capacity and tenants.</p><p>As carriers launch 5G networks, which connect cars and myriad devices and operate at high speeds, reducing latency will be a major issue. Reducing latency means moving computing and wireless cites closer to users.\u00a0</p><p>The impact of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger on tower and infrastructure companies is complicated.</p><p>\"The risk is three bigger carriers more market power more ability to exert any pressure on infrastructure companies, and I think it will drive a desire for infrastructure companies to be bigger themselves,\" Gellman said.</p><p>The timing of the merger closing is a factor, he added. T-Mobile and Sprint plan to decommission 35,000 cell sites, but will add 10,000 as they stitch their networks together. The companies also plan to aggressively invest in 5G networks, which would require infrastructure spending.\u00a0</p><p>If the 5G investment occurs alongside the decommissioning of sites, it would lessen the pain for wireless carriers. The tower have time to prepare. It would take a year to a year and a half for the merger partners to get approval--which may very well not happen. The deal partners would then have to finalize and implement their network plans.</p><p>The current market with four providers had its own issues, Gellman noted.</p><p>\"From the perspective of the tower and infrastructure industry, it's not a big secret that Sprint hasn't really invested a lot in their network over\u00a0the last number of years,\" Gellman said.</p><p>\"Is it better to have four national competitors than three? Sure,\" he said. \"But one of them wasn't really investing anyway.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">There's still time get your ticket to join host Jim Cramer and keynotes Paul Singer, Nelson Peltz, Jeff Gennette and Steve Mollenkopf at the Corporate Governance conference on June 7, 2018 in NYC.

(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0John Holmwood\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The efficacy of the language of openness is dependent in part on the exclusion of a binary opposite, or rather, a sequence of binary opposites: closure, secrecy (versus transparency), darkness (versus light), lies (versus truth) and so on. Open government, for example, is about making power itself transparent, bringing it to truth and light and thereby holding politicians to account without, as it were, any further need for action. Similarly, if open access is merely about getting publicly funded research out from 'behind the paywalls of high-subscription-cost journals' and making it free and available to use and re-use and if copyright reform--including exceptions for parody and quotation--is partly about increasing access then 'What is there to contest?' (CE, p2). For the sociologist John Holmwood contestation is tied to the recognition that open access occurs in the context of enclosure and that 'commercial enclosure is emerging as a significant objective of public policy' (CE, p2).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two key aspects of public policy in the UK are linked by a language of openness that simultaneously excludes and produces commercial enclosure by means of the increased privatisation and marketisation of knowledge and creativity. </pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">The Finch report on open access, published in 2012, maintains that barriers to access, especially when research is publicly funded 'are increasingly unacceptable in an online world' in as far as they 'restrict the innovation, growth and other benefits' that might accrue. (2) A concern here with public access to publicly funded research by means of 'enhanced transparency, openness and accountability' segues to an emphasis on 'closer linkages between research and innovation, with benefits for public policy and services, and for economic growth' (p5) [my emphasis]). Access here is effectively access to research for private industry or small and medium enterprises. Published a year earlier, the Hargreaves review of Intellectual Property (IP) is also concerned that IP rights that 'support growth by promoting innovation through the offer of a temporary monopoly to creators and inventors' might also 'stifle growth where transaction costs are high or rights are fragmented in a way that makes them hard to access'. (3) If the problem with IP is that it fosters a closed market dominated by established players in technology and content, the solution is to redesign IP in order to facilitate a fairer, more transparent, more open and competitive market that encourages new entrants and enables rather than constrains further innovation. The solution to piracy in a digital world 'where copying and distribution are more or less free', is not, for Hargreaves, copyright enforcement as much as a modernisation of copyright law that encourages 'open and competitive markets in licensed digital content' (p10).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Finch recommendations in favour of 'gold' open access publishing funded by author or article processing charges (APCs) plus minimal restrictions on the rights of use and re-use are in the process of being incorporated into the UK Higher Education sector. (4) The process is uneven and controversial, not least since the Creative Commons license (CC BY) mandated by Research Councils UK (RCUK) allows for commercial re-use of research material with attribution rather than the author's permission. An alternative to this would be a non-commercial share-alike license (CC BY-NC-SA) or one that simply allows non-commercial users to download and share work as long as the author is credited (CC BY-NC-ND). Martin Paul Eve, an advocate of open access, or rather, of the re-politicisation of open access, nevertheless recognises it as an instrument of neoliberalism understood 'as the practice of using the free market as the assignation of all value'. (5) He lists the key traits of neoliberalism as:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. A fixation on quantification and measurement\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. The belief that all aspects of society are best handled on a for-profit basis through competition<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. A nominal insistence on transparency, accountability and openness, so that point 1 can best be achieved.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Research Excellence Framework (REF) will mandate open access publishing in the next assessment round, scheduled for 2020. It fits all three of Eve's key traits of neoliberalism and is an effect, he argues, of the privatisation of knowledge through open access. If this is the case, can open access also be a mechanism for challenging the privatisation of knowledge? For Eve, among others, it can. [6] CC BY licenses might mean that 'yes, people can re-sell your work. However, they cannot stop you from distributing it for free.' Building on an earlier address to these issues in New Formations, (7) it would seem that whatever the potential of what Janneke Adema and Gary Hall refer to as radical or scholar-led open access, there is little doubt that the policy agenda constitutes not only a commercial enclosure of academic research but also an enclosure of knowledge itself. (8) This is especially the case in the arts and humanities where the provision of block grants for APCs is limited, and the ability of academic authors to 'pay-to-say' will be uneven at best. In 'Open Access: HEFCE, REF2020 and the Threat to Academic Freedom', Meera Sabaratnam and Paul Kirby maintain that the gold route to open access threatens academic freedom by placing pressure on institutions to distribute inadequate funding (which they cannot do fairly, openly or transparently) and increases academic inequality 'by linking prestige in research and publishing to the capacity to pay APCs, rather than to academic qualities'. (9) There is a question mark then, not only over who publishes and where but over what is published--the kind of knowledge produced. Work may very well be judged by standards other than peer review.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The premise of the Hargreaves recommendations is that the IP framework is out of date and must adapt to new technology:\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IP law must adapt to change. Digital communications technology involves routine copying of text, images and data, meaning that copyright law has started to act as a regulatory barrier to the creation of certain kinds of new, internet based businesses (IP, p3)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A progressive, deterministic view of technology is supported here, and in the Finch report by a narrative of crisis and catch-up and by an ontology of the digital as copying, re-use and sharing. If digital technology simply is copying, re-use and sharing then the seemingly uncontestable assertion is that IP law should strive to set it free (where freedom is, of course, a function and condition of the market). The narrative that IP is broken and must therefore be fixed, working alongside the narrative that access is broken and must therefore be fixed, unites the pro-and anti-copyright agendas in a technocratic rational consensus that denies and negates any asymmetry of interest and effectively de-politicises the debate. Responses to Hargreaves' recommendations for the modernisation of copyright and lifting of regulatory barriers that restrict commercial copying demonstrate that the technocratic consensus, the narrative of crisis and catch-up is being narrowed from its address to the digital world in general to the Internet more specifically and finally, to the spectre of Google. As Hargreaves writes:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the Review, conversations about the Google Books Agreement tended to divide people between those who see Google as the likeliest and most efficient reshaper of global markets in digital content, because its business model relies upon connecting online consumers with digital content in all media; and those who point with concern to Google's already very considerable market power, profiting from delivering access to other companies' content, whether provided by legitimate services or not. Google's size and reach in global digital markets has already provoked the attention of EU competition authorities. Google itself may be at a point of recognition that its size requires it to proceed at least to some extent by negotiation and agreement rather than only by bold entrepreneurial strikes which leave courts, regulators and governments gasping to catch up (IP, p36).\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A more recent report entitled 'Supporting the Creative Economy' is highly critical of the Hargreaves review of IP and of the UK Government's largely favourable response to it. (10) Written by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) which supports the creative industries, including publishing, it goes as far as attributing an 'underlying agenda' to IP reforms supported by the Intellectual Property Office which comes under the remit of a separate government department, namely, Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). This underlying agenda, according to DCMS (versus BIS) is 'driven at least in part by technology companies (Google foremost among them)'. (11) Elsewhere, it refers to 'the perceived power and influence of Google in the Government's inner, policy-making sanctum' implying, therefore, that the Government commissioned Hargreaves review is not as balanced and objective regarding the spectre of Google as it may sound, but rather, as the phrase 'gasping to catch up' might suggest, more envious and/or enchanted. The DCMS report is picked up and promoted by a publisher, Zelijka Marosevic, who refers to 'the concern of many in publishing and in other creative industries that cabinet ministers are holding private meetings and are keen to curry favour with the big tech companies, while they possess too little concern for the creative industries'. (12) Google in particular 'is held to account for its \"derisorily ineffective\" response to preventing its search from leading users to sites that abuse copyright laws'. Like Google, she concludes, the Government seems less interested in the rights of individuals than those of industry, less interested in publishing than in the tech industry, less interested in enforcing than diluting IP Addressed directly to Google, this Good Old Fashioned 'copy-fight' is more asymmetric and more inevitable than ever. The UK Government is already implementing Hargreaves' recommendations for a Digital Copyright Exchange that does exactly what Google, on account of its monopoly, was not permitted to do, namely, turn 'an unlicensed approach to the mass digitisation of the world's books into what is, in effect, an online licensing system, complete with stakeholder governance and disputes procedures' (IP, p36). Here, in the DCMS approved 'digital market place', the Copyright Hub where licenses are bought and sold, the disputes over copyright are effectively regulated and contained. (13)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alongside the deterministic crisis and catch-up narratives narrowed down to the spectre of Google, binaries of open versus closed, publicly versus privately owned content, free versus commercial culture structure the reform of access and IP. In as far as politics is elided by the technocratic consensus that unites pro- and anti-copyright agendas, advocates for commercialisation and those for creative commons, the possibility of re-politicisation emerges in the rejection of such consensus and with what, in a Derridean sense, remains undecidable or incommensurate with respect to the binaries. (14) A paragraph that evokes Derrida so soon after Hargreaves requires, I suspect, a note on method, or rather, the elucidation of a strategy of reading and writing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deconstruction is a strategy for overturning and intervening in the hierarchical binaries that structure UK policy and Western philosophy alike. Here, following Gary Hall and his agenda for new cultural studies, I resolutely refuse (overturn, corrupt, interrupt) the binary of policy and philosophy, the concrete and the abstract, the political and the (merely) theoretical that has become, if anything, yet more hierarchical in the decades following deconstruction and 'after' theory. (15) The always more than philosophical, abstract and theoretical point of deconstruction, its 'strategic intent' is first to invert and then to corrupt binaries (noting, of course, that all attempts at inversion and corruption are captured in part by what they seek to overturn) and to present new, provisional concepts without ever offering them as a third term or a means of resolving a dichotomy. (16) Deconstruction is more of a movement than a method, a movement of overturning 'in such a way as to register the constitutive dependence of the major on the minor term' and also a 'movement beyond the framework delimited by these terms'. (17) The new provisional concepts that move beyond frameworks by temporarily suspending them connect feminism with deconstruction, Donna Haraway with Jacques Derrida, 'natureculture' and 'FemaleMan' with 'differance' and 'hymen'. (18) They testify that texts matter, are 'material-semiotic' or world building and that criticism is not negative or positive (anti- or pro-) but precisely, political. If power operates through stabilising terms--'the language of openness is powerful and persuasive'--then politics is what is made possible by destabilising them. (19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The de-stabilisation and politicisation of the language of openness is effected in part by recognising its constitutive dependence on commercial enclosure and on the enclosure of criticism itself. If the debate on copyright circling between pro- and anti- Hargreaves, BIS and DCMS, the tech industries aka Google and publishing--encloses critique (as the possibility of politics), the debate on access threatens to enclose academic research and writing and therefore the very conditions of possibility of critique (the conditions of possibility that make politics possible). Work that has already been done on 'the limits of openness'and the opacity of secrecy and transparency is consistent with a deconstructive movement that nevertheless does not realise its full strategic intent without the invention of terms that signal a move beyond. (20) Such terms are the product of writing, of inventiveness through writing and they are hard to find in a post-theoretical, post-deconstructive academic culture embedded in the neoliberalism of which it speaks and reoriented to the presencing of privileged speech acts. If the term phallogocentrism is one that signals a movement beyond the division of speech and writing, presence and absence, fact and fiction, by revealing the constitutive dependence of the masculine major on the feminine minor, then it continues to exist as a significant trace in the contemporary speech-writing system of humanities research: 'The trace does not appear as such, but the logic of its path in a text can be mimed by a deconstructive intervention and hence brought to the fore' (JD).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking, as my text, the policy and philosophy of copyright and access reform, what are the traces and ruptures that can be mimed and brought to the fore by a deconstructive intervention? It should be noted that such an intervention is premised on the impossibility of interpretation, on an encounter or contact with the text that is neither faithful nor transgressive but rather, inevitably inventive. It should also be noted that the primary mechanism for deconstruction is writing: 'The process of writing always reveals that which has been suppressed, covers over that which has been disclosed, and more generally breaches the very oppositions that are thought to sustain it' (JD). Derrida's writing, 'arche-writing' is a process, happening less on the page (as literal inscription) and more in the movement between what is intended and what is conveyed. (21) This same movement, the archetypal breach in meaning expressed in the neologism 'differance', is evoked by Haraway who reinvents the idea of meaning as differance and sees writing as a means of making a difference. After arche-writing, cyborg writing 'has a special significance for all colonized groups'. It is a mechanism 'of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as other'. (22) The tools that writing seizes 'are often stories, retold stories, versions that reverse and displace the hierarchical dualisms of naturalized entities' (p175). My question about traces and ruptures in the con/texts of reform was addressed to a small group of once new, and would-be independent publishers who might regard themselves as colonised in that sense but who have consciously seized the tools to mark the world that marked them and/or others as other. I would not describe them as interviewees but as co-discussants and fellow storytellers. My co-discussants were: Janneke Adema (researcher and blogger on open access publishing), Pauline van Mourik Broekman (Mute), Mercedes Bunz (the Hybrid Publishing Lab), Joe Deville (Mattering Press), Carol Stabile (Ada. A Journal of Gender, New Media &amp; Technology), Eva Weinmayr and Andrea Francke (and publishing). On the basis of my involvement in setting up the Goldsmiths Press, as well as my involvement in the CREATe consortium, I convened and contributed to a discussion that was organised around a number of questions and responses (spoken and written) the first of which had to do with miming traces about copyright and open access. (23)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CRISIS, WHAT CRISIS? THE FUTURE OF (ACADEMIC) PUBLISHING (AND THE HUMANITIES)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The UK policy environment (with respect to publishing and other<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so-called creative industries) is currently dominated by the reform\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of copyright and access. To what extent should issues of ownership\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and access dominate the debate on publishing? What, if anything, do\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 they occlude? (24)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Janneke Adema and Joe Deville in particular, the question of access 'or better said the lack of access' remains important. There is, for Adema, the simple, unacceptable fact of lack of public access to publicly funded research plus the limited distribution of publicly funded research to the increasingly underfunded libraries of Western, as well as non-Western universities. More than that, as Deville puts it, the question of access 'also becomes, access to what? Just academic work? Or the frameworks that produce that work?' Adema argues that:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 we need to be wary when access, like in the Finch report, becomes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 dominated by access to business, to stimulate the knowledge economy\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 etc., instead of stimulating creativity and invention, and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 promoting rethinking, reperforming and deconstructing the way we\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 conduct and publish our research.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If access means access to publicly funded research for private industry and the market, it also means limited or lack of access to already marketised research: 'We increasingly don't have access to qualitative specialised research, as this needs to have a certain market-appeal in the current publishing ecology before it is deemed publishable'. (25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there is a degree of consensus, within the discussion group, that improving access is necessary 'on both sides' or with respect to the production as well as consumption of research, there is also a general agreement that this might not be the first or only priority and that it is useful to think in terms of what isn't currently being thought, said and done about publishing. For Janneke Adema, Joe Deville and Andrea Francke, one of the major occlusions in the debate on access and copyright reform is the question of responsibility. Deville refers to the 'distributed responsibilities' that include academic writers and publishers but also academic institutions, research centres and government. While Mercedes Bunz and Pauline van Mourik Broekman emphasise the absence, or rather 'endless deferral of responsibility'--from government to research centres to academic institutions--when it comes to the allocation of inadequate funds for open access journal publishing, Francke and Adema are interested in how the question of responsibility can be 'mimed' from the con/texts of access and copyright:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the open access movement, and as part of the main open access\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 definitions, access has always gone hand in hand with reuse rights,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and this is where the question of copyright comes in. As far as I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 am concerned, moral rights, i.e. attribution, is all we need in<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 academia (and we might rethink this too, who do we attribute\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 exactly), and we should be able to do without copyright in this<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 respect. But ownership of a text is a more difficult question,<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 because this implies amongst others taking responsibility for a<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 text and for the integrity or fixity of the contents that we are\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 publishing. A more interesting question is thus, in what sense are\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 we responsible for our texts?

In this respect the question of\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ownership is a broader question than that of copyright I think<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (which for me still functions too much as part of a liberal regime\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 based on property and proprietary objects), as this asks us\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 questions about our responsibility towards texts too.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So access has implications for copyright and copyright raises questions about moral rights which give way, for Adema, to a broader question of ownership as responsibility for research that is not just versioned but fluid in excess of proprietary objects. For her, and for Carol Stabile, neoliberalism institutes an overinvestment in the object, the book or article that is the end result of publishing. Concerned (only) with access to, or rights associated with such objects, a neoliberal rationale assumes and implies, as Stabile puts it, that everything is fine 'below the line'. What lies below the line are the institutional and extra-institutional 'life conditions' (van Mourik Broekman) that structure the research and writing process as well as specific scholarly practices such as peer review and citation that are, in Stabile's words, 'biased and broken'. Underlying this, below the line that is below the line of accessible, attributable or copyrighted objects is the double enclosure (commercial and critical) of published and publishable output in the humanities in particular.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With US academics Mark Garrett Cooper and John Marx, I am wary of reading even a double enclosure as a crisis in the humanities, preferring instead to recognise the genealogy of crisis that is, in effect, no crisis at all, but rather an ongoing, dynamic and antagonistic encounter with all that is considered to be external to the humanities--digitisation and marketisation included. (26) As Cooper and Marx argue, a crisis model of the humanities tends to fix it in an imaginary golden era in which its core values may be deemed to be under attack from the 'twin pressures of media change and neoliberal policies' (CCC, p140). What is more, 'in this narrative, the humanities becomes the last outpost within the university willing to fight the good fight against economic instrumentality and its technological fetishes (for example, MOOCS)' (p140). As much as I admire her exposure of economic instrumentality and especially its technological fetishes (MOOCS, ebooks, apps, podcasts and so on) in debates on the future of academic publishing, Johanna Drucker does seem to regard humanities scholarship as a last outpost, a stand against academic capitalism that may well be our last. (27) Scholarship, essentialised as being 'hard', 'serious', 'life-long' and the sole preserve of experts and professionals is installed at the 'centre of knowledge production' and all the 'hype around digital alternatives to print sometimes seems like a distraction to blind us from the need to address that reality, as if it will take care of itself if we just find enough apps and devices and platforms to play with' (PD). By suggesting that scholarship, as the presumably unchanging but vulnerable system supporting humanistic knowledge 'is at risk', Drucker shifts the crisis model from publishing per se to the humanities and brings with it a temporality that is not dynamic and antagonistic as much as static and oppositional. The crisis model is the model of binary opposites, of print and digital, of past (scholarship) and present (just so much 'pixel dust'). Deconstructing the crisis model of publishing and of the humanities is, I suggest, a prerequisite to any intervention below the line. Doing it is not easy, since it includes recognising what is at once vital and instrumental about scholarship and arguing, again with Cooper and Marx, that experimentation is not something we might add to, or even recover from within the humanities, but rather something that was always already part of its institutionalisation:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Crisis-obsessed humanists characteristically fail to appreciate the extent to which institutionalisation and experimentation are interlinked. Innovative collaborations across departments and outside academe's halls disappear in tales that privilege disciplinary formation and defense. Seen in a broader perspective, however, experiment looks just as important as institutionalisation. Collaboration that bridges sometimes antagonistic institutions like the university and the Hollywood studio lacks the certainty of disciplinary defense, while the term innovation smacks of the very corporate rhetoric PhD programs teach humanities scholars to abjure. Nonetheless, generating new ways to engage interlocutors outside the humanities and outside academe has long been a vital part of humanities practice (CCC, p131).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What they describe as a 'century-long drama' of institutionalisation and experimentation 'challenges us to reconsider' what institutions and disciplines do (p131) and, rather than seeking to preserve a fixed idea of scholarship (or, as Kathleen Fitzpatrick does, of the scholarly community), it challenges us to attend to the cuts and stabilisations that render scholarship more or less instrumental. (28) A feminist deconstruction of the crisis model--one that is anticipated in Marilyn Strathern's Audit Cultures, Roger Burrow's 'Living with the h-index? Metric assemblages in the contemporary academy' and especially Ros Gill's examination of 'the hidden injuries of the neoliberal university' --is further attuned to the differentiated structure of instrumentalism (and non-instrumentalism) and to the conditions of (im)possibility for a feminist politics of communication.

(30)\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scholar-led rather than policy-driven open access is problematic not because it fails to deconstruct the binary of open and closed or, necessarily, because it fails to open out from this binary to consider the politics of scholarly communication. It is problematic, for me in as far as it does this mainly from the perspective of the universal, the concept, and not from that of the exception (Haraway's 'colonized'). This is the reason why my discussion was oriented toward feminist publishers. When they, or rather, we, albeit as a heterogeneous group, speak of rethinking (once more) text, author and authority or access, rights and responsibility we are already invested in generating a new order of rank, arising from the exception.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hidden labour is a key exception in publishing. Joe Deville refers to its 'unseen others' and asks: 'Do we need to connect OA [open access] publishing to what Susan Leigh Starr calls the 'sociology of the invisible'?' (31) For Mercedes Bunz, a sociology of the invisible would incorporate 'infrastructure work', the work of accounting for, and literally crediting everybody involved in producing a book. Through the Hybrid Publishing Lab, Bunz 'is experimenting with an extended edition notice in the beginning of books similar to the closing notes of a movie, which would name the participants engaged in processing the manuscript'. (32) Both she and Deville, when asked why they became involved in publishing initiatives, refer to an investment in collaborative projects and in visibly collective and mutually supportive authorship facilitated by open, peer-to-peer as opposed to double-blind peer review. (33) Deville and his fellow editors at Mattering Press are early career researchers who felt 'that some of the ways in which academic value [was] conferred (e.g. via double-blind peer review) didn't map onto how we were engaging with each other (e.g. more open, supportive, but still feeling [that the] possibility for productive, helpful critique was there)'. If early career researchers are also a key exception in publishing, it is because they constitute much of the hidden labour behind the double-blind peer review process that is doubly precarious for them, that affects them asymmetrically both as reviewers--engaged in casual, temporary employment or facing the hurdles of promotion and tenure--and as the reviewed--seeking constructive criticism but vulnerable to something more judgmental. Martin Paul Eve, as an advocate of scholar-led open access, does recognise this exception. In his outline of the problems with peer review he asks:\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether it is right that a mere two academics, in most instances,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 although sometimes only one, have the private, unaccountable, final\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 word on an article's acceptability. For Early Career Researchers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (ECRs) this private decision can be the difference between a\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 lifetime of employment in academia or a lengthy period of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 re-training. (34)\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My colleagues at Mattering Press (and elsewhere) might even consider themselves poised between, facing the prospect of combining a lifetime of employment in academia and a lengthy period of retraining as publishers. It is significant that they cite their experience of peer review as one of the factors that led them to this prospect. As Rosalind Gill states, a bad experience of peer review up to and including the rejection of an article can lead some early career academics to conclude 'that they really aren't good enough' and should not go on, where others are driven 'to work even harder' (BS, p240).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the most part, Eve's critique of peer review is generic and dispassionate. His primary concern is to defend open access from the accusation that it abandons peer review as a form of quality control and to suggest instead that openness provides an opportunity to rethink peer review in relation to 'community' in particular. For a sense of how, for example, 'anonymity can be problematic' and for a sense of the unevenly distributed cost of substituting constructive feedback for harsh judgment, it is necessary to adopt a different perspective (BS, p75). In her feminist reflection on scholarly practice, Gill engages with early career researchers and argues that 'the hidden injuries of the neoliberal university' are experiential (affective, embodied and internalised) and differentiated according to gender, race and class (p240). By means of some 'unscientific' data and conversations held through (what she refers to as) improper channels of communication (emails, memos, letters and other 'fragments') she offers a powerful, impassioned account of the problem with anonymity and the cost of 'gratuitous attack and cruelty' (pp231, 229). One of her concerns is to challenge double-blind peer review by ending the silence about how it is experienced--and by whom. She reports what was said to her by a female friend: 'I'm really fed up. I heard yesterday that my article for x journal was turned down ... one of the referee's comments was vile ... When I read it it was like a slap in the face ...' (p228).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A less experiential, more experimental or theoretical approach might relate the problem of anonymity to the problem of knowledge and specifically to what Haraway refers to as disembodied knowledge (SCW). (35) Disembodied knowledge is transcendent, detached from the knower and therefore from responsibility and accountability. If this is mainstream, masculinist knowledge for Haraway, then feminist knowledge is situated, not detached but attached to an embodied knower who is therefore accountable for what she produces. Open, or community-based peer-to-peer review that the feminist open access (non-APC) journal Ada already practices might, as Carol Stabile suggests, be more 'situated, accountable and dialogic' but it is also very time consuming and labour intensive. We discussed how to account for this labour intensiveness when the differentiated 'intensivity' and 'extensivity' of academic labour is part of what this and other feminist publishing projects are attempting to address (BS, p231). For Stabile, the intensification and extensification of labour draws on 'love', 'devotion', 'passion' and 'commitment'. Here affect may be self-regulatory and governmental but, for Stabile, it is simply how political work, including feminist publishing, gets done. If we want more open or transparent peer-to-peer review, we have to acknowledge its own closures and secrecies and also 'work even harder (BS, p240; OA).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FEMINISM AS SCHOLARLY PRAXIS\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If feminist publishing is caught in the self-regulatory cycle of labour about which it speaks (and writes) then what difference is it making--what kind of difference can it make?

At this point in their comic, they change register 'from critique to manifesto' (WCC, p28) and, as part of a thought experiment, wonder what would happen if academics decided to act against copyright demands 'imposed upon authors by academic publishers, often without any real need' (WCC, p28). There is, they suggest, a 'beguilingly simple but powerful option: withdraw content and expertise'. This might 'focus the minds of academic publishers' but 'who would do such a thing?'. As a legal academic, Deazley considers it unlikely that legal academics, as a large heterogeneous group with many journal outlets at their disposal, would mobilise with sufficient disinterest and unanimity. So what about feminist academics?\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In her article on the increase in feminised--flexible, caring, multitasking, relationship-building--affective labour in 'an entrepreneurialized post-crash economy', Carol Stabile returns to Valerie Solanas's SCUM manifesto based on a '(science)fictional organization' for, amongst other things, orchestrated unwork. (37) When you are 'working like a dog', unwork, including the withdrawal of content and expertise, has strategic-anarchic appeal. (38) Another option is not (just) to withdraw but redirect both content and expertise toward publishing outlets that are more ethical, more creatively and intellectually vital, less exploitative and over which academics and other contributors have a greater degree of control. All of the discussants that came together to debate the future of feminism, writing and publishing at Goldsmiths, myself included, are redirecting labour in this way. Some of us are also in the process of withdrawing at least our expertise from mainstreamjournals. (39) As a mixed group of academics and artists, we are all aware that the strategic redeployment of reviewing, editing, reading and writing, as well as the harder work of publishing itself is a form of activism with a history, or rather, a set of histories relating to university presses, artists' books (PNB) and feminist publishing initiatives. (40) It is, of course, no coincidence, and certainly not a facet of digital technological agency per se, that a number of new digital first university presses are in train, that scholars and artists are concerned with the legacy of the artist's book or that feminists are reappraising pamphlets, manifestos and other experimental modes of communication. These are among the ways in which the enclosure of the conditions of possibility of critique (the conditions of possibility that make politics possible) is being acted on. What interests me in particular is the extent to which these separate legacies overlap, and in doing so offer to teach us 'how to dream outside the boundaries of a capitalist matriarchy' manifested as feminised rather than feminist labour (MV).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Opening out from openness\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joe Deville describes Mattering Press as a material and political intervention, 'very closely aligned with feminist attention to making a difference'. It foregrounds a feminist, not feminised ethics of care, oriented toward the publishing process (the process of producing knowledge differently), its relations and infrastructure. Mattering Press aims to make a difference by 'attending to who and what we become involved with' when we publish, and by 'taking care of not just the human relations we instantiate, but also the material (e.g. payment, production and reviewing models, the printed texts themselves, the digital texts, how these circulate, the work involved in making them circulate)'. All of these things matter in the double sense of being significant and of coming in to being, of materialising as subjects and objects of care. Mattering Press enacts thinking about posthuman agency predicated on relational processes that cut into and across the boundaries of human and non-human entities. Apart from caring more about the entities involved in publishing (authors, readers, texts, payment models), the press is ethical in as far as it strives to make 'better cuts' (LANM) and to enact relations that are responsible and accountable. It takes responsibility not just for the knowledge it produces but also for the way it produces it. It opens out (from) open access in this way, as well as by taking the perspective of the exception.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is a difference, for me, between opening out open access and opening out from open access. I would base this on what I perceive to be a totalising tendency in scholar-led open access, one that will always re-enclose it and that attempts to assimilate, for example, ethics and experimentation to its own cause, namely, the cause of keeping open access open to the outside, to its constitutive relations, processes, texts, materialities, modes and disciplinary contexts. In recognition of this tendency, and drawing on Weber's use of Kierkegaard, Janneke Adema returns open access to a deconstructing movement that foregrounds not the movement (called open access) but movement itself, not relations but relating, not experimentation but experimenting. (41) The difference is in the present participle: 'For the present participle involves a movement that is first of all, repetitive, second of all, never conclusive or contained, third, on-going and futural, and fourth and finally, actual and immediate'. (42) The present participle, for Weber, 'moves in quite a different, more transitional way' to deconstruct 'the model of all knowledge' including scientific, humanistic, academic and artistic knowledge that is 'based on the past participle'. There is no openness in open access that isn't already a form of enclosure. There is, at best, an opening that foregrounds itself and is without cause. Rather than adhere to movements, we should perhaps attend to where movement is. I am intrigued, in this case, by what Pauline van Mourik Broekman has observed in the movement (one towards the other) of artistic and academic research:\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is striking that there has been a rash of conferences,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 exhibitions, workshops in the contemporary art context asking what\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 knowledge and its limits are, but sort of on the understanding that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 art should be 'let in' to help define it (i.e. it wants to be\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 legitimised, gain access to the domain of 'knowledge'--and via<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 artistic research we must read this as academe). Whereas,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 conversely, one gets the sense that academe is seeking to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 escape/get out/exit; find new languages, new spaces and platforms,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for 'knowledge'. Where do these two tendencies meet?<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instituting invitalism\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there is a degree of movement between art and academia, I'm interested in the extent to which they meet, or might meet through writing. Put another way, how and where is it possible to write out (of), as well as about the hierarchical binaries of openness and the vicious circles of feminised labour? Artists Andrea Franke and Eva Weinmayr of and publishing talk about their Piracy Project as an intellectual property event that tries to avoid 'the black and white approach of yes or no, when it comes to copyright or open culture advocates'. (43) What began as an occupation of an art school library that was under threat of closure has grown into a collection of more than a hundred 'modified, appropriated and copied books from all over the world' including, for example, Whais off piejing (2011), a self-published reversioning of John Berger's Ways of Seeing 'rewritten as if transcribed phonetically from reading by a German or possibly a Finn, creating what looks like a nonsensical new language on the page'. (44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paul Goldsmith's International Copyright: Principles, Law and Practice is a physical book consisting of screen captures from Google Books. Part of what is captured here 'are the limits Google places on previewing pages, with the (nearly) blank pages stating 'not shown in this preview', taking up most of the book'. (45) Facilitated by labour intensive independent publishing houses engaged in 'everything from experimental writing to republishing out of print or censored material', the collection experiments with copyright and access in order to stimulate debate and encourage further intervention. (46) In addition to the Piracy Project, and publishing have issued a public invitation to 'help us explore the language of piracy'. (47) They offer a list of synonyms for piracy--including 'borrowing, poaching, plagiarizing ... repeating, cloning, translating'--and invite the reader to join them in exploring 'the blurred spaces between these terms'. How, for example, 'does plagiarizing challenge the common perceptions of originality?' By sponsoring one of the terms, the reader contributes to a book chapter that will be written by a scholar or artist and in which they will be credited. They engage in a deconstructive movement that includes new definitions and at least the possibility of new, provisional concepts. As well as the piracy and keywords projects, Eva Weinmayr was involved in a digital real-time collaborative scriptwriting project that was a dialogue 'in the sense that a dialogue creates something bigger in-between us'. Written by 'a journalist, a writer and me', all in different countries, it was, she says, 'an exceptional and rich experience triggering imagination and ideas'. Finally, she asks, 'what would happen if such a method would be used for academic writing?' My own question borrows from hers, linking a method, based on real-time collaborative writing, back to the movement she identifies with Deleuze, the 'thing that flows' between us: 'what would happen if such a movement would be used for academic writing?' Or, going back to Derrida and Haraway, 'what would happen if academic writing became, as it always has been, an art of invention as well as an act of intervention?'<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My own keywords list, translated from and's would consist of antonyms rather than synonyms. A number of them have already been mentioned in this article, including open and closed, experimental and institutional, vital and instrumental. These are the hierarchical binaries that I have, to an extent, deconstructed, falling short, as most academic writers do, of inventing an in-between or alternative term. However, since academic writing, or the configuration of writing, publishing, privatisation and marketisation is, to paraphrase Haraway, the nexus of trouble that I am staying with, and in the spirit of feminist deconstructionism, here is one such term: invitalism. Invitalism is akin to the opportunism of scholar-led open access, the sense that a debate (if not a movement for reform) is open enough to be hacked, hijacked and redirected. Invitalism is antagonistic to the enclosure of openness (including by openness itself), experimentation and especially vitalism. It moves against this enclosure although it does not, in any final sense, achieve it. It is political only in its antagonism and does not in itself constitute an intellectual or creative movement (or indeed, a combination of the two (48)). Invitalism differs from opportunism because it is less confined to a movement and more inclined to wander, for example, between movements for open access and copyright reform. Here (in its wandering) it is attuned to the differentiated structure of instrumentalism and its opposite and to the conditions of (im)possibility for a feminist politics of communication. This politics is neither negative nor affirmative but, rather, strategic. (49) It is always on the move as a politics of intervention (in a text, a system, a movement [including its own], a status quo) and of invention. It takes the incursive move from scholar-led open access and turns it into an invitation. This invitation is issued to academics and artists alike. It is an invitation to unwork the work of writing about scholarly practice and to work harder at the work of writing out of its enclosures. Invitalism is scholarly writing that is not about, but out (as in, half way out) of scholarship, always in the process of reinventing it--of experimenting and institutionalising. Invitalism is invitalising. The difference is in the present participle.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CONCLUSION: WHY WRITE?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the words of Ed McCabe: 'creativity is one of the last remaining\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 legal ways of gaining an unfair advantage over the competition'.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IPRs (the major rights being patents, copyright, design rights, and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 trade marks) incentivise innovation through the offer of a\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 time-limited return on innovative investment.

(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have argued that philosophy can reinstate critique and create an opening for political intervention in policies that privatise knowledge and market creativity. Writing is central to a deconstructive philosophy that moves against metaphysics, including the metaphysics of writing expressed in the question: 'what is writing?' Following Heidegger, Derrida critiques the metaphysics of presence, the privileging of 'that which is, or that which appears', reminding us to pay attention 'to the conditions for that appearance'. (JD) The conditions for appearance that I have attended to here include publishing and/as scholarly practice. My main contention that we should write out (as in, write out of), not so much about the differentiated instrumentalisation of scholarly practice (if not transcending then transforming it) presumes to answer a question that is in need of asking. I posed a loaded question to my co-discussants, asking them 'to revisit the association between feminism and writing, to ask again: why write?'\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through her long association with Derrida, I invoked Helene Cixous' invocation, her injunction to write:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Write, let no one hold you back, let nothing stop you: not man; not\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the imbecilic capitalist machinery, in which publishing houses are\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the crafty, obsequious relayers of imperatives handed down by an\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 economy that works against us and off our backs; and not yourself.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Smug-faced readers, managing editors, and big bosses don't like the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 true texts of women female-sexed tests. That kind scares them. (51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Together with Xaviere Gauthier's withering reference to 'the frightful masculine fashion of speaking' that always surprises her ('speaking in order to be right--how ridiculous!' LM, p200), I invoked a feminism that would scare and ridicule the rightness of rights, the assertion, more political than legal that I/we write in the spirit of innovation rather than intervention and in order to secure our 'time-limited return' rather than give vent to a desire that is encultured and embodied. (52) In as far as my own oppositionalism is problematic and returns and desires cannot be separated any more than they can be assimilated, one to the other, then the task of challenging (the instrumentalisation of writing) is more challenging and more provisional. It is, as my Goldsmiths colleagues Terry Rosenberg and Duncan Fairfax argue, the challenge of moving toward 'a form of writing that ... creates a new space from which to write'. (53)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This form of writing is not experimental but experimenting. For Janneke Adema it includes 'breaking down barriers between formal and informal publications' such as the monograph and the manifesto, the article and the comic. One of the things I appreciate about Kathleen Fitzpatrick's reflections on academic writing is her willingness to be self-reflexive. Referring to anxieties about writing, linked to 'originality, creativity, productivity, ownership and so on', she recognises that she is 'subject to precisely the same concerns and emotions about which I've been writing' and explores ways in which we might be 'less anxious' about our work (PO, pp 51,56). For me, however, the challenge is less about self-reflexivity, less about academics writing about academic writing and more about returning our anxiety to a more externalised desire that is, following Cixous, following Derrida the feminist minor to the masculinist major term of the return.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DOI: 10.3898/NEWF.83.06.2014\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Research for this article was undertaken as part of the RCUK funded Centre for Creativity, Regulation, Enterprise and Technology (CREATe): 'Whose Book Is It Anyway?

The issue stems partly from an accounting oddity that wasn't fully addressed in the overhaul of stock-options accounting that took effect last year. </p><p>Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Yahoo, for example, said in its annual 10-K report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in February that its \"provision for income taxes\" last year was 42 per cent of its $1.1-billion (U.S.) in pretax profit. But Yahoo likely won't end up owing any income taxes from last year's profit, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p> The U.S. government isn't losing much, if anything, because of the option-related tax benefits enjoyed by these growing companies. Employees who exercise stock options must include the gains as income they report to the tax authorities. To a large degree, the tax burden is simply shifted from companies to executives and other employees. But the government still may lose out because some individuals owe taxes at rates lower than the 35-per-cent statutory rate applied to big companies. </p><p> Still, the gap between some companies' reported and actual tax rates indicates that stock-option accounting can confuse investors. The discrepancy also raises some awkward questions, including whether the revamping of stock-options accounting practices went far enough, and whether shareholders are being given meaningful information about the true profitability of companies that issue lots of options.</p><p> The amount shown as a tax expense on some companies' financial statements includes a large portion related to options that \"is never ever going to be paid; it's not an expense by any stretch of the imagination,\" says Albert Meyer, a former accounting professor and now president of Bastiat Capital, a Dallas investment-advisory firm. \"I cannot find in accounting theory any reason for it - other than it fulfills the function of creating the impression these companies are paying their taxes.\" </p><p> A Yahoo spokeswoman said the company provides investors tax information in its annual report, and gives additional information about cash paid to the government for taxes in its quarterly earnings calls.</p><p> The recently filed annual reports covering 2006 results are the first disclosed since the new rules took effect, and indicate the tax gap owing to benefits from stock-based pay options is still sizable for some companies. </p><p> Stock options, a popular form of compensation for many companies, give employees the right to buy shares stock at a preset \"strike\" price. For years, accounting regulators treated options as though they were essentially free, permitting companies to dole them out liberally, generally with no hit to their bottom lines - and to get a tax deduction in the process. That changed in the United States last year, when new rules forced companies to estimate the long-term value of an option, and to deduct that amount from its income in its financial reporting over the period the options become exercisable.</p><p> But when it comes to tax returns, for most options a company has to wait until the option actually is exercised by the employee - often years later - at which point it deducts the difference between the exercise price and the current stock price. For example, if an employee exercises the option with a strike price of $40, and the stock is trading at $60, the company deducts $20 from its return.</p><p> In their annual 10-K reports, companies disclose a \"tax provision,\" which in theory is the amount they accrue to pay expected tax bills. But because of the accounting quirk, companies include an amount they never actually pay - the tax-return benefit they receive from options exercised by their employees. The result for big issuers of options with rising share prices is a tax provision that can overstate the company's true tax obligation.</p><p> For instance, in a news release announcing 2006 earnings, Mountain View, Calif.-based Google said it had an \"effective tax rate\" of 23 per cent. But Google's soaring stock price helped generate a $611-million tax benefit from restricted stock that vested as well as options exercised last year - which cut its actual effective tax rate to about 8.8 per cent, according to a Journal estimate. </p><p> The problem with this discrepancy, critics say, is that shareholders may not be getting information about Google's true profitability. Is the tech giant even more profitable than it might seem, because it owes less in taxes than its income statement would indicate?</p><p> Or is it less profitable, because Google is giving away much of its income to its own employees in the form of stock-option gains that aren't fully reflected on its income statement? Google declined to comment. </p><p> The Journal calculated adjusted effective tax rates by subtracting the tax benefit related to stock-based pay from a company's tax provision.</p><p> While that benefit is presented in a company's statement of cash flows, and sometimes in its tax footnotes, it generally isn't clear that it effectively reduces the company's reported taxes.</p><p> The Journal methodology, reviewed by three accounting experts, can lead to results that are different from the actual cash taxes paid by a company in a given year for several reasons, including the effect of reserves and payments related to previous tax years.</p><p> Stock options aren't the only things driving companies' true tax rates below the statutory 35-per-cent U.S. rate.</p><p> Some tech firms are still able to take advantage of losses from previous years to credit against taxes on future profit.</p><p> And many companies attribute earnings to subsidiaries in countries with lower tax rates.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20070416WSJTECHTAX16</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4NH5-YDN0-TXJ2-N3CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

View more opinion articles on CNN. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (CNN) --  It's the end of the internet as we know it. At least that's what some say about new copyright legislation working its way through the European Parliament in Brussels. But behind all the talk about censorship machines and the death of memes is another much more fundamental issue -- the power of big tech companies. </p><p>The copyright legislation was designed to update European copyright law to reflect the challenges of a digital world. </p><p>Indeed, the debate around the European copyright directive is really about who profits from what is circulated on the internet. Should it be the big platform companies like Google and Facebook that have created new ways of distributing content and built up gigantic advertising business in the process? Or should it be \"legacy\" media firms like newspapers and TV networks that still create a lot of content?</p><p>Three parts of the regulation have proved controversial. </p><p>Article 3 would limit companies' ability to data-mine texts. Research organizations could use algorithms to mine texts, but in some cases firms would need a license to do the same thing. </p><p>Article 11 of the directive would require content-aggregation sites to pay content owners for the headlines they use to link to an original article on another site. For instance, Google News would need to pay The Guardian for using a headline that links through to an article on The Guardian's website. </p><p>Article 13 of the directive puts the onus on large tech firms to get the agreement of copyright holders when sharing content on their sites. For instance, Facebook would have to make sure an image shared by a user is not under copyright.</p><p>The new legislation has sparked outcries in the tech community. In an open letter to the European Parliament, 70 public figures, including Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web) , warned that it could transform \"the Internet from an open platform for sharing and innovation, into a tool for the automated surveillance and control of its users.\" </p><p>Intellectual property rights experts also claimed that changes to the legislation will create more problems than they solve. </p><p>Some corners of the internet have been flooded with talk about \"memes bans,\" \"link taxes\" and \"censorship machines.\" Opponents of the directive have pointed out the role of \"legacy\" media outfits, like the German media conglomerate Alex Springer, in promoting the law. </p><p>Behind the outrage is the tale of big tech companies confronting legislative changes that are a fundamental challenge to their business model. And, to avoid having to transform it, the companies are trying to use significant political power. </p><p>Each of the changes in European legislation create a big problem for those business models. Article 3 would put the brakes on big business opportunities for these companies in text mining and artificial intelligence. Article 11 represents an attack on the huge business big tech firms have built by selling advertising placed next to content others have produced. Article 13 would make it much harder for big tech firms to benefit from content produced by others while not having to pay those who produced it. </p><p>The new legislation could mean lower growth opportunities, more cost and less profit for these big tech companies. According to one estimate, Google has spent about 31 million euros lobbying Europe in recent years.</p><p>This has been both through direct lobbying (which it spent over 5 million euros on in 2016 alone), as well as indirect lobbying undertaken by the 24 lobbying organizations in Brussels it regularly funds. Bureaucrats working in the European Commission have declared the amount of lobbying from both sides of the argument \"astonishing.\" </p><p>There is a big chance that as big tech battles it out with legacy media in a lobby war in Brussels, the one group that will lose out are the people who actually create the photos, songs and texts we share every day, and are unrewarded.

At least that's what some say about new copyright legislation working its way through the European Parliament in Brussels. But behind all the talk about censorship machines and the death of memes is another much more fundamental issue -- the power of big tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The copyright legislation was designed to update European copyright law to reflect the challenges of a digital world.</p><p>Indeed, the debate around the European copyright directive is really about who profits from what is circulated on the internet. Should it be the big platform companies like Google and Facebook that have created new ways of distributing content and built up gigantic advertising business in the process? Or should it be \"legacy\" media firms like newspapers and TV networks that still create a lot of content?</p><p>Three parts of the regulation have proved controversial.</p><p>Article 3 would limit companies' ability to data-mine texts. Research organizations could use algorithms to mine texts, but in some cases firms would need a license to do the same thing.</p><p>Article 11 of the directive would require content-aggregation sites to pay content owners for the headlines they use to link to an original article on another site. For instance, Google News would need to pay The Guardian for using a headline that links through to an article on The Guardian's website.</p><p>Article 13 of the directive puts the onus on large tech firms to get the agreement of copyright holders when sharing content on their sites. For instance, Facebook would have to make sure an image shared by a user is not under copyright.</p><p>The new legislation has sparked outcries in the tech community. In an open letter to the European Parliament, 70 public figures, including Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web) , warned that it could transform \"the Internet from an open platform for sharing and innovation, into a tool for the automated surveillance and control of its users.\"</p><p>Intellectual property rights experts also claimed that changes to the legislation will create more problems than they solve.</p><p>Some corners of the internet have been flooded with talk about \"memes bans,\" \"link taxes\" and \"censorship machines.\" Opponents of the directive have pointed out the role of \"legacy\" media outfits, like the German media conglomerate Alex Springer, in promoting the law.</p><p>Behind the outrage is the tale of big tech companies confronting legislative changes that are a fundamental challenge to their business model. And, to avoid having to transform it, the companies are trying to use significant political power.</p><p>Each of the changes in European legislation create a big problem for those business models. Article 3 would put the brakes on big business opportunities for these companies in text mining and artificial intelligence. Article 11 represents an attack on the huge business big tech firms have built by selling advertising placed next to content others have produced. Article 13 would make it much harder for big tech firms to benefit from content produced by others while not having to pay those who produced it.</p><p>The new legislation could mean lower growth opportunities, more cost and less profit for these big tech companies. According to one estimate, Google has spent about 31 million euros lobbying Europe in recent years.</p><p>This has been both through direct lobbying (which it spent over 5 million euros on in 2016 alone), as well as indirect lobbying undertaken by the 24 lobbying organizations in Brussels it regularly funds. Bureaucrats working in the European Commission have declared the amount of lobbying from both sides of the argument \"astonishing.\"</p><p>There is a big chance that as big tech battles it out with legacy media in a lobby war in Brussels, the one group that will lose out are the people who actually create the photos, songs and texts we share every day, and are unrewarded.

The United States Federal Trade Commission and the New York State Attorney General \u2014 who together brought the case against Google \u2014 now require YouTube to obtain consent from parents before collecting or sharing personal information. In addition, creators of child-directed content must self-identify to restrict the delivery of targeted ads. The $170 million fine is a pittance given Alphabet Inc.'s (Google's holding company) valuation of more than US$700 billion[3]. [embedded content] Our digital identities comprise data collected across our activities, making personal identifying information irrelevant. Children today are subjugated to a scale of data collection and targeting that we cannot fathom. </p><p>Right now, we also have no clue about the consequences, and regulatory protections to data-proof their futures are far from certain. My ongoing research on how big tech and media conglomerates are using dark pattern design to bypass privacy regulations protecting personal information has revealed how vulnerable children are to data collection and how Canada's legislation in particular is failing them.Incomprehensible scaleFor adults and children, Google has access to everything from search queries to online purchases to any app and website associated with gmail accounts \u2014including deleted accounts[4]\u2014 or linked via cross-browser finger-printing[5]. As a parent, you create a network of cross-connections when you input information to make purchases for your child online or set up accounts for your child on apps and websites. Added to this is all your child's activity on YouTube and YouTube Kids, search data to clicks on recommended videos to rewinds and duration of play time. Then add cross-browser fingerprinting and most recently, Google's 'GDPR workaround,' secret buried web tracking pages that act as pseudonymous markers[6] that track user activity across the web. This latter violation of data privacy was revealed in a complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commission[7] filed the same day Google's fine was made public. We are talking about vast fields of aggregate data, the scale of which is difficult to comprehend; this data can be parsed by the artificial intelligence recommendation algorithms that Google has pioneered, and that now steer everything from employment application processes[8] to dating apps[9]. Children in the United States and Canada have another significant, persistent arena where information is being produced by them and collected by Google. Google entered the educational sphere in 2012, and now dominates educational technology market in the U.S., giving Google unprecedented parent-sanctioned access to children's data through kindergarten to Grade 12[10].<url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/293673/original/file-20190923-54749-11uq082.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=cliphttps://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/11/23/why-you-need-to-teach-your-kids-about-data-privacy/#The\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/293673/original/file-20190923-54749-11uq082.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=cliphttps://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/11/23/why-you-need-to-teach-your-kids-about-data-privacy/#The</url> growing presence in classrooms of computers, devices and the internet raises concerns about children's privacy and data collection by large corporations like Google. ShutterstockDominance in the educational sphereAlphabet Inc. dominates child-directed and child-featured content online through YouTube Kids and has now colonized online educational spaces through Google Docs, G-Suite, Chromebooks and the associated Gmail accounts for children that are required for use[11]. This means that Google's access to children's data spans entertainment (YouTube and YouTube Kids), search and purchase histories (via associated parental accounts), and educational sectors. The uptake numbers in the educational technology sphere are staggering. Between 2012 and 2016, Google Chromebooks went from less than one percent of the U.S. school market to over 50 percent \u2014 more than 30 million Chromebooks are currently being used in American classrooms. By 2017, more than 58 percent of devices purchased for U.S. schools were Google devices[12]; more than 80 million instructors and children use them globally[13]. Given Google's history of privacy violations[14], it's no surprise that Google's rollout of Chromebooks again violated children's data privacy. Initially, Google resisted complying with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)[15], providing links to its security policies, which FERPA rejected. In 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed an FTC complaint[16] because Chromebook default settings initially allowed Google to collect user data including 'Web browsing histories, search-engine results, YouTube viewing habits and saved passwords.' Harry Brignull, a user experience specialist, coined the term 'dark pattern' to describe a 'user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things, such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills[17].' Gmail accounts for children remain a standard practice in schools today. Standard practice continues to be that children are enrolled by schools en masse into Gmail accounts[18], often without parental consent, using their full names, and 'into other services that collect data without any notification.' This data collection is presented as benign, optimizing your child's experience, enriching education, democratizing access to 21st century online resources.Updating the lawsWhat Google has done is to create a dynamic, adaptive system of data collection that has already colonized our children's futures, given what we now know of how ad targeting can manipulate behavior[19]. We have no way of knowing how this depth of data collection may be used in years to come. In March 2019, U.S. senators Ed Markey and Josh Hawley introduced a bipartisan bill to update COPPA[20], banning targeting ads to children, extending privacy protections to 13- to 15-year-olds so data cannot be collected without user permission and an 'eraser button' that would allow parents and kids to delete personal information. This proposed update to COPPA is crucial legislation that Canadians should be studying - in addition to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation[21] - as again, there are multiple documented instances of Alphabet's subsidiaries failing to protect children's privacy. This legislation, if passed, would have enormous impact on the revenue of the digital ad market for Google and Facebook, as digital ad revenue in the U.S. totaled $107 billion in 2018[22] We should anticipate sustained resistance from Alphabet's subsidiary companies and the other major platforms. A focus on how we can ensure the consistent protection of the data privacy of children and youth must be central to our discussions of technology globally and to Justin Trudeau's proposed Digital Charter[23] nationally in Canada.

The caller identifies himself as the chief information officer and says he needs you to follow a link he sent and complete a new security measure for your email right away. You hang up and open the email. Do you click the link? Probably.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the person on the other line wasn't a colleague. Suddenly, a hacker has access to your company email and whatever other data he can get his hands on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scenario highlights one of your company's biggest cyber threats: The unassuming and underinformed employee who lets the hacker in. It's an all-too common problem that can result in huge losses of data, security, money and integrity for companies of all sizes.</p><p>Firms are already spending significant time and money to stay ahead of the hackers. Many have purchased expensive hardware and software to lock down their data. Meanwhile, CIOs are trying to stay on top of the newest breach strategies and figure out ways to educate people against them. They hold training sessions, circulate skills tests and even send out fake scam emails to test employees' reactions. But still, one mistaken click by someone in the sales department or human resources could open the door for a bad actor and a very bad day.</p><p>Examples like Target and eBay have highlighted the costs of a major data breach. Both experienced attacks in the past few years that left millions of their customers' personal and financial data at risk. Locally, big names like MedStar Health, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield and the University of Maryland, College Park have weathered breaches of their own.</p><p>Hackers are becoming more savvy at preying on people's instincts and web comfortability. Gary Merry, CEO of local cyber firm Deep Run Security, said the key to staying ahead of the hacks is strengthening a company's front line of defense: its employees.</p><p>\"Your employees can be you biggest vulnerability and most valuable asset when it comes to cybersecurity,\" he said.</p><p>User error</p><p>Not every breach is caused by an employee misstep, but a good chunk of them are. A survey of about 2,500 CIOs found 31 percent of security issues can be attributed to employee error, according to a study by staffing firm Robert Half Technology.</p><p>Some of the most common employee-caused errors can be linked to phishing scams and accessing unsecure websites. Phishing emails often appear to be sent by a reputable source or even a friend, but are meant to trick people into giving up sensitive information like passwords.</p><p>While some are obvious - we've all seen the \"Dear friend, check this out!\" messages - many of these breach attempts are still effective. Out of more than eight million phishing test messages tracked in 2015, 30 percent of the messages were opened by targeted users, according to a report from Verizon. Of those, 12 percent of users went on to click the malicious link and only 3 percent of users reported the suspicious message to management.</p><p>Of all the corporate breaches in 2015, 89 percent of them had a financial or espionage motive, the report said.</p><p>It can even happen at big tech companies like Snap Inc., the parent of social media app Snapchat. Last year, a phishing email that appeared to be sent from CEO Evan Spiegel fooled a payroll employee into divulging personal data on hundreds of employees.</p><p>Part of the problem is constant connectivity. In the last decade, virtually every business has become a tech company, said Jack Huffard, president and chief operations officer at Tenable. People are online constantly, using unsecure websites and bringing their personal devices to work. Not to mention they are carrying around millions of pieces of personal and corporate data on their phones or laptops every day.</p><p>\"What used to be a secure network, now doesn't have borders at all,\" Huffard said.</p><p>And unless companies are willing to give up on using technology, they have to be ready to combat an inevitable security breach.</p><p>Investing in employees</p><p>Merry says having a secure company starts with having a security-educated staff.</p><p>\"It should be a fundamental goal of any company to make an investment in their employees' cyber knowledge,\" said Merry, who spent four years as a CIO at Jos. A. Bank Clothiers. \"Technology and software can be very helpful, but real cyber strength comes from a community itself.\"</p><p>The investment can come in several forms, he said, whether its periodic training, lunch and learn sessions with the IT team, free seminars or even random phishing and breach detection tests. The idea is to keep the dialogue on cybersecurity open, and to keep staff at every level involved, Merry said.</p><p>Employees will always make mistakes, and Zuly Gonzalez, CEO of Light Point Security, said it's also important for a company to have policies and enforcement strategies in place for when they do. For example, if an employee doesn't need to browse the web freely for their job, a company could put blocks on internet use or on certain kinds of websites to reduce risk.</p><p>\"Organizations should take stock and figure out what employees need to be able to do in their jobs and evaluate the risks there,\" Gonzalez said. \"Being able to enforce policies and have tools in place to help keep a network secure, it's a good backstop.\"</p><p>Per the Robert Half study, 21 percent of CIOs feel their security budget is not sufficient enough to keep their organization's data safe. But Merry said it's not all about the money. He said the key to making any security plan successful is getting everyone in the company onboard.</p><p>\"No matter how much money you put in, how comprehensive your security measures are, unless everyone understands and participates, it won't be effective,\" he said.</p><p>Strengthening defenses</p><p>Local companies are making security investments of their own.</p><p>Philip Campbell, CIO of Calvert Memorial Hospital, manages IT and security for the Frederick hospital and its 1,200 employees. He said dealing with cyber in health care can be tricky. It's about finding a balance between keeping patient data secured - which is regulated by federal laws and standards - and allowing for the sharing of information among different doctors, insurance providers and medical staff.</p><p>\"You still have to be able to share data with the patient, with other care providers,\" Campbell said. \"It's like you have to keep the side and back doors shut, but the front door is going to have to keep opening. So how do you keep out the rain?\"</p><p>Campbell said he strives to make sure every employee understands the risks in dealing with the different technology involved in health care. Anything that connects to the internet or to internal systems could pose a threat.</p><p>Every employee at Calvert Memorial receives initial cybersecurity training when they're hired. Campbell's department is tasked with making sure employees stay informed about any new cyber threats, news or policies that are relevant to the company. He sends out email newsletters each week to keep people up-to-date on the latest trends.</p><p>\"I really just try to keep the drumbeat going of thinking about security as an everyday thing,\" Campbell said.</p><p>And local companies that have weathered big breaches in the past, are also taking steps to make sure it never happens again.</p><p>A 2014 breach of the University of Maryland, College Park compromised over 300,000 staff, faculty and students personal identification data.</p><p>University of Maryland CIO Eric Denna said the school has invested an additional $3 million to assess and strengthen data security efforts since. The investment includes additional staff as well as new hardware and software measures.</p><p>\"Without question, securing and protecting data remains an unwavering priority for this institution,\" Denna said.</p><p>Health care companies CareFirst and MedStar also faced breaches in recent years. A CareFirst database was attacked in 2015, affecting about 1.1 million consumers. A ransomware attack on MedStar last year left computer systems frozen, resulting in some patients being turned away from area hospitals.</p><p>CareFirst, in a statement, said employees and contractors are required to complete mandatory privacy and security training when they are hired and again each year of their employment. The company also sends out periodic IT security awareness newsletters and conducts process reviews to make sure everyone is taking necessary precautions.</p><p>MedStar Health, which employs 30,000 throughout Maryland and Washington, said protecting privacy and securing information is \"among [its] highest priorities.\" Employees are given year-round interactive training on phishing, social media usage, encryption and passwords, MedStar said in a statement.</p><p>John Rasmussen, MedStar's chief information security officer, said the company takes added security measures when installing new technology to its system and is constantly monitoring unusual activity.</p><p>The breaches of MedStar, CareFirst and University of Maryland are under federal investigation. Currently, none have been attributed to any employee error.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Before the prevalence of smartphones, which is a mere 10-or-so years ago, humanity had a pretty good grasp on our interaction with technology. You go to work, use a computer, choose what you click on (mostly) and go home. At home, you may or may not have had a desktop or laptop where you spend some time clicking away. But our connection to the techno-overlords was mostly linked to our access to a PC.     But then every. Second. Person. Started buying smartphones (thanks Apple). Smartphones post-iPhone 4 were highly desirable. They had great cameras, could seamlessly browse the internet, install any app you want and featured an intuitive user interface. What\u2019s not to like? In no time, about 80% of the world\u2019s population ran around with a digital tether in their pockets (Deloitte, 2020). A pretty significant statistic if you consider the time it took to become this prevalent.     That, in itself, isn\u2019t crippling our current social construct. And in no way do smartphones cause all the problems I\u2019ll touch on later on. But it has led to what we can now call The Social Dilemma (thank\u2019s Netflix).    What is The Social Dilemma?   Last week, Netflix released an hour-and-a-half-long documentary that takes a look at the inner workings of social media and software companies. They pull in some big names in the form of ex-VPs, execs, founders and creators of some tech corporations. You know, Google, Facebook, Apple and Pinterest to name a few.     It delves deep into the inner workings of social media and software that connects people in general. How do they function, how they track user date and certainly most importantly, how they make money.     If Google or Facebook aren\u2019t charging you to use their service, how do they cash in?    There has been a general consensus that they collect user data and sell it for money to advertisers. Which isn\u2019t exactly the case \u2014 what actually happens is far more nuanced than that, incorporating complicated machine learning systems and big server farms. What they actually do with user data is far more devious. \u201cIf they\u2019re not selling you a product, you are a product,\u201d one of the cutscenes in the doc read.    Which is essentially why every social media user or person with an online presence need to watch the documentary.     Granted, it\u2019s not the best piece of cinema ever. The documentary does feel a bit long-winded in some parts and it features some awkward B-tier reenactment. But, as my colleague Brad pointed out, since when do we watch documentaries for the production value anyway? In this case, just like a Romany Creams box, the content is far more valuable.    Following the documentary, I felt the need to disable all of my social media accounts. Unfortunately, that\u2019s kind of out of the question when you\u2019re a journalist. That\u2019s like\u2026 our main source of news and current affairs. I also hit a snag when I realised that\u2019s how we manage our business social media accounts.     Without going into too many spoilers, the end of the documentary hinted at more regulation and accountability for big tech. They need to step in and take responsibility for this monster they\u2019ve created, right? Wrong. Every single person online need to take responsibility. Stop unlocking your phone just to check notifications. Set app usage limits with the newly implemented digital wellbeing features (in iOS 113 and Android 10 and up). Throw your phone in the Vaal River.     The onus is on you. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43080316102</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VB-3H81-JCSC-J0CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Stuff.co.za</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 15, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

A lot. And I also happen to like Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai as well, so writing this post doesn't spark joy. Before I begin, let me say that no company is perfect. </p><p>No CEO is either, and that's okay. In the age of outrage, it is worth repeating as many times as necessary. Not every misstep is a scandal or the end of the world. But since Pichai just took a pass on fixing a pretty big mess that falls under his purview[1], and it isn't trivial, let's talk about it.Some context: I'm generally a fanUnlike some of my peers, I don't think Google is as nefarious or deliberately deceitful as, say, Facebook[2]. I think Google tries, and mostly succeeds, at balancing the needs of its platform and the needs of its users, to arrive at a mutually-beneficial balance of data collection and utility. It's just that Google misses the mark sometimes, but as frustrating as it is for a former product manager like me to witness, it isn't exactly the sort of thing that puts Google in the dog house for me.But with great power comes great responsibilityGoogle, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Cisco, Tesla, Intel, Samsung, and their peers all exist to create value for their stakeholders, and maximize profits. They aren't there to eradicate malaria, solve income inequality, or combat political corruption. They are businesses, and their primary objective is to maximize the growth and profitability of their products, services, and platforms. Everything else is secondary. How they choose to do so is a matter of vision and culture. Some of these companies are led and staffed by people who are as driven by being a force for good in this world as they are by hitting their financial numbers. Others are led and staffed by people who don't necessarily care about being a force for good in this world, but understand that not lying to their customers, not defrauding them, and ultimately not harming them, is just a sound business policy. I don't know which Google is, and it doesn't really matter. What matters isn't what a company aims to do but what it does.YouTube's content problem and wrong answersAnd so here we are. YouTube appears to be 1)causing harm[3]by having become[4]a breeding ground for toxic and dangerous content[5], and 2) profiting from advertising revenueboosted by algorithms[6] that point users to that content in an effort to keep them on the platform as long as possible. YouTube has its own CEO (Susan Wojcicki, since 2014), but the platform is Google's responsibility. Google is Pichai's responsibility. So when he was asked what he intends to do about YouTube's content problem and his answer was that YouTube is too big to fix completely[7] was wrong. What he really means is, 'I don't know how to fix this problem, so let's just agree that it can't completely be fixed. Not my fault. The company is just too big.'Small failures of leadership lead to big onesIf you start with excuses as to why you can't do something you know you have to do, you've already lost the plot. If you're head of a company, you can't simply abdicate responsibility. Leadership means you have to try, and then keep trying, and then try some more until you find a way to make it work. If, as a CEO, you really believe the company is too big for you to fix, maybe you've found the limits of your own ability to lead it.Zeroing-in on the problemPerCNBC's reporting[8]: YouTube, which is owned by Google, has come under fire in the last couple of years, as content ranging from deniers of the Sandy Hook massacre tosupremacist content[9]has continued to show up on the site despite the company's attempts to filter it out. During aCNN[10]interview that aired Sunday, Pichai was asked whether there will ever be enough humans to filter through and remove such content. 'We've gotten much better at using a combination of machines and humans,' Pichai said. 'So it's one of those things, let's say we're getting it right 99% of the time, you'll still be able to find examples. Our goal is to take that to a very, very small percentage well below 1%. [] Anything when you run at that scale, you have to think about percentages.'' First of all, YouTube isn't getting it right 99% of the time. Not even close. Second, that sort of linear, symmetrical thinking doesn't really work with regards to an asymmetrical problem. It doesn't make sense to measure the problem in terms of percentages, let alone to craft a solution based on those metrics. YouTube's problems require clusters of new solutions, not the optimization of existing half-measures. Pichai doesn't appear to be thinking proactively about this, let alone broadly enough. What he is telegraphing with his answer is that incremental progress along percentages is all he hopes to realistically accomplish. 'Anything when you run at that scale, you have to think about percentages.'No. This is not a percentage problem. Unfortunately, it doesn't stop there. Again, per CNBC: 'Pichai added that he's 'confident we can make significant progress' and that 'enforcement will get better.' He also said Google wishes it had addressed the problems sooner, since many of the videos have been running for years. 'There's an acknowledgement we didn't get it right,' he said. 'We're aware of some of the pitfalls here and have changed the priorities.' Huh? 'Confident that we can make significant progress. Enforcement will get better. We've changed the priorities.' What? Look, we all know the difference between lip service and an actual plan. Does anyone hear a plan here? I don't.The trouble with blaming predecessorsPerhaps the worst part of Pichai's answer is the moment he blames Google for not having addressed the problem sooner. Not my fault! I didn't cause this. Someone else should have taken care of it before I got here. Look, good leaders don't talk like this. More importantly, let's not forget that Pichai became CEO of Google in 2015. Come October, he will have been CEO for four years. Blaming predecessors for a problem that has been festering at YouTube for Pichai's entire four-year tenure as CEO rings dangerously hollow. This was a problem in 2014, when Wojcicki took over YouTube. It was a problem in 2015 when Pichai took over[11] Google. It was still a problem in 2016 and 2017 and 2018. And it is still a problem now. When does a current problem stop being your predecessor's fault? YouTube seemed perfectly comfortable capitalizing on ad revenue when its 'up next' feature was recommending white supremacist content as well as scores of conspiracy theories, disinformation, and otherwise toxic video to users from 2014 to early 2019. The practice didn't stop until February of 2019[12](at least with regard to white supremacist content), a mere two months afterPichai was called to testify before Congress[13]. Public and legislative pressure were enough to trigger changes at YouTube in just two months' time that Pichai and Wojcicki together somehow weren't able to address for almost half a decade. How about that. To make matters worse,YouTube's still very new white supremacist content ban[14] (June 2019), came several months afterFacebook announced its own policy[15](in March 2019), making YouTube (and parent company Google) relatively late entrants in the 'Let's clean up our platforms' game. Pichar is leading from behind, and only then under the threat of enforcement. Which brings us to our final topic.The regulators are comingGoogle and Facebook havegiants targets painted on their backs right now[16]. There's talk ofregulating big tech again[17], and the topic is gaining momentum this time. This is due in part because social platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have been profiting frompolitical extremism[18],pseudoscience[19],misinformation[20], andradicalization[21]for years, andthose chickens[22]havecome home to roost[23]with a vengeance[24]. Yes,the real issue with regulation and antitrust for big tech focuses more on data and privacy[25], but the toxicity of these platforms, and the growing danger they pose to public safety, cannot be ignored. Social platforms' toxic andharmful content problem[26]has been obvious andreported on[27]extensively for some time, and yet it took the growing threat of regulation and antitrust enforcement to finally getPichai[28], (Google, YouTube),Zuckerberg[29](Facebook), andDorsey[30] (Twitter) to start taking the issue seriously. This was most assuredly not because they felt that it was their responsibility to get their houses in order, or they would have made a move earlier. Instead, it is because they don't want to be regulated or broken up. Given the very thin ice that big tech is already skating on, Pichar didn't do himself, YouTube, or Google any favors with his statements this week. If nothing else, his lackluster answer just provided fresh ammunition to lawmakers and ambitious bureaucrats betting their careers on the upcoming fight between Washington DC and Google.

A dedicated video device for Teams meetings , a whopping 85 inches for display in a conference room or hospital corridor, so large everyone could see it, and be seen.   No longer would we have to fiddle around with the laptop or phone. Just gather in front of the TV and click the touchscreen.   But at a price tag of $21,999, gosh, that's just a little bit north of our budgets, wouldn't you say?   So you've got to love Amazon's answer, which came later in the week. A dedicated 10-inch unit, for $250, the Echo Show 10, which lets you go through Alexa to connect to Zoom, Skype or Alexa-to-Alexa direct calls.    Again, no fiddling. This time, just use Alexa, your Zoom calendar and voice computing to connect.   Or better yet, plug a webcam to the TV via the $119 Fire TV Cube device and do it on the big screen TV of your choice. Maybe not 85 inches, but many of us have good 50 to 60 inches or larger in the living room. If not, Best Buy would be happy to sell you a 50-inch TCL, Samsung or Amazon-branded Toshiba TV in the $300 range.   The Amazon solutions are both listed as coming soon, but if you have a Facebook Portal video chat device, you can use the dedicated unit to connect now to Zoom. The update started rolling out Friday.   The Portals start at $129, and are available in three sizes: with 8-inch, 10-inch or 15.6-inch screens. An edition that connects to the TV, Portal TV, is not supported for the Zoom calls.   The smart displays were originally marketed as places for video chat first, then using the video screen to look up recipes on YouTube, operate your smart home and best of all, as economical and easy to mount digital photo frames.   Those features are still sound, but add in the dedicated Zoom device, and the kids who are stuck at home taking school on their laptops can have one unit just displaying the teacher and lessons. This would leave the students hands freer for schoolwork and notetaking on the laptop.   For those who are taking meetings all day, the same issue applies. Isn't it hard to take notes when your laptop screen is filled with speaker video windows? Plus, this way, you wouldn't have to worry about webcam placement . After all, it's best to be at eye level, which most people ignore, and not have the webcam looking up at their chins and noses. That requires stacking the laptop atop a bunch of books, which gives you a better look, but makes it really hard to type.   So the savvy speaker or student would have to constantly move the books around. That dedicated device on the desk would solve the issue, living atop the books that could just stay there and not have to be moved around.   Meanwhile, that's not all folks. On Wednesday, Google holds its annual fall hardware product event, where it's expected to unveil a new top of the line smartphone, the Pixel 5, an updated streaming device, Chromecast and a new take on the Nest Home Hub video display unit.   Last year's Nest didn't work with Zoom or initially with Google's Meet, the video chat service Google heavily touts as a Zoom alternative. (It does now, but setup is highly convoluted. You ask Google to set up a meeting, then need to click the touchscreen to confirm. Google generates a code to send to your guests, which it sends to your phone, via the Assistant app. You open your phone, copy the invite, and text or e-mail the invite. Got that?)   Meanwhile, Google has already said it will begin accepting calls from Zoom on Nest Hubs before the end of the year, so expect more action and hopefully improved  usability.   Finally, we began this edition by talking about that crazy Microsoft TV/PC.   What if you want to put Zoom calls on your TV now, without having to wait for Amazon's Fire TV Cube update?   TVs with built-in webcams are rare, and besides, how would you connect to Zoom without a computer?   Exactly.   To get Zoom on the TV, all you need is a laptop, an HDMI cable, adapter to plug it into your laptop and webcam, and you're in business.   Connect the HDMI cable from the TV to laptop, plug in the webcam and position it well (so it doesn't look up your nose) change your HDMI settings on the TV to bring in the laptop, and you've got a Zoom call on the big screen. You'll just need to operate it from your laptop. Without spending $21,199!   Questions about any of this? Just look for me on Twitter, where I'm @jeffersongraham .  In other tech news this week  ICYMI, Amazon announced 13 new products, including a redesigned Echo and Echo Dot speakers, which no longer resemble coffee cans but instead are now spherical, more powerful Fire TV Sticks (to help your programs load faster) and some wild stuff.

And they show a deepening split among leaders of the House Judiciary Committee, which is carrying out a yearlong investigation into alleged anti-competitive abuses in Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a letter to top officials at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, Republican members of Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee ripped into Democratic proposals to bar most mergers during the crisis.</p><p>The letter, which POLITICO reviewed, painted the plans in bleak terms.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, these ideas are part and parcel of the latent socialism embraced by many modern Democrats, which represents an existential threat to America's economic superiority,\" they wrote.</p><p>A separate missive slated to be sent Wednesday by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who chairs the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, calls for the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to block large companies receiving coronavirus relief funds from engaging in mergers they see as harmful.</p><p>\"To protect small businesses and their workers, and to ensure a functioning, competitive economy as we emerge from this crisis, we urge you to use your broad authority and discretion to restrict large companies that receive taxpayer-subsidized bailout funds from engaging in mergers and acquisitions,\" the liberal lawmakers wrote in the letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.</p><p>Cicilline last month proposed a broad moratorium on most mergers during the worldwide emergency, and has called for the plan to be included in any next coronavirus relief package Congress takes up. Every Republican on his panel is now on the record saying the idea would be catastrophic.</p><p>\"A moratorium would reduce the flexibility that American businesses have in deciding how to best access capital,\" they wrote. \"Such flexibility is vital, especially during and in the wake of economic crises. With companies struggling to survive, it makes no sense to deny them a primary way to access cash - especially when there may be limited alternatives available.\"</p><p>A senior GOP aide was even blunter in dismissing the Democrats' proposals.</p><p>\"Only those in the hipster antitrust movement think banning mergers is a good idea and it's clear they've let their kombucha ferment for too long,\" said the aide, who asked to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the Republican letter.</p><p>The letter is addressed to Makan Delrahim, the head of the DOJ Antitrust Division, and Ian Conner, the director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition. Delrahim's office asked Congress for the option of taking more time to review proposed mergers, but the Hill has yet to grant it that authority.</p><p>Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have gone even further than Cicilline, proposing legislation that would bar deals by private equity and big tech companies so long as the economy is struggling.</p><p>Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Senate's leading antitrust panel, and 14 other Democratic senators took a more moderate approach in a separate missive this month that urged federal antitrust enforcers to vigorously challenge mergers during the pandemic.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-251233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWM-0SJ1-JDJ6-K1D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"596\"/><timeReceived>3:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 12, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Amazon and Facebook are capitalizing on the fact that they are viewed as essential services for a public staying at home, while Google and Apple are building tools that will enable state health departments to provide a critical public service, tracing the course of potential new coronavirus infections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pace of the probes of these companies has slowed as regulators and lawyers are forced to work from home. Emboldened tech lobbyists are fighting to delay the enforcement of a new privacy law this summer in California, saying that because of the upheaval, they cannot comply by the July deadline.</p><p>And while the global economy faces potential unemployment and contraction not seen since the Great Depression, the largest tech companies - and a handful of medium-size ones - are benefiting from new consumer habits, initiated during the lockdowns, that analysts predict will turn into longer-term shifts in how people shop, work and entertain themselves. The broader stock markets tanked in recent weeks, but Amazon and Microsoft share prices hit or neared records. Facebook is moving to acquire high-skilled talent, announcing the hiring of 10,000 new workers this year.</p><p>Google parent company Alphabet reported Tuesday that first-quarter revenue rose 13 percent, despite a significant slowdown in advertising in March. People are using Google's service \"more than ever,\" chief executive Sundar Pichai noted, something that has prompted the company to marshal resources and product development.</p><p>The companies' deep pockets will enable them to withstand the coming global economic recession, a stark contrast to what industry insiders and analysts expect to be the biggest shake-up of the tech landscape in years. As many start-ups collapse, bigger tech companies will expand on the power they have accumulated using the playbook of the past decade - snapping up talent, buying or copying rivals and eroding traditional industries. Some of those weakened companies may disappear altogether and cede even more territory to tech.</p><p>Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said at a recent virtual panel that the most powerful companies have the ability to bounce back. \"When you have an industry leader and something collapses, the industry leader, if it's well managed, tends to emerge stronger a year later,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook and Google declined to comment for this report. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon spokesman Dan Perlet said in a statement, \"While we appreciate the opportunity as a retailer to serve customers and are seeing increased demand for essential products, there are no winners out of Covid-19.\"</p><p>(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>As the companies start announcing quarterly earnings this week, Big Tech's current position is far better than in previous market crashes. In the dot-com bust of 2001, Google was not yet public. Amazon almost went bankrupt, losing 90 percent of its value in two years. The crash was seen as a crisis of Silicon Valley's making, as money flooded into thousands of frothy start-ups with unsound business models.</p><p>During the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009, large technology companies were hit along with the global economy. Facebook was still privately held. The combined value of the five richest companies - ExxonMobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&amp;T and Procter &amp; Gamble - was $1.6 trillion. Today, tech companies occupy those top spots. Microsoft, currently the most valuable company in the world, is worth $1.3 trillion alone.</p><p>\"There are really two Americas right now,\" said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at the New York University Stern School of Business and author of \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.\" \"There is Big Tech, and there is everyone else. They can do what very few companies can do, which is play offense in the middle of a pandemic.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, over 250 start-ups have shed more than 30,000 jobs since March 11, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks Silicon Valley layoffs and furloughs. A recent survey of 400 investors and founders by the venture capital firm NFX found that more than half of start-ups said they had initiated a hiring freeze or had lowered their value in the hopes of attracting new investment. Start-ups that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, such as the scooter company Bird, have laid off large portions of their workforces.</p><p>\"Every start-up and every investor is having these conversations right now,\" said investor Roy Bahat, head of Bloomberg Beta, a venture fund backed by the Bloomberg company. \"We're telling the start-ups we invest in that the safest assumption is that the next time you can raise money again is never.\"</p><p>Review service Yelp, however, could face an even bigger blow. Yelp for years has complained that Google has copied its services and used its power to redirect people away from the company's listings in search results. Now the company is laying off or furloughing more than 2,000 people - over a third of its workforce. Unlike Google, which has diversified ad revenue and huge cash reserves, Yelp generates almost all its revenue from advertising by bricks-and-mortar businesses, such as salons and gyms.</p><p>Yelp declined to comment.</p><p>Inside Google, a cautious attitude prevails as the search company anticipates significant losses in income from advertising in the coming months, particularly from the travel, entertainment and retail industries, according to people who work there, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely without having to get company authorization. Estimates by eMarketer predict that overall spending on search and display advertising, which constitute Google's core businesses, could drop by at least 20 percent or be as high as 38 percent in the quarter starting April 1.</p><p>\"The entire global economy is hurting, and Google and Alphabet are not immune to the effects of this global pandemic,\" Pichai wrote in an email to staffers this month. \"We exist in an ecosystem of partnerships and interconnected businesses, many of whom are feeling significant pain.\"</p><p>But he tempered the warnings, promising no major layoffs. The company would \"be slowing down the pace of hiring, while maintaining momentum in a few strategic areas,\" Pichai said.</p><p>Google, however, may benefit in one key way from the crisis as its relationship with the federal government transforms. Over the past year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have launched probes of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google for potential antitrust violations, and more than 40 state attorneys general have announced wide-ranging inquiries into the business practices of Google and Facebook. Last year, the FTC levied the largest fine in the agency's history against Facebook for violating user privacy during the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the company enabled the Trump-affiliated political consultancy to breach personal data from tens of millions of Americans.</p><p>Inquiries are slowed in the short term as everyone works from home, said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer whose clients are involved in several of the federal probes.</p><p>\"How much can you compel a company to do something when they are in lockdown? So if they want an extension or want a delay, what are you going to say?\" he asked. \"This situation plays best for the companies that have been under investigation.\"</p><p>At the same time, the public is becoming more reliant on those companies' services, while governments outsource critical work to them. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) uses models and slides derived from location data from Google and Facebook to show possibilities for the path of new infections. Health departments throughout the country are working with Google and Apple to conduct contact tracing.</p><p>The Association of National Advertisers, a lobbying group representing Google and Facebook, is actively pushing the attorney general of California to delay the final regulations and enforcement of the state's landmark Consumer Privacy Act, set to go into effect this summer. </p><p>In several letters, the group has argued that the regulations, which require companies to provide data that they hold about consumers and allow for consumers to request deletions of data, are too onerous to comply with now that company lawyers are working from home.</p><p>As the economic contraction continues and start-ups die off, the largest companies may be some of the only companies in the position to do any hiring. In a recent interview, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, made a point of highlighting that the company would create 10,000 new positions this year in engineering and product roles.</p><p>That contrasts with invitations and ticketing company Eventbrite, which had to lay off or furlough nearly half its staff. While invites to virtual events are booming, the company is suffering because of the cancellation of many events and the resulting loss of its cut of ticket sales.</p><p>Eventbrite chief executive Julia Hartz said the choice to lay people off was \"heartbreaking\" but necessary. Eventbrite has referred some laid-off employees to Facebook, she added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook's rival events team responded to the pandemic by moving its people to teams working on other products that have exploded in popularity, such as Messenger and Livestream, according to the people familiar with the company's operations. On Friday, Facebook launched a competitor to videoconference services Zoom and Houseparty, allowing up to 50 people to videoconference at a time.</p><p>After years of reputation problems because of Cambridge Analytica and other scandals, some employees say they are feeling a boost in morale, according to other people who work at the company. Even the newfound positive reception for the Facebook Portal - a much-ridiculed video chat device that all employees received to work from home - is a surprise.</p><p>Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is on the media circuit, touting the company's efforts to keep the public safe. He wrote an op-ed in The Post about how data is key to survival, and he sees the crisis as a potential moment of redemption for Facebook, according to people familiar with his thinking.</p><p>Amazon executives have also launched a media blitz, touting the company's role in supplying important goods to consumers.</p><p>Amazon is leading the biggest hiring spree, announcing more than 175,000 new, mostly low-wage jobs in warehouses and delivery. The company is openly recruiting workers who have been laid off from other industries, as it has struggled to keep up with the surge in consumer demand.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of its warehouse workers have protested their working conditions, and dozens of warehouses have workers who tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>\"We're investing heavily to keep our employees safe and to temporarily increase pay for associates - spending $500 million on pay increases alone through the end of April,\" Amazon's Perlet added in the statement.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that Apple chief executive Tim Cook recently told employees that the company felt so comfortable in its cash position that it would continue investing in research and development throughout this year and did not anticipate layoffs.</p><p>Big Tech's ability to continue hiring and sustaining itself through crises will give the companies an advantage not only in Silicon Valley but also in the economy at large. Many of the traditional industries expected to suffer - bricks-and-mortar retail, food service, and media and entertainment - are the same industries that have been gradually gutted by technology since the last recession.</p><p>And when the spending comes back, it will favor the biggest tech platforms over smaller digital ad companies and publishers, said Nicole Perrin, an analyst with eMarketer.</p><p>\"A lot of the traditional media and ad businesses have been in decline,\" Perrin said. \"The decline will happen faster this year, and a lot of that money will not come back, because it was slowly trickling away.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com\">elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com</email></p><p>Faiz Siddiqui in San Francisco and Jay Greene in Seattle contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-cf1676ca-897c-11ea-8ac1-bfb250876b7a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSM-MMY1-JBFW-C4HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2083\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Met 2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amazon and Facebook are capitalizing on the fact that they are viewed as essential services for a public staying at home, while Google and Apple are building tools that will enable state health departments to provide a critical public service, tracing the course of potential new coronavirus infections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pace of the probes of these companies has slowed as regulators and lawyers are forced to work from home. Emboldened tech lobbyists are fighting to delay the enforcement of a new privacy law this summer in California, saying that because of the upheaval, they cannot comply by the July deadline.</p><p>And while the global economy faces potential unemployment and contraction not seen since the Great Depression, the largest tech companies - and a handful of medium-size ones - are benefiting from new consumer habits, initiated during the lockdowns, that analysts predict will turn into longer-term shifts in how people shop, work and entertain themselves. The broader stock markets tanked in recent weeks, but Amazon and Microsoft share prices hit or neared records. Facebook is moving to acquire high-skilled talent, announcing the hiring of 10,000 new workers this year.</p><p>Google parent company Alphabet reported Tuesday that first-quarter revenue rose 13 percent, despite a significant slowdown in advertising in March. People are using Google's service \"more than ever,\" chief executive Sundar Pichai noted, something that has prompted the company to marshal resources and product development.</p><p>The companies' deep pockets will enable them to withstand the coming global economic recession, a stark contrast to what industry insiders and analysts expect to be the biggest shake-up of the tech landscape in years. As many start-ups collapse, bigger tech companies will expand on the power they have accumulated using the playbook of the past decade - snapping up talent, buying or copying rivals and eroding traditional industries. Some of those weakened companies may disappear altogether and cede even more territory to tech.</p><p>Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said at a recent virtual panel that the most powerful companies have the ability to bounce back. \"When you have an industry leader and something collapses, the industry leader, if it's well managed, tends to emerge stronger a year later,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook and Google declined to comment for this report. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon spokesman Dan Perlet said in a statement, \"While we appreciate the opportunity as a retailer to serve customers and are seeing increased demand for essential products, there are no winners out of Covid-19.\"</p><p>(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>As the companies start announcing quarterly earnings this week, Big Tech's current position is far better than in previous market crashes. In the dot-com bust of 2001, Google was not yet public. Amazon almost went bankrupt, losing 90 percent of its value in two years. The crash was seen as a crisis of Silicon Valley's making, as money flooded into thousands of frothy start-ups with unsound business models.</p><p>During the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009, large technology companies were hit along with the global economy. Facebook was still privately held. The combined value of the five richest companies - ExxonMobil, General Electric, Microsoft, AT&amp;T and Procter &amp; Gamble - was $1.6 trillion. Today, tech companies occupy those top spots. Microsoft, currently the most valuable company in the world, is worth $1.3 trillion alone.</p><p>\"There are really two Americas right now,\" said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at the New York University Stern School of Business and author of \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.\" \"There is Big Tech, and there is everyone else. They can do what very few companies can do, which is play offense in the middle of a pandemic.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, over 250 start-ups have shed more than 30,000 jobs since March 11, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks Silicon Valley layoffs and furloughs. A recent survey of 400 investors and founders by the venture capital firm NFX found that more than half of start-ups said they had initiated a hiring freeze or had lowered their value in the hopes of attracting new investment. Start-ups that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, such as the scooter company Bird, have laid off large portions of their workforces.</p><p>\"Every start-up and every investor is having these conversations right now,\" said investor Roy Bahat, head of Bloomberg Beta, a venture fund backed by the Bloomberg company. \"We're telling the start-ups we invest in that the safest assumption is that the next time you can raise money again is never.\"</p><p>Review service Yelp, however, could face an even bigger blow. Yelp for years has complained that Google has copied its services and used its power to redirect people away from the company's listings in search results. Now the company is laying off or furloughing more than 2,000 people - over a third of its workforce. Unlike Google, which has diversified ad revenue and huge cash reserves, Yelp generates almost all its revenue from advertising by bricks-and-mortar businesses, such as salons and gyms.</p><p>Yelp declined to comment.</p><p>Inside Google, a cautious attitude prevails as the search company anticipates significant losses in income from advertising in the coming months, particularly from the travel, entertainment and retail industries, according to people who work there, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely without having to get company authorization. Estimates by eMarketer predict that overall spending on search and display advertising, which constitute Google's core businesses, could drop by at least 20 percent or be as high as 38 percent in the quarter starting April 1.</p><p>\"The entire global economy is hurting, and Google and Alphabet are not immune to the effects of this global pandemic,\" Pichai wrote in an email to staffers this month. \"We exist in an ecosystem of partnerships and interconnected businesses, many of whom are feeling significant pain.\"</p><p>But he tempered the warnings, promising no major layoffs. The company would \"be slowing down the pace of hiring, while maintaining momentum in a few strategic areas,\" Pichai said.</p><p>Google, however, may benefit in one key way from the crisis as its relationship with the federal government transforms. Over the past year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have launched probes of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google for potential antitrust violations, and more than 40 state attorneys general have announced wide-ranging inquiries into the business practices of Google and Facebook. Last year, the FTC levied the largest fine in the agency's history against Facebook for violating user privacy during the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the company enabled the Trump-affiliated political consultancy to breach personal data from tens of millions of Americans.</p><p>Inquiries are slowed in the short term as everyone works from home, said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer whose clients are involved in several of the federal probes.</p><p>\"How much can you compel a company to do something when they are in lockdown? So if they want an extension or want a delay, what are you going to say?\" he asked. \"This situation plays best for the companies that have been under investigation.\"</p><p>At the same time, the public is becoming more reliant on those companies' services, while governments outsource critical work to them. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) uses models and slides derived from location data from Google and Facebook to show possibilities for the path of new infections. Health departments throughout the country are working with Google and Apple to conduct contact tracing.</p><p>The Association of National Advertisers, a lobbying group representing Google and Facebook, is actively pushing the attorney general of California to delay the final regulations and enforcement of the state's landmark Consumer Privacy Act, set to go into effect this summer. </p><p>In several letters, the group has argued that the regulations, which require companies to provide data that they hold about consumers and allow for consumers to request deletions of data, are too onerous to comply with now that company lawyers are working from home.</p><p>As the economic contraction continues and start-ups die off, the largest companies may be some of the only companies in the position to do any hiring. In a recent interview, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, made a point of highlighting that the company would create 10,000 new positions this year in engineering and product roles.</p><p>That contrasts with invitations and ticketing company Eventbrite, which had to lay off or furlough nearly half its staff. While invites to virtual events are booming, the company is suffering because of the cancellation of many events and the resulting loss of its cut of ticket sales.</p><p>Eventbrite chief executive Julia Hartz said the choice to lay people off was \"heartbreaking\" but necessary. Eventbrite has referred some laid-off employees to Facebook, she added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook's rival events team responded to the pandemic by moving its people to teams working on other products that have exploded in popularity, such as Messenger and Livestream, according to the people familiar with the company's operations. On Friday, Facebook launched a competitor to videoconference services Zoom and Houseparty, allowing up to 50 people to videoconference at a time.</p><p>After years of reputation problems because of Cambridge Analytica and other scandals, some employees say they are feeling a boost in morale, according to other people who work at the company. Even the newfound positive reception for the Facebook Portal - a much-ridiculed video chat device that all employees received to work from home - is a surprise.</p><p>Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is on the media circuit, touting the company's efforts to keep the public safe. He wrote an op-ed in The Post about how data is key to survival, and he sees the crisis as a potential moment of redemption for Facebook, according to people familiar with his thinking.</p><p>Amazon executives have also launched a media blitz, touting the company's role in supplying important goods to consumers.</p><p>Amazon is leading the biggest hiring spree, announcing more than 175,000 new, mostly low-wage jobs in warehouses and delivery. The company is openly recruiting workers who have been laid off from other industries, as it has struggled to keep up with the surge in consumer demand.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of its warehouse workers have protested their working conditions, and dozens of warehouses have workers who tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>\"We're investing heavily to keep our employees safe and to temporarily increase pay for associates - spending $500 million on pay increases alone through the end of April,\" Amazon's Perlet added in the statement.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that Apple chief executive Tim Cook recently told employees that the company felt so comfortable in its cash position that it would continue investing in research and development throughout this year and did not anticipate layoffs.</p><p>Big Tech's ability to continue hiring and sustaining itself through crises will give the companies an advantage not only in Silicon Valley but also in the economy at large. Many of the traditional industries expected to suffer - bricks-and-mortar retail, food service, and media and entertainment - are the same industries that have been gradually gutted by technology since the last recession.</p><p>And when the spending comes back, it will favor the biggest tech platforms over smaller digital ad companies and publishers, said Nicole Perrin, an analyst with eMarketer.</p><p>\"A lot of the traditional media and ad businesses have been in decline,\" Perrin said. \"The decline will happen faster this year, and a lot of that money will not come back, because it was slowly trickling away.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com\">elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com</email></p><p>Faiz Siddiqui in San Francisco and Jay Greene in Seattle contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-cf1676ca897c11ea8ac1bfb250876b7a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSM-GG81-DYX1-H1BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2085\"/><timeReceived>3:35 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Eine Art Vorl\u00e4ufer sehen wir jedenfalls im ersten britischen Direktversicherer (Top UK), der 1982 mit einem rein telefonischen Angebot startete.\u00a0In Deutschland kann der Einstieg ins E-Commerce des Direktversicherers Cosmos Direkt im Jahr 1996 als Meilenstein bezeichnet werden. Die inzwischen zur Generali-Gruppe z\u00e4hlende Gesellschaft d\u00fcrfte heute der weltweit gr\u00f6\u00dfte Direktversicherer im Lebengesch\u00e4ft sein.\u00a01999 begann der Online-Vertrieb von Huk-Coburg und auch die Allianz startete mitAllianz 24 einen Direktversicherer, der sp\u00e4ter unter dem Namen Allsecur bekannt wurde. Ebenfalls 1999 begann mit dem Marktstart von Check24 (damaliger Name: Einsurance) die Zeit der deutschen Online-Vergleichsportale. Im Jahr darauf folgte dann FinanceScout24.\u00a0 Check24 ist heute mit Abstand Marktf\u00fchrer beim Vergleich von Kfz-Versicherungsvertr\u00e4gen und wies einschlie\u00dflich seiner anderen Vergleichsportale (z.B. im Energiesektor) zuletzt einen Umsatz von rund 500 Mio. </p><p>Euro aus. 1999 startete auch Asuro, die mit einer Online-Plattform den\u00a0Kunden einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber ihre Versicherungsvertr\u00e4ge bot.\u00a0Im Jahr 2000 wurde der ausschlie\u00dflich online t\u00e4tige Versicherer HUK24 gegr\u00fcndet, der bis heute erfolgreichste deutsche Online-Versicherer.\u00a0 Die erste mobile App eines etablierten Versicherers war ab dem Jahr 2010 verf\u00fcgbar und stammte von der Munich-Re-Tochter Ergo direkt. 2010 schlug aber auch die Stunde der ,,echten\" Insurtechs. Mit den digitalen Policenverwaltern wie z.B. Simplr konnten Kunden auch mobil den \u00dcberblick \u00fcber ihre Versicherungspolicen sowie ihre Konten und Depots wahren. Ebenfalls 2010 trat mit Friendsurance zudem der erste Peer-to-Peer-Versicherer in den Markt ein und erm\u00f6glichte die gegenseitige Versicherung von (Bagatell-)Sch\u00e4den innerhalb einer Nutzergruppe, w\u00e4hrend nur gr\u00f6\u00dfere Sch\u00e4den von beteiligten Versicherern getragen werden.\u00a0 Ab 2013 gingen digitale Makler wie Knip und sp\u00e4ter Clark, Wefox und Getsafe an den Start. Sie sind inzwischen in der Regel auch als Policenverwalter t\u00e4tig und bieten Versicherungsvergleiche an. Seit dem Jahresende 2013 wurde von der SV Versicherung erstmals im deutschen Kfz-Versicherungsmarkt ein Telematik-Tarif angeboten. Es folgten Admiral Direkt, Allianz, Axa, Generali, Signal Iduna und VHV.\u00a0\u00a0Rein digitale Versicherer entstanden im Grunde erst im Jahr 2015. In der Idealvorstellung wird zwar ihre gesamte Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette digital abgebildet, in der Praxis f\u00e4llt jedoch allein schon aufgrund ihrer Telefon-Hotlines die Abgrenzung zu den etablierten Online-Versicherern schwer. Zu den Vorreitern z\u00e4hlen die Deutsche Familienversicherung (DFV) sowie der Krankenversicherer Ottonova und ab 2016 Element (Schaden- &amp; Unfall / White Label), One (Haftpflicht und Hausrat) und Neodigital (Privat- &amp; Tierhalterhaftpflicht, Hausrat &amp; Unfall). Ebenfalls ab dem Jahre 2016 tauchten mit Clark (und sp\u00e4ter Moneymeets) am Markt die ersten Makler auf, die bei der Analyse der bestehenden und der Auswahl von neuen Versicherungsvertr\u00e4gen auf Robo Advisory setzen.\u00a0</p><p>Ab dem Jahre 2017 erhielten Insurtechs wie Ottonova und Element Bafin-Lizenzen, wobei erstere von Munich Re und letztere von Debeka unterst\u00fctzt wurden. Zudem gr\u00fcndeten auch etablierte Versicherer reine Digitalmarken: Adam Riese / W&amp;W (Privathaftpflicht, Rechtsschutz), Friday / Baloise (Kfz) und Nexible / Ergo (Kfz). Im Jahr 2018 fand der Markteintritt vom Start-up Coya statt, das Schaden- &amp; Unfall-Policen anbietet. Erneut verschoben wurde hingegen der Start von Flypper (Privat- und Tierhalterhaftpflicht, Hausrat, Wohngeb\u00e4ude, Unfall).</p><p>Beim Blick auf deutsche Insurtechs nicht zu vernachl\u00e4ssigen sind Unternehmen, die zwar keinen direkten Kontakt zu Privatkunden haben, aber entweder als Makler f\u00fcr Firmenkunden agieren, oder als Dienstleister bzw. Zulieferer im digitalen Maschinenraum von Versicherern wichtige Teile deren Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette abbilden. Zu letzteren z\u00e4hlen - wobei es sich hierbei nicht um Insurtechs im engeren Sinn handelt - Unternehmen wie z.B. IBM und SAP.\u00a0Als Insurtech k\u00f6nnte aber MSG Life bezeichnet werden, die mit den inzwischen erworbenen Gesellschaften FJA und COR bereits seit 1987 Standard-Software f\u00fcr die Bestandsf\u00fchrungssysteme von Lebensversicherern anbieten. Sieht man von dem seit Dezember 2018 b\u00f6rsennotierten Digitalversicherer DFV ab, so sind COR (ab dem Jahr 1998) und FJA (ab dem Jahr 2000) die einzigen InsurTechs hierzulande, die - inzwischen unter MSG Life firmierend - \u00fcber eine B\u00f6rsennotiz verf\u00fcgen.\u00a0</p><p>Zu erw\u00e4hnen w\u00e4ren zum Beispiel aber auch die ,,Enabler\" von Anbietern von Annex- oder Nischenversicherungen bzw. situativen Versicherungen (On-Demand Policen). Aus dem direkten Kundenkontakt sind zwar in der Regel SituatiVe (AppSichern) und Simplesurance bekannt, die seit dem Jahr 2012 u.a. unter der Marke Schutzklick insbesondere Handys, aber auch Kameras und Fahrr\u00e4der versichern. Im Hintergrund von Online-H\u00e4ndlern arbeiten aber h\u00e4ufig Unternehmen (wie z.B. Virado und MassUp seit dem Jahr 2014), die ihnen das Angebot dieser Policen erm\u00f6glichen. Mit Blick auf neue Technologien f\u00fcr Versicherer sind bei den Themen Big Data und k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz z.B. Insurers.ai, MotionsCloud, Omni:us, Parlamind und Rasa zu nennen, die ab dem Jahr 2015 t\u00e4tig wurden. Mit Chatbots f\u00fcr den Kontakt mit Kunden besch\u00e4ftigen sich u.a. Kauz und Knowhere.</p><p>Beim Thema Blockchain bzw. Smart Contracts ist uns hierzulande lediglich Etherisc im Jahr 2016 aufgefallen, da sie eine auf Ethereum basierende Technik f\u00fcr Flugausfallversicherungen entwickelt hat (noch bevor Axa im Jahr 2017 ein \u00e4hnliches Produkt mit dem Namen Fizzy startete). Im Fall von Stornierungen oder Versp\u00e4tungen eines Fluges werden dabei automatisch Zahlungen an Kunden ausgel\u00f6st, ohne dass eine Schadenabteilung den Schaden \u00fcberpr\u00fcft. Den Vergleich und Abschluss von Cyber-Security-Policen f\u00fcr kleine und mittelgro\u00dfe Unternehmen bietet seit dem Jahr 2017 CyberDirekt an. Das ebenfalls im vergangenen Jahr gegr\u00fcndete Start-up Perseus bietet KMUs Schutz bzw. Hilfe bei Cyber-Attacken an und hat im Jahr 2018 zusammen mit Versicherern einen Cybersecurity Club gegr\u00fcndet.</p><p>Die gro\u00dfen deutschen und europ\u00e4ischen Versicherer setzen bei der F\u00f6rderung von InsurTech-Innovationen neben klassischen Beteiligungen v.a. auf die Unterst\u00fctzung in Form eines Akzelerators. Ein Akzelerator unterst\u00fctzt Gr\u00fcnder in zeitlich begrenztem Umfang nicht nur mit Kapital, sondern auch mit Coaching, Zugang zu Netzwerken, B\u00fcros und Infrastruktur. Ein Inkubator hingegen hat statt der schnellen Hilfe bei der Produkteinf\u00fchrung mehr die l\u00e4ngere Begleitung im Sinn, wobei sich diese beiden Formen der Innovationsf\u00f6rderungen nicht immer trennscharf abgrenzen lassen. Bei den selbst gemanagten Aktivit\u00e4ten sind neben der Gr\u00fcndung von digitalen Unternehmen auf der ,,Gr\u00fcnen Wiese\" und Joint Ventures mit anderen Unternehmen auch Digital Labs anzutreffen. Ein Digital Lab bzw. Innovation Lab (wie es z.B. von Axa im Silicon Valley unterhalten wird) b\u00fcndelt hausinterne Aktivit\u00e4ten in einem eigenst\u00e4ndigen Team,\u00a0dessen Mitarbeiter sich - losgel\u00f6st vom Tagesgesch\u00e4ft - mit digitalen Innovationen besch\u00e4ftigen. Ihre Ideen sollen als Motor f\u00fcr die Digitalisierung des ganzen Unternehmens dienen.</p><p>Allianz weist als Kooperationspartner u.a. JD.com, Visa und Panasonic auf und verf\u00fcgt z.B. \u00fcber Beteiligungen an Simplesurance, Lemonade und N26. Die IT-Investitionen liegen bei rund 3,5 Mrd. EUR p.a.\u00a02018 wurden offenbar 840 Mio. Euro rein in Digitalisierung investiert, u.a. um einen europ\u00e4ischen Direktversicherer (Allianz Direct) aufzubauen. Axa verf\u00fcgt u.E. bislang \u00fcber die aussichtsreichste InsurTech-Strategie unter den von uns analysierten europ\u00e4ischen Versicherern. Daf\u00fcr sprechen prominente Kooperationspartner (z.B. Alibaba, Ebay, Facebook und Uber), InsurTech- F\u00f6rderung u.a. via Digital Lab und Inkubator aber auch Beteiligungen wie z.B. an Policy Genius und Limelight. Generali wirkte lange beim Thema InsurTechs recht defensiv. Der Konzern kooperiert mit Nest Labs / Google und Devolo (Hausautomation). Zuletzt fiel er z.B. durch Kooperation mit Etherisc und Shift Cryptosecurity (Versicherung von Kryptow\u00e4hrungen), Skin Vision (Hautkrebsvorsorge) sowie in Indien durch Schadensmeldung via WhatsApp auf. Hannover Re leidet als reiner R\u00fcckversicherer kaum unter Digitalisierungsdruck. Neben mehreren Eigenentwicklungen wie ReFlex (Risikopr\u00fcfung am Point-of-Sale) existieren zwar relativ wenige (Insur-)Tech-Kooperationen, aber einige Beteiligungen wie z.B. Sureify (Customer Engagement Tools), Perseus (Cyber-Schutz) und Qinematic (Scan-Software).</p><p>Munich Re hat u.E. die am breitesten diversifizierten Insurtech-Aktivit\u00e4ten. Der Konzern besitzt u.a. den Online-Versicherer nexible und den IoT-Spezialist Relayr. Es existieren z.B. Kooperation mit InsurTechs wie Getsafe, One, Slice und Trov bzw. mit Bosch (Sensorik), Dt. Telekom (Haussicherheit), Precisionhawk (Drohnen), KuKa und MHP. Swiss Re liegt u.E. beim Stand der InsurTech-Aktivit\u00e4ten zwischen Hannover Re und Munich Re. Neben zahlreichen Eigenentwicklungen und der Tochter Community Life existieren Beteiligungen an CarlQ (nutzungsabh\u00e4ngige Kfz-Vers.), Tyche (Machine Learning f. Gewerbevers.) und Vouch (P2P-Kfz-Versicherung). Kooperiert wird insbesondere mitSAP. Talanx betreibt u.E. eine verhaltene Digitalstrategie. Neben Eigenentwicklungen wie Argos (Geoinformation), Cyber+Smart (Cyber Insurance) und Eagent (Online-Sales-Plattform) bestehen Beteiligungen an Finleap (Start-up-Schmiede) und Elinvar (Asset-Management-Plattform). Kooperiert wird mit ExB (KI) und xbaV (betriebliche Altersversorgung). Zurich ist bei der Kommunikation von Insurtech-Aktivit\u00e4ten defensiv. Bekannt sind aber u.a. Kooperationen mitVodafone (Smart Home) und Coverwallet (SME-Versicherungsmanagement) sowie Beteiligungen an FitSense (Fitness- App), DIG (Mobile Versicherungsplattform), OutShared (Self-Service-Plattform) und Brightbox (Connected Cars).</p><p>Wie bereits erl\u00e4utert, d\u00fcrfte der (potenzielle) Konkurrenzdruck durch InsurTechs und Big Techs auf die etablierten Versicherer zum einen mit dem Anteil des Schaden- &amp; Unfallversicherungsgesch\u00e4fts an den Pr\u00e4mieneinnahmen steigen. Zum anderen steigt der Druck sicherlich auch mit dem Anteil des Erstversicherungsgesch\u00e4fts. Lebensversicherer einerseits und R\u00fcckversicherer andererseits d\u00fcrften weniger unter dem Druck durch die Techno-Konkurrenz stehen. Ordnet man die europ\u00e4ischen (R\u00fcck-) Versicherer in unserem Coverage-Universum (siehe Abbildung unten) entsprechend ihrem relativen\u00a0Exposure, so scheint der Druck im Fall von Zurich und Talanx am h\u00f6chsten zu sein. Es folgen Axa , Allianz und Generali. Munich Re und Swiss Re, in erster Linie aber ,,reine R\u00fcckversicherer\" wie Hannover Re sollten weniger stark betroffen sein.</p><p>Ist in der Versicherungsbranche angesichts der Vielzahl der entstehenden Insurtechs bald mit einem Pendant zum Taxivermittler Uber zu rechnen, der die Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle der etablierten Anbieter manchenorts in den Grundfesten ersch\u00fcttert hat? Oder droht sogar Online-Versicherern Konkurrenz durch neuere und (noch) billigere Anbieter? Unseres Erachtens sind keine InsurTechs in Sicht, die eine ,,Revolution\" in der Versicherungsbranche ausl\u00f6sen k\u00f6nnten. Auch die ,,Gefahr\", dass solch ein Anbieter k\u00fcnftig entsteht, h\u00e4lt sich aus unserer Perspektive in Grenzen. Da wir weitreichende Gratis-Angebote im Versicherungsgesch\u00e4ft u.a. aus regulatorischen Gr\u00fcnden ausschlie\u00dfen, m\u00fcsste ein solcher Anbieter den Zugang zum Kunden durch den Aufbau eines Markennamens erst teuer erkaufen. Nur wenige (wie hierzulande z.B. Check24 oder Hypoport) d\u00fcrften \u00fcber ausreichend Kapital verf\u00fcgen, um dies in gro\u00dfem Umfang gew\u00e4hrleisten zu k\u00f6nnen. Hinzu kommt, dass eine rasche internationale Expansion aufgrund der national z.T. sehr unterschiedlichen H\u00fcrden (wie z.B. Solvenzanforderungen und Vertriebszulassungen) zumindest au\u00dferhalb der EU-Staaten stark erschwert wird. Der bei weitem gr\u00f6\u00dfte Teil der Insurtechs d\u00fcrfte aus unserer Sicht als Serviceanbieter oder Produktlieferant mit den etablierten Versicherern kooperieren. Die Start-ups, die auf ,,Revolution\" setzen, d\u00fcrften in der Mehrzahl zu klein bleiben, um den etablierten Anbieter ernsthaft gef\u00e4hrlich werden zu k\u00f6nnen. Falls ,,revolution\u00e4re\" Insurtechs in gr\u00f6\u00dferem Umfang Erfolg haben sollten, w\u00e4ren aus unserer Sicht etablierte Versicherer in der Lage, durch Eigenentwicklungen, Beteiligungen und Kooperationen mit anderen Start-ups zumindest mitzuhalten.\u00a0 In Einzelf\u00e4llen k\u00f6nnte es f\u00fcr gro\u00dfe Versicherer aus der Old Economy dennoch notwendig werden, sehr erfolgreiche InsurTechs aufzukaufen, bevor deren Marktanteile zu gro\u00df und der Kaufpreis zu hoch werden. Das Risiko, dass dies im Fall der F\u00e4lle misslingt, weil die Eigent\u00fcmer der InsurTechs den Verkauf ihrer Anteile verweigern, ist allerdings nicht unerheblich.</p><p>Die Gefahr durch eine ,,z\u00fcndende Idee\" bleibt zwar allgegenw\u00e4rtig, die wesentlich konkretere Bedrohung geht aus unserer Sicht jedoch von ,,Big Tech\" aus, d.h. konkret von Digital Global Playern wie Amazon, Google, Apple und Facebook. Sie verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber ein weltumspannendes Netz an Nutzer bzw. Kunden, von denen u.E. viele vergleichsweise leicht zu Versicherungskunden gemacht werden k\u00f6nnten, indem sie in die im Aufbau befindlichen Ecosysteme dieser Konzerne eingebunden werden.\u00a0 Hinzu kommen die bislang vornehmlich in Asien t\u00e4tigen Online-Giganten Alibaba und Tencent (dem auch der f\u00fchrende chinesische Instant-Messaging-Dienstes WeChat angeh\u00f6rt). WeChat betreibt bereits heute ein Ecosystem, das gro\u00dfe Teile der Lebensbereiche der Nutzer umfasst, wie z.B. Instant Messenging, Telefongespr\u00e4che, Computerspiele, Online-Shopping, Zahlungsverkehr, Lieferdienste und Taxi-Angebote (zusammen mit Didi).\u00a0 Von den Big Techs der kalifornischen Technologie-Hochburgen sehen wir im Fall von Apple trotz der hohen Kundenzahl kaum Gefahr f\u00fcr etablierte europ\u00e4ische Versicherer ausgehen. Abgesehen von Produktversicherungen bzw. Garantieverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr die hauseigenen Produkte (Apple+ und Apple Protection Plan) hat das Unternehmen bislang auch keine Neigungen erkennen lassen, in den Versicherungsmarkt einzudringen. Abgesehen von den dort wesentlich geringeren Margen w\u00fcrde dies u.E. auch nur schwer zum Luxus-Image von Apple passen.\u00a0 Facebook (inkl. WhatsApp) weist zwar wesentlich gr\u00f6\u00dfere Nutzerzahlen auf als Apple und verf\u00fcgt auch \u00fcber sehr detaillierte pers\u00f6nliche Daten seiner Nutzer, was ein passgenaues Angebot von Policen und die Risikoselektion stark erleichtern w\u00fcrde. Allerdings w\u00fcrden wir hierin massive zus\u00e4tzliche Datenschutz-Probleme \u00fcber diejenigen hinaus erkennen, wegen denen der Konzern seit einiger Zeit ohnehin am medialen Pranger steht. Einen Markteintritt als Makler auf dem Facebook Marketplace kann aber aus unserer Warte nicht v\u00f6llig ausgeschlossen werden.\u00a0 Im Gegensatz zu den beiden bereits genannten Konzernen hat sich Google tats\u00e4chlich bereits ins Versicherungsgesch\u00e4ft vorgetastet. Der Konzern hat sich nicht nur an den US-InsurTechs Oscar Health und Lemonade beteiligt, sondern - vermutlich in Kooperation mit Branchengr\u00f6\u00dfen - Versicherungen f\u00fcr mobile Endger\u00e4te angeboten (Google Protect bzw. Nexus Protect). Zudem betrieb der Konzern Vergleichsportale f\u00fcr Kfz-Versicherungen, Kreditkarten und Hypotheken (Google Compare), die allerdings 2013 (Frankreich) bzw. 2016 (USA und Gro\u00dfbritannien) eingestellt wurden. Der seit 2013 geplante Markteintritt in Deutschland wurde abgesagt. Trotz des Scheiterns der genannten Vorhaben ist ein neuer Anlauf im Versicherungsgesch\u00e4ft nicht auszuschlie\u00dfen. Dies zeigt auch die im Okt. 2018 verk\u00fcndete Minderheitsbeteiligung an Applied Systems (GB / Irland), die Managementsysteme f\u00fcr Versicherungsvermittler anbieten.\u00a0 Die besten Chancen, erfolgreich ins Erstversicherungsgesch\u00e4ft (evtl. als Makler) vorzudringen, r\u00e4umen wir Amazon ein. Der Konzern nennt einerseits einen umfangreichen Schatz an Kundendaten sein eigen. Zum anderen hat er - im Gegensatz zu den zuvor genannten Unternehmen - bewiesen, nicht nur Smartphone-Besitzer und Suchmaschinen-Nutzer zu bedienen, sondern zahlende Kunden erfolgreich mit h\u00f6chst effizientem Online-Shopping-Service versorgen zu k\u00f6nnen. Amazon war bereits in der Vergangenheit sehr erfolgreich darin, ganze Branchen vor sich herzutreiben.\u00a0 Neben dem komfortablen Online-Service und der ausgekl\u00fcgelten Logistik trugen hierzu v.a. attraktive Preise bei. Insbesondere im Buchhandel konnte sich der Konzern erfolgreich zwischen Produzenten und Endverbraucher dr\u00e4ngen und sich so - unter Nutzung von Skalenvorteilen und modernster Technologie - einen erheblichen Teil der Margen der Buchh\u00e4ndler sichern. Zuletzt sorgte aber auch der Kauf des Online-Pharmah\u00e4ndlers Pillpack f\u00fcr Aufsehen. Amazon bietet seit 2016 in Kooperation mit etablierten Versicherern wie z.B. Warranty Group / London, General und ERGO Garantieverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr (Elektro-)Produkte an, die bei Amazon gekauft wurden (Amazon Protect).\u00a0 Im November 2017 suchte Amazon zudem in gr\u00f6\u00dferem Stil Fachkr\u00e4fte f\u00fcr einen in London ans\u00e4ssigen Gesch\u00e4ftsbereich. Nicht zuletzt hat der Konzern im laufenden Jahr gemeinsam mitJ.P. Morgan und Berkshire Hathaway die Neugr\u00fcndung einer US-Krankenversicherers angek\u00fcndigt. Schlie\u00dflich k\u00f6nnte auch die Beteiligung an dem indischen Insurtech Acko General Insurance als Teil der Vorbereitung eines ,,Angriffs\" im Versicherungsgesch\u00e4ft gedeutet werden. Zuletzt machten Ger\u00fcchte um den Start einer Versicherungsvergleichsplattform in Gro\u00dfbritannien die Runde. \u00a0</p><p>Gro\u00dfe Teile der Produktpalette des Versicherungsgesch\u00e4fts sollten aufgrund der Komplexit\u00e4t der Schadensabwicklung auf Jahre hinweg in den H\u00e4nden etablierter Anbieter bleiben - zumindest soweit es sich um komplizierte Versicherungsprodukte handelt, wie z.B. private Haftpflicht- oder Krankenvollversicherungen bzw. gewerbliche All-Risk-Policen. Hinderlich f\u00fcr Direktversicherer jeder Art d\u00fcrfte zudem sein, dass die Anonymit\u00e4t der Kunden schlechtere Risiken anlocken k\u00f6nnte als dies bei etablierten Versicherern mit pers\u00f6nlichem Kontakt zum Vertreter der Fall ist. Die automatisierte Kommunikation mit Chatbots oder virtuellen Assistenten erh\u00f6ht u.E. auch die Gefahr von Versicherungsbetrug. Schlie\u00dflich k\u00f6nnte die Bequemlichkeit bei der Schadensmeldung Kunden in manchen F\u00e4llen dazu ,,verleiten\", auch kleinere Sch\u00e4den zu melden. In Summe d\u00fcrften diese Faktoren dazu f\u00fchren, dass die Schadenquoten von Online-Versicherern h\u00f6her als zun\u00e4chst erhofft ausfallen - egal, ob sie von Big Techs betrieben werden oder von anderen Anbietern. Nicht zu vernachl\u00e4ssigen ist an dieser Stelle, dass einzelne gro\u00dfe Versicherer l\u00e4ngst begonnen haben, umfangreiche Abwehrstrategien gegen\u00fcber Big Techs zu entwickeln: So hat z.B. Chinas zweitgr\u00f6\u00dfter Versicherer Ping An Milliarden Euro in seine Ecosysteme gesteckt. Von den knapp 26 Mio. Neukunden, die Ping An im ersten Halbjahr 2018 hinzugewinnen konnte, stammen 30 Prozent aus den f\u00fcnf Ecosystemen des Konzerns. Im Ecosystem Gesundheit hat inzwischen allein Ping An Good Doctor 230 Mio. registrierte Nutzer. Nicht zuletzt z\u00e4hlt Ping An zu den Gr\u00fcndungsgesellschaftern des chinesischen Online-Versicherers Zhong An, der seine Policen u.a. \u00fcber Alibaba und Tencent vertreibt und seit seiner Gr\u00fcndung im Jahr 2013 bereits 450 Mio. Kunden gewonnen hat.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VERSW-71672fb8678743e4a0b9c2b8d98201fb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VERSW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJP-7BM1-JCTG-30MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247750</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3215\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 VVW GmbH Alle Rechte vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName><br/>Versicherungswirtschaft</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"41786\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>Ausg.3</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>1.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, you may have seen was arrested this morning in London, dragged from his longtime refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy there and thrown into a police pen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Assange's arrest is a remarkable new development in a long and fascinating story. One that tells you a lot about our leaders and their priorities. We will have that story for you in just a minute.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first tonight for details on what exactly happened to Assange today, we're joined by Fox's chief intelligence correspondent, Catherine Herridge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, thanks, Tucker. This seven-page Virginia indictment was filed in March 2018 and unsealed earlier today as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested in London after Ecuador withdrew asylum.</p><p>Assange spent seven years in their embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape allegation. The indictment alleges that Assange engaged in a bride conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army to access classified information on Defense Department computers.</p><p>WikiLeaks eventually posted thousands of classified defense and State Department records. Assange's lawyer issued a statement this morning defending his client as a reporter and publisher quote, \"The U.K. courts will need to resolve what appears to be an unprecedented effort by the United States seeking to extradite a foreign journalist to face criminal charges for publishing truthful information.\"</p><p>Former U.S. government officials and legal experts predict a protracted legal battle for Assange and the Justice Department over a host of issues including extradition that may go well beyond the Trump presidency, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks a lot, Catherine, for that summation. Appreciate it. Well, if you watch a lot of the coverage of this story today on television, you likely came away with the understanding that Julian Assange is some kind of Russian spy who is in trouble tonight because he stole classified documents from the U.S. government. That is not true. It's factually incorrect and saying so it's not a defense of Assange, we're not here to promote him or excuse any number of things he said over the years that we disagree with quite a lot.</p><p>But just so it's clear, whatever his sins, Assange did not steal documents from the United States government. He did not hacked the DNC servers. He didn't break into John Podesta's Gmail account. There is no proof that he is working for the Russian government or ever has worked for the Russian government. Assange has never been charged with any of that and wasn't today, no matter what they tell you.</p><p>If you're upset about the theft of classified documents from the U.S. government, and there is reason to be, we already know who did that. A 22- year-old army private named Bradley Manning, now called Chelsea Manning. In 2013, Manning pleaded guilty to stealing secret material and got 35 years in prison for it. Shortly after that Barack Obama commuted Manning's sentence, this allowed Manning to leave jail decades early, go back on television as a commentator, and then run for political office.</p><p>So if your real concern is America's national security, you have someone to be angry at -- Barack Obama. And yet strangely, nobody is. Instead they're furious at Julian Assange for printing the documents that other people stole. Quote, \"Julian Assange has long been a wicked tool of Vladimir Putin and the Russian intelligence services,\" wrote professional moralizer Ben Sasse who also serves in the U.S. Senate. \"He deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison.\" Wicked? The rest of his life in prison? Idi Amin ate people and never faced this kind of scorn. Not even close, nor for the record was Amin ever extradited. He died at 78 years old in his own bed leaving behind 43 loving children.</p><p>So what's going on here? A couple of things. First, Julian Assange embarrassed virtually everyone in power in Washington. He published documents that undermined the official story on the Iraq War and Afghanistan. He got Debbie Wasserman-Schultz fired from the DNC. He humiliated Hillary Clinton by showing that the Democratic primaries were in fact rigged. Pretty much everyone in Washington has reason to hate Julian Assange.</p><p>Rather than just admit that straightforwardly, he made us look like buffoons, so now we're sending him to prison. Instead, they're denouncing him as, you guessed it, a Russian agent. Watch Senator Richard Blumenthal explain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Justice should come to Julian Assange for his role in Russian meddling in our election and the sooner the better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Okay, so once again, just to be totally clear, no one has ever shown that Julian Assange is a Russian agent. The indictment against him today does not say that, it doesn't mention Russia at all. But that has not stopped virtually every politician in Washington from repeating Senator Blumenthal's line including many Republicans.</p><p>Robert Mueller nearly killed the Russia collusion hoax. Julian Assange is allowing them to keep it alive. You think journalists would say something about this. Assange is after all, one of them. What do you call a man who publishes news for a living? Assange is no sleazier than many journalists in Washington, he's definitely not more anti-American. He's broken stories the \"New York Times\" would have won Pulitzers for, and yet many of his colleagues have disowned him.</p><p>\"Oh, please,\" wrote Alexia Campbell of Vox, \"Assange is no journalist. We know who he works for,\" meaning Russia. \"Julian Assange is not a journalist,\" explained Jelani Cobb of \"The New Yorker\" without actually explaining. Ken Dilanian of NBC who doesn't so much cover the national security state as he write memos on its behalf noted that quote, \"Many believe that if Assange ever was a journalist, those days ended a long time ago.\" At NBC when they tell you many believe something, it means they believe it.</p><p>So why all the hostility to Julian Assange? Well, we'll let former Democratic staffer and current CNN anchor Jim Sciutto explain. Assange's real sin was preventing Hillary Clinton from becoming President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: He is central to several cases. He is central to Russian interference in the election. The U.S. intelligence views him as a middleman, a cutout that he was in effect part of this interference. He's central to questions about what the Trump administration or Trump campaign, I should say, knew prior to the release of those materials, right? What were the communications between Roger Stone, et cetera? It's possible that this has something President Trump himself is not particularly excited about.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's remarkable to watch this. It's bewildering actually. There was a time not so long ago, really when reporters didn't applaud the arrest of other journalists for publishing information.</p><p>In 1971, \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" published a trove of stolen classified documents about the Vietnam War. It was called the Pentagon Papers. Remember that? Liberals loved it. Books were written celebrating their bravery. As recently as 2011, \"The Washington Post\" saw the connection, quote, \"A conviction of Julian Assange would also cause collateral damage to American media freedoms.\" A post op-ed said that year, quote, \"It is difficult to distinguish Assange or Wikileaks from \"The Washington Post.\" And that's true. But that was before the Trump election and the total war that followed, a war in which the media have definitively chosen a side.</p><p>Press Freedom? Sure, as long as we agree with your politics. The First Amendment? Well, that all depends, who did you vote for? The guardians of speech or now the enemies of speech. The people charged with policing power are now colluding with power. There's a reason you see John Brennan on NBC all the time. They're all on the same team now.</p><p>We're not saying any of this to defend Julian Assange. We just want to be absolutely clear about who hurts this country more, and it's not him.</p><p>Author and columnist, Mark Steyn joins us tonight. Mark, thanks a lot for coming on. Whatever you think of Julian Assange or the material that he published, is it a little strange to see journalists who laud \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" for publishing stolen classified documents during Vietnam applaud his imprisonment?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Absolutely, Tucker. I mean, I agree 100 percent with what you've just said, but I hadn't seen that Jim Sciutto CNN clip, and I'm shocked at the idea that because he thinks somehow Julian Assange knows something about the Trump campaign in 2016 that gives the U.S. government the right to demand that London extradite an Australian to Washington to go to jail.</p><p>I mean, even if you take everything that Jim Sciutto said as true, there is absolutely no -- there is absolutely no basis for what the government is proposing to do to Assange, except that he made everyone in Washington look like chumps.</p><p>CARLSON: Is it a little odd to have a former Democratic official who worked in the Obama administration now on CNN with a microphone, telling us that we're immoral if we don't believe the pronouncements of the permanent bureaucracy here in Washington. Does it seem like an inside game a little bit?</p><p>STEYN: Yes, I think so. I think this is all an inside game. It's the duty -- basically, it's the duty of the government to keep its secrets, and if the most lavishly funded, quote, unquote, \"intelligence community\" on the planet, can't keep it secrets, the idea that it has the right to go to war against the people who publish those secrets is something that as you said, 20, 30, 40 years ago, the press would be up in arms about.</p><p>Now, to see the American media serving as lickspittles of the Deep State is a deeply bizarre transformation.</p><p>This is basically -- the stuff that Julian Assange published, this indictment is extremely weak. The idea that he somehow goaded and encouraged Manning to steal this stuff. The line he used was -- Manning tells Assange, \"That's all I've got left to give to you.\" And Assange says, \"Curious is never run dry in my experience.\"</p><p>The idea that a corrupt Federal criminal justice system could extradite and convict him a man on the basis of those words, or to disturb every American, actually, anyone who believes in liberty.</p><p>CARLSON: That's right. Spend 10 minutes reading about Chelsea Manning, then Bradley Manning, and ask yourself would any competent, same person give that individual access to classified information? Put that person in proximity of classified information? No one was ever held accountable for the recklessness of allowing Chelsea Manning to steal that information.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CARLSON: And I have to say, is it weird to see Republican office holders continue with the ludicrous lie that Russia is somehow the gravest threat America faces on the world stage?</p><p>STEYN: No, no.</p><p>CARLSON: That's insane.</p><p>STEYN: No, Assange is some goofy Australian internet lefty, he has got nothing to do with Putin. But your point is actually the critical one here. If this was a real and if this was an intelligent intelligence community, Bradley Manning - Chelsea Manning wouldn't been able to walk out with all that stuff, just download it and take it out.</p><p>There are four million people with top secret intelligence clearances in this country. That's a population the size of New Zealand. If you gave top secret clearances to four million people, you're not that intelligent an intelligence community in the first place.</p><p>CARLSON: No. I don't know why I'm laughing. So grim.</p><p>STEYN: No, it's tragic, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: It's so grim and true, but there's no one is ever held accountable for their incompetence or the recklessness with which they manage our country. And so they haul this guy off to jail and we're all supposed to feel safe, but I don't feel safe.</p><p>STEYN: No and you shouldn't feel safe and just -- I listened to Blumenthal and/or Ben Sasse saying this guy should be going to jail forever. Americans flip it the other way around. Americans would be up in arms if the government of Australia were demanding that London extradite a U.S. citizen to Australia for publishing Australian intelligence secrets.</p><p>You look at it the other way around, Americans would rightly see this as a gross infringement on the freedom of American citizens.</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>STEYN: I hope this English judge who has asked the Americans to put up the proofs by June, I hope when he sees what they put up in June that the English judge tosses this thing right out.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I don't think we want Assange in Washington because once he starts talking in open court, a lot of people are going to regret that he did that.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CARLSON: I think. Mark Steyn, great to see and we're going to see just a minute from now on \"Final Exam\" as a contestant. Good luck.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, I've been rehearsing. I'm pumped. I'm ready to go.</p><p>CARLSON: Good. Thank you. Well, the creepy porn lawyer could soon be the creepy porn prisoner. He's been hit with yet another indictment. This one is unbelievable, the details -- and it implicates CNN, too, so it's really got everything. It would be a shame if you missed it. We'll be right back.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the hits keep coming for the creepy porn lawyer. CNN's favorite guest was just hit with 36 new felony charges. He's been accused of fraud, bribery, embezzlement, and one case of robbing a paralyzed man. Trace Gallagher has the latest on this -- Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And Tucker, for a guy who builds himself as a winner, he is on a losing streak to beat the band and in those 36 counts, you mentioned, several of them are for wire fraud. But wait until you hear what the alleged wire fraud entailed. Here's the California U.S. Attorney, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLA HANNA, CALIFORNIA U.S. ATTORNEY: Wire fraud related to the theft of millions of dollars from five clients, including a paraplegic man who agreed to a multi-million dollar settlement, but has received only a fraction of the money despite the fact that Mr. Avenatti received the full settlement amount over four years ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Yes, the U.S. Attorney went on to point out that the government actually cut off the paralyzed man's disability payments because Stormy Daniels' former attorney would not even file paperwork saying that man was awarded a settlement. The indictment says Stormy's former lawyer also took another client's $2.5 million settlement and bought a private jet. Yesterday that plane was seized.</p><p>And so the man who had his eyes on the White House may have to settle for the big house. If convicted, Stormy's former lawyer is looking at 333 years in prison. Good behavior, maybe he's out in 100 and his response to all this is quoting, \"For 20 years, I have represented Davids versus Goliaths and relied on due process and our system of justice. Along the way, I had made many powerful enemies, I am entitled to a full presumption of innocence, and I am confident that justice will be done once all the facts are known.\"</p><p>But don't forget, that's just his West Coast David versus Goliath battle. He is also facing Federal charges in New York of trying to extort Nike for $20 million -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: It sounds like he may have fleeced a few David's along the way. Trace Gallagher, great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>Well, it's horrifying, of course in a car crash kind of way, but the continuing collapse of creepy porn lawyer is also a surprise really to no one, well, actually someone -- CNN's head media critic.</p><p>While the creepy porn lawyer and future creepy porn prisoner was robbing the disabled, this little guy was calling him a serious presidential contender. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Looking ahead to 2020, one reason why I'm taking you seriously as a contender is because of your presence on cable news.</p><p>MICHAEL AVENATTI, LAWYER: I've got 20 years of experience at a very high level. As an attorney, I understand how governmental regulations are passed, how laws are passed, how the Supreme Court works. I have an extreme depth of knowledge ...</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: \"I'm taking you seriously as a Presidential contender.\" Here's the best part, his show is called \"Reliable Sources.\" Hilarious.</p><p>Well, every single House Democrat, except one is backing a bill that would require all high schools nationwide to let biological men compete on women's sports teams. Now, to most people that seems insane and to female athletes, it is of course grossly unfair. But now it's orthodoxy. Science and common sense are irrelevant, the orthodox will not be questioned.</p><p>Meanwhile, a taxpayer funded study sponsored by the NIH -- National Institutes of Health -- is allowing sex change hormones to be given to children as young as eight years old. So what are the effects of that? Do we know? Dr. Marc Siegel is Fox News medical contributor and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Doctor, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So whenever you have an advancement in culture that nobody is allowed to question and then it bleeds over into science, it makes me nervous -- no matter what it is, whether I like it or not. I haven't heard a single person ask the obvious question, what is the effect of giving hormone suppressing drugs voluntarily to children?</p><p>SIEGEL: I think there's a long-term effect. First of all, puberty blockers which you start with like an anti-estrogen or an anti-androgen that followed by hormone therapy as they enter adolescence can lead to neurological problems, problems with bone growth and sterility later on. So that's just the physical issues. There's also the psychological impact and the neurological impact of having to transition someone that may decide later on that they want to go back the other way.</p><p>Of course, we should support transgender children. Of course, we should support a child's choice, and that's what the American Academy of Pediatrics says. But when they talk about giving these drugs, these hormones, I get very nervous. And I think to myself, \"Who is super imposing their will here? Is it doctors or is it parents?\" Because again, a child is someone that I want to watch develop? There's no reason to be questioning sexuality and sexual choice in a nine-year-old. We have to wait and see which way it goes.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I mean, it almost sounds like Munchausen by proxy. I mean, it sounds like the parent is sort of displacing onto the kid maybe something that's going on with them or who knows, but it doesn't seem responsible at all, and it seems incredibly risky. It seems demented, to be honest with you.</p><p>Where are the adults standing up, and saying, \"Well wait a second,\" you know, \"These are --\"</p><p>SIEGEL: Well, 1,100 adults wrote a letter saying, \"We don't agree with the American Academy of Pediatrics,\" and by the way, your point about Munchausen by proxy, I think is excellent because I think parents have guilt. They think, \"Wait a minute, maybe I'm not doing enough. Maybe we really aren't going --\"</p><p>This is our culture now, right? We have to listen to every word. But I think our job as parents is to guide, to support, not to be mean or anything, but to support and watch development in progress.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>SIEGEL: I don't think we give drugs and I don't think we look for doctors that do our bidding for us. There's a long-term effect here.</p><p>CARLSON: So if you were to stand up at a medical conference and say what you just did, which strikes me as extremely moderate, you know, way more -- I mean, right? It doesn't seem controversial what you just said, how would you be received?</p><p>SIEGEL: It depends on the conference. You know, I have a feeling that the Democratic lawmakers are trying to pander to a certain group, but it depends. Doctors are varied on this issue, and I think a lot of doctors would agree with me, \"Do no harm.\" We are not dealing with a disease, we're dealing with a developing child. Let them develop, support their psychological development.</p><p>And by the way, to your earlier point, when we're talking about athletics, I believe it's a competitive advantage to allow someone that is born a male, and then -- and had all these years of testosterone building up muscle, right, building up bone and then we allow them to compete with women -- that's giving them a competitive advantage. I call that juicing.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course it is. I mean, that's called biology, but it's being denied by the United States House of Representatives explicitly, and by the interest group that is pushing this and that's shocking to me. Anyway, doctor, thanks very much for clarity on that. Good to see you.</p><p>SIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: A Democrat says his takeaway from the Jussie Smollett case is that all of the police are racist. We will explain what he said after the break.</p><p>BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOBBY RUSH (D-IL): The FOP is the sworn enemy of black people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Keep in mind that Jussie Smollett paid men to pour bleach on him and put a rope around his neck and then blamed an entire ethnic group for doing it. He did that as part of a fake hate crime. He has gotten away with it due to the pretty obvious corruption of Prosecutor Kim Foxx.</p><p>Last week, police protested Foxx's corruption. Instead of joining them, Illinois Democratic Congressman, Bobby Rush, denounced the police. \"They are racist,\" he said. They hate some people based on their skin color.</p><p>Kevin Graham is the President of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police and he joins us tonight. Mr. Graham, thanks very much for coming on. So you have a sitting member of Congress ...</p><p>KEVIN GRAHAM, PRESIDENT, CHICAGO FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: ... dismissing the entire Chicago Police Department as racist. How do you respond to that?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, first of all, I guess he is unaware that the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department is black.</p><p>CARLSON: I noticed that.</p><p>GRAHAM: And 25 percent of the Chicago Police Department is also black, and there's about another 25 percent that is Hispanic. So I don't know where he gets the idea that Chicago Police are racist, but I think it makes her rhetoric and let's face it, he's a former Black Panther. He has never liked the police. He has made incendiary comments in the past. And you know, we stand against hatred. We are there to protect people and not to incite people. So I think he is speaking irresponsibly, and I hope that the Members of Congress take action.</p><p>CARLSON: Chicago is a big complicated city with a lot of disorder and violence and it needs a competent Police Department. Who is going to want to join the Chicago Police Department if when you do, you get called a racist on the basis of no evidence by some buffoon in the Congress?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, you know, this is a very tough job. It's one of the toughest jobs in the country. Our city has gone through a lot problems. We are trying to make inroads. I can tell you this that the Fraternal Order of Police, three months -- two months ago brought a plan to the Superintendent about linking police officers with churches and we are trying to mend fences. We are trying to get out in the community to make sure that there is direct community and police involvement.</p><p>We're the ones that are doing that. We're the ones that are trying to make sure that people have confidence in the police and know that we're going to be there and protect them. And it certainly doesn't help when somebody makes irresponsible comments like Congressman Rush did.</p><p>CARLSON: But if -- I mean, look, you don't get rich being a cop. It's dangerous. And if in addition to those two things, you have office holders attacking your moral character, again, on the basis of no evidence, why would competent good people want to become cops at a certain point?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, you're absolutely right. I mean, in July, we're going to be without a contract for two years. These officers haven't even had a raise. And the city doesn't seem to be interested in trying to settle a contract to try to help these, so yes, you're right. There's going to be problems with recruiting and they're going to wind up lowering the standards, and then they're going to have more problems.</p><p>So you know, it is going to be a Catch 22. And so the city and the Police Department need to work with the FOP to try and make sure that the people in the City of Chicago are protected. And they really need to get on board with us and make sure that we can protect the people of the city, and that seems to have been falling by the wayside, certainly at operation push with Congressman Bobby Rush.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and Jussie -- so for example, really quickly, what is the starting salary for a cop in Chicago?</p><p>GRAHAM: It's about $40,000.00.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, okay. And so you're getting lectured by people who fly in private planes all the time about how you are bad people, I mean, how does that make you feel?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, it certainly that they're not in touch with reality. I mean, our guys go out there. Our police officers do an amazing job every day. They do everything they can. Now, I will tell you this, no situation is perfect. But our officers go out with -- and I had to answer a call from another officer just the other day about the lack of equipment in one of the districts. They're doing their best with what they have.</p><p>And certainly, we're trying to do our best to serve the people and I don't know where they're going to get police officers who are going to want this job.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. Who would want that? The only people who are going to want it are the people you're not going to want to be cops, and this is really a bad cycle that you're embarking on. Kevin, thank you very much, and Godspeed.</p><p>GRAHAM: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Last week, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg wrote an op-ed calling for governments worldwide to band together to regulate free speech. Brendan Carr is an FCC Commissioner. He just wrote his own op-ed responding to Mark Zuckerberg and he joins us tonight. Brendan, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>BRENDAN CARR, FCC COMMISSIONER: Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: So the big tech companies would like free speech regulated by government. What could go wrong?</p><p>CARR: It's pretty remarkable actually. So if you think about it, Facebook has been under mounting scrutiny recently for a number of its practices -- how it protects your online data, how it shares that data, and most directly now, how it moderates online speech. Lawmakers and the public have been asking a lot of serious questions about what they let you say on the platform, and the posts they let you see on the platform.</p><p>In response to that pushback, Facebook has come up with a new idea that heads in a totally wrong direction. It wants the government to step in and start policing your online speech for it and look, outsourcing government censorship -- outsourcing censorship to the government isn't just a bad idea, it's a violation of the First Amendment, so I'm a no on that.</p><p>CARLSON: So, and Amen. And I'm glad that finally someone at the FCC -- I know there are others, but not enough -- is taking that very sensible constitutional position. But what about the original deal with the internet where we give these companies an exemption? They're not news companies. They are platforms, Congress has said that. And their job is just to let people say what they want as long as it's not illegal, they're not selling drugs, right? Or guns or peddling kiddie porn? Why don't we go back to that?</p><p>CARR: That's right. We want an approach that's going to promote a robust exchange of views. And what Facebook is talking about here is not targeting illegal content. What it described was harmful content. So this is content that is fully protected by the First Amendment. It's invited regimes, not just the government here in the U.S., but abroad to step in and start shutting down ideas that it doesn't like under the rubric of it being harmful speech.</p><p>One example that Mark Zuckerberg gave was speech on immigration. He said that speech on a divisive political issue, and if you're online advocating an issue position on immigration, the government should start regulating that speech.</p><p>And look, Mark Zuckerberg has a very loud platform, a big platform to express his own views on immigration and hot button issues.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>CARR: So then to step in and call for everyday Americans when they are advocating for those issues online, for the government to step in and police that, I think that's a bad idea.</p><p>CARLSON: But Mark Zuckerberg is one of the richest people in the world and he has paid to lobby for open borders, not just speak, but influence our lawmakers, but you aren't allowed to? I just wonder, taking three steps back, how did we get here? Zuckerberg grew up in the United States. Most of these people did. This is a constitutional republic. Number one in the Bill of Rights is freedom of speech. They seem totally unaware of that. Why?</p><p>CARR: What's interesting, I've been a regular at the FCC for a number of years, and I can tell you, when large corporations come in and start calling for greater government control, they're not doing it as an act of charity.</p><p>Facebook right now is a company that's worth a half a trillion dollars. It's got a leading position in the market. It didn't find religion and regulation until it established that dominant position.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>CARR: They have 30,000 people right now. They're doing content and security review. So calling for this heavy-handed government regulatory regime is going to wreck an economic moat that only makes it harder for startups to compete in this space.</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right. This is the real protectionism right there.</p><p>CARR: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you so much for that. Good to see you. Well, do you think America is the best country on earth? Do you say so out loud? Well, 20 years ago, if you did, you might get a fist bump; now, you'd be called a bigot. That's just a head.</p><p>Plus, time for \"Final Exam.\" Mark Steyn and Pete Hegseth face off. Who has been paying closer attention to the news of the week? You'll find out after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: It's time now for \"Final Exam\" where top flight battle-hardened cable news professionals compete to see who has paid the closest attention to what is happening in this country, at least for the past seven days. This week's first contestant is \"Fox and Friends\" co-host, Pete Hegseth. He is also the host of \"Battle in the Holy City,\" which you can watch on Fox Nation, also a friend of ours. His opponent, one of our favorite guests of the show, another friend, author and columnist, Mark Steyn.</p><p>This is a pairing that I had nothing to do with. I have no idea what's going to happen.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS HOST: Put me up against this guy right here? The smartest man in the universe?</p><p>STEYN: It's War of 1812, round two, Tucker. Canada -- so the President says, \"Where are the guys who burned down the White House, and we're coming to get you.\"</p><p>CARLSON: That's a good point. Now, I would agree with you.</p><p>HEGSETH: That was their last win. That was their last win.</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn is about the smartest person I've ever met.</p><p>HEGSETH: He is.</p><p>CARLSON: And these questions may rattle him, so we'll see.</p><p>HEGSETH: Tucker, this is Studio E though, your old \"Fox and Friends\" studio. I feel like I have a home field advantage.</p><p>CARLSON: It gives you an advantage. We'll see if you can press it successfully. You the rules, I want to repeat them anyway for our audience. Hands on buzzers. I ask the questions. First one to buzz in gets to answer the question. Critically you must wait until I finish asking it before answering it. You can answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name. Every correct answer gets you one point, a wrong answer detracts a point from your score. Best of five wins. Makes sense?</p><p>HEGSETH: Let's do it.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, semi. Question one is a multiple choice. You have to wait to hear the options. Here it is. Scientists had moved beyond creating useful robots are now building machines that do completely useless things. A robot unveiled in -- no surprise -- Japan has been trained to do something related to sports. Is it a hit A. Half-court shot? B. Ice skate? Or C. Throw a curveball?</p><p>HEGSETH: Oh, I thought I had it.</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn.</p><p>STEYN: Ice skate.</p><p>CARLSON: Is it ice skate? Has the robot been trained to ice skate?</p><p>STEYN: Oh no.</p><p>HEGSETH: You know, you have Canadian bias.</p><p>CARLSON: It's not curling either.</p><p>HEGSETH: That is the old James Naismith.</p><p>CARLSON: It's the old -- the traditional Japanese sport of basketball.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay, question two. This one, another multiple choice. This week on the other celebrity quiz show, \"Jeopardy,\" a contest and set a record for the most money won on a single episode. How much did he win? Was it A. $90,000.00? B. $100,000.00? Or C. 110 grand.</p><p>HEGSETH: A faulty buzzer.</p><p>STEYN: Come on.</p><p>CARLSON: Pete Hegseth, we're going to give it to you.</p><p>HEGSETH: Oh, I've got to press it -- oh, I've been dainty here. I'm going to go with C. 110,000 bucks.</p><p>CARLSON: A 110,000. Is Pete Hegseth correct?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Congratulations are in order to a \"Jeopardy\" contestant who won a record amount of money on yesterday's show watch.</p><p>ALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY: A new one-day record. $110,000.00.</p><p>KENNEDY: If he wins another $400,000.00, he could bribe his kids into UFC.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH: That's true.</p><p>CARLSON: Good line and true.</p><p>HEGSETH: The power of a good guess.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, you been watching game shows to practice. Smart. Okay, yet another multiple choice question.</p><p>STEYN: Oh.</p><p>CARLSON: This is about a plane in Spain that could not take off in the rain. Also something -- it's like doggerel. Passengers were stuck in the tarmac because a bird was strutting down the runway. What type of bird was it? Was it A. A pigeon? B. A crane? Or C. A flamingo? Mark Steyn.</p><p>STEYN: I've got to go with a crane in Spain.</p><p>CARLSON: Was it a crane in Spain next to the plane?</p><p>HEGSETH: I don't think they have cranes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Despite honking horns and impatient pilots, it took it sweet time sprinting down the tarmac, airport crew tried to scare it off and at one point it did fly away, but then it flew back in a matter of seconds. The flamingo finally left right before a team from the Wild Life...</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH: Oh no. Flamingo.</p><p>CARLSON: This goes to my theory. There's an inverse relationship between IQ and performance on the show.</p><p>STEYN: I was thinking too laterally and didn't -- I should have gone with flamingo.</p><p>HEGSETH: The old pun got you.</p><p>CARLSON: This is --</p><p>STEYN: I thought of a lawn ornament.</p><p>CARLSON: But it was good. It was worth losing. Okay, this is today's \"Daily Double.\" It's a two point question per our judges. Question four. Some fans of Bernie Sanders are angry at him this week because he confessed to something they consider controversial. What did he confessed to? Pete Hegseth.</p><p>HEGSETH: Being a millionaire.</p><p>CARLSON: Being a millionaire.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Is that right?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator Bernie Sanders says he is a millionaire. The Vermont senator has denounced millionaires for years.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I wrote two books in recent years. One of them was a bestseller on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list, translated to five or six languages. It did very well. I made money on that book.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH: Capitalism. Great for him.</p><p>CARLSON: Did he put his pinky to his mouth when he said \"millionaire?\"</p><p>STEYN: Yes, what languages did Bernie's book get translated into?</p><p>HEGSETH: One language. Green, Mark. Green.</p><p>CARLSON: Estonian. That was it. All right, final question. Also a multiple choice, here we go. Astronomers have captured the first ever image of a black hole. Some say it looks like a donut, others say it looks like a dragon's eye. How far away is this from Earth? Is it A. Two million light years away? B. Fifty million light years away? Or C. One hundred million light years away? Mark Steyn.</p><p>STEYN: I'm going to go with two million light years away.</p><p>CARLSON: Two million. Twice as far as Bernie is rich. Is that correct?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... the most famous doughnut hole of all time that first image of a black hole.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I never believed that this black hole was as big as people said, until we saw that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: M87 is over 50 million light years away.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH: Oh, it's 50.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, rub --</p><p>HEGSETH: I was wrong, but you took the risk.</p><p>STEYN: The black hole of my career after this performance, it's actually bigger than that.</p><p>CARLSON: You didn't only lose, Mark Steyn, you lost spectacularly floridly. You're in fuego in your loss and congratulations to you for doing so, so memorably. Pete Hegseth, you won.</p><p>HEGSETH: I've been waiting for a coveted Wemple mug.</p><p>CARLSON: We are putting an Erik Wemple mug from Jeff Bezos' website in the mail. May you treasure it. May fill it with bourbon.</p><p>HEGSETH: Forever.</p><p>STEYN: No, no. I don't mind losing to Lisa Boothe, but losing to this man that cries at \"Titanic.\"</p><p>HEGSETH: I do.</p><p>STEYN: He is girlier than Lisa Boothe.</p><p>HEGSETH: Every time the \"Titanic\" plays, I cry.</p><p>CARLSON: It's so good.</p><p>HEGSETH: It's true.</p><p>CARLSON: It's going to be weeks before I can digest this segment. Thank you, gentlemen, both of you.</p><p>HEGSETH: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for this week's \"Final Exam.\" Pay very close attention to weird things that happen all week. Come back Thursday to see if you can beat the experts. We'll be right back.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Democratic candidate, Julian Castro says that immigrants aren't a burden to this country, they're not a luxury, they are a necessity. \"We have to have them,\" he claims because Americans aren't having their own kids.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is a little bit politically incorrect to say to some people, but we do need them. If we don't get this right, in 20 or 30 years, the United States is going to be begging for immigrants to come and make a youthful vibrant workforce. We need them today more than ever before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's not an original thought, we'd be surprised if Castro ever had one of those. Instead, it is a constant refrain. You hear it from lawmakers and journalists and economists and college professors. They tell us we need massive amounts of immigration to replace the children that Americans aren't having.</p><p>For some reason, this is always taken as an immutable fact. Americans just don't want to have kids or they can't have kids. We need more abortion to assure they don't have kids. Well, here's something no one ever says, but it's worth suggesting. Why aren't we trying to help American citizens have kids? It's not that they don't want them, they want them. They want to be having more than they're having.</p><p>According to Gallup polling, the average American wants about three kids in a family. That figure is actually higher than it was 30 years ago. People are more pro-children than they were. The average American woman, though, is having fewer than two kids. Among those who reach their 40s without having any children, more than half regret it and wish they'd had at least one child.</p><p>So why isn't government trying to help Americans have the one thing they really want, which is children? It's not impossible. There are a lot of ways they could do that. Deflate the student loan bubble, reduce housing prices so young people can actually buy a home, give big tax cuts to bigger families so that middle class couples feel secure about having a third or fourth child. Other countries do it. It's not crazy. Is there anything more important? If so, what is it?</p><p>But none of this occurs to anybody in Washington. They look at an America where citizens are broke and depressed and killing themselves at record levels and therefore failing to reproduce the species. And they see only one option, only one answer to that. Import new children from Honduras and Bangladesh to satisfy the labor needs of Silicon Valley, big Ag and private equity. And by the way, if you disagree with that, you're the immoral one.</p><p>Well, not so long ago, it was considered normal for Americans to like America, why else would they be here? Imagine that. Now thinking that gets you denounced as a bigot, a xenophobe, a white nationalist, whatever that is. There's a new view in Washington. It has a simple ethos recently expressed by President Obama's former Attorney General, Eric Holder, \"America was never a great country.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARI MELBER, ANCHOR, MSNBC: There's a lot of talk about America being a leader -- as a \"democracy,\" quote, unquote, in the 1800s when women and African-Americans couldn't vote, what kind of democracy is that?</p><p>ERIC HOLDER, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: No, that's exactly right. It's when I hear these things, \"Let's make America great again.\" I think to myself, \"Exactly, when did you think America was great?\"</p><p>MELBER: Does that phrase echo as discrimination in your ears?</p><p>HOLDER: It takes us back to I think an American past that never, in fact really existed in this notion of greatness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Jon Miller is the host of \"The White House Brief,\" and we're happy to have him join us tonight. John, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p>JON MILLER, BLAZE TV HOST: It's great to be here, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So simple question. If you don't like America, why are you running it?</p><p>MILLER: I don't know why you're running it. I don't even know why you're here. I mean, if you don't like America, if you don't think America is the greatest country, in the world, then you can get the hell out of here and go and let me know how it is in Caracas where you flip up the switch and the lights don't come on.</p><p>I mean, it's incredible to me. You said earlier in the show, 20 years ago, if you said America is great, you might get a fist bump. Just to give you some perspective as to how fast things are tumbling out of control.</p><p>You know, I was in college, probably -- I was in college not even 10 years ago and you could say -- I was at a very liberal school, probably one of the most liberal in the country. You could still chant \"USA, USA\" at parties. You could still even fly your colors. You can't do that anymore.</p><p>I mean, you do that, they're going to come after you. They're going to try to hang you in the streets for that.</p><p>CARLSON: I wonder why though. I mean, America is flawed. Sure. We do shows every night on America's flaws. But compared to what?</p><p>MILLER: I mean, it's the only alternative and it's flawed, but show me a better system.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>MILLER: And show me a better country where people can do better for themselves. But I think it's cynical. I think that you know, I was vacillating for a while as to whether they actually were stupid enough to believe this nonsense, or whether they were just doing it to be because they don't have any other ideas, their tanks are empty. And I came to the conclusion that it was the latter when they started calling me a white nationalist. There's some logistical problems there.</p><p>CARLSON: Did you cop to it?</p><p>MILLER: Well, I put up a video on my Jon Miller YouTube page that was defending against Joe Biden's attacks on white men and defend -- I was defending, you know, European thought which has led to a great manifestation, which is America defending Western values, gosh, forbid, defending Western thought, and they were calling me a white supremacist and they just did that to Candace Owens, and you saw them do it this week to Candace calling her a white supremacist. Stephen Miller is not a white supremacist. He is actually a Nazi. Stephen Miller is a Jewish Nazi in the White House.</p><p>CARLSON: What's so interesting though, I mean, it's so absurd. It's hard to believe anyone takes it seriously, and yet we all sort of play along and do take it seriously.</p><p>MILLER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: We probably shouldn't. We shouldn't.</p><p>MILLER: We shouldn't.</p><p>CARLSON: But why is it that nobody ever says because I'm pretty open minded, you know, this system doesn't work, here is an alternative.</p><p>MILLER: Well, what is the alternative?</p><p>CARLSON: You know, here's another country where it's really working well. No one ever says that.</p><p>MILLER: Venezuela?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, exactly. So what is the impulse? Like what -- who is made happy by the idea that our country is terrible? Who does that excite?</p><p>MILLER: I think it's not meant to excite anyone. I think it's meant to get votes. I mean, that's what they're doing. And it's really cynical because you have someone who is a Trump supporter or maybe, you know, actually who has got and wears the \"Make America Great Again\" hat. I mean, Hillary Clinton says the Make America Great Again is a white nationalist slogan and she never lies.</p><p>So I mean, that's -- but you tell someone your neighbor is a white nationalist, that starts to be -- then you start to say, \"Okay, well, you know, I don't want to be around that person.\" And it really divides the country when you think you are living amongst white supremacist and white nationalists and Nazis. It is dangerous and it's creating a lot of animosity and tearing us apart.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it scares the hell out of people. It bothers me intensely and I am white and I think -- no, I'm serious. I don't want to -- I don't want to -- I mean, it's just -- first of all, it's so untrue. Americans are really nice. There are some weirdos out there, but there aren't many.</p><p>MILLER: No. And it's one of those things where you just wonder is their political agenda more important to them than the wellbeing of the country?</p><p>CARLSON: No, that is --</p><p>MILLER: I don't think it is.</p><p>CARLSON: That is nicely put. Jon Miller, great to see you. Thank you for that.</p><p>MILLER; Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, student loans are of course one of the biggest burdens holding back young people and prior generations, young adults who spend money, buying homes or raising kids. Now a lot of their money goes to paying off tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt. Colleges benefit greatly from this, but the loans come from the U.S. government.</p><p>Ten years ago, the student loan industry was nationalized under Barack Obama. Almost all loans now come from the Feds. If we want to fix this problem, government action is necessary, but don't get your hopes up.</p><p>Congresswoman Maxine Waters of California chairs the House Financial Services Committee. She is the top financial regulator in the entire U.S. House of Representatives. Yesterday, Waters revealed that she didn't know the government control student lending. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): Last month, this committee received testimony that last year, one million student loan borrowers defaulted, which is on top of the one million borrowers who defaulted the year before. What are you guys doing to help us with the student loan debt? Who would like to answer first? Mr. Moynihan, big bank.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CEO, BANK OF AMERICA: We'd stopped making student loans in 2007 or so.</p><p>WATERS: Oh, so you don't do it anymore? Mr. Corbat?</p><p>MICHAEL CORBAT, CEO, CITIGROUP: We actually did student lending in 2009.</p><p>WATERS: Mr. Dimon?</p><p>JAMES DIMON, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE: When the government took over student lending in 2010 or so, we stopped doing all student lending.</p><p>WATERS: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: \"When the government takeover student lending,\" why doesn't Washington ever seem to fix our problems? In this case, they don't even know they're causing their problems, and obviously, they don't care either or they would know.</p><p>We're out of time yet again, an hour. Who knew it could go so fast. But we will be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. But don't go away -- a special surprise for you tonight. Tonight at 9:00 o'clock, Sean Hannity will host a full hour of compelling television.</p><p>It begins right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019041101cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVY-JYC1-JB20-G154-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8040\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Espionage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sexuality</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Police</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Racism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Big Tech</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Regulations</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkU5NzdDMzI5QTcxNDQ5QTg3NDAwNjNGM0MwMTgxNEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Scope</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkFFNzEwMUYzNEU3NDdGRTg4RUM2OUM0ODI1ODg2QjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

We're going to make a lot of noise,' he wrote.</p><p>'Nobody will be able to ignore what's happening. We're going to flex our collective muscles and demand that giant, manipulative corporations give us back control over our data, privacy, and user experience.'</p><p>Through the demonstration, Sanger said he hopes that tech companies will rethink their policies towards users' personal data, which is often times harvested and used by companies like Facebook for marketing, advertising and other metrics.</p><p>In what Sanger is calling the Declaration of Digital Independence, the Wikipedia founder is calling for a fundamental shift in the attitude towards data ownership. </p><p>'Each of us individually owns our own data. Each of us individually controls it, just as we have control over our email, text messages, and blogs,' wrote Sanger in the post.</p><p>'It can be totally private, courtesy end-to-end encryption, or totally public; the choice is up to us.' </p><p>Sanger also adds that he hopes that social media websites will be pressured to become more 'interoperable' as a result.</p><p>'Social media services stop acting as silos but become interoperable,' wrote Sanger. 'If we make a post on one service, it can appear on another service.'</p><p>Calls for wholesale changes in the attitude of social media giants mirrors a growing wave of skepticism toward big tech that has been stoked by a slew of miscues throughout the last several years. </p><p>Facebook in particular has been addled by privacy breaches, the most significant of which allowed the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to leverage the private data of 50 million Facebook users in an attempt to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of President Donald Trump. </p><p>As a result of several privacy scandals and increased pressure from both users and regulators, Facebook and Google -- the two companies arguably at the center of tech-focused privacy concerns -- have begun to noticeably shift their tone.</p><p>In a recent keynote, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared that 'the future is private' and has begun rolling out end-to-end encryption across its messaging services while Google announced that it will allow users to begin auto-deleting their location data and offer more protections against companies who track users' web browsing. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-54122251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG4-4KR1-F021-62N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"515\"/><timeReceived>7:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

He blasted the Facebook boss for 'abusing the company's power online.'Sanger also expressed anguish at the way internet's evolution was handled in the last two decades ever since he set up Wikipedia up in 2001.Sanger called the current state of affairs: 'It's appalling frankly,'Social media strike and its rationale Sanger was in limelight this week for his exhortation for 'social media strike' that sought to highlight his concerns about the use of the Internet to a larger fraternity.In a Change.org petition, Sanger called for a complete social media boycott [2]on July 4 and July 5.The petition outlines Sanger's grievances with social media and the flawed use of personal user information in the hands of tech giants that use 'detached and colder algorithms.'Sanger aimsDeclaration of Digital Independenceto work as a tool of persuasion in convincing 'as many people as possible' to 'join together and reform' the entrenched social networks.Sanger's 'Declaration' primarily calls for the replacement of 'vast digital empires' with new decentralized networks to be run by independent individuals.Why decentralized Internet matters?</p><p> In Sanger's view, instead of regulating the Internet, there is a need for facilitation to allow the emergence of decentralized social networks so that individuals can publish information online without needing the umbrella of any social media giant.It must be something similar to the way bitcoin evolved as a 'decentralized' asset without regulation by any central bank. Such decentralized social networks can check any single platform's rise as a monopoly to control users' data online.'A decentralized internet, a freer internet, that's what led to the internet being created in the place,' Sanger said.Why Sangers is against regulating the Internet Noting that Internet would not have been created by people like Mark Zuckerberg or any Silicon Valley executive of today, Sanger said their penchant is mainly for controlling everything and that is antithetical to the concept of bottom up.
