Referring to big tech as a 'parasite on journalism,' Teachout unveiled on Wednesday a broad, though somewhat vague, plan to use the antitrust laws available to state and federal prosecutors to break up Google and Facebook's stranglehold on the news business. In the wake of tronc, the Daily News' parent company, laying off half the publication's staff on Monday, much of the blame has been pinned on the corporation and its executives. According to the Daily Beast, tronc executives told remaining Daily News staff that they had no strategy behind the mass layoffs. </p><p>Meanwhile, former tronc board chair Michael Ferro, who left the company in March amid a sexual harassment scandal, received a $15 million severance package from the company, drawing criticism. Teachout, however, says that targeting tronc, while necessary, is piecemeal and would do nothing to save local news. 'I'll look into illegality wherever it is, or any issues that fall within the jurisdiction of the AG's office,' Teachout said at a Wednesday press conference outside the Daily News headquarters in lower Manhattan. 'But I can't repeat this enough. If we don't actually deal with the systemic, structural issues that are squeezing out and starving local journalism, if we keep treating these as one-offs, we're gonna keep losing local news.' The larger issues Teachout was referring to were the heavy concentration of digital ad revenue with Google and Facebook, which she said transferred revenue from journalists and publications into the hands of tech giants. She cited a December report[1] from research firm eMarketer estimating that 63 percent of all digital ad revenue in 2017 belonged to the two companies. Microsoft and Oath each accounted for 11.8 percent of revenue, while Amazon took 5.4 percent. Other reports, such as one from software firm Pivotal[2], estimated Google and Facebook's duopoly at 73 percent of digital ad revenue in 2017. Though Facebook and Google still are clearly the dominant forces in online advertising, their share of the market appears to be slipping somewhat, according to the same firm cited by Teachout. A post[3] from March suggests that Google and Facebook will see their share of digital ad revenue decline to 56.8 percent this year, and continue slipping in 2019 and 2020 as companies like Amazon and Snapchat grow their ad businesses faster than the two current juggernauts. None of it points toward ad revenue returning toward news publications themselves. Meanwhile, Facebook's profit margins are, according to Teachout, over 40 percent. 'Local newspapers around the country are getting decimated as the digital ad revenue is dropping and being shifted from the newspapers themselves, the journalists themselves, to Google and Facebook,' Teachout said, referring to this as the 'ad tech tax.' Teachout said that lax antitrust enforcement had allowed Google and Facebook to acquire companies and become massive juggernauts in the advertising industry. She said that she would work with other state attorneys general to bring a 'major antitrust investigation to look into the ways in which Facebook and Google are wielding and maybe abusing their duopoly powers.' She also proposed 'rigorous enforcement' of state and federal antitrust statutes, like the state's Donnelly Act, preventing anticompetitive business practices, and the federal Clayton Act, to prevent the proliferation of monopolistic mergers, to bust the duopoly. As such, she wants to break up Google and Facebook in such a way that creates 'healthy ad markets' with hundreds of firms making lower profit margins, and more revenue going to publications and journalists. In that vein, she hopes to block large mergers and acquisitions by companies like Facebook, citing its acquisition of Instagram as an antitrust violation -- both had been competing in the market for user-created photo content. 'We should explore breaking up these companies to allow for healthy ad markets which are necessary to support affordable access to news,' Teachout said. 'So instead of newspapers begging for access to readers through Facebook and Google, what we should have instead is a healthy, vibrant, competitive ad market with hundreds of digital ad brokers competing -- with a profit margin, but not 40 percent profit margin -- competing for the attention of those news organizations.' Responding to a question from Gotham Gazette, Teachout said that Google and Facebook were able to achieve such dominance in the online ad market because their mergers and acquisitions had been allowed to proceed at a hectic pace with little regulatory scrutiny. As such, if the companies were to be broken up into hundreds of smaller ad companies, and enforcement and legislative statutes prevented new mergers from taking place, then a newly competitive market would be sustained by government intervention and the share of revenue demanded by the firms would decrease. 'There isn't actually a competitive market for different ways to reach readers,' Teachout said. The Fordham Law professor and constitutional scholar discussed her antitrust plans on the same day she received good news about a lawsuit she helped craft against President Donald Trump, for his alleged violation of the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which is said to prohibit payments from foreign governments to the president of the United States. A judge, citing Teachout's work, ruled that a case brought by the attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, D.C. could proceed. Teachout is facing New York City Public Advocate Letitia James, U.S. Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, and Leecia Eve, a former aide to Governor Andrew Cuomo, in the Democratic primary for Attorney General. The vote is September 13. One area of antitrust action Teachout said she would pursue would be to prevent Facebook from using its platform to host both news from outside sources, like the Daily News or Gotham Gazette, and its own news content, such as the presentation of trending topics alongside posts from news services. Teachout referred to this as a 'clear' violation of antitrust laws. She also said she would support state legislation to prevent content discrimination on social media platforms, saying that large media organizations like the New York Times could afford to cut deals to better promote their content in a way that a smaller outlet -- she cited the Poughkeepsie Journal -- could not. 'I do see it as a combination of legislation and enforcement, but we gotta start with enforcement. We're just not even enforcing existing laws.'

So if you are outside the room right now, I'm just starting the conference. So good morning, everybody. My name is John McAdam. If you don't know me, I'm President and CEO of F5. Welcome to our annual Analyst and Investor Day.</p><p>The agenda here is pretty straightforward. I think you're going to find it pretty useful this morning. As usual, I just do the introduction. I'll be involved very much in the Q&amp;A, and then our team mobile will do the presentations.</p><p>There is a lot going on with us right now. I feel really, really good about where we sit in the industry and our position and our strategic position specifically. If you look at this year that is coming up -- actually, let's look at last year just for a second. Last year, I said on the call it was really a game of two halves. Q1 and Q2 was pretty tough; obviously Q2, the March quarter, was a tough one. [Turndown] was pretty tough for the whole industry. But I felt really good about Q3, Q4 and our momentum moving into fiscal 2014.</p><p>I think the big mistake we made last year -- just talking about mistakes -- I know companies don't often do that -- our product refresh took too long. It was too elongated and it lasted almost a year. The good news is as we move into this fiscal year, it's all done. It's a done deal. We are coming in with a whole range of new products.</p><p>We had our sales conference just recently and the mood was really upbeat. I think we have got some absolutely clear, tangible drivers to grow our product revenue, which, as you all know, is our main focus, as the ACE replacement has been -- the momentum there is excellent. We have done over 900 replacements there since we started. We think we have got really good opportunity.</p><p>You may have noticed that we actually are now a partner of Cisco, a pretty significant partner, I think, as we move forward, as we are with companies like VMware. But I think that is going to help as well in that specific scenario.</p><p>Service provider has been lumpy, clearly. But again, we have got a bunch of business drivers in that space. The LTE rollout with Traffix, we feel really good about that. Our win rate is increasing. Dave Feringa will talk about some of the wins that we have done there. But we really do believe that that Diameter solution we have is the best out there in the market. We have introduced new functionality, like the policy enforcement manager and products like that.</p><p>Probably in service provider the biggest opportunity is security and security with our access products, security with our application firewall. But more importantly, with our advanced firewall manager, which is the traditional firewall product that is ideal for saving money, but also protecting against DDoS attacks and areas like that because of its performance. So we feel really, really good about that as well.</p><p>So a whole bunch of drivers I think are going to accelerate our product revenue growth this year as we move forward.</p><p>The big thing I really feel good about is our strategic position. I know there has been a lot of concern and discussion and all that stuff about software-defined networking. I really -- I compare it a little bit to what happened in virtualization, when VMware started coming up with their virtualization products. Everybody -- oh my God, F5's value-add is going to diminish. It was the opposite. I think exactly the same thing is going to happen with our strategic position with SDN.</p><p>We announced our Synthesis architecture you are going to hear about in great detail today as well, and it really puts us in a really, really strong position. After -- we announced our Synthesis architecture on Tuesday of last week, and after that on Thursday, we announced the ecosystem. And you should take a look at that press release, the companies that are involved in talking and working with us. All the SDN players are deeply working with us, and not just at the marketing level of press announcements, but actually technology relationships, and we will talk about that as well. VMware, Cisco, obviously OpenStack is a standard. HP, Dell, companies like that. So we are in a really strong position here, because we have this value-add of understanding what is happening at the application level, and you are going to hear a lot about that today.</p><p>So that is all I have got to say. I will obviously be back at the Q&amp;A, and I hope it is an interesting morning. In terms of the presentations, if you could keep questions to a minimum of maybe even zero -- if that's possible -- and then we will have quite a long time for Q&amp;A later today. So okay. So Manny, yes.</p><p>MANNY RIVELO, EVP OF STRATEGIC SOLUTIONS, F5 NETWORKS, INC.: Good morning, everybody. So let me back up, please. So Manny Rivelo, EVP of Strategic Solutions for F5. I have been with F5 for two years, and prior to that, I was with Cisco for almost 20 years, a month shy of 20 years.</p><p>My goal today is simply to explain to you our strategy and our vision of the Company and to give you an indication of what we rolled out to the industry last week. Then I am going to turn it over to Karl, and Karl will go through the products that actually bring this vision to reality.</p><p>I talk a little about the time is right for this vision, and the reality of it is, it couldn't be any better with all the changes that are going on in the market segment. And there has been a big gap, and I will talk a little bit about that gap that's been left in the industry, which is really about layer 4 through 7. There has been a lot of conversation -- John talked about that conversation that is happening around SDN. But the reality is layer 4 through 7 services have not been dealt with in an ideal way in the industry.</p><p>And what we are doing is we are inserting into that gap in the industry and ensuring that the whole stack, if you will, the whole OSI stack is fully integrated in a dynamic fashion to bring that to market.</p><p>Now, last week was a big coming out for this architecture and it was a big coming out for the Company as a whole, because if you look at the events that happened last week, on Monday, we were part of the Arista announcement around their spline architecture. They launched it here in New York. On Tuesday, we launched our Synthesis architecture. On Wednesday, we were part of Cisco's application-centric infrastructure architecture. Thursday, we announced our ecosystem. Just yesterday, we announced strategic partnerships with Amazon around utility-base pricing for cloud-based services. And today, we had a big announcement at the LTE Summit around our Diameter stack and our solutions and awards that we are winning there. So a lot of activity is going on around F5 and we expect a lot more. And this architecture is really targeted at capturing that.</p><p>Where we focus is predominantly on three markets, and I will talk a lot more about that, and that is security, cloud and mobility. And when I talk about mobility, I am talking about it both from an enterprise perspective, mobile devices, but also from a carrier perspective in the mobile operators.</p><p>Our target, our sales addressable market that we go after -- and this is fully -- that we could cover every one of these dollars with our solutions. We did a lot of work around this. It is a little bit over $6 billion market; it is actually $6.4 billion market. So what we are launching is an architecture to go after $6.4 billion in 2014.</p><p>This market will extend itself, based on our roadmap, to about $18 billion by 2017. And that is what we are targeting. Now this is about four times the traditional ADC market. Towards the tail end of my presentation, I will go through it, and I will show you how it is composed and what are the submarkets and how we get to that $6.4 billion opportunity. So a significant opportunity, and we want to go capture that from an architecture point of view.</p><p>The reality of it is that the market is going through a lot of shifts and a lot of technology shifts that are being created out there. You are familiar with these, so I am not going to go through them in a lot of detail; I'll just touch on them. But obviously, mobility, we all know. Mobile devices are exploding. There is more smart phones than there are PCs. That threshold was crossed a couple of years ago. By 2015, there is going to be more tablets than there are PCs out there. The workforce is mobile, the workforce is always on. That creates a whole new set of opportunities in the market segment that need to be addressed, because customers want similar experiences in the mobile world as they have in the traditional world.</p><p>Cloud applications are on the move. You are seeing a lot of comments around bring your own app, BYOA, now, right? Where your app is actually moving, it is living in the cloud. As a matter of fact, cloud companies are growing at an immense rate. And if you talk to most enterprises, over 70% of enterprises out there have a cloud strategy. And that means moving workloads to the cloud. Some of those have started in dev and test environments, but the reality is they have a significant cloud strategy.</p><p>The threats. With all this movement, the boundaries have disappeared. There is a new set of threats. We read a lot about malware, we read about application attacks, we read a lot about losing PII information in the industry. So software-defined, there is this concept that software-defined networking was going to just change everything, the whole landscape is going to change. Really, software-defined networking -- or software-defined everything is about automation and orchestration, and separation of the data plane from the control plane and being able to deliver services much more dynamically in an environment. So it's actually a very good opportunity for us to participate in.</p><p>The Internet of Things, there is a lot of talk about the Internet of Things. All that means is there is going to be more signaling. There is a signaling tsunami coming. We all read about that. Everything needs to communicate over a 4G network, and as a result of that, need to address those problems in the industry.</p><p>And then of course there is something that very few companies talk about -- we end up talking a lot about it -- which is the workloads, the traffic. The protocol of the Internet has become http. And when you are dealing with http, you are not dealing with packets anymore; what you have to deal with is the flow. It's a different way of architecting your network. So as a result of that, all of these opportunities are significant and they all have massive implications on applications.</p><p>Now, the reality is we have been positioning the Company around this vision, which is really about the delivery of applications reliably secure and accelerated, anywhere, anyplace, anytime. And that has been what we have been building to, which has positioned us really well to capture on these changes that are happening in the industry.</p><p>The evolution of the Company, which I would say we are in the fourth phase of our evolution -- you could actually argue there is a phase zero, and you could say phase zero was the founding of the Company around load balancing. But back in about 2003, 2004, the Company moved from being a traditional load balancer and build a platform, the TMOS platform -- Karl will talk a lot about that today -- which was a full proxy architecture. By bringing that platform to market, it really opened up a lot of opportunity for us as a Company.</p><p>First of all it, allowed us to, yes, do traffic steering, traffic shaping. It allows us to offload services off of a server, accelerate connections, things of that nature. But it became the building block for what I would consider to be phase 2. And phase 2 is when we started to look at it and we said, there is other services that we could do inside that platform. We can begin to consolidate services in the industry. And these services traditionally have been point devices. So you could start consolidating security services -- for example, a firewall. So now you don't need a firewall sitting outside a load balancer. These services can be combined. And when you combine those services on one common platform, you could also chain those services dynamically based on flow.</p><p>So it gave us a platform to begin to consolidate services in the market segment. And I have listed some of the ones that are there. There is actually -- and I will talk a lot more about it -- there is a lot of services that we are consolidating.</p><p>The second point I will make on the slide is these layers continue. It is not as if we move to phase 2 and we are not innovating in phase 1. We are innovating a lot in phase 1. You will see a lot of conversation today about what we are doing around forward proxies. You will see innovation in layer 2 around secure Web Gateway things that we are launching to the market. So these layers will continue for time, forever, but obviously we are building on them.</p><p>The third, which is probably about two, maybe three years ago, was the whole cloud movement. And we realized we needed to make significant investments in cloud. And they came different ways. For one, it was all about ensuring that TMOS, our operating system, in all of the software modules can sit on any cloud, on every hypervisor in the industry that is a major hypervisor. So we support obviously VMware's ESXi, Microsoft's Hyper-V, Xen KVM. We even could put our workloads on AWS out there. We had a strategy to not only have all of our bits everywhere, but also continue to increase the performance of our virtual additions in the market.</p><p>We also believed that it was important to have the highest multi-tenancy in the industry. When you are dealing with cloud environments and you are selling to a cloud provider, they may want to buy a physical or a virtual piece of kit, but they might divide it and sell it to multiple customers. So a very, very strong push around the multi-tenancy characteristics.</p><p>Now, what has also been happening that we have been paying a lot of attention to is in the application environment. There has been a lot of changes in the application environment. About 5 to 7 years ago, you started to hear a lot about agile development. Now, the concept of agile development is really simple. All it means is you are listening to your customers, instead of going away for a year or two and writing an application, I am going to develop an application a lot quicker. I am going to do these sprints, usually about 8 weeks of work. I load the application out in the environment, people test it, I get feedback, I do more development. So agile has become a very popular software development tool specifically for cloud workloads in the environment.</p><p>And it was targeted at really delivering a lot of value. The problem with it is that agile by itself was a development methodology. It wasn't about deployment of the applications. There was this gap that has been left around how you deploy applications. And what we started to observe is that lots of corporations started to use the cloud. As I said, most organizations have cloud strategies. Most of them began to actually put some of their workloads or test their workloads on AWS or a Rackspace or Terremark or somebody else domestically, as well as internationally.</p><p>And so the cloud or DevOps became much more in vogue in the market segment. The problem with that is not all workloads can be in a public environment. Some of those workloads placed in a public environment have restrictions from an organization and/or don't have the right service levels that are out there, which sort of has given rise to this concept of SDN. SDN is the missing link. Because you could build an application fairly quickly through agile. You can deploy the application in your own private data center through a virtual instance, let's say, using VMware stack in a container. In the future, you will be able to also virtualize your storage and in the future you will be able to virtualize your network through SDN layers 2 and 3.</p><p>But there has been this void that has been left around 4 through 7 services. The reality is the applications also may need firewall services, load-balancing services, acceleration services, things of that nature. And that gap you are seeing is what we are filling in the market segment. We have intentionally pushed our strategy after that 4 through 7 gap as an organization, with a vision as a Company to deliver applications without constraint. That means your applications can roam, they can be placed anywhere, they should run where they run best. And then the services should follow that application.</p><p>So if the application needs security or acceleration, they will follow the applications in the environment, and that is what we are building as an overall organization, which has led to what we launched last week, which is this concept of Synthesis. And Synthesis is an architectural message really. It means that -- let me talk about it from this slide. What it basically means is that we are building our phase 4 of our architecture and it is around software-defined application services. It means defining those layer 4 through 7 services in software and be able to deliver those to the application much more dynamically.</p><p>Now, Synthesis itself has three major elements inside of it, and I am going to talk about each of those. It is really -- the first is the high-performance fabric, which is actually an elastic fabric. The second is the concept of automation orchestration, how you could deliver those services on any environment, because we basically sit on top of most environments that are out there. And the third is this concept of simplifying the business models. We heard from customers that they want options in how they procure our technology, not just perpetual licensing, but other options. So we have launched all three of those as part of the Synthesis architecture and we will continue to evolve on all three of those.</p><p>Just to talk about the first one a little bit, this high-performance fabric, the way to think about it is it sits on any network. If you can get a network to an F5 Synthesis fabric, meaning traditional networking technology -- it could be a VLAN, which we have been doing for the last 10 plus years; or it could be an SDN using NSX or Nicira; or ACI from Cisco; or anybody else, Microsoft's Hyper-V. If you can get a network to any of our devices, we can plug into that architecture and sit on top of that layer 2, if you will, layer 3 construct that is out there.</p><p>Now, what we do is we deliver a series of devices. These are the traditional devices that you see us talk a lot about. Virtual editions across all industry hypervisors, 1RU, 2RU appliances, fixed appliances that customers buy. And then these single-bladed chassis. And I use the word single-bladed because I think it is important. Our architecture has one line card, and you slap that line card. So we don't have a line card for a firewall and a line card for a load balancer and a line card for an acceleration device. That is all software. All our innovation is truly, truly software. The line cards are just boosting performance, and as you add line cards, the overall capability of the chassis just increases. So think about it almost like an x86 fabric, although it is much more than that, and Karl will be showing you why that is the case.</p><p>These components that we built of these devices can be interconnected a whole bunch of different ways. And what we have been pushing a lot as part of our Phase 3 is this concept of scale-in. And scale-in is a technology architecture which allows you to either scale a device on-demand, meaning increase the performance through licensing, go from let's say a 5-gig to a 10-gig performance capability, so you could actually increase on demand. Or you could cluster devices together. And I will talk a little bit more about that, meaning you could take multiple devices and make them appear as one device, or you could take a device and partition that device or a cluster.</p><p>The partitioning is the multi-tenancy, and we do that in 2 ways. One way is we virtualize the actual partition all the way down to the operating system, which means I can have one device running three instances all the way down to the operating system. Or we could leave one operating system and do administrative partitions, where you basically partition the client, but it is still one version of VOS.</p><p>So scale-in allows you to leverage, if you will, these platforms, physical and virtual, and begin to configure them a whole bunch of different ways, giving you an elastic fabric in a multitenant fabric that is high, high performance.</p><p>Now, on the performance, here are some of the stats, just so you could see how incredible of a platform we could build. It is a 20-terabit throughput that we could build on that. We could cluster 32 devices. On any one device, we could have up to 80 partitions on that device. And then obviously, if you cluster devices together, the partitions go up.</p><p>Other stats that are pretty impressive is that 9.2 billion connections. We can provide on one cluster -- one multitenant cluster -- one connection for every user in the world -- more than one connection for every user in the world. So it is actually built for high, high performance, high scale. Obviously, you build that up as much as you want. And if you want one device, you want 32 devices, you can configure it that way. So that is a single cluster, very, very high performance.</p><p>The other thing this architecture provides is we've separated the data plane from the control plane from the management plane. If you look at the fundamental tenets of SDN, it is a separation of the data plane from the control plane. Our TMOS architecture has had that separation from the beginning. That allows us to do things like, for example, in the data plane, we could allow a customer to write their own service. And about a third of our customers implement some service themselves.</p><p>Now, some of those services that I have seen out there are simple enhancements to the way applications work. Others are basic raw functionality, like a session border controller functionality, that we have a customer in Australia who has implemented a skinny version of a session border controller. So by opening up the data plane, you can actually, if you think about it, write your own service.</p><p>We also opened up the control plane and we opened up the management plane so we could operate with third-party engine through a set of REST APIs using our iControl. So a lot of capability is offered there, making the platform extensible and highly programmable -- future-proofing, if you will, the platform.</p><p>What we put on top of that platform is what I would consider -- what our phase 2 of our strategy is; it is a catalog of services. Now, the way to think about services, obviously, you know it is for availability services, things like server load balancing or things like global load balancing. But we have been investing aggressively in the security space. We have been investing in the mobility space. And this catalog of services adds a lot of feature functionality.</p><p>So this word diagram kind of begins to illustrate that. So here you could see, for example, in security, yes, we do firewall, yes, we do DDoS protection, yes, we have acquired a company about two months ago that does web anti-fraud. And those are the sort of services that sit on that platform. On the mobility, it is everything from SAML assertions to remote SSL to MAM integration and a list of services. So what you are starting to see is a consolidation of devices into services on a common platform that is highly elastic in nature. And that is what this concept of the high-performance application services fabric is.</p><p>The second element of our strategy was really around the manageability of the platform, how do we manage the platform. And that is providing the concept of a single pane of glass. Last year, we talked a lot about BIG-IQ, and we have been delivering on that vision of BIG-IQ. And the way to think about BIG-IQ is it has four basic connector types that are required for it to participate, if you will, with all the other technology that are required in the industry.</p><p>The first connector type is really how we connect to orchestration engines. And I said we build a set of REST APIs in the separation of our management plane. And those REST APIs can be accessed by your orchestration tool of choice. So if you are already using, for example, VMware's vCO or vCNS, or you are using OpenStack, you can orchestrate from that center down to us, and then we will orchestrate the services you want inside the environment. So it is basically a set of plug-ins, if you will, to work with those third-party orchestration engines in the industry. And since we expose all of our objects, you can access it just by some simple programming.</p><p>The second major connector type is we have this high-performance fabric. We want it to be a elastic, we want to have multi-tenancy. So we have to have a set of services that manage that high-performance fabric. And that is really the fabric orchestrator. That is about orchestrating the fabric, the concept of this elastic fabric partitioning, putting the right services in there that are required.</p><p>The third thing we are doing with BIG-IQ is really this concept of module connectors. And the way to think about module connectors, you saw the catalog of services we have. Well, I have to configure the firewall. I need to put firewall rule sets into that. Or I have to configure my acceleration service. So as a result of that, the complementary modules are being built in BIG-IQ to manage the services and to allow the administrator of those services to manage those services inside the environment. You are seeing some examples there of some of the ones that we will talk about today.</p><p>And then the last piece is this concept of cloud connector. I said that workloads no longer sit on Prem; they sit on Prem, they sit in the cloud, they sit anywhere. Customers want to burst into the cloud. So what we have created is the concept of a cloud connector. So now you could launch that cloud connector, let's say, on AWS or you could launch it on another cloud environment. You could interconnect back to your data center, and that instance of sitting out in the cloud becomes part of your data center. It really creates a secure tunnel to that. So we have the capability now of bursting workloads for on-demand.</p><p>We have customers that are looking at doing this for disaster recovery situations. They don't want a disaster recovery data center. They would rather use the cloud to do that, as an example. So now they can easily do that by bursting to the cloud and extending, if you will, their data center into the cloud. So that is the concept of cloud connector. And once you extend yourself to the cloud, the reality is you could do anything. It becomes part of your elastic fabric inside that environment.</p><p>So this is the second core element of the Synthesis architecture we announced, which is all about the manageability of that.</p><p>The third element we look at -- we call the simplified business models. We heard loud and clear from our customers that they -- of all sizes -- that they have different options on how they want to procure the technology. For example, it could be still a large account, but they may want to burst to the cloud, they may want to pay by the day when they burst to the cloud. They may not want to purchase, if you will, a big IP or a virtual addition inside that environment.</p><p>So these are the business models we currently have, and we launched a couple of new ones. Obviously, in the cloud environment, we have had bring-your-own license kind of solutions; we have had those for a long time. We had cloud licensing programs that we work with the CSPs and MSPs out there. But we launched the utility pricing model. That is basically metered. That is all it is. That is what we launched with AWS yesterday. It means you could pay by the hour, you could pay by the day. So if you want to burst to the cloud a workload, pay for two hours and take it down, that is what you are paying from a licensing point of view.</p><p>On the traditional side of the house, if you will, the traditional data center, we have had perpetual forever, we have had subscription. Some of the subscription licensing models we have are things like reputational databases and things of that nature, which customers subscribe to. Others are going to be secure Web Gateway, which we are launching here in the Vancouver release.</p><p>But then we launched this concept of good, better, best. And the way to describe good, better, best the easiest -- because we were thinking about how to name it, and the team, it just stuck with them -- it is really a grouping of our technologies put together so you could deliver and solve customer problems. So the way to think about good, good is basically our traditional business. It is our availability set of services. Better is that, plus some security services, some acceleration services for mobile environment, SDN capabilities, things of that nature. And best is the whole enterprise suite of technology. And we have grouped it in this way because it makes it easier for customers to procure, versus saying, well, I want a little load-balancing and I want a little firewall and I want a little bit of this; we just grouped it, making it simpler for customers to purchase that. And it has been very well-received by our sales organization and by our customers, and we launched this last week and we are pretty excited.</p><p>It is really -- these simplified business models and the concept of good, better, best are really tackling these three things. The flexibility is all about we want to make it easy for customers to deploy this architecture to solve lots of different business problems, accelerate the way they deploy their applications, make them secure, make them accelerated, making sure that no application in their environment doesn't have the services that makes it run better.</p><p>The second thing is really simplicity. And the simplicity, there is just fewer options. We have a large set of SKUs and configuring things to be a little difficult at times, we want to simplify it for our sales organization, for our customers and for our channel partners inside the environment. And the thing is the best value, because as you begin to group these technologies, you will have those services. And we have customers that are interested in buying the services and then over time migrating out competitors' equipment inside. So that is the simplified business model.</p><p>So Synthesis is really about these three core elements, and these three core elements coming together to a common architecture. Because our premise is we believe that we can continue to consolidate those services, give you a highly elastic fabric, make it highly manageable and orchestratable, and then give you options in the way you procure that technology so you could solve lots of business problems that are out there.</p><p>The other thing we did last week is to demonstrate to the industry the power of the architecture is we launched 11 reference architectures. What you'll see here is there is reference architectures here for things like DDoS mitigation or VoLTE for the LTE space, or even things like for DevOps with our line rate technology. This is using that platform in different places in the network, either around user services, network services or application services. And what we launched is nine elements to every one of those, which is a whole bill of material how you configure it, how you set it up, everything.</p><p>Now the only reason we launched 11 is because that is what we can get to by the sales meeting. Throughout the course of this year, we will have many more reference architectures that we are building to in the market segment. But this is a proof point and you go on our website, you will see the collateral that is out there for every one of these.</p><p>In addition to that, we did a hard comparison about our architecture relative to the industry's competitors, as we see them, across two basic elements. One was the richness of services. We have the richest set of services relative to any of our competitors, and two, around the concept of a high-performance fabric in the industry. So we feel very well-positioned in this arena.</p><p>And the other thing we did is we took a hard look at this architecture and these reference architectures, and we went and we contracted ACG -- we worked with ACG Research -- they are a very well-established organization that looks at TCO modeling -- and we looked at five -- I am showing you three here of the reference architectures -- we looked at five of the reference architectures and we will look at the rest with time over a five-year TCO analysis, looking at all of the OpEx and all of the CapEx. And what we noticed is because we are consolidating these services that we are seeing somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% to 80% reduction in those architectures as we move forward. So there is a strong value proposition here for the CFO of an organization to begin to standardize and move away from device sprawl, instead managing services.</p><p>And then we launched a broad ecosystem last Thursday. John talked a little bit about the ecosystem, you saw some of the press release and some of the major announcements. Obviously, there is a set of companies that are much more in the fabric traditional layer 2, layer 3 SDN space. We have deep relations with all of them. This is not a go-to-market slide from the perspective of a nice, rosy slide. We are doing deep integration with those companies around how our layer 4 through 7 Synthesis architecture sits on those SDN fabrics.</p><p>We are doing a lot of work with systems integrators out there. You are seeing them on the slide there, whether it be an IBM or an NSN; obviously, the cloud and so forth (inaudible) side that slide. So in our press release, many of these were quoted, and the rest are on our website. So we think we have a very broad ecosystem to deliver this architecture to the market.</p><p>Then in the business benefits, and we talked a lot about these last week. But I kind of group them into these four major categories. The first is really about business value. We want to drive business value. And the true business value is helping organizations deliver their applications. Now, it's speed of how those applications get into the environment, because the reality of it is that is how organizations are differentiating themselves in this digital world that we participate.</p><p>But it is not only about the velocity; it is also about making sure they are fast, secure, available. So there is a strong business value associated with that. And whether you are deploying that in your environment, meaning your data center, or you are deploying it in the cloud, it doesn't matter to us. We want to provide the same set of services and associate with that.</p><p>The second is really a message to the IT organization. We want to increase IT's capabilities. And we want to give you a platform that is both physical and virtual. So the reality is we are giving you one set of bits, you deploy them on our physical devices or you deploy it on x86; it doesn't matter to us; it's a common platform that can support all of those architectures. We are helping organizations move away from managing devices, that device sprawl problem that they have, where you look inside their data center and you say, what does that box do. Well, that is my firewall. What does that box do? That is my WAF. What does that box do? That is my SSL termination. We are consolidating that into a set of services on one common platform, and you deploy those services as you see appropriate.</p><p>And the third thing is the TCO. Part of the value of the TCO just comes out of the consolidation of the services and moving to a much more software-defined world, if you will.</p><p>And then the last is the future-proofing. Because we open up the data plane and the control plane, because we work with an open set of standards and APIs, we allow customers to future-proof their environment. If there is a service or a need that your application may have, you could write your own expression in that service and bring that service to market.</p><p>So we think these are the four, if you will, pillars of the value statement of what Synthesis brings to the market.</p><p>So Synthesis is one architectural message that is targeted at multiple places inside your network, solving credible business problems that are out there, of which we launched 11 reference architectures in the market. And then it is targeting these major growth drivers that I talked about. That $6.4 billion of growth is really around growth in the security space, growth in the software-defined data center/cloud space and growth for mobility.</p><p>Now I started out by talking about that $6 billion opportunity. I wanted to give you a little bit more insight how we came up with that number and how we see it to be a very credible number. And this is addressable market that we are going after in 2014. Obviously, it starts with the core ADC business, the delivery controller. There is a lot of different growth drivers on what is driving growth in the ADC. One is just basically traffic load. I mean, there is more and more traffic load out there, there is a need to look at those environments and virtualize the ADC and make it available in the cloud, et cetera.</p><p>The submarket is what is comprising of the ADC growth. That is the traditional business, which is the physical world, but there is a growing virtual ADC business that we are actively and aggressively participating in. There is the concept of acceleration for mobile devices. And this is not, if you will, the wide area acceleration. Although we do that from a data center to data center perspective, this is the mobile user who you want to accelerate their connection via through things like speedy gateways, asymmetrical acceleration, image compression, things of that nature. There is that market.</p><p>There is the acquisition we did approximately a year ago around LineRate, and we are launching that to the market segment here in the very near future, which targets the DevOps community. And then of course there is analytics and measurement around the users' application behavior. So that is the ADC market.</p><p>In addition to that, we have been consolidating security services aggressively into that market. The business drivers there we talked a lot about there is a shifting perimeter inside the environment. But these are the services that we have consolidated, and you are seeing some of them out there, from basic firewall, layer 3, layer 4 firewall services, that we do at very, very high, high performance for both the enterprise as well as for the service provider; DDoS mitigation; web application firewall; remote access; all the way to the most recent acquisition we just did, Versafe, which is web anti-fraud. So we continue to consolidate these security services, working in tandem with the core services that are inside the device.</p><p>On the mobility side of the house, specifically for the mobile operators, if you will, our Diameter suite, our Traffix acquisition. It is great. It is doing incredibly well inside the market segment. We are seeing a lot of traction with that. And that is the money protocol, if you will, for the 4G networks. The whole evolution is moving from SS 7 to Diameter. We're in the core of those mobile networks and we are in the core of integrating the components inside the mobile network.</p><p>We have done a lot of work around a module, carrier-grade NAT. There is IP address exhaustion out there. Users can't move to IP v6 overnight, so there is a need to have an environment where you translate addresses from 4 to 6, or they could both work inside that. So we are seeing a lot of success with the CGNAT module.</p><p>Policy enforcement, which becomes much more about differentiating quality of experience, if you will. Where I know it is user A going to application Y, what do I want to do around that mobile connection? Do I want to give them preferential treatment? Do I want to rate limit them, do I want to send them to a firewall, do I want to send them to parental control services?</p><p>And then other things like GI firewall and Traffic Steering. Now GI firewall and Traffic Steering also show up, if you will, in the security section or -- that being the firewall; and obviously, Traffic Steering also shows up in the ADC component.</p><p>And the last piece is cloud, and I am only showing here two submarkets for cloud. The reality of it is all of this is cloud, because all of it is on a virtual edition so it could sit on any cloud environment. Our ADC is cloud, our security services are cloud. Our Diameter stacks are cloud-enabled.</p><p>But in addition to that for the cloud, we have the capability of doing the bursting, the brokering, those kinds of services inside the environment, really targeting much more, if you will, the public cloud. That is what I am talking about in this slide. The rest is available also.</p><p>And it is these four markets come together that create this opportunity in 2014 from us and those services across that one common architecture.</p><p>So sort of in closing, what I want everybody to realize is our focus is to continue to develop on all four phases of our architecture. Our goal is to continue to have the highest performance application services fabric in the industry. You will see us push on that -- faster, more tenancy, faster devices, both virtually and physically. We will continue also to consolidate services in the industry, as appropriate, meaning our catalog of services will increase inside the market segment.</p><p>We will be highly orchestrated and automated inside the environment, participating in this concept of push a button and my network becomes a reality. And that will be with a third-party set of ecosystems, because it is an ecosystem play; it is not one vendor all alone. And then we will continue to work with our customers to give them new business models so that they can procure the technology in the way they want to consume the technology, whether it be on prem or in the cloud or combinations thereof.</p><p>So that is sort of our focus of the Company. Hopefully, that gives you a quick intro to what Synthesis is. And I know there will be a lot of questions and I will be happy to take some questions later on in the day. With that said, I would like to bring up to the stage next Karl Triebes, who is our EVP of Product Development and Chief Technology Officer. Thank you.</p><p>KARL TRIEBES, EVP OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT &amp; CTO, F5 NETWORKS, INC.: (inaudible) about what Manny presented with Synthesis and the roadmap and what we are doing on the product side as part of that. So one of the first things I wanted to talk about real quick is our development team. We now have seven development locations across the world. We are closing in on close to 1000 engineers -- or actually 1000 personnel as part of our development team, with, like I say, with different locations, with different specializations.</p><p>So in Seattle, we focus very much on kind of the core platform, LTM, GTM, TMOS. And then in San Jose, it is our security products, along with Tel Aviv. So both those sites really focus on that. Lowell now is we have been ramping down our investment in ARX. We have been ramping up a lot of the BIG-IQ work, actually, and some of our hardware development being done out in Lowell. Spokane is really our core hardware development. Boulder is where we just acquired LineRate Systems last year, and that is where they are headquartered out of there. And then we also have -- we do a lot of sustaining work and development out in Tomsk, Russia, which has been a really great area for us because we have been able to really get a lot of good, young talent out there and scale that operation.</p><p>So I want to talk about our next big release. Last year when I was up here speaking, we were just about to release what we are calling our 11.3, or our Solar release. Since that time now, we are coming up on our next major release, which is called Vancouver. We have actually -- this actually will be our third major release over the last year. And so -- and then we had two minor releases in there. That represents over 300 some odd features that were released over the last 12 months. So we have been very busy as an organization bringing out new features and products. And that also includes releasing a whole new line of appliances and everything else.</p><p>So this is just some highlights of the features that are in here. And I am not going to talk about all of them. But Secure Web Gateway, we are entering a new market there and I will speak in a little more detail about that. We have done a lot of work around manageability with these new REST-based APIs, both for the BIG-IP as well as on BIG-IQ. On the virtual edition side, we have new, very high performance virtual editions running 10-gigabit rates. On the hardware side, we have some new things coming, that I will talk about that as well. BIG-IQ, there is a lot of new modules, new licensing models to help support cloud. We are working very aggressively with OpenStack, the open source, and then also with partners, such as VMware and Cisco there.</p><p>On the service provider side, as Manny mentioned, CGNAT continues to be a focus. It is one of these moving targets, because customers are constantly adding variants to that protocol, so it is something we have got to continually work on. We are doing other things as well to traffic steering. And also control plane, with Diameter routing with our Traffix group.</p><p>On the security side, we continue to add significant security features every release. DDoS has been a major focal area for us as part of that. Not only are we adding them in software, layer 4 and layer 7 type DDoS capabilities, but we are also putting it in hardware to help combat against volumetric style attacks.</p><p>And also, just basic platform security, common criteria, EAL, other things that we are doing to harden our platforms.</p><p>Just to give you some stats on this release, like I said, it's a significant investment. Over 136 major features as part of this release. And this one still boggles my mind -- almost 23 million lines of code either added or changed as part of that. And that is on a code base now of about 49 million lines of code. So you can see it is a significant investment that we have made on our software side and we continue to make there.</p><p>So just a little bit more about TMOS and what it means and what it does. There are four areas we focus when on we talk about TMOS. One is the first, its ability to be programmed. iRules are a good example of that, that we are able to build custom functionality at the data plane by leveraging iRules. And iRules aren't something that we just created 10 years ago and said okay, this is it. We are constantly adding new capabilities to iRules, so it can work with new types of protocols and enhance performance there. So we are always constantly adding to that.</p><p>Now, we have had iControl as part of this. iControl Is the ability to automate our platforms. We have had that for 10 years as well. And that is something where we have worked from day one with application partners, so they can actually initiate events in the network from the application itself. And that was something very different back in those days, and I would call that essentially SDN.</p><p>Then we have other areas that we can program as part of this. We can now do things like high-performance performance monitoring. We can -- so we have a language surrounding that; we are calling that M rules. It will probably get rebranded once we release that. And then there is other areas -- so we have multiple layers of programmability as part of the platform.</p><p>Now the other piece of this is scalability. And like I said, TMOS is built from day one with this notion of being able to scale. And as Manny talked about, there are two ways we can scale. We can scale up, where we say, okay, we want to just basically add a blade, add performance, add a blade, add performance, add a CPU, add performance. We can also scale out as well, and that is the whole thing around multi-tenancy and the scale in fabric and I will add some more details to that.</p><p>Now the other part of the TMOS is the basic services that it provides for the modules or the other network level services. And one of the most fundamental ones is its ability to be a proxy, a very high-performance proxy; that is so it can do TCP-level operations and we optimize things at the TCP layer. We are also a full-web proxy, so we understand everything at the web tier as well. So we are able to go through and actually thoroughly understand what is in a website. And that's sort of -- these services are what make us very good at things like being a web application firewall or being able to optimize web-based applications or manage traffic around these different applications. And this is a very different approach than say our other competitors, of having this really high-performance forward-proxy solution.</p><p>Now, you heard Manny talk about Synthesis. This is the architecture from the product side that really helps complete that Synthesis picture. And so we started again with TMOS, with this high-performance services fabric. And then we have the various ways to scale that fabric. So it is the second piece of it. And then we have all the programmability, these different pieces of programmability. And you will notice there I have actually included Node.js as part of this. Because one of the things that we are working towards in the future, one of the reasons we are excited about our LineRate acquisition, is our ability now to leverage open source as the means to program this fabric. And I will talk more about that as well.</p><p>And then finally, you need to manage this. And that is what part of BIG-IQ is, the ability to provide another level of automation and control and centralized management to this overall fabric.</p><p>Now, just talking about the hardware a little bit, there are three areas that we focus on that we have to optimize for when we talk about our hardware. The first one is being packet-oriented; that is, we have to live in the network and we have to do things very well at the network level. In fact, we have a complete full switch implemented across our product line. So we do that very well. We have to basically be a good network citizen.</p><p>Now, the other thing we have to optimize for is CPU-oriented operations, things that -- proxy-based operations. So things that require TCP operations or a high level of intelligence and flexibility. So we have to optimize for that as well.</p><p>And then finally, the third area is what we call specialized operations. So things like being able to do layer 4 offload or the DDoS offload and hardware, while being able to support connectivity down there between the switching components and other things, or SSL services or compression caching, you name it. And so we optimize for all three of those things, and so kind of the intersection of those three areas is basically where our hardware sits.</p><p>Now if you look at competitors, typically none of them can actually optimize for all three axes. Typically, they are using servers or other things so they can optimize for one or two of these things, but they really can't do all three.</p><p>Just a recap of our refresh. Last year we refreshed our entire line of appliances, so starting from the 2000 all the way up to our 10,000 series. Each one of these appliances has a scale and licensing option, so you can scale performance with a software license. And also, we offer various options for FIPS and SSL and NEBS as part of these platforms as well. And actually, we will be introducing SSDs, high-performance memory as well, as part of that lineup.</p><p>Something that will be coming out here very shortly this quarter is what we call our Victoria II blade, which the brand is actually the VIPRION 2250. It fits in the 2400 series platform. We have significantly increased the performance of this from the previous generation. It has gone up from -- the previous generation, we did about 18 gigabits for layer 7. This does 80. So it is over a factor of four for just layer 7. Layer 4 is 80 gigabits per blade. So on a four-slot chassis we can -- do the math -- 320 gigabits of throughput. So it is the highest performance, smallest footprint platform out there in the market today. And then the modularity you get with being able to put the blades, having a bladed system.</p><p>The other thing that we have increased is our ability to do VCMP on this, meaning that we support 20 high-performance VCMP images per blade; so that is 80 per chassis. And we will go through some more details of what it means to do VCMP on our blades.</p><p>Now, we are also working on our next-generation blade for the large, high-end VIPRION. This is very much -- we call it Cerberus. We don't have a model number yet for it. This is still future, but it is the fourth-generation blade for the high-end VIPRION, like I said, the 4X series chassis. And it will be it is very much focused at service provider in super high-end enterprise. And it will be again significantly increasing the performance over the current generation, significantly improving VCMP density, and it will have some new things like 100 gig interfaces and some other high-performance interfaces as well.</p><p>Just to show you kind of more details on our roadmap, on what we are doing here, we talked about the Victoria II blade, the 2250. We actually will have a 2-slot chassis that will be coming out -- we call it the V2 -- that will accept the current generation of VIPRION, the 2400 blades. And it is in a 2U footprint. So it is going to be very compact. It will be the world's first modular ADC appliance.</p><p>And then you can see out in the future, we are still working on Cerberus and some other things as well. And actually, we are going to have a new variant of our current generation, our third-generation blade for the 4X 100s, that will again significantly ramp up our VCMP density, as well as memory and other capabilities.</p><p>Now just to show you kind of where we are at with the VCMP density, there is two factors we always look at. One is cost per instance. And you can see as we increase density, the cost per instance goes down. I threw in Citrix there just to kind of give you a comparison, that their highest-end appliance right now. And you can see -- and it is a little hard to see on this diagram -- but you can see where we are getting to in terms of cost per instance. And we are talking sub-$5000 per instance, which is by far the lowest in the industry.</p><p>And you can see here on the right side how the number of VCMP instances ramps up. And so you could see with the Cerberus, we will be close to 400 instances in a single chassis. So very high densities.</p><p>The other part about VCMP now is that it is not just about providing multi-tenancy. It is about having flexible allocation as part of that, so that you can scale as the services demand that kind of scalability. And we have various ways to do it. I am just showing a few examples here.</p><p>But one of the key things is that we are able to now expand or contract the number of CPUs per VCMP instance, as well as memory and other resources of the system. And one of the things that is very different about VCMP and what we do, our multi-tenancy versus the competitors, is that we are able to virtualize all the way down to bare metal. That is we control the resources all the way down to the most fundamental element of the platform. So we can control and have true isolation of the tenants that are running (inaudible). No one else does that. Everyone else is sharing CPUs or doing other things, or in the case of one competitor, they are using essentially a single operating system with multiple -- basically multiple tenants running on that same operating system.</p><p>Now, we also can provide redundancy, not only at the blade level but across chassis. That is part of the whole fabric that we are able to provide active, active, active, active, you name it, type scalability and cluster these resources as well. So it is not just limited to chassis or to the boxes or appliances; it is at the instance level; it is at the VE level as well. So we are able to scale that horizontally.</p><p>On the virtual edition front, again we are releasing a new 10-gigabit version that runs on VMware. And also under XEN and KVM, we have 8-gigabit versions that are going there as well. Hyper-V, we are limited to three. That is more an issue with Microsoft's implementation, where non-native Windows guests can't make use of the resources of the their Hyper-V -- hypervisors. So you wind up being limited there. Hopefully, that will change.</p><p>And then I am showing we also run all of our services at Amazon. That is just a limitation of Amazon, the 1-gigabit. As soon as we can do higher, we can go there. There is no fundamental limitation in our footprint or in our technology.</p><p>Now the other thing I want to mention too is that we support different footprints now as well for cloud applications. So we have a very small footprint version, LTM-only, of our VE, that is -- basically it is a 5-gigabyte footprint with -- it supports one core and about 25 megabits of throughput. Or you can go for the mega large instance, with the full 4 cores and 10 gigabits of throughput and all that.</p><p>Some new things that Manny mentioned in his presentation, where we are making it much easier to license our products, especially for the cloud. So pool-based licensing, being able to rent licenses and do things like that, so you don't have to have -- the perpetual -- you don't have to run them perpetually.</p><p>And BIG-IQ is very central to that because in those scenarios, it actually accesses the licensing manager. It is actually a licensing proxy in that case.</p><p>Just to remind everyone, as Manny talked about, we have a 11 different modules today that we support as part of our platform. They focus on areas like security. We have three different modules for security. We have modules that are very focused on the service provider market, kind of core traffic management and traffic steering. And then we have cloud-based ones as well. And then BIG-IQ, which centralizes management of these different modules. So as we go along, we are adding modules that plug into BIG-IQ that now can manage the individual modules across your entire infrastructure.</p><p>Just thought I would quickly again mention LineRate, what we are doing there. LineRate, again, is an open source application proxy. And the open source we work with today is Node.js. Node.js is essentially JavaScript-based libraries, open-source JavaScript-based libraries. And long-term, the focus is going to be to bring that capability and integrate that as part of BIG-IP, but we are also launching it as its own product.</p><p>And the initial launch -- and this is very much focused at the DevOps community that Manny talked about -- will be made available on Amazon. And so customers will be able to go use that in the cloud. Now, ultimately, we will extend that again to BIG-IP and other platforms. But that is going to be our initial go-to-market with that, and that will be coming out here very soon.</p><p>On the service provider, we talk about kind of our Focus Five . We have five areas that we focus on as part of this. There is DNS services; an area called policy-based steering; control plane, the service provider control plane with the SDC, your Traffix product; CGNAT and kind of those network level services; and then security.</p><p>On the DNS side, we have the highest-performance DNS solution out there, over 11 million requests per second. And what is great about that, what is -- typically most people don't need that. But what service providers like about that is the best way to provide denial of service with DNS is just to have massive capacity, so you can't overwhelm the DNS system. And that is one area that we are able to provide for them. So it is not only popular for the service providers, but it is also popular for our enterprise customers as well.</p><p>We also have other technologies for helping accelerate DNS, like our DNS caching, as well as DNA express. And then also, we can provide other types of security with DNSSec. And so we are also focusing in areas like being able to provide full local DNS offload and other things. But that is again very much focused on that service provider.</p><p>Okay, policy-based steering, this is a big area, because there is a lot of technologies that we use to steer traffic in these data centers. Our policy enforcement module is part of that suite. And what it does is allows you to classify traffic and then make decisions about what to do with that traffic, based on policies that are part of the PCRF infrastructure. So -- which is very different than like a DPI-type solution. We are able to actually enforce and manage traffic versus just being able to identify it. And then we can apply all the other services that BIG-IP provides, with the iRules or some of our other security services, on that same footprint. So it is very different than when you start talking about a DPI-based solution.</p><p>Now, there is other ways that we steer traffic as well. We offer a full ICAP interface, which allows you to steer web services natively. And that has been very popular for things like being able to do video optimization, which now largely runs over web.</p><p>And then we also have other protocols that we support as part of that, like SIP and GTP Prime and other things that fit under that umbrella of doing traffic management, so that is a big area.</p><p>Now on the Traffix, again, that is all about Diameter routing and signaling. We have a very flexible platform and architecture, fully software-based. We sell it on basically off-the-shelf, standard platforms, so usually a blade server, to the customer so they can pick and choose based on what licensing they want in terms of throughput and performance. And again, WiFi offload has been kind of more of a focus here, and then voice-over LTE has been a big focal area for this, and we are definitely seeing a lot of good traction with that.</p><p>CGNAT, this is, again, an area, like I said earlier, it is a moving target for us. Customers are constantly evolving this part of the network. There is new protocols. So we are evolving with that. We have had a lot of focus in terms of being very competitive in this area. And again, we are continuing to move forward with that.</p><p>And then on the security side, the Gi firewall is probably one of the biggest areas. We have a super-high-performance network-based firewall with our AFM solution. And this is again super popular for the guys that need to implement this kind of performance and bandwidth in the service provider networks. A key component of that is BIG-IQ, because the customers there need to scale management as well. So being able to scale out and run hundreds of instances of that in their infrastructure that manage it centrally has been a key requirement for them.</p><p>On the security side, there are, again, four major areas that we focus on. APM is our product for identity and access management. And this is what started out originally as our acquisition of a company called uRoam. And we took the SSL VPN technology which provided the remote access and we fully integrated that -- actually re-architected a lot of it, put that as part of our BIG-IP package, then we scaled it massively. So we have extremely high scalability. So we can not only manage remote access, but we can centralize all access controls, and then provide things like SSL. So it makes a single sign-on, and we can front end web applications, we can federate web applications using SAML as part of that.</p><p>And now what we are adding to it is our ability to now manage outbound traffic with our Secure Web Gateway. We have partnered with WebSense, we fully have integrated their database into BIG-IP, and with that, we are able to provide -- essentially create policies now associated with what users can access out in the Internet. So basically, we are protecting them from accessing inappropriate or the wrong contact or things out on the Internet on websites. And so that will -- actually, that is part of the Vancouver release, and that is coming. And then hopefully, we can extend that technology to other areas with our firewall and all.</p><p>Now Versafe -- and I will talk more about this in detail -- but this is about being able to provide antifraud and anti-malware capabilities to our core platform. I will go through that.</p><p>AFM, one of the big areas where we are continuing to build that out, the focus is on management right now, being able to centralize management. But we are continually adding features and capabilities. DDoS is a big area for this. We now have over 60 vectors now in hardware for DDoS, and we are continually adding new software-based sectors, as well, as part of that.</p><p>And then ASM, ASM is just a natural component to tightly integrate with Versafe. It is a web application firewall. Versafe protects users at the time they access the web application. And so being able to tightly couple the policies of ASM and then the detection capabilities of Versafe is going to be critical as we go forward. And so there is just a great synergy there.</p><p>But we are also doing things on ASM; we're rolling out more of the layer 7 DDoS capabilities, because those tend to be the hardest to combat against. The L4 ones tend to be more what they call volumetric, so they are just trying to overwhelm the system. The L7 ones tend to be more insidious and go after vulnerabilities within the application.</p><p>And then finally BIG-IQ support; you will see that coming out as part of Vancouver as well.</p><p>Okay, on the Secure Web Gateway, I already spoke through most of this. But it really gives us that outbound capability. This is the first time -- we are able to actually do this quite quickly, because we are able to leverage other technology components from our BIG-IP portfolio. So for example, we use a forward proxy -- and Manny just referenced this earlier. This is part of our acceleration manager. It's something we have had for a while. It is a very high-performance forward proxy. We are able to take that, take the WebSense database, and then obviously wrap some work around that and our management plane and all that, and then release that very quickly. So it is a good example of being synergies and being able to get leverage because of the suite of technology components that we have and get something to market that we think gives us something very unique and differentiated.</p><p>All right, this just shows a little bit more. It's something we don't talk about. There is a lot of services, such as the statistics. So we actually have a full analytics engine built into BIG-IP, so the Secure Web Gateway can leverage that. And also one of the unique attributes of APM is what we call our visual policy manager. This is very unique. It gives you -- it is a very powerful way to create very complex and detailed policies. We have had this for quite a while. It is very differentiated when you look at other solutions.</p><p>Just again with hardware, we are accelerating DDoS. We have over 60 new vectors now -- or 60 vectors we support in hardware itself today, hundreds more in software. And we are continually adding to that. You will see that continue.</p><p>On Versafe. Now, Versafe, I was really excited about, because the issue of trying to combat malware is a very tricky issue. And you tend to need kind of a toolkit of things to go after it. And this is a great toolkit. And delivery of this toolkit is excellent, because it gets delivered at the time when a user is accessing, say, like a banking application or other types of applications. It does not require any client footprint. That is different than some of the competition, which you actually have to install a client.</p><p>And what that means is you go to a website, you click on it, and then the website asks can I install this client. Well, most people aren't going to do that. I know I don't. Any website asks if they can install something, that would be a no. This does it transparently because it happens within the browser. And what it does is it is able to deliver essentially obfuscated JavaScript from the user application. BIG-IP gets involved, because it can actually inject that JavaScript transparently as part of the transaction, and then it gets rendered down in the client device, and then it connects back up to the application, and then it is able to detect changes.</p><p>So for example, if there is a key logger on the -- keystroke logger that was going on down in the device, we would be able to detect that. There is various things that can be detected, and based on that, then you are able to reject or basically alert that there is a problem, and then with ASM then we can block it. So it is a natural fit, again, to combine with ASM.</p><p>And as part of this now, we have basically a security operation center. So it is a 24-by-7 center that actually can see these threats, they are alerted and then they notify the customer and they work with the customer to resolve. In fact, over the past -- they have actually had to work with -- they have worked with law enforcement agencies when they detected issues to go out and get these things taken care of. So it gives us a new capability that we didn't have previously. It gives us kind of like a -- I like to call it like a layer 8 kind of intelligence, because you are looking at user behaviors in addition to things that are happening across transactions. And so you can see how this in the future could get leveraged across other aspects of our security lineup.</p><p>And again, I spoke largely about this. One of the other things we are building out now -- and we've started it -- we started it a couple of years ago, but we have been able to accelerate this -- having this security research team. This is based out of Israel. But we have been able to add significant brainpower to that team. And again, it is to keep building out this basis of our security products.</p><p>All right. Software-defined networking. I had to put this in here, because it's just -- it has been such a misused term, I think, over the last three years, when it came out. It has been applied -- many meanings have been applied to it. Ours have been pretty simple. We focused on this notion of applications and how they are deployed on the network and how they are used by -- how they are accessed by users, and how that experience has optimized, managed, how we make those available and how we secure those.</p><p>What we didn't do is get boiled down at the network layer. Because we are not a network level device. We live in the network, but we sit on top of it. We go in as an overlay, because we are a proxy. And that makes us largely independent of the infrastructure. But it also is what has been very good for us to work with our partners, like VMware and now Cisco, because what they are is they are focused at managing the network, being able to add programmability at the network tier; we add the programmability at the app tier as part of that.</p><p>And this is how we complete that picture. You can see here, if you look at the data plane, there is various protocols now that are running. You have NVGRE, you can have VXLAN, you can have other SDN-type protocols running. Basically, those look like another form of VLAN, as far as we are concerned. It is a network construct. We connect into that, we can connect those networks, we can bridge, we can act as a gateway, an app gateway. But we don't have to get involved at managing connectivity in the network layer, and we don't do that.</p><p>And so again, when we talk about integrating with Cisco, we layer very nicely on top of their architecture. Now we also plug into things like SDN controllers. So that we can participate as part of the programmability of the network, we provide, again, the flexibility and programmability of the application infrastructure on top of that. So these applications can be our services, they can be other types of services.</p><p>And then we can also plug into other automation frameworks with this as well, so we can initiate different services. And a good example of this is if you look here, you can see there is BIG-IQ cloud, and then what Manny was talking about, SDAS. Well, VMware integrates into BIG-IQ, and what that allows them and us to do is complete the orchestration workflow. Meaning that they can provision the resources of the network -- so virtual machines running. And then we can essentially connect those virtual machines with the application resources. And we can do this all from a single pane of glass or a single point of view. Before, this would take multiple departments; this can now all be done directly from, say, V center for example.</p><p>Now, with our network side partners, same type of thing. We plug into their SDN automation controllers. You have Cisco coming out with APIC. Arista has an open-flow interface. And essentially -- so we can plug into that and connect basically the network programmability, like I said, with the application programmability.</p><p>We also work with other -- like open source. So OpenStack has been -- we have been very involved with that. OpenStack, again, is very focused again at providing essentially programmability via an open-source interface. And that does mainly network-level stuff, but it does some other basic capabilities. But we are a big contributor there and we are working with that as well, again, to provide this level of orchestration and management throughout the network.</p><p>And then finally, we connect to the cloud and help manage resources within the cloud. Amazon today, you can get any one of our virtual machines running -- or any one of our modules running on a virtual machine on Amazon. When we first introduced it, we provided essentially transparent connectivity to Amazon, so you can do things like cloud bursting or app tiering in the cloud. Now what we can do as well is we actually can orchestrate the actual resources within the cloud. That is, that from BIG-IQ, you can now manage your entire EC2 or your AWS account. So high availability, all those resources as part of that; so it is very transparent now. And we are going to add more clouds and build this. But it shows how we have a complete picture around orchestrating and managing the services, regardless of the type of infrastructure that they exist in.</p><p>On BIG-IQ, three major areas that we focus on as part of this, that it is going to do. We talked a lot about the application fabric management, so being able to create essentially the resources and scale these resources in the cloud. Or actually -- or regardless -- it's actually not even the cloud; it can be any infrastructure. Then cloud orchestration and management. This is like I talked a moment ago, orchestrating resources or constructs within the cloud, in addition to our application services. So essentially providing that uber management tool that can do everything you need to manage your entire cloud infrastructure. And then finally, centralized management for all of our BIG-IQ modules. So like security manager, things for ASM, other types of services that we provide that we need to scale and provide a single point of view. And so that is kind of its focus.</p><p>You can see here BIG-IQ, BIG-IQ, what is interesting about it is it's a whole new platform for us; that is, we built it from the ground up. We were able to leverage some components that we have been TMOS, but largely, it is a completely different platform. It has REST-based interfaces for programmability. But it also has the ability, again, for us to create custom modules that plug into it for centralized management or other applications. Anybody can create a module for it. It is very simple. Again, it has got these open APIs.</p><p>Now this just shows -- unfortunately, we couldn't animate, this but it shows different areas that BIG-IQ can help. If you need to add services to your existing data center, it will allow you to move services, move the apps or our services that are associated with these applications, and then add capacity or remove capacity dynamically, whether it is in your infrastructure, whether it is a hybrid cloud or whether it is a public cloud type infrastructure, and do this all transparently.</p><p>This just shows -- like I was talking about these modules, these service modules that can plug in on top of BIG-IQ. Like I said, it has an open API; but again, we also support these different types of modules. So for example, BIG-IQ cloud, again, is the module we offer for being able to tie into Amazon today, being able to provide essentially that connectivity between your data center and Amazon. BIG-IQ security, centralized policy control for our application firewall -- or for our advanced firewall. And we can scale to hundreds of instances there.</p><p>And then ASM, that is coming out here very shortly. You see BIG-IQ mobility. This is focused on mobile access management. And then we have other ones for doing more fabric style control, which is called BIG-IQ Device, being able to do provisioning, licensing, bare metal deployment of services, software upgrades, things like that, all the things that help kind of scale and manage the fabric. In fact, just a little bit more detail around what that is here on this slide.</p><p>But it gives us now the ability to really manage not only -- like I said, with BIG-IQ, with this platform, we are able to manage not only our own services, but plug into other types of controllers and other types of services and really automate and orchestrate the entire infrastructure as part of that. And this is, again, kind of a key component to do that.</p><p>And that is why we talk about being so pivotal. Like I said, we have best-of-breed data plane services that we can apply with TMOS. And now we have a best-of-breed control module or control manager that can fit on top of all this and help orchestrate and tie into all these different architectures that -- and the things we are working with our partners.</p><p>So with that, I will turn this over to Dean, who is going to come up and speak.</p><p>DEAN DARWIN, SVP OF MARKETING, F5 NETWORKS, INC.: Good morning. My name is Dean Darwin. I am the Senior Vice President of Marketing, and I wanted to give you a little bit of background before I get started. I've spent about 20 years -- over 20 years in sales. And I did long stints at both Cisco Systems and Network Appliance. Been at F5 for a little over eight years, and I was the SVP of Worldwide Channels. So I ran Channels for about five years, did the Unity program, about 3000 partners and about 70 distributors.</p><p>So I think -- I have been in marketing for about seven months now, started orchestrating the Synthesis format and what you will be seeing on the marketing side of things. But I think what I bring to the table is a lot more sales element, a lot more partner element to marketing, and I am going to show you today some of the strategies that we are deploying.</p><p>So if I look at the marketing aspect of what we are trying to do, I would really like you to grab onto this, is that if on the left, you looked at what our traditional marketing was about. It was really about products and features. We were really great a talking about new performance products, new platforms, either DE or hardware. And then a release like Karl talked about a couple of times a year, a major release that would come out, and we would market that.</p><p>With this announcement of Synthesis, I think it brings both to our partners and our customers and our sales force a new way to be able to sell. And what we are adding to this now are business outcomes and solutions that I am going to talk about. Manny mentioned a little bit about it around reference architectures. That is really geared around business outcomes. It is a different tool for the sales guys and the partners.</p><p>And then on the right-hand side, you also see the Synthesis vision. And I am going to show you how that gets marketed. We are really now extending with this announcement two new tools to the tool bag for both the partners and the sales teams to go out and mention. But that is what we are marketing behind. So before I was on the left; now we have all three that we go to market with.</p><p>As part of Synthesis, the other thing I wanted to do today was give you a little bit more of a sales and marketing motion, to put a little context behind how Synthesis gets consumed and what the opportunity is and how sales changes a little bit. So I am going to take you through a scenario on exactly what this means and I think what the opportunity is.</p><p>There is a concept that this leave no application left behind, and that is really true when you look at corporate enterprises. On average, you take a look at corporate enterprises, they have in excess of over 1000 applications. And with agile and the explosion of mobility, you are seeing even more applications being developed quicker, over the walls of the network guys to be able to support. But this explosion of applications really starts to create a little bit of tension on the underlying infrastructure. And I am going to show you that from a modeling perspective.</p><p>In fact, this week, I was actually here in New York and I had dinner with one of the major banks. They had 15,000 applications they were deploying or had in production. So I believe and I think the market proves out that every application requires services, be it acceleration services, security services, optimization services, availability services. It is not just a few that need it, but all applications need to consume that.</p><p>What has happened, though, is -- that is why actually when we came out with the application delivery controller, was to be able to offload those services that were hardcoded into the application, to let applications be applications or let servers serve.</p><p>But if you have this theory where you have a large amount of applications on a corporate enterprise and they all require services, what ends up happening is you have a barrier to cloud. And this is something that you talk to any of the CIOs out there, everybody has a mandate or a percentage of applications they want to move to the cloud, but there is a barrier, either public cloud or the AWSes of the world, because they have to have the application services there at the cloud. And it is not something that Amazon focuses on, not the higher-level stuff. They give you a compute, they give you storage, they give you an interface, but they really don't focus themselves in on the 4 through 7 services that application requires.</p><p>You take an application and you take a data center, you start looking at things like compliance. That is pretty important. If I can't extend my compliance out to the cloud, my application becomes a barrier. So you have this mandate. So you have all these applications that need to consume services. But what has happened is because of the economics and the way we are structured technically, we kind of force the customer to go into the selected few. So they take their most important applications. Because some applications might not have even cost as much as an application controller. It didn't make a lot of sense to put a $50,000 or $75,000 pair of BIG-IPs in front of an app that might have cost $20,000, but still needs to consume services.</p><p>So over time, what we have done is we have taken these applications and said, these are the most important, they are going to consume services. The rest of applications really get left behind. And you can go to any one of our customers today, and they will have their most mission-critical, their SharePoint, their Oracle, their web application, covered with us. But there is a lot of applications they would like to use services around and also move to the cloud that just don't exist.</p><p>And when we built out the infrastructure that Manny talked about, this is kind of how it looked. So we have applications that are dedicated to pieces of hardware or also software. But they were solid. So you would have an application married to a BIG-IP married to a BIG-IP. And it still creates this environment where applications need to consume services.</p><p>So with Synthesis -- and I want you to get this from an opportunity perspective -- what Synthesis does is it removes this underlying siloed approach, and we replace it with a high-performance fabric. When you have that compute fabric and you get rid of silos and you go linear across -- or elastically across the data center, you now have the ability to do two things. You can elastically scale to support the performance characteristics of all applications, irregardless of where they sit. I want you to consume that for a second.</p><p>The second thing you could do is you could also now spin off these application services. This is what Manny talked about. It is the services the applications are consuming. Now that it sits on a fabric, all applications can be consuming the services, and you can extend that out to the cloud. So you remove that barrier.</p><p>The thing I would want you -- envision an application -- you have got an application, you are going to spin up that application. That application is going to get provisioned. So now F5 is going to let you say, this application requires SSL, this application requires compression, this application requires perhaps a WAF. Or on a bigger scale, these thousand applications need SSL, these thousand applications need this, and you get into degrees of provisioning, irregardless of where the application lives.</p><p>Now you have that application with those services spun up, now you want to move it out to AWS. Well, the services that you provision under Synthesis now move along when you spin that instance up at AWS.</p><p>Think about the opportunity from that perspective, where you walk into any corporate where we are largely installed, we may have 100 or 200 BIG-IPs back in that original configuration of kind of a siloed approach. With the fabric and SDAS, the ability to do Synthesis, you open it up where the conversation extends now to the CIO to say, look, you have 100 or 200 covered today with those application services; now with SDAS and Synthesis, we can get all 1000 or all 1500 -- in this case, the bank I talked to you -- all 15,000 applications. So your spend will go up and your opportunity increases for our existing installed base.</p><p>It also creates a pretty large barrier to entry for competitors, because these SDAS applications are getting the services provisioned against this fabric.</p><p>So I want you to think in those terms, because I think one of the things I am really excited about from a marketing perspective is going back into the existing accounts to really extend our footprint and to show them that there is -- the applications are not being left behind.</p><p>And if you look at the ROI or TCO around that, it is really measured in hours. Because think of what they had to do with the other applications were left behind. They were programming those application services in the app. Now. that was the promise at ADC long ago. But now with Synthesis, we can have a much more differentiated conversation, which really resonates from both an economics perspective and an enablement perspective. So that is, I think, a pretty vast opportunity for our channel and our sales teams, and that is what we are going to be marketing in 2014.</p><p>So let me talk about Synthesis for a second from a marketing perspective. When we sat down and we looked at this concept of no application left behind, we looked at the concept of applications -- all applications requiring services, this high-performance fabric, and spinning that fabric and extending it out to the cloud, that opens up a lot of dynamics around partnerships. And we had to really vet it.</p><p>So I sat down with Manny and I personally talked to about nine different customers around the world, our largest customers, to get this vetted before we went out to market with it, and said, what do you guys think? Are we solving a problem? And I want to show you a couple of quotes. And unfortunately, I couldn't put the names on. I didn't have permission to go public with the quotes, but these are some of our largest customers. And I thought it was interesting, because everything I heard from these customers I spoke to around the world was all around -- I have had a lot of vendors come in right now with the SDN visions. I have had the usual suspects walk in with a lot of vision statements, come in and said, here is our vision. So we are hearing a lot of this vision thing. So when we came in and talked about our vision, I think they understood the differentiation.</p><p>The other thing that the customers told us was that every one of the SDN vendors came in and said, here is what we are doing for layers 2 through 3, this is the new data center, the software-defined data center, here is the economic benefit from it. And the customer would ask, well, what are you doing for 4 through 7. What is the answer? Go ask (inaudible) cloud. Go ask F5. So this was really resonating to the customer base, to say, ah, here is the answer for 4 through 7 as it relates to the underlying network, either in a traditional network, back into the VLAN network, or in the SDN model.</p><p>The one I really like was a large property who just consequently had just briefed their executives on their own vision for their data center a week before us. And they said it was so interesting -- they looked at our slides and we said what do you think, are we headed down the right track? And they actually came back and said, it's uncanny; we could have used your slides; it is that much aligned. So I think we did well and it resonated well.</p><p>And then one of the top 10 financial companies asked -- we have been asking for this for quite a while, so we completely agree with the vision. So the customers were vetted out very nicely.</p><p>I then went out to the partner community that I know very well, sat down with them and said, is this something you guys can envision, is this what your customers are asking for. And unanimously, was very, very positive.</p><p>So Manny talked about the ecosystem. So then we transitioned and started talking to the partners about Synthesis, how do we marry together, how do we operate together, how do we get joint vision, can we go to market. If you really look at the left side on the Ecosystem press release -- and I am not going to go through every one of the quotes -- but it was pretty astounding on every SDN vendor got behind this message, because it solves a dramatic problem for them, and actually will allow them to have greater traction on their SDN, because they can answer the 4 through 7 issue.</p><p>So I am going to pull a couple of the quotes from the SDN vendors specifically. I am not sure if you saw the press release, but I am just going to throw them up there. I am not going to read them. But this is Cisco -- this is Soni Jiandani from Cisco, that they really talk about the ACI infrastructure that they are doing with SDN having true synergy with what we are doing with Synthesis.</p><p>So I want you to think of -- like Manny talked about and I want to reinforce that -- is a fabric overlaying another fabric. It is not cannibalistic; it is an API, it is provisioning, so we spin up an environment with Cisco, where now the application services I talked about, where every application requires services. And when we change the licensing that we talked about with good, better, best, that fully enables that opportunity. Because no longer do we get really siloed on how we deploy that licensing. And in a Cisco perspective, when they actually go out and discover resources on their ACI infrastructure, we have the ability to tie into that and participate. So not only are you spinning up compute and network, you are spinning up compute, network and application services. Very powerful. And it is an enabling technology for them on pushing forward their SDN vision.</p><p>VMware had very similar views of Synthesis as well, again reinforcing the idea that an F5 4 through 7 Synthesis fabric overlaying an SDN fabric is an enabling technology that gets them to market faster because it solves that application services problem.</p><p>HP, Bethany Mayer, same thing. What they are doing with software-defined networks, they understood the fabric. And I can go on through every one of these guys. But I think for this audience specifically, one takeaway from this is this would have never happened if this was a load-balancing conversation. I'll be very blunt with that. This would not have happened if this was just a simple load-balancing issue. This has nothing really to do -- availability as part of the application services, we are far past just load-balancing on this. This is an entire fabric talking to a fabric with orchestration and provisioning.</p><p>So these quotes -- the reason I printed them is because you guys have the ability to get this data; it is in the press release. And then also Nokia is also very aggressive on the aspect of SDN.</p><p>So when you have all the SDN vendors coming to us, we are looking at use cases now and go to market, like Manny talked about, we are really not talking about just a marketing relationship where we are on each other's PRs. We are having in-depth conversations about how we bring this to market. I am very bullish on the marketing messages that are coming out of this and what we are doing with these companies to be able to do and drive business solutions.</p><p>So let's switch gears for Synthesis for a second, and I want to reinforce this again. So what is Synthesis? What is it? What does it consist of? And Manny talked about the three pillars. It is a high-performance fabric, and that fabric again is elastic, that can scale out to the cloud. And I want you to think about that. I talked about this application that can be spun up, services provisioned to it, and now you want to move that application to the cloud. That fabric extends out to the cloud.</p><p>And what both Karl and Manny talked about was that elasticity and all the stuff that is going in BIG-IQ. What that is is really the ability to take that fabric and say, you know what, I have got this fabric from F5 that's 4 through 7 writing over my SDN or traditional network. Now I am just going to extend that out to AWS. That fabric and the management of that fabric extends out to the cloud with the services. So you are now tying those services together.</p><p>That is where the intelligent orchestration of services come in. And that is the SDAS, that is the no application left behind, the provisioning of the services to the application irregardless of where it lives and all the intelligence around that. You do that through simplified business models. You do that through the ability to be able to do the licensing so you free up that capability. I am incredibly bullish on this licensing model because it opens up the opportunity.</p><p>The discussion with a CIO or the architects is now not let's just how we do this one application, but how do we enable all your applications, which takes you from an X spend to a Y spend in that customer discussion.</p><p>But also what Synthesis is -- there is three more tenets, which is we are working very hard -- and you saw a press release about us launching on AWS -- is really over 2014 F5 on every cloud in every market place. So we can extend that fabric to be able to enable the cloud, enable those application services. And what Karl talked about, which I am also excited about, which is this performance characteristic of -- or this performance leadership aspect.</p><p>So our solutions go all the way down to 25 megs, which is a developer's dream on the cloud, flip it out, get some tests done, bring it -- tear it back down, build it in the cloud, all the way to what Manny talked about with the 20 terabytes and everywhere in between. So you can do the fabric in two boxes or you can do them in 32 boxes. It is how far you want to scale that fabric. You want it all software, you want it all hardware, you want it hybrid, you want software in the cloud, hardware here for SSL? It is every variable of performance leadership.</p><p>And then Manny touched on this and I am going to spend a little bit more time on this, because I think it is a very salient point, which is reference architectures. This is also a very big part of the Synthesis launch. It was very interesting to the SDN vendors when we spoke to them about Synthesis, because this is where we meet. This is the business outcomes. And I will show you what this means.</p><p>So let's take a step back, and these are the reference architectures. And you see them from both mobility reference architectures, you see them in security reference architectures, you see them in cloud and you see them in core ADC services. What these reference architectures are is really the way business problems get solved. If you think about that -- customers don't go on to our webpage, have a DDoS attack and go I wonder if a couple of BIG-IPs will help me. They have a DDoS problem. They want to understand what the DDoS solution is.</p><p>The other thing about reference architectures is this has an ability for us -- the deal size will be larger, because you are solving a much more vast business problem. From a partner perspective channel -- and this is something I spent eight years here at F5 developing -- this is also a channel where the channel meets. Because what the channel has the opportunity to do is take these reference architectures -- they are fully documented, and I will show you what the BoM looks like -- they can wrap their own services around it, they can take other vendors on their line card to round off the solution.</p><p>So when I vetted this out with the channel partners of Synthesis, they all came back and said, Synthesis is great and we like it and we understand it and we are getting a lot of push from the SDN vendors, and we understand the fabric on top of a fabric, but this is where we go out today. And the reference architectures that we did -- fully documented, and I will show you what the BoM looks like on the bottom -- these are vast. Fully documented and they are all available today, based on today's reality and today's code. And what will happen is as Karl releases Vancouver and other releases, my reference architecture team will continually keep these updated.</p><p>This is also where we talk to the Ciscos of the world and the VMwares of the world and they are very interested in this, because this is where we can meet on a particular business problem. Does it make sense?</p><p>So what happens is what we have done with these reference architectures, we have extended them out from a marketing perspective, where they really now become what I talk about with the channel, but they also -- when we do events, when we do different things with our partners, we will be talking about these reference architectures and not necessarily product and feature. That is underlying the reference architecture and supporting the reference architecture, but supporting the business value of business outcome of the engagement.</p><p>The other thing we do, like every other vendor, is we have campaigns. So it is a playbook for our field and field marketing our channel to be able to follow. We have now developed that these new campaigns for 2014 will all be based on our reference architectures. So not only can we look at the reference architectures as we do events, as we do different field marketing opportunities, I can measure this. I know exactly what reference architecture is doing well, which one needs more work, which one is consumed, which partners are engaged with us, where does it work geographically. Is this reference architecture working better in one theater than another? But again, it is all around solving particular business outcomes, which is a very, very big part of Synthesis.</p><p>So how does a channel partner or sales or a campaign actually utilize this, this combination of reference architectures and the Synthesis messaging? Because one is a business outcome, fully-documented reference architecture. The other is a vision that we will be releasing over time. So how does this work?</p><p>Where I think the value is going to come from is -- let's talk about sales. I talk about a customer that may have a DDoS problem or a cloud bursting problem or a federation issue. They land on a reference architecture. Our teams go out and sell that particular reference architecture. Then they can move up into the Synthesis vision and then land back down on a different reference architecture. A lot of the customers I talked about, when I briefed them, they said, how do I consume Synthesis, where do I start? I have 200 of your boxes right now; I am not real apt about tearing those out and putting in a fabric. I'm very pleased with what you are doing, but how do I migrate to this?</p><p>So the beautiful thing about the reference architectures is the ability to take this reference architecture, deploy the fabric in that reference architecture, isolate it off, and then over time, as they get more comfort, they can start bringing other use cases in or start to migrate their old way of doing business into the Synthesis fabric. So you have the ability to transition from reference architectures up to the vision, deploy it for that or scale it out as far as you want.</p><p>Now, the interesting thing is over 2014, we have about another 10 to 15 reference architectures lined up. So we had this compelling event that was our worldwide sales meeting that we wanted to get the reference architectures again that could be consumed today and is being consumed today, to get those out. So we did 11. But there is another 10 or 15 behind that. And then you will see this continually being reinforced as other use cases get done, all under the Synthesis fabric.</p><p>So it brings a lot of capability from a marketing and a messaging perspective to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace from just here is how this particular service works, or do you want us for this particular application or what you want to do with this, to more of a larger-scale reference architecture selling motion and marketing motion.</p><p>And the other thing that I think we have done for the first time at F5, and will be releasing over 2014 as well, is you have got these campaigns and you have got these reference architectures. Not all of the messaging has to be consumed at all layers. And what I mean is before, we would come out with one message that was targeted at IT; now, it is differentiated. So all of the campaign structures now are based on personas.</p><p>So how that reference architecture gets marketed to the CIO is going to be different than to the person in IT that consumes our technology traditionally. Different messaging, different business focus, different ways we are going to market, which I think will give us a lot more granularity and the messaging will resonate to the right audience at the right time. So I think this is a step forward from a marketing perspective.</p><p>The other thing that we have done and we have released, and you have seen some instances of it today, is we have really focused in on our brand. And for the first time, we have really gone out and said, this is our brand, this is our message, our vision, and we are starting to do some advertising for name recognition, specifically driving a lot of these partner discussions. Because you are dealing with the Ciscos and the VMwares and you have got to have some branding in the marketplace.</p><p>So this is the new tagline. So you might have heard IT Agility Your Way and The Network Ends with F5. This is the new one, which is Solutions for an Application World. So you will see that through everything we do over 2014 and extending through that. But we are really trying to get synonymous with the application. We are trying to get as close to the application in our messaging as we can. It is where we, quite frankly, live and breathe.</p><p>So if you look at it, it is our new tagline. I think Manny talked about our new vision, which is applications without constraints. The mission, and this is resonating to everybody in the field, is deliver the most secure, fast and available applications to anyone at anytime.</p><p>And then really the difference -- and I talked about this earlier -- the difference in the brand and what we are doing from a marketing perspective is really to go out and talk about the software-defined application services. And that is really what I was talking about with applications consume services that are provisioned to the application, irregardless of where it lives, and then riding that elastic fabric, so no application is left behind. That is a tremendous difference, specifically when you are a CIO that has got 2000 or 3000 applications and you have got 100 covered right now.</p><p>And if you look at the economics of what it costs to build those services and compliance and other regulatory things in those applications themselves, they would much rather bring them off to a fabric and let the applications serve -- or the server serve and the application do its job.</p><p>The other thing we have done -- I am not sure if you have seen this in the room, but over the last couple of quarters, we have really done a lot of thought leadership work, where we have been in Fortune, we have been running ads in Forbes, we did Hemispheres, we were in USA Today. And this is a little bit different for F5 than we have done in the past, and you will see more of that thought leadership focus throughout 2014.</p><p>I am going to spend a second about digital marketing. When you look at marketing, the trends in marketing today -- and I tell this story about buying a car. And I went out and did all the research buying the car -- I am sure you all live this as well -- you pick the car you want. I did it all online and I was a fully educated buyer, all the way down to the price, the color, the features I wanted and walked into a dealer, and then I was prepared to talk to a salesperson.</p><p>And that is what is happening today, is our audiences are becoming a lot more educated. They are being a lot more knowledgeable before they are wanting to bring in a channel partner or bringing in one of our F5 reps or one of our partners, if that is the way we are going to be doing the engagement.</p><p>So we have got to be a lot better at our digital marketing focus. So we have actually put a lot of emphasis on the strategy for 2014 to really differentiate ourselves from a digital marketing perspective. We believe we will be one of the biggest lead-generating -- the way we have done it, anyway -- engines that we have got throughout 2014. So I am going to show you what the new digital marketing strategy looks like and the work that we have done around the digital marketing aspect and the strategy.</p><p>So right now, customers, like I had said before, they don't go out and do a search on our website and say, I think a couple of BIG-IPs will help me solve this DDoS problem. They might. But we will do a much better job on SCO to be able to show up on the Googles of the world and be able to get linked to the reference architectures or the business problems our customers are facing. So when they come out and they do a search for DDoS,. we actually show up at the top end of it. And this is very, very unique. When we click -- or that customer clicks on DDoS, yes, I have a DDoS problem -- I don't know who F5 is, but I do have a DDoS problem -- we are going to actually land them right on the reference architecture page. So it doesn't take to the Company profile, it doesn't take him to the exec bio, it doesn't take them -- it takes them right to their business problem. So those 11 reference architectures and the rest -- the 10 or 15 that will follow behind it will be completely linked in to our SCO optimization to land them right on that reference architecture page, to try to help the customers become educated on their business problem, before they ever have to talk about a BIG-IP or a TMOS or anything else.</p><p>So the other thing we have done -- and many of you in the room may know this -- we have a very, very strong digital marketing service right now called DevCentral. And DevCentral has over 120,000 members that exchange technical information, solutions, iRules; it is a very, very vibrant community of developers and customers from F5 that really gets deep on the technical side of things. But it was a separate property that with -- DevCentral is a little bit separate then everything we have done.</p><p>We made the strategic decision to leverage DevCentral more to not make it salesy, but to bring it into the fold for its one face to the customer. And I will show you what that looks like. So I have got a DDoS issue. Now what we are doing is we are actually bringing in -- and you can see at the bottom -- we are bringing in the DevCentral link so the environment of DevCentral. So when a customer comes in and learns about our DDoS solutions, kind of get it -- now what is this community for DDoS. Now I am curious about this; I am going to land there. It takes some right to the reference architecture page of DevCentral, where there is this vibrant community talking about DDoS problems, talking about how they solved their problems with F5, talking about iRules, exchanging information and ideas. It makes a much more powerful experience for the customer. It probably gives them a little bit more confidence that F5 has got a very robust solution around DDoS. So that is one thing we are doing strategically, is to try to take the DevCentral information and the participants of DevCentral and bring them into the fold of our digital marketing aspect. I think that is going to make a major difference.</p><p>The other thing we are doing is we are changing the entire look and feel of F5.com. And I am going to show you a couple of snapshots. This will release in January. So the Synthesis landing page is there today. That will be a bridge through January. In January, we will have the big unveiling; giving you a sneak peek at this. But you can see DevCentral at the top, we're now combining these properties.</p><p>We have other properties I didn't put on this slide, things like iHealth and AskF5, which are knowledge databases on the support side or how is my system performing. Those are also separate properties that we are now starting to bring into this environment, so it is one pane of glass or one digital experience for the customer. It will also show you the robustness of what F5 is and how many problems and business solutions we can solve.</p><p>Take a look at those reference architectures; there's a very good chance when somebody is referencing or researching one problem, they will stumble onto other reference architectures and it will expand our reach within that customer.</p><p>But here is a screenshot of our digital -- front page of the new F5.com. And you can see that we will create a slider environment that as people come into the environment, underneath the engine -- or the engine that runs F5.com, we have actually put a lot of technical capabilities on things like understanding who you are, understanding where you are going, a lot of reporting and analytics. So we can capture that as part of our lead process.</p><p>And then as we look through the sliders, what we are doing is we are doing targeted information specific to the user. And I will show you something I am really excited about, which is here. Once we understand who you are, we can actually start serving up data to what you care about. So let's say you come from the medical facility, you log in with us, you become an active participant at F5.com. You now have the ability -- or when you come to the site, we will actually recognize -- oh, you are medical -- you care about medical information. Or for you guys, there is also the Wall Street here, financial. So we have a financial vertical. And we will be doing more of this vertical messaging with the digital marketing campaign.</p><p>But we think this is where the customers will become educated, they will spend a lot of time, they will be living on the reference architectures, which gives our partners and our reps a much more intelligent way to interface with a customer because the customer is much more educated on these reference architectures. So going past product and features and moving into business outcomes and solutions.</p><p>So that is what really it is about for 2014, is really promoting the leave no application left behind, the Synthesis SDAS model, really going deep with our partners on the SDN side from a joint marketing campaigns. In fact, we are already talking about how do we engage and what is the strategy around different shows, what is our different messaging, how do we take it on the road, how do we advertise around this. So it is much more than just a handshake marketing engagement. So the go-to-market from the reference architecture as being tip of the spear.</p><p>And then migrating through 2014 into the campaign structures around reference architectures, generating more reference architectures for my group to be able to expand out what Manny talked about and support the TAM. And then moving into the entire aspect of the digital marketing.</p><p>And again, not leaving you with the fact that our reps and our channel partners have the ability to use these reference architectures to move in and out of the Synthesis vision to solve business opportunities.</p><p>And then lastly, closing with the fact that we have got a lot of customers that have a lot of apps that are not sitting in front of BIG-IPs, that in the future with Synthesis and SDAS will open that up. So it is not only a customer acquisition for new customer acquisition, but it is also an opportunity to go back to our installed base and expand that discussion, and then bring in the rest of the reference architectures.</p><p>So with that said, we have got about a 10-minute break that follows me. I would like to thank you for your time and you can go ahead and go on break.</p><p>(Break in progress).</p><p>DAVE FERINGA, EVP OF WORLDWIDE SALES, F5 NETWORKS, INC.: I'm going to go ahead and get started and if people out in the hallway want to hear what I have to say they will come in, I'm sure. My name is Dave Feringa; I am the EVP of Worldwide Sales for F5. I've been with F5 for nine years; I've been in the current job running worldwide sales for about a year and a half. Prior to that I ran the Americas theater for F5. So just a brief background on me.</p><p>So my presentation is really going to -- there are going to be two major parts to it. The first part, I'm going to talk briefly about overall sales strategy, markets that we are going after, how we are leveraging our direct team channels, business development, etc.</p><p>And in the second part of my presentation I'm really going to focus on key wins. These are customers that bought and implemented F5 technology over the past year, talk about the customer's business challenge, why they bought F5. I think you will find in almost all the cases the customer found that they can deploy multiple services on our platform and the cost efficiencies that help them roll out their services and build this infrastructure were significant and it was a key reason why we won business. So, we'll give you some examples -- service provider, banking, federal, etc.</p><p>So I will just start with an update on our sales headcount growth. So we continue to grow the sales team, we added about 75 people over the last 12 months. I will tell you that we are aggressively hiring right now. We are aggressively hiring all roles -- sales roles, engineering roles, channels, inside sales, etc.</p><p>Last year one of the things that we did strategically is we did uptick our hiring on engineers. As we add salespeople and cut territories we want to make sure that they have access to engineering talent. And that is a big part of our strategy as we are talking to customers about consolidating multiple services and multiple parts of their infrastructure. They obviously want to do proof of concepts, they want to have technical deep dives and to enable that we need to have technical resources in the field. So that was a big part of what we did over the past 12 months and what we'll continue to do in FY14.</p><p>So Manny and Dean talked some about this, but from a sales perspective these are the key growth areas, the growth drivers that the sales team is focused on. First of all the application explosion; applications are continuing to grow. And as a Dean had mentioned in one of the banks that he met with just recently, they have [50,000] applications. And usually only a small minority of those applications are getting the services that they require. So we see a big opportunity not only within our existing accounts but also to go into new accounts and talk to them about how we can provide optimization security availability services to those applications.</p><p>Security is going to be a huge market for us this year and beyond. Last year we did a very, very good job training the sales team and selling security, our security business ramped up very nicely. We are really excited about this. One of the areas I see in FY14 that is going to be a new business for us in security is service provider. We are in some very large roof of concepts right now in the service provider space. They look very good and we think that this is going to be a market as service providers need to protect their networks from the proliferation of mobile devices that are out there. We think this is going to be a very big market and a key driver for us.</p><p>LTE and mobility is exploding. I think Manny talked about the signaling tsunami, I think he called it, that is happening. With our Traffix acquisition we can really provide great technology to help customers handle that signaling explosion. At the same time CGNAT, [TEM], traffic steering, other areas are also really important to the service provider and mobility market. So we are very excited about going after that business.</p><p>Cloud is going to be a big driver for us; we announced yesterday the hourly billing on AWS that John talked about a little bit, that will continue to grow. We are talking with multiple other cloud providers about similar types of services. One of my examples in my key win is actually one of the real big cloud guys, and I will give you a flavor for why they decided to implement on the F5 platform.</p><p>And then lastly certainly not least is just the Cisco opportunity. There is still a lot of ACE product out there that is available for us to upgrade. And it is not just upgrading the ACE devices to an F5 ADC; after we do that we are able to go in and talk about multiple other services that we can layer on.</p><p>We announced a partnership with Cisco last week; I can tell you the sales forces very excited about that. And I think that partnership will just -- will only help us in terms of going after the ACE replacements, the ACE boxes that are out there and upgrading them to F5.</p><p>This is just some high-level strategies on going to market. So, first of all, from a direct sales force perspective, as I said, we're going to continue to invest in hiring. We are very, very aggressively hiring all roles. We're going to put an extreme focus on training for the synthesis as well as all the reference architectures that were mentioned earlier.</p><p>Last week we had our international sales conference, it was in San Diego and the entire sales conference, all the breakout sessions, etc., were really about getting the sales team educated and excited about the reference architecture and synthesis vision and I can tell you that the sales team is really, really excited about this. We think it is a great strategy for us and one that our customers are going to readily adopt.</p><p>Major focus on pipeline development. Dean talked a lot about how we are going to market in terms of leveraging the reference architectures, what we're doing online. I actually have a guy on my team, his only job is to help work with each of the theater VPs and work with marketing and be the interface to drive pipeline growth.</p><p>One of the things that we have done is we have invested in some tools. And what's great about these tools is as we get leads for marketing it actually scores how relevant those leads are. And so the sales teams know who to call on higher priority and we can get much more granular in calling people that are most interested in F5 products.</p><p>And we're going to put a big focus on selling professional services this year. What we are finding is that these implementations, when you are launching multiple services on an [ADC] platform, to successfully put those in and make them work well we want to sell professional services. And we're going to make that a big part of every sales campaign that we do.</p><p>So from a channel perspective we are going to do a few things. First of all we are very focused on increasing the certifications, both sales and technical, within the channel organization. Security, we are going to continue to recruit security VARs. Many of these security VARs are trusted advisors with customers on what the security strategy is. We've got a vault program that gives them incentives for selling security.</p><p>We have a Guardian program. And I know Julian is going to be following me and he's going to talk a bit about Guardian. But Guardian is essentially a very handful of partners out there that have gone through very rigorous certifications that can help augment our professional services. So these Guardian partners, and there's only a handful globally, can also provide the high-level professional services that F5 can.</p><p>And obviously the one thing that we always measure the channel on is their ability to drive incremental new business -- not only new opportunities within existing accounts but we measure new customers that they bring to F5.</p><p>And then from a business development perspective, we're going to put a lot of focus on these software defined data center partners. We're really excited, as I said, about the Cisco announcement; we think there's going to be some excellent go-to-market opportunities with that. We've got -- had a number of very, very good meetings with VMware as well and other SDM providers, so we think this is going to provide us some lift in the sales force to go after some new customers.</p><p>Service provider, our strategy in service provider has always been to leverage the large integrators, the big guys like the Ericsson's and then kind of the mid-tier guys like the GENBAND's, the Sonus', etc. So typically we are a part of an overall solution that those customers, those companies roll out to the service providers. Cloud certainly going to be a big focus.</p><p>And then one thing that we have done a really good job with over the years that we'll continue to leverage is working with our technology partners. Those are companies like Oracle, Microsoft, SAP, etc. We have got use cases, we have got white papers, the sales teams when they see, for example, in Microsoft as they see an exchange opportunity we've got a whole bunch of literature, in some cases we even partner with a Microsoft team to go and talk to that customer about how F5 can really help them with their exchange deployment. And the same is true for Oracle and others.</p><p>And then last but not least, system integrators -- we work a lot with the big guys, IBM, HP, DiData -- these guys actually have been very helpful in the Cisco upgrade. Many of those guys have put in the Cisco infrastructure and now we are working with them to provide an upgrade path for those ACEs that are no longer in sales.</p><p>Okay, so now I'm going to focus on some of the key wins for FY13. So I thought would start with a federal win. As we all know, the federal government is going through quite a serious situation right now. And if you are going to successfully sell to the federal government you better be able to show them ways that they can be more efficient and the ways that they can save money. And you better be able to show them how they can do it securely as well.</p><p>So this agency had a very typical problem that we see. They had really built their infrastructure based on sprawl, they just added on and added on and added on and added on, and they just had a very significant device sprawl going. And it made it very difficult for them to troubleshoot problems; it made it very difficult for them to operate and it wasn't secure. So they needed to change their strategy.</p><p>So what they decided to do was to build a private cloud and to really reduce the device sprawl, reduce their points of presence from over 600 down to about 15 and then provide ruthless security on those 15 points of presence. A big area for them as well as they wanted to make sure that they had very strong application level security in addition to layer 2, layer 3 security.</p><p>So we have been talking to this customer for a while, and they ended up going with F5 for a couple of different reasons. First of all, our VIPRION technology met their needs very, very well. There are two main reasons why VIPRION met the requirements. First of all, they know that this private cloud that they are building will not only meet their needs today, but they are looking to bring in other agencies in the future.</p><p>And so what is nice about the VIPRION technology is that they have a lot of open slots and they can just slide in blades as they grow. So it gives them kind of a pay as you grow type of model. So it makes it very easy for them to expand and grow as their requirements grow.</p><p>The second thing they like about it is that the VIPRION provides them a level of reliability. If one of the blades goes out it is architected so that the other blade can take on the traffic so they like that level of reliability. And one of the key requirements was application service module, which is our Web application firewall. As I said, that was a key requirement for the business.</p><p>So in the government world you deal with this thing called an RFP all the time. And so, when the RFP was written we were really in the best position because we could provide chassis-based blade type solutions with Web application firewall that allows them to do the consolidation. So, one of the things we liked about this deal is they -- not only was it $7.5 million, which is a very, very large opportunity.</p><p>But they bought 30 of our 8 chassis VIPRION's and they just put two blades in each of those VIPRION's, so there is roughly 180 slots that they can fill over time. So there is lots of opportunities to grow. And from talking to the account team, they do see other agencies plugging into this architecture and I think there's going to be a lot of growth for F5 on top of this -- on top of the $7.5 million.</p><p>So this win is with a major bank, this win started off as a classic ACE replacement opportunity. Many of the large banking customers typically they have an IT organization that almost -- access an internal service provider to the different business units. In this case this $4.6 million deal was for really just one business unit that they were serving. And some of the requirements were first of all they needed 2K SSL keys by the end of 2013. The Cisco ACE could not handle that; they can only do 1K.</p><p>The other thing is that the banks are trying to SSL everything, right, and so they really needed a platform to scale. The Web application firewall for this specific business unit was a hardcore requirement. They were actually looking at one of our competitors just for Web application firewall. And obviously in the banking environment, as many of you probably know, you have to show cost efficiencies and cost cutting, that is a big part of what is happening in many of the large financial institutions.</p><p>So for this business unit we met the needs better than anybody. One of the key drivers was that not only can we provide the upgrade to the ACE and the SSL infrastructure that they needed, but on the same platform they can do a Web application firewall. So they are able to consolidate services.</p><p>And what is even more exciting about this deal is that they're actually looking really hardly at our AFM firewall module. We are in proof of concept with them right now on that and I think there's a good chance that will also get layered in. And so, the customer had excellent CapEx and OpEx savings.</p><p>And one final thing I will say is that we've invested in these international technology centers, there is one in London, when in New York, one in Seattle; we're in the process of building one in Singapore. And the fact that we have these ITC's allows them to do the proof of concept much faster -- kind of brings F5 closer to our customers. So you don't have to fly to Seattle for everything. And it really helped us get this opportunity up and going, tested, so the customer felt real comfortable with it.</p><p>I'll (technical difficulty) that they've done 4,000 hours of professional services. There are tons and services that have been sold with this deal. And the other thing I will say is that this customer -- I mean this was just one deal for $4.5 million (technical difficulty) actually the last 12 months we have done a heck of a lot more than that with them, actually over $10 million with this customer. So we think there's a lot of room to grow.</p><p>Okay, this is a key win within the cloud space. So this is a key cloud provider and their business problem was this -- a year ago as they were going to market and they are trying to compete with the Amazon's and the Bluelock's and the other ones out there, they are going with very much a hardware-based infrastructure. And so, it was very costly. And it was making them not competitive.</p><p>And so, they were losing a lot of business and even when they won business they were usually taking it at a loss because, again, their infrastructure and the way they were deploying infrastructure per customer was just too expensive. So they decided to go to a virtual environment to cut the cost, maintain the same level of services and also be a little more agile as well.</p><p>So the account team worked with them for a number of months, and one of the things that the customer really liked about F5 is that not only could they deploy our virtual edition, which is our software-based solutions, not only could they provide that just for the common LTM ADC services, but they could also off the same platform provide security service as well and go to their customers with multiple services at a very, very cost-effective price point.</p><p>SAML, single sign on, was an absolute key requirement for them and we were the only vendor that could provide that. The other thing that was very interesting is that one of the reasons they went with F5 is because we have a very strong brand within the enterprise. So as they are going after enterprise accounts they can say, well, we are standardized in F5, we know you are as well, so as you pump some of your applications to us we are on the same infrastructure.</p><p>EAL4 occasion was important that allows them to go after the federal business. EAL4 is just one of the security certifications that you have to get if you are going to compete for certain types of business either globally or with the federal government. And last we integrated well with their provisioning system. So this was a nice $2 opportunity, we will grow as they grow.</p><p>So this is a win with a major Fortune 50 Company, it was APM, which is our access policy manager. The customer's business problem was this, they had deployed 120 SSL VPNs out there globally and these appliances could only supply their end-users, their customers, their contractors with just network only access. So once you are on the network you have access to all the applications.</p><p>They wanted to provide much more granular policy based on who the end-user is, based on what the business unit they're part of, based on where they are located. And they also wanted to do something that was much more cost-effective than managing 120 appliances globally.</p><p>So we worked with them very closely, some of their requirements were they wanted to be able to handle exchange through this device, they wanted to be able to handle VDI, they also wanted network access and they also wanted very specific application access.</p><p>We went through the proof of concept with them; we were the only product that could do this for them. They went from over 120 SSL VPN appliances to 20 F5's. And as you can see, there was mostly VIPRION's. Again, they bought VIPRION's for the same reason I mentioned earlier, the ability to scale and for the reliability aspects.</p><p>For some of the smaller countries they did buy the 4200 appliance, but major cost savings -- they're leveraging LTM as well because LTM has geolocation services built into it. And so, we can actually make a decision if that end-user is coming in from St. Louis then they can take them to the closest data center or the most available data center to them.</p><p>So it took us two weeks to do the proof of concept. This is rolled out and deployed and it is been a very good opportunity for us. We think we will see much, much more of this as the aging of the SSL infrastructure that is out there -- we have a lot of opportunities to go after similar customers that are in similar situations.</p><p>So I'm going to give you an opportunity to talk about a Traffix win. This was with a major Tier 1 global carrier. This global carrier operates in multiple countries. They are rolling out LTE. They see the oncoming signaling storm that is going to happen as they go roll this out in all of their countries. And so, they needed to really handle and provide how they provide signaling from these LTE devices to their core network elements.</p><p>So they also wanted to provide a single solution for all of the countries that they operate in. And they had a hard requirement, there are some new international roaming regulations that are being rolled out and they needed to make sure that they can meet those requirements.</p><p>So what's interesting about this deal is that we won it on a pure what I will -- in sales we call it a frontal approach. We just had a much better product and a much better solution than anybody else out there. And we were competing with Ericsson, Huawei, Tekelec, a number of the real big guys. And when they rolled out all their requirements we met them better than anybody.</p><p>Similar to the example I gave before, we leveraged our international technology centers to do the proof of concept. And when they looked at the product's performance and they looked at the way that we could deploy services in those countries, it was a no-brainer for them to go with us. So this was a great win.</p><p>I want to add -- I don't have a slide on this, but last night we just found that we won another Tier 1 carrier. We got an order for over $1 million. And we are really excited about the momentum that we are seeing in that Traffix business.</p><p>So this is another service provider win leveraging our technology, the PEM technology, the policy enforcement module. This customer was an existing F5 customer, they have leveraged us for LTM, they have leveraged us for traffic steering, they actually leveraged us for firewall as well.</p><p>Their business problem they were trying to solve was kind of an interesting one; at least I thought it was interesting. They wanted to make sure that during times of network congestion that the end-user could still have a really good expense, especially with video. That said, during times when the network was not congested, they wanted to make sure that they did not leverage their video optimization technology because doing that reduces the number of bytes that goes over their network, and if you reduce the number of bytes you charge less.</p><p>So they really needed and enforcement point that could look and analyze at the data, the end-user data, the network congestion data and then apply policy. And that is exactly what the PEM module is doing here is that it is actually doing deep analysis of a number of factors and making policy decisions on when to turn on or turn off video optimization.</p><p>What is interesting about this deal is that they had an F5 infrastructure, but to enable the PEM capabilities they upgraded their F5 infrastructure, the upgraded it to the VIPRION technology and they've now got PEM rolled out throughout their architecture. So good win leveraging the policy enforcement module.</p><p>And I believe this is my last one and this is probably one of my favorite wins from the past year. So, this is a major financial services company and they are -- they were not an F5 customer, as a matter of fact, they were both Citrix and Cisco for ADC and they actually were Citrix for their Web application firewall.</p><p>So our first foray into this account was to upgrade their Citrix Web application firewall. And so, the sales team was in there, we are competing for the business, definitely have product leadership in this space. But the customer was like, you know what, yes, we think you have a better product but all my operations staff, my provisioning systems are all based on Citrix, I don't want to retrain those people. And so we were struggling in the opportunity. We hadn't lost it but we were definitely struggling, to be frank.</p><p>At the same time the account team found another opportunity in another part of their business. And this opportunity was more of a traditional ADC opportunity. The customer's business problem was that they had deployed Oracle and they needed to replicate Oracle over multiple data centers. And they were looking for their ADC infrastructure to handle that. And the current Citrix and Cisco infrastructure could not handle it.</p><p>So the customer was looking at having to spend $4.3 million in additional product, licenses, etc., to enable this replication. Well, our account team got in there, system engineer sat down and over a couple of days got really in depth requirements of exactly what they were trying to do.</p><p>And then we went back and we wrote an [i-roll], and we wrote an i-roll, we tested it out and the customer found, hey, we can handle this Oracle business, they don't have to buy the $4.3 million worth of stuff. And they were like, okay, you are in, we are going to give you the ADC business.</p><p>Well, the account team said that's great, let's go talk about that Citrix Web application firewall that you have that you are trying to upgrade. You can just light up software licenses to enable ASM and we can do that for you as well. And the customer side, that is a no-brainer. And so, we are now their standard for not only Web application firewall, but for also ADC. And it was -- this is a customer point, one of their comments is that we are going to put F5 TMOS in all layers of the network.</p><p>So that is all that I have. I would like to introduce Julian Eames who is our EVP of Business Operations and he is going to talk to you about services and some other things. Thank you.</p><p>JULIAN EAMES, EVP OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS, F5 NETWORKS, INC.: Good morning. As Dave says, I'm going to give you an update on the services business. I'm going to take a couple of slides just to go through a couple of things that happened in 2013 and then look toward the plans for 2014.</p><p>So on the highlights slide starting on the left hand side there with customer satisfaction, still maintained a very high score out of 10 with all our customers. This is purely for the support center and the reactive services that we provide. I could also put up the consulting service's satisfaction scores which are higher than that and there is a healthy competition between the two organizations within F5.</p><p>The revenue in the middle there, $682 million over the year, 22% growth year on year, very, very proud of that. We like to think we maximize every dollar we can after services. But at the same time our philosophy absolutely is every service we provide is to help us to sell more product. So we're not trying to be a services organization for the sake of it and you will see through the course of the rest of the presentation how our services have wrapped back to the marketing and product sales methodology and flow.</p><p>And then in terms of health, we grew the deferred balance for maintenance up to $519 million at the end of the year.</p><p>Operationally we did a number of things as well that we are very pleased with. On the top left there, University of Phoenix, we now introduced F5 and ADCs within their course curriculum, so we are starting to see new students get trained on where our applications fit, which has been completely missing in the marketplace. This is a slow burn, but we hope to see more and more people in the future come out with knowledge of what our areas of the market is about.</p><p>At the same time we caught up with the certification that we have been rolling out over the year. This has been a huge investment in terms of getting to a point where we can give both classes and tests to both customer engineers, to partner engineers and our own engineers to identify their level of capability and their level of knowledge. This flows through and replicates every part of this product offerings that we have. So we have security specialists, we have service provider specialists and so on and those courses and tests reflect that.</p><p>And it is a very key point when we come to the Guardian program. We, in the course of 2013, created a beta with a number of partners around the world to develop a professional services program for them. And we wanted to make sure we just didn't come out with a vendor only solution that we are very happy with and the partners would just ignore.</p><p>So we spent a good amount of time, probably six to nine months, working with partners, developing a systematic approach whereby we are helping them with leads in terms of professional services, we are helping them manage where they can get business and at the same time ensuring that they are capable and then telling our end-users that we give them the tick in the box to say we believe they are capable versus those partners that haven't invested in F5.</p><p>Added to that, we provide a number of services to them -- early training, getting involved in NPI so they know where the product roadmap is going and the technical capabilities therein.</p><p>And then lastly on the right there, Traffix. Dave talked about a number of the wins we have had there. A year ago we inherited 14 people who were doing both professional services around the world and then taking a pager home at night and running the support at the same time. When some of your partners have more people on an account than we have people in F5, they got a bit shocked by seeing the same people and hearing the same people over and over again.</p><p>So we have managed over the year to integrate it into our whole services organization, split out support so we can run seven by 24 across the globe for support for those clients and then at the same time provide consultants on-site to help implement the traffic solution because typically this takes three to six months to do and typically we don't get to revenue until acceptance. So it is in our interest to move that along as quickly as possible.</p><p>In terms of revenue, that is the graph over the last five or six years. So you can see a progression that we are very pleased with. And then deferred maintenance revenue, again you can see good progression, no slowing down as you would expect over the course of the last couple of years. But again, a good indicator of what we think we'll do in terms of revenue for next year.</p><p>We believe that we are maximizing just about every maintenance dollar we can. There is still small amounts of room for improvement, but these are the percentage of attach rates of maintenance we get off every new product sale. So you can see in the high 90s just about everywhere other than EMEA and we keep working there and it is typically the Middle East where we have the most work to do.</p><p>And then aging, we average over the last three years and then beyond three years out as well what our renewal rate is at the same time. And these are industry-leading numbers, we are very, very pleased with these. We work with not just our own internal renewal team, but we also work with outsource people such as Service Source and Concentric. And when we talk to them and look at best practice in the industry, they keep telling us that we have the highest renewal rate of all the vendors that they use. But we also continue to listen because the more we can improve the better. But we think this is a maximized number.</p><p>We talked about customer satisfaction earlier in terms of support, but that really is just the tip of the iceberg. If we just focused on our reaction how quickly we can get to problems, that is good but that really doesn't tell the whole story. When you've got a client who wants high availability and they want 5 9's of uptime, that gives me five minutes a year to respond. Even if I had (inaudible) sat on top of the box we couldn't respond that quickly, we couldn't get to an answer.</p><p>So everything we do is aimed at getting those implementations as clean and as robust upfront with operations, plans for the client and his staff or her staff so they understand when there is an issue what data we need. How to set up the high availability, how to set up the fabric, this is the key piece. And when I look at this example 5 9's isn't just something that the Company wants, it is something they bonus their own team on. So the individuals we are working with really care about that because that depends on what they're going to take home at the end of a quarter or end of a year. So it is very personal to them as well.</p><p>What we found with a couple of large major institutions both this side of the Atlantic and overseas is the more we do upfront the more we define what their responsibility is, what our responsibility is, what they're going to do in terms of a migration, what we are going to do in terms of a migration, the more successful that migration is.</p><p>And when I look at this particular example, and it references back to one that Dave gave you earlier, the quicker we can migrate all their ACE pairs to an F5 pair the quicker they can start to use the other services that we have. So consumption is key if we want to continue to build in that account and grow more business out of that account.</p><p>To quote the CTA yesterday who I met, we want to get to 2006, we want to get to straight load balancing, that is table stakes. Then we can start adding additional services on. So that is why our services are in place to help the client move across. Because in most of these ACE shops they only have Cisco skills, they don't have F5 skills and they don't have the time to go away and go and be trained and get the experience. So they need us to augment them both in the existing migration and also for the initial period of time going forward.</p><p>Going back to synthesis and the simplified business model. In terms of good, better, best we are rolling out both services and pricing that match that motion in terms of sales, but also putting together that match the reference architectures and the services provided.</p><p>And then within the utility pricing and AWS we have a new challenge for us, because we can't build the same infrastructure for somebody who is just buying an hour's license. So we are really developing the ask F5 and the [iHelp] tools and chat so that we can get to the clients quicker and information quicker, but at a much lower cost than we do with a traditional support center.</p><p>This then reflects the reference architecture that both Dean and Manny talked about earlier. And you will see as we build out architecture, implementation, maintenance and optimization services (technical difficulty) to the partner technical community will all be based on the reference architectures as well. So there is a base product level of knowledge we expect and then we try to specialize on top of that piece.</p><p>Additionally, our professional services packages that we put together, again trying to make it as simple as possible for both ours and the channel salespeople to sell those services, will be based on the reference architecture. So fixed prices, fixed amount of resource and so they know exactly what they are getting and how to sell it.</p><p>We talked a little bit about how we are developing for the utility market place but ASKF5 continues to grow its usage, over 2 million users in the last quarter, 311,000 unique visitors. So this is new people to F5 coming to find out about how pieces of the F5 technology work. We've integrated that with iHealth which is a service allows us to diagnose problems quicker, allows us to look at a client's configuration run heuristics against it and identify issues upfront.</p><p>It is also available to the clients to run themselves. So they can look and see if they have got cookie-cutter implementations, the one unit here and one unit in Singapore absolutely does match. Because time and time again you see just little drifts in configuration that can make the real difference when it comes to issues. And then again, linked into DevCentral. As Dean said, all the landing pages will look identical, all of them link back to each other. We can help a client from writing an iRule all the way through to running a heuristic to make sure that iRule will work (inaudible) of a configuration and that system will continue to run smoothly.</p><p>Expanding our reach is probably the biggest issue that I wrestle with today. We've expanded the number of professional services engineers we've had partly because of Traffix. When I look at Traffix, we are going to grow that team probably by another 60 people in the course of 2014 partly through getting the consumption of our product to on the [synthesized] product.</p><p>If we just went for pure headcount we would just grow and grow and really struggle to find those people. So that is why we invested in the Guardian program. This year have been part of the corporate growth plan and sent out from 2014; we have put that responsibility out into the local field into the local both channel managers and services managers. It is a [handful] today, it is 25 partners, we want to at least double that and our goal is to try and triple that through the course of 2014. The more capable partner engineers there are out there the quicker we can sell more product.</p><p>At the same time we also look to the bench program, hiring consultants from a vendor that does not sell product at all, training those consultants, but only paying from when we use them. So we can expand our reach much more quicker but have the flexibility of not having people on our books at the same time. So we have got our bench partners both in Europe and in North America and we are expanding that out into Asia Pac as well.</p><p>And additionally, we don't want to travel to every site. We live in the world of the Web, we want to provide a lot of these services remotely. So more and more this year you will see implementation services being offered remotely only. Why spend two days traveling to do a two day install. You are going to halve your efficiency that way.</p><p>We believe we can up the revenue, lower the cost by doing it and we believe for most of our customers this will be acceptable, so we are pushing that piece as well. And you'll also see a bit later in terms of managed services some of the thoughts we have in that arena.</p><p>So these are our plans for 2014. As I said, Guardian pushing out to the field, trying to expand by three times as many engineers out there. Making them very much a part of the F5 community, giving them early access to both training and knowledge and where the product is going. Giving them authorization to talk and work with customers. Giving customers good confidence in who those engineers are.</p><p>UNITYNet is a new program that we developed out of Europe and is our way of managing the partners. At the moment we are not going to set benchmarks for clients, but we are going to start giving all those partners access to the information of what business they are doing with F5. What is their renewal rate? How often are they inside the right quarter for that renewal? How many of their engineers are certified? How many of their engineers are going and doing consulting revenue? How many leads have we given them?</p><p>And through the course of the year we are going to roll this program out, monitor that, go through [QBRs] with those channel partners. And then slowly either develop and improve or weed some of the weaker ones out. So that is one of the goals for the year.</p><p>On support we are really having to look at developing more and more cost efficient ways of working with a developer. Working with LineRate and AWS is a completely different business model. So we are continuing to push in terms of systems, allowing our clients to get to the information over the Web through chat rather than having to log or call, having an engineer call them back in that business model.</p><p>At the same time we are also opening a new support center in Auckland, this will finally get rid of the (inaudible) view that Singaporean English isn't good enough for them. But also will give us the ability to open the support hours much earlier in the morning. And it is also a very rich vein of technical talent and we found it very easy to hire people there.</p><p>Consulting will continue to grow but, as I said, we're going to keep looking at that reach. So we try and minimize the cost as much as we can, but at the same time we want to help our clients and our sales teams have that product consumed so we can get on to the next deal.</p><p>And at the end there Karl talked about the SoC, that we've inherited with the purchase of Versafe. We are very excited about this both in terms of PD and getting information back on what is going on out there in the security world, but also in terms of services that we can provide to the client. We are going to replicate that SoC very quickly in terms of the end of this quarter beginning of next quarter into North America.</p><p>To allow us to have more closer access to clients in North America we're going to make it part of the ITC demonstration as well so it has access there. But we also see its base infrastructure for us to look at other remote services and software as a service from F5. So there will be more development in terms of that through the course of the year.</p><p>And then lastly, the thing we all care about. We have looked at when clients purchase professional services with product deals. In the past we just looked at the big deals, the ones over $1 million and looked at how those clients purchased going forward. This time we looked at the whole spread of deals from $50,000 up to the multimillions. And then looked at how much product did those clients who purchased consulting services and training buy over the next two years versus those that didn't.</p><p>And consistently we saw within a range of 20% to 40% the clients who bought services upfront bought that amount of extra product going forward. So that is the reason for putting more professional services in place. And with that I would like to hand over to Andy Reinland, the Chief Financial Officer.</p><p>ANDY REINLAND, EVP &amp; CFO, F5 NETWORKS, INC.: Okay, well clearly we are running a very efficient analyst day here. So we are well ahead of schedule. As CFO I like to see that. We are going to -- I'm just going to run through some of the high-level financials, add a little color, I don't think you are going to get any new messaging here. And clearly we don't update the quarter. So as you know, no expectations there. And then will go into Q&amp;A.</p><p>So as we look at this last year, John mentioned at the start of the discussions today and really a tale of two halves, right. A tough Q1-Q2, Q2 probably one of the biggest misses we've experienced as a Company. Just a very tough environment. But then Q3-Q4 really saw growth come, allowing us to push investment -- investing a lot of these drivers that we believe are out there for us, so it felt very good.</p><p>Solid profitability -- I will talk a little bit more about gross margin, but the one thing I want to be very clear about as a relates to our discussion with gross margin, when we talked on the call about investing and consulting and the 50 to 100 basis points, that is on the services side of the margin. On the product side we feel as strong as ever. A lot of questions around are we seeing pricing become more of an issue, potentially pulling down our margin on that side. No.</p><p>If anything I think we see more upside opportunity on that product margin. Historically we have been very conservative about guiding that. And we probably will continue to do so. But we have not seen the change in pricing. If anything our competitive win rates, as we said on the call, are higher than they have ever been. Pricing is an issue. Will we get aggressive with pricing? Sure. If we want to win for strategic reasons we will.</p><p>If we can bundle in software to drive a deal we are going to do that. If we want to throw in consulting, which we're seeing more and more demand for, we are going to do that. But that is really the driver here. That is really the driver here. And then a strong healthy balance sheet, no debt, $1.3 billion in cash.</p><p>We continue with our buyback, I think you will see that be one of the avenues that we push dollars back it out. Over the last two years we have brought share count down by 2 million shares. And in the last 18 months we have purchased three what we believe are very strategic companies, Traffix, Versafe and LineRate. So I think you will see us continue on the M&amp;A front to look at those strategic technologies that we believe we can add to our platform, expand our services and thereby expand our overall market.</p><p>As we look at just year over year, 8% revenue growth, net income and cash flow, some are flat. We wanted to continue investing, we believe in these drivers. And what we learned this last year is when you turn off the hiring machine in today's competitive environment it is very hard to crank it back up again.</p><p>So we want to be really careful with that as we drive forward in the coming year. Will we continue to manage the business as we do watching revenue weekly, comparing it, adjusting the dial? Yes, we will continue to do that, but what we do want to do is put us in the position that we are not constantly bringing in that talent into the organization, that is a primary goal for us.</p><p>Large customer penetration -- so we talk a lot with you about our penetration into the Fortune 500. What we believe is important is how many of those Fortune 500 do we have more than 50 units in, so I'm really talking about the two graphs on the left. We see this as our opportunity with Cisco. They have tremendous account control, that Cisco ACE opportunity is sitting out there. Now as we partner with them we think that opens it up even more.</p><p>Key to that, key to that we believe is having consultants that can go out and really make these implementations go very well. Why? Because we don't just want to replace those ACE blades, we want to sell those follow-on services, consultants are key to that. So we want to make that investment.</p><p>Also with Traffix -- Traffix is a bit of a different business model. It is more longer-term projects with milestones, consultants are key to that. So we are going to invest in that and this is the opportunity we are talking about there.</p><p>Some of our key trends, income statement you see on revenue and op margin. Clearly the Q2 -- Q1-Q2 dip and the pull out of that. I think this shows, along with EPS, kind of the tale of the two halves, as John laid out. But with gross margin overall managing straight through that.</p><p>On the balance sheet side the highlight here really deferred revenue. 80% of that balance is current maintenance. That is the anchor of our revenue for next year. So, and as you see as we executed through the year, still strong growth in the deferred revenue.</p><p>Revenue trends by geography -- really what I'd highlight here, there has been messaging. Cisco announcing yesterday a discussion of emerging markets. For us emerging markets where we are talking Latin America, China, India, Russia, really make up -- last quarter was about 7% of our bookings. We highlighted on the call that for us China is -- we concur with their comments, China in particular, we've just seen that pull back. The other areas actually haven't been that bad. Overall it's small but we'll watch it very closely.</p><p>Headcount -- so we added roughly 325, 11% year-over-year. So a little bit of investing ahead of revenue, knowingly doing that, but we are going to continue to watch it. This is just the breakdown. So our first-quarter targets, we talked about that we see seasonality in our business now, in particular in Q1. So cautious guidance, taking that into account. We reflect on Q2 a year ago, very difficult quarter for us. So some of the positioning that we have given you takes that into account. But again, as we go through it we will manage. Really no more here to highlight.</p><p>So, fiscal 2013 planning assumptions. So really went through this on the call. A couple of key messages out of this is, one, our top priority is and will be product revenue growth. And we will manage the rest of the business behind our expectations on product revenue growth. So when we talk about the gross margin messaging of investing in consulting, maybe seeing the services side of the gross margin pull down, we are going to be watching that. That statement is made in anticipation of topside growth.</p><p>And we will continue to manage the business as closely as we ever have and we will adjust if we need to. We don't think we are going to be, but we will be watching it. The non-GAAP operating margin, with that seasonality we want to continue to invest. We're going to see in the first half a potentially pull down mid-30s. Remember we ended Q4 at 38.1%. So we may see that pull down. And then in the back half where we see even stronger revenue, it will come back up.</p><p>CapEx $6 million to $12 million per quarter. And then our tax rates -- clearly we are good Americans at 38%, 35% GAAP tax rate. So with that I'll bring the rest of the executive team up and we will go into Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: We have got a microphone here, so we're going to move it around the room. So if you would just wait until we get the microphone.</p><p>MARK SUE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Mark Sue, RBC Capital Markets. If I look at the business and what you guys have done in terms of revenue growth, we have seen there are certain points where you were growing at 35%, 31%, 20% and then we finished the year at 8%. Clearly you want to reaccelerate that. And we're just trying to get a sense of what is really helping you and actually hindering you.</p><p>A lot of new technology, security, the fabric, all of those things on DDoS, everything else on the carrier net that is going to help your Traffix. But your base business, do you think that that can actually grow next year? What would be a growth estimate that you feel comfortable, particularly with all the new exciting things that you have, that would be helpful. Without being specific, John, considering that.</p><p>And also balancing that from the law of large numbers, clearly soon you're going to be at the $2 billion mark in revenues that are scaling issues, we're starting to see some of the seasonality. So if you could kind of put that all in together for us that would be helpful. Thank you.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: Yes, I will start and anybody can chip in. But it's really interesting, I mean one of the things I said in the opening was we made a mistake on the product refresh last year. It took too long, won't happen again, the development, are well rid of that as well. Maybe we were even too open about what was coming four to five times of performance. There is no question in our mind now that we saw some (inaudible) going on.</p><p>We feel really good about the way the second half shaped up and where that sits us. Obviously the things like that we are getting bigger, things like that. But when I look at where we are sitting today in terms of -- the phrase I used was tangible drivers -- product refresh, ACE, what we are doing insecurity, that type of area -- I think that as long as we execute you will see the results in that.</p><p>Notice I didn't say the market opportunity was a hindrance, I didn't say competition was a hindrance. I think from an architecture perspective -- in fact I think we have gone from being sort of neutral in the first half of fiscal 2013 where customers were probably looking at what is happening with SDN and architecture and the cloud and all that to the opposite.</p><p>Where we are sitting now it's becoming really clear that we are going to be a big player in all this stuff and I think that goes away as well. So I hope you hear that as a positive asset because that is the way we feel right now.</p><p>MARK SUE: I have a quick follow-up. If I look at the penetration, a lot of your customers are very happy with products that are almost six years old. Is that really the issue here where they (multiple speakers) are happy with it (multiple speakers)?</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: No, I don't think so. In fact, the other thing I think that we made a mistake on was we didn't refresh fast enough. In other words, it is almost five years, Karl, I think since we did the appliance refresh?</p><p>KARL TRIEBES: (Inaudible - microphone inaccessible).</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: Four and a half to five years. We probably should be looking at more of a three-year scenario, that is now an opportunity.</p><p>TIM LONG, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Tim Long at BMO. Just two questions here. First, a lot of talk about partnerships becoming much more important. Maybe if you can just break down for us some of the offsets there. Does that pull in a lot more revenues and is there any kind of margin trade-off in any of those partnerships?</p><p>And then related to SDN and the changing architectures. Are there trade-offs there as well where maybe we are moving into a world where it's more software-based and maybe there is some revenue give back in that transition as well? Thanks.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: Yes, I mean on the partnerships, I don't think there is any margin trade-off that I can see at all. Just -- and the other thing that was pretty clear about this gross margin business, we're talking about more professional services. We absolutely feel really good about our product margins. In fact, I think there is an opportunity there with this good, better, best with the reaction we are seeing from the sales force. And it has been very quick and it has been very, very good. So I feel really good about that.</p><p>The second point was in SDN and the software. Yes, so I will talk about this. Now I don't want to be the only one talking here, but basically it is very much an evolution. I don't think -- it is a revolution over time but it is an evolution from our perspective from a business perspective. We feel so good about where we are with that this whole orchestration engine with BIG-IQ and what it allows our customers to do.</p><p>We have a massive array now of software solutions, so I think we are seeing hybrid sales happen today. So we are embracing that in a big way. But I don't see that as being any sort of revolutionary move that is going to happen. But from a customer viewpoint, to be able to see the synthesis architecture and the roadmap and know where you going I think we are in a really good position now. Manny?</p><p>MANNY RIVELO: The only thing I would add was to the partnership question. These partnerships that you saw -- some of them are classic partnerships we have had like in the application spaces, those aren't relatively -- those aren't new. But on the fabric side, all of those are customer led. I mean when we are partnering companies like VMware, companies like Cisco, it is because the market is demanding that. And that is how they have all been created. So we think there is incredible upside because these are the architectures that the customers want implemented.</p><p>GEORGE NOTTER, ANALYST, JEFFERIES &amp; CO.: George Notter from Jefferies. I guess you guys have been asked this question before, I thought I would ask it again. The security initiative is obviously a piece of the growth opportunity going forward and you guys shared some data I think coming out of fiscal 2012, the $50 million number with the caveats on hardware and services attached, not in that number, but --. And then on fiscal 2013 you gave us a different number, right? I think it was 30% of revenues had some piece of software for security attached. How -- can you give us something that is apples to apples in terms of a comparison to just sort of measure quantitatively in any way how you are actually doing on security?</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: It's really tough to do that, that's a base presentation (inaudible) in (inaudible) where you talk about $4 million deals and $7 million deals and they're running security. We could say that was all security. I think that would be slightly misleading because the customer is doing a number of things with their platform. That is the whole -- the whole strategy is a consolidated platform that can do multiple services.</p><p>So -- and by the way, when you said services wasn't included in that $50 million amount, neither were the systems, or neither was the hardware. So it is obviously much bigger, but really it would be too subjective. We have debated this internally, not that we're trying to hide it, it's almost the opposite. But because our products are doing -- one of the things we hear about is the ADC market maturing.</p><p>I don't know where that comes from, because what we had done with the ADC market is it has been our strategy for over a decade and it has really accelerated in the last couple of years. And the reason we have a $6.5 billion sales addressable market and all the stuff we can sell today into that is because we have increased the ADC market. And the biggest way we have increased it in the last 12 month is security. But giving you a specific number would be so subjective.</p><p>GEORGE NOTTER: Okay, and then just back to Mark's question, you guys obviously expect product growth to be reinvigorated. And however you think about that in terms of the number where it could go over the balance of the year, I mean how do you parse out where that comes from? Again, I'm not trying to pin you down a little bit more here, but --</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: Yes, you are.</p><p>GEORGE NOTTER: -- what component of it would be security, what component would be product refresh, what component would be ACE upgrade? I mean just the professional services investment that sort of flows through the product. I mean just any sense of magnitude at all or piece of that growth that would come from each part?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, it's all good questions but you know we are not going to answer. Specifically I mean other than we are investing to drive the top-line growth, that is what we are going to do. All these additional services, the new pricing that has been talked about here, the good, better, best.</p><p>Actually on the security side that is going to make breaking that out even more complicated, right, because our goal then is going to be driving these large enterprise bundles in the organizations that we can go in and leverage later but give them pricing that encourages them to take it now. So I think that is going to be great for us.</p><p>GEOFF AGUE, ANALYST, BERNSTEIN INVESTMENT RESEARCH: [Geoff Ague], Bernstein. Just in light of your answer on security, how do you come up to your addressable market at $6.5 billion, especially if you actually don't really know how to quantify the contribution to your revenues of an opportunity like security?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So the way we -- the $6.5 billion, the way we did it is we looked at the subcategories of the market. So we provide solutions for DDoS, for example. We provide solutions for Web application firewall. Those are all valid markets, IDC and others, track those markets we have a CAGR on those markets.</p><p>What is very hard, right, as you said it is a $6.5 billion actual market? Yes. From a device perspective it is a $6.5 billion market. However, when you start to look at the architecture and the fact that we can consume multiple services in one device versus multiple devices, that market may not be $6.5 billion, right, because it is in a shift.</p><p>Let's be honest, it is in a shift and architecturally these shifts are occurring just like in the shifts that are occurring in the networking side of the house, right, not every Ethernet port is the same. How do you quantify a V switch versus a physical switch. But from a classic market perspective to give you a number that you could tie off to that is a legitimate number.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: And one thing we are really concerned about is our market opportunity is absolutely not any prohibitor to growth. I mean given the size of the Company to be aiming at that market, we feel really good about that.</p><p>JESS LUBERT, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES: Jess Lubert, Wells Fargo. I want to take another stab at the growth outlook. And if I do the math with respect to your TAM numbers it seems like you believe your opportunity is growing North of 20%. So I want to understand if that was a fair level of product growth to judge you by over a longer period of time. And then I have got a question on synthesis.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: Andy is going to earn his money today.</p><p>ANDY REINLAND: Again, we are not going to put a number on it. But I think you are looking at it from the right angles, right, what we are going to do is go out for, we're going to hire, we're going to hire salespeople and we are going to execute, drive these partnerships to more access, the access that we are going to get to Cisco's base customers. I think it positions us very well.</p><p>JESS LUBERT: Then I wanted to follow up on SYNTHESIS. I just wanted to clarify that all elements of the offering we are shipping, that this is more of a marketing push rather than anything new to the portfolio. And given most customers are early in the process and evaluating SDN architectures, how important of a driver do you believe SYNTHESIS is likely to be in the business over the next 12 months? Does SYNTHESIS extend sales cycles now that you are pitching more of a solution rather than point products? And does SYNTHESIS potentially reopen the door to get back at some of the big tech players who have increasingly been in sourcing ADC functionality.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: There were a lot of questions there. Let me see if I can answer all of them. There is nothing in SYNTHESIS that is not shipping today. So -- and there are some -- a couple of services that I talked about that you might have seen on the diagram that will be shipping in the next release which is the Vancouver release which is scheduled to go out beginning of our next calendar year. Things like Secure Web Gateway as an example, which is a service.</p><p>But everything else is constructed has been constructed around this architecture. So we intentionally wanted to launch something to market that is completely available to our sales organization, to our channel partners and to our customers, that is a done deal. In the sense of it is it going to elongate the sales cycle, I don't think so because we've already been talking to customers about this from an architecture point of view.</p><p>A year ago we started to talk about the concept of an intelligent services platform. And that was the, if you will, precursor to this concept of SYNTHESIS that we have a -- the ADC is a different tool for your architectures. And most customers are getting that. And the sales organization adopted that messaging very well. So this is a logical extension to that. And it fills in the void.</p><p>When we talk to customers about SDN or they ask us should we partner with VMware's NSX platform, should we partner now with Cisco's ACI architecture or others that are out in the industry what they notice is that there is a big void around their 4 through 7 services in the architecture. Yes, they can get an Ethernet faster, and much more dynamically. But what they do know as that without the services their application experience will be poor.</p><p>And to a large degree we have created a great application experience for our customers and they want us to participate in that. So I think SDN it rounds out the portfolio, we have been selling our SDN -- we have an SDN connector, we have been selling that in the market, we are in a lot of betas with a lot of customers, we don't think that is going to extend it. It just solidifies for the network a key component of their architecture, I think strengthening our relationship with the customers. I am not sure if I missed anything.</p><p>Oh, did it change the dynamic in the tech vertical. Well, the LineRate product that we are launching to the market segment can change that dynamic, because they have been building their own proxies, they have been building their own load balance. With the new line rate product that we are bringing to the market, that is to cause point open source and using no JS which brings in a lot of additional value.</p><p>We think that is going to change some of that dynamic in some of the tech vertical. But there is still going to be a moment. There are a couple of people out there in the industry, usually it is some of the larger cloud providers, will build their own load balancer and there is room for that. But it won't span beyond the top customers that are out there, it is too complex of a set of technologies to do that.</p><p>Now what we have done is we presented SYNTHESIS to some of those large cloud providers and it changed the conversation. They want a lot more detail because what they are seeing is that then they have an architecture where it's beyond a load balancer, they can put acceleration services. And some of them are looking at the reference architectures as tools to offer to the market as services, if you will. So we think there's a lot of upside but it is too early to call that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Also, real quick. SYNTHESIS is not dependent on SDN, I just want to make sure that is very clear. It can be done independently use, take a use case like DDoS where you need very large performance numbers for the amount TAC coming in. That could be a SYNTHESIS referenced architecture deployed today that has nothing to do with SDN, we can go into traditional networks as well.</p><p>ITTAI KIDRON, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO.: Ittai Kidron, Oppenheimer. Manny, a question for you. On the pricing the way you have changed your pricing schemes and you said you've talked about how you have reduced the number of SKUs out there, that was one of what was the biggest push backs we got from client that it was always very complicated and very expensive and nobody could start at a small step and grow from there.</p><p>Can you give us a little bit more detail on what is the level of shrinkage now that you have from a SKU standpoint? Also, given the customer's ability to start small and build from there, from a near-term standpoint does it create some sort of a hump you need to go over, is large deals maybe start smaller initially and does like a quarter two phase before it starts filling in.</p><p>So how do we manage that transition? And then lastly, from a competitive standpoint, some of your competitors have been selling for quite some time all you can eat type of plans without charging for extra future. How does this new pricing scheme address that competitive issue?</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: These guys can give you the detail, but one of my measurements was standing at the back when we had 1,000 people plus actually in San Diego last week. And we went through this presentation and the sales force, a bit like you guys, actually, you don't clap that much. It was loud applause in terms of what we had done. You could tell the initial reaction from their simplistic productivity perspective was pretty positive.</p><p>MANNY RIVELO: And just to give you an indication of the shrinkage. First of all we haven't retired any of the SKUs so you could always buy a la cart. But the problem with the a la cart model is we have over 1,100 SKUs and that becomes complex. Do I bundle this with that, and what if I put it on this piece of hardware then these two modules, how it will all work?</p><p>So the new pricing these offers go down to 48 SKUs. With 48 SKUs you could order any virtual addition, any appliance, any chassis and bundle in the right software. So it is very, very simplistic from that point of view. Customers get their head around it. I was with a large financial account on Tuesday night here who actually is one of the use cases that Dave talked about who asked the question, so how do I buy best next. Because they kind of have a better kind of bundle and they want to upgrade to best and true themselves up. So we are seeing that already.</p><p>The activity that we are seeing on SalesForce.com basically quoting systems and things like that indicate that there is rapid movement to adopt these models, the channel wants these models and the pipeline and deal volume is growing at an incremental rate.</p><p>Some of our competitors have done some of this pricing, if you will, and offers the pricing. However, they haven't had traction with service deployment. And what I mean by that is they might have offered the let's say equivalent of best because they bundled it maybe with a VDI solution and they packaged in those elements together as part of the subscription model. But they are using one or two services inside the environment.</p><p>Our success is going to be not only to sell best but our success is going to be that that architecturally gets implemented in different places in the network. That is why we led really hard with reference architectures, why we are leading really hard with services models to make sure that those get consumed and deployed inside the environment.</p><p>So we hope a year from now that they will be talking about good, better, best use cases up here where we solve those kinds of issues. But it really is about taking the friction out and allowing service velocity to solve points of problems in the network.</p><p>ITTAI KIDRON: Do you see the risk though of customers that used to buy best type of pricing model actually going down the scale? I mean, how much of that is a risk in (multiple speakers)?</p><p>MANNY RIVELO: We modeled all of that internally. We think it is going to go in the other direction, right. What we see is there's going to be an upswing. That the reality of it is customers are going to see the incremental of moving to the next level and they're going to see the benefit of the [TCO] associated with that and they are going to supersize, for lack of a better word, themselves.</p><p>ITTAI KIDRON: Very good. And near-term then you don't see this as creating some sort of a lull here as you transition to this model?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, in addition we also created some sales incentives. So the salespeople make more money when they sell best, less money when they sell better and not as much money when they sell good.</p><p>ITTAI KIDRON: Very good, thanks.</p><p>BRIAN WHITE, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Brian White, Cantor Fitzgerald. John, maybe talk a little bit about the Cisco relationship. Obviously in the past they have been kind of the Darth Vader, in your eyes, of the networking industry. And they announced last week you are part of the ACI ecosystem, they are part of your SYNTHESIS ecosystem. So what is driving this, the partnering with Citrix, so on and so forth?</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: Two big things I think, and more but two big things. One is the technology alignment that we have seen with the ACI solutions and ours. We actually demonstrated it at the launch, we demonstrated the ability, just the touch of a button where you basically would deploy -- in fact, load balancer I think was the application under firewall. Touch of a button up it comes. So I mean you are deploying it like that and that is based on the ACI policies, the API connection to us.</p><p>And so, the technology alignment in terms of the way we have done this has been obvious and we are hearing that from Karl's people and from their people. And then the other thing is the alignment in terms of where do we sell together. If you look at -- Citrix is our biggest competitor, by a long way actually and then it drops.</p><p>But in terms of the enterprise and the service provider space, there is massive alignment between us and Cisco. And I went back after being involved in the San Diego office in Cisco, back to the sales force, and the message that we are all getting is get out there, meet your counterparts and start working together. And we are seeing that. And so those are two big things.</p><p>BRIAN WHITE: And does it accelerate kind of the ACE module penetration?</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: I think it does, yes, I think it helps dramatically. Having said that, we've had great success in that so far. I was actually asked the question on the call, I think it was Eric actually, asked about you saw that partnering with Cisco and didn't quite -- if you look at my answer it was pretty vague but the answer was obviously yes, we do. Similarly, we are doing a lot with VMware, a lot of technology alignment with VMware as well. So I think we are in a good position there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: ^ The other data point that -- you guys probably know this data point, but as I share it, if you look at the traditional data center and just the data center and you look at the players inside the data center, we have huge overlap, right, with VMware and with Cisco.</p><p>So to a large degree that is why I said it is customer driven, because they already have these components and they want these components tightly coupled and integrated to deliver this concept of the software defined data center. So we -- our sales organizations want to work together because these customer decisions have been made, now it's about delivering better solutions.</p><p>BRENT BRACELIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES: Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest. Thank you guys for being efficient with your presentation -- allowing more time for Q&amp;A. I have several questions so bear with me. Wanted to start with Dave and then go to Karl. But, Dave, if you look at sales hires headcount it looks like about 28% increase over the last two years, product revenue has increased about 11%.</p><p>You talked about aggressively hiring so how do you look at A, sales productivity. And then B, do you have the right salespeople? Is that where you are aggressively hiring? Do you have to have a different skill set to get into security, to get into service provider, help us understand why you are aggressively hiring now?</p><p>DAVE FERINGA: Well, we -- as I said, one of the areas that we made a big investment was hiring more SEs, because if you hire more SEs it helps make the salespeople more productive. And that one example I gave where the SE spent a couple of days really evaluating the customer requirements and spent a couple of days writing the iRules, we see examples similar to that all over the place.</p><p>So we need to continue not only to hire salespeople and split territories and go after the opportunity in front of us. But at the same time make sure that we give them the right technical resource. We look at sales productivity all the time. I feel very comfortable that we have got the right sales leaders and the right salespeople out there. I mean to be frank there will be some that are load-balancing, pair of HAA load-balancing guys that may not help make the transition for us.</p><p>I will tell you at the ISC, a big part of my messaging to everybody was they need to embrace reference architecture and synthesis selling. We need to up our game a little bit and we are going to give them all the education that they need to do that. The one thing I will say though that we have tracked over the past forever actually, but has really ticked up and gives me a clear indication that the sales force is migrating to selling more strategically is we track software attach rate. And the software is the part of the solution that is strategic and is the services.</p><p>And really over the past two years, and especially over the last four quarters we have seen our software attach rate go up quite nicely. So I feel very comfortable that we have got the right team to enable this new strategy. There may be a few people that we need to -- won't be able to hop onto the boat with us, but I mean that is going to be true in any sales organization at any time.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: And then the other thing, I don't think you said this, but the other thing that we are doing now as a top priority is quota, quota carrying, hiring again. And we sort of had a little bit of a lull there especially in the first half, but we increased the SE's. But now there is a big focus on quota. Now that won't have a massive effect in the next six months, but clearly if we don't do that it could have an effect in a year and then beyond. So we feel really good about the aging profile which has been increasing and that is a big deal, but we do need now to hire more quota.</p><p>BRENT BRACELIN: Okay, fair enough. And then shifting gears to Karl here. Three questions -- one is I appreciate your three vector differentiation on CPU and packet and specialization. But is that also your Achilles' heel relative to being able to deliver product? You have a big Intel, CPU refresh cycle next year with Grantley, that's differentiating on three different vectors. Does that slow your ability to kind of develop product diversity to some of the peers other that might be more just CPU based? And are you considering innovating unto of the three factors for the low end of the marketplace? Help us understand why the next cycle you are not late again.</p><p>KARL TRIEBES: Right. So one of the reasons our refresh cycle wound up being as long as it was on the low end is we were aligning with the Intel release cycle. So we were with the latest processors coming out of the gate. We are aligned with that cycle right now. So typically when you see the new platforms coming we got to the latest and greatest processors. You know what I mean, in fact, we had an announcement -- a joint announcement with Intel when we released the new platforms because we were leveraging their latest and greatest.</p><p>So no it doesn't really impede us. And our cost to produce these platforms and optimize at the same time is better than trying to go buy like standard off-the-shelf metal or a platform from some Chinese ODM or something like our competitors do because we can cost optimize all the way down to the board. So we pick every component, we pick every piece, we know exactly what goes in, so we can keep our COGS very low.</p><p>So if you look at our COGS, we've got best of breed. We were very low down there, that is not the issue. It's mainly just aligning with our suppliers and making sure that we are able to take advantage of their release cycles and be right on the edge of those, Intel is a good example of that.</p><p>BRENT BRACELIN: Helpful. My last two quick ones. LineRate, is that just going to be part of the Amazon marketplace with every other ADC that is out there? Or is there something more strategic that we should think about LineRate and Amazon? And then the second question would be really around BIG-IQ. Can you talk about attach rate, upselling to the installed base? And is BIG-IQ going to be something that half of the installed base will use in the next five years? Or give us some examples on the uptake and opportunity around BIG-IQ.</p><p>KARL TRIEBES: Yes, so, with LineRate, this is the initial -- we are just going to market initially with Amazon because the dev op guys don't want to talk to a salesperson necessarily. What they want to do is have easy access to the technology. So we are making it real easy for them to kind of get used to it and just give it a try.</p><p>Our strategy is one -- like I said, was to integrate with BIG-IP as part of it longer-term roadmap, but also the technology itself is platform independent. So we will be releasing it potentially on standard off-the-shelf [COTs] hardware in addition to our own, that is a platform option right now. But we are -- right now it is very much let's get it out with the tech guys, it is very nascent, it is very early days with it.</p><p>On BIG-IQ, the focus there has been, first of all, getting it into the ecosystem of partners and being able to help us, like I said, kind of complete that FDN fabric and be a part of that. And then there is also focus on being able to support all the modules. We don't support all the modules yet. We are focusing on security initially and then cloud as we go down the lineup.</p><p>I suspect as we go forward with that it is going to become much more vital to customers to leverage BIG-IQ because they want to be able to consolidate centralized managed services. And also do other things like software upgrades, device management, provisioning of ADC services -- it is going to vastly simplify a lot of that.</p><p>So I suspect that that -- we will see a higher percentage of the customer base start to adopt it. And it is very simple because it can run in virtual, it can run on hardware, it is very flexible. We can put it in the cloud, it is a very easy thing to consume from that perspective.</p><p>SID PARAKH, ANALYST, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN: Sid Parakh, McAdams Wright Reagan. Just two quick questions here. One is how should we think about revenue composition kind of going forward in terms of you're launching a lot of new cloud enabled products, there is more software kind of being packaged into the sales cycle. I mean are we looking at more multi or licensing deals, are we looking at more recurring revenues on the product side of things? So just trying to understand in the very long-term scheme of things. That is the first question.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: Yes, and, Manny, you may want to comment on this as well. But we have seen an increase in the software mix, and we talk about the attach rate increasing. vCMP, that is having more than one copy of the software in the box, either in an appliance or in the chassis. That is starting to -- that had a really nice pick up last quarter and we think that will increase because it's clearly cost effective for the customers, but it has got license associated with that.</p><p>So I think you are going to see that software content continue to increase. And in terms of the services type like the Versafe acquisition, whether it is basically a subscription type model, I think that will increase as well, you will see that. But that is going to be more, again, evolution, I think that is going to be slower incremental as well.</p><p>SID PARAKH: And just a follow-up on the sales front. Can you talk about after having expanded your sales footprint kind of where you are in the build out cycle, what kind of coverage do you have? Because it sounds like not having enough feet on the street has been kind of part of the issue being able to get to all the deals.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I don't know if I would say we did not have enough feet on the street, I don't know if I would start with that. I mean I think we see a great opportunity in front of us and we have been adding headcount and adding people as we see the opportunity present itself to us. And we look at it geographically, we look at it by vertical, we look at it by major accounts, by territory.</p><p>And so, when we pull together a headcount plan, I mean we really get pretty granular on where we want to split territories, where we want to make investments, what countries, what reasons regions, etc. And so, I don't feel like we are necessarily underutilized but we do see a great opportunity for us moving forward as we go into these other services. And by going to these other services we need to hire people in all different roles to take advantage of it. So that is why we are investing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So we are going to take two more. Just two more.</p><p>SANJIV WADHWANI, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Sanjiv Wadhwani, Stifel. Apologize if this has been asked, but two questions. One is on the virtual side of the equation. John, maybe you can walk us through how the deployments are taking place between virtual and [up line] based products and what the cost differential is. And then on the ACE opportunity you have talked about 900 customers so far, is there still significant growth in 2014 when you look at that opportunity? Thanks.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: Yes, on the virtual side we have seen a variety of types of different types of sales. We have seen basically $1 million sales all software, we have seen -- and more than one of those. But they are still pretty rare when you are up to the high-end. Typically it is a hybrid sale that we have seen.</p><p>As we have increased our capability in BIG-IQ and ScaleN, which allows you to take a system and software and scale them together and manage them in one place. I think that will increase as well. So I think you're going to see more and more hybrid, but clearly if you have a horizontal scaling focus in your architecture as a customer cloud provider, you can see all software as well. So you are going to see the mix there.</p><p>In terms of the differential, it's not significant actually. If you look at the entry level 2000 and the price of the software version that's equivalent to that, it is about 80% roughly in that area.</p><p>SANJIV WADHWANI: (Inaudible - microphone inaccessible)?</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: I'm sorry? Oh, yes, absolutely. We think that is an opportunity that is going to be an opportunity over a number of years. We have done some more analysis. Manny, do you want to talk about that?</p><p>MANNY RIVELO: Yes. We did a top-down and bottoms-up analysis on the ACE opportunity. By looking at what Cisco has done over the last 10 years and then putting about a 50 -- discounting about 50% saying that has been replaced or not. And we are seeing an opportunity that is probably about $1 billion to $2 billion out there, still kits sitting out there.</p><p>Just like the question was asked, you have a lot of equipment out there that is five to seven years, there's a lot of ACE equipment. And in some of those accounts where we penetrated, some we discussed today in the use cases, we have only touched 20% of the installed base. So there is still repeat business.</p><p>So, John, dead on, it is a multi-year journey and they are going to pick -- move those components out over time. The interesting part is as they insert an ADC or let's say a BIG-IP into that equation is that quite often there is a secondary service that they enable. And that leads to the whole synthesis message and that is proving out very well as we replace ACE.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: This is the final question and then we are done.</p><p>ROD HALL, ANALYST, JPMORGAN SECURITIES: Okay, I just have a question in 10 parts. No, I'm just kidding. It's Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Thanks for the questions. Two things I wanted to ask you about. One is on synergy, can you talk a little bit about the installed base and how much of it is synergy usable? And just kind of help us understand what sort of refresh might be necessary to implement synergy for customers that would be interested in it. That would be one thing.</p><p>And then at the other thing I wanted to ask you about is one of the things I have realized, maybe for obvious reasons, in the last several months is how some of these big customers -- the same problem -- you guys have this rich complex product and you have always struggled to get that message across to the financial community.</p><p>And I think I have just realized that is true for these big customers as well. They perceive you in a very vertical way. They look at particular applications and then once they get hold of the box, all of a sudden the realize, hey, this is thing is rich, there is all sorts of stuff we can do with it. How do you -- can you solve that problem and start to -- instead of starting so small start bigger with some of these big guys?</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: Right. Or better or best. By the way it is SYNTHESIS, Rod, SYNTHESIS the architecture, not synergy. But the whole SYNTHESIS is based on making that, if you like, complexity and it's not really complex, but that wealth of services more visible to the customer, more visible to our sales force. The packaging definitely in my opinion will help that quite tremendously because actually seeing we have this opportunity for you this one and this one, good, better, best. By definition you start a conversation about what you can do.</p><p>Because you are right, one of the things that we have we get from customers all the time was I didn't know you could do that. We get that a lot. And the whole concept of synthesis is to up rate that so that is on the table right away. And by the way, when you want to buy it you are buying a product, you are not buying some mythical marketing message, you are buying products, which then links into the licensing with the good, better, best and things like that. I think that is going to be pretty successful.</p><p>ROD HALL: Okay. Can I just -- one other thing I wanted to ask you guys on the virtual stuff. This -- one of the things -- people always ask about pricing but not unit volume. Do you think that -- does unit volume change with this? Because I would think that -- we've seen with virtual machine deployment, application deployment velocity increased. If we automate everything now we are going to see another huge increase in automation, in velocity and deployment,. And I just wonder can you comment on the unit volume side of the virtual equation as opposed to the pricing side?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: When we look at the data center solutions there, there are multiple ways people are consuming the technology in the data center. So just to explain the unit volume and the increase in that. Some of the large deals we did this year around VEs were targeted at where a customer provides a service and they provide the service to let's say 1,000 users. And instead of taking one device and partitioning that device using virtualization technology it is easier for them to partition a single unit, right, a single VE.</p><p>Part of why the strategy has been I call it 10 to 10, pushing our performance down to 10 meg, up to 10 gig and beyond, right. But the concept would be to get small footprints for VEs so you can have lots of those that are specific to a tenant, right. So we think, yes, there will be unit volume increase in that part of the market segment. And we saw some multimillion dollar deals this year that address that specific thing. And there are others in the pipeline. So I think you will see that occur.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM: Okay, that's us. I Hope you found it useful and thanks for being attentive and probably next time you will hear us is on the quarterly call.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Yet in 2018, perceptions about these dominant companies often reflected uneasiness and doubt\u2014and for some, so did their stock performance.Maybe the mood shift has to do with the fact that the public and government leaders no longer evaluate these tech giants based solely on their spectacular market growth and multi-billion-dollar valuations, but also on the effects of their products, which are woven into almost every aspect of people's lives.Some of these platform companies, taken together, now have a shared nickname: 'FAANG,' which stands for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google, a unit of parent company Alphabet. Industry observers see their fates tied together in some ways, and in the aggregate their market value had sunk[1] by more than $700 billion as 2018 drew to a close.Business conditions such as trade wars surely played a part in those losses, but at least some of that slide was due to public scrutiny over controversies like those that thrust Facebook(NASDAQ: FB[2])under the spotlight in 2018. The company, defending against criticisms over data privacy violations and the spread of false 2016 election campaign messages from fake accounts traced to Russia, found user growth slowing[3] persistently. </p><p>Its market cap plummeted[4] by more than $100 billion on a single day in July, and hasn't recovered since that period in the summer.Some observers say the FAANG companies slumped because they had been overvalued. Others say these companies are facing new headwinds from regulators that could cut into their profits. Lawmakers are considering ways to rein in the power of global tech companies that control the personal data of millions of people, use it to reap billions in ad revenues and sales, and allegedly squeeze out competitors[5]\u2014or acquire them.Ride-hailing pioneer Uber now hopes to take its place among the commanding platform giants that are publicly traded, through the IPO it plans for this year. But there's speculation that Uber will fall short[6] of the daring $120 billion valuation that some Wall Street bankers have suggested it could establish through the IPO.Xconomy asked a number of business leaders to comment on the lessons of 2018, and forecast some of the patterns we may see in 2019[7]. Two partners from Silicon Valley venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, Venky Ganesan (pictured, second from right) and Matt Murphy (pictured, second from left), were among those who offered their insights. They commented on the FAANG companies, the role of public trust in business success for tech companies, and the stress tests that fundraising will bring for companies with lofty private valuations.Here are their comments, shared via e-mail:Xconomy: What trend or event defined your industry in 2018? What are the implications for 2019?Venky Ganesan: 2018 was a rough year for FAANG\u2014the former kings of the stock market have been dethroned. While Amazon, Uber, and Microsoft lead the pack in terms of public-facing companies, I don't believe there will be a 'new FAANG.'More companies are choosing to remain privately held than ever before. Big tech's relationship with the public and the government is irrevocably changed. Expect regulation and governmental oversight, very similar to what happened to the banking sector.X: World Wide Web founder Tim Berners-Lee has proposed the formulation of a 'Contract for the Web' to mitigate the impacts of tech companies on individual privacy, national and regional strife, and other societal factors. He is asking companies and others to help write it, and pledge to honor it. If you were helping to write the 'Contract for the Web,' what are some of the provisions or principles you would propose? Do you think companies will honor these principles?Ganesan: All tech companies, whether they be consumer, enterprise, startup, or a Fortune 500 company, will need to prove that they can earn the public's trust in 2019.After seeing the very public and very negative backlash felt by the likes of Facebook and Google for their high-profile data breaches, it will be important for tech companies to promise customers that their information is protected. Privacy and how you use data will be key discussion topics going forward.If the industry as a whole is going to evaluate how it treats consumer data, the first step is holding big tech accountable.X: What are the emerging technologies that make it harder for you to predict how well your startup, your startup investment, or your company's new initiatives might remain relevant in the market, for a time period long enough for them to succeed?Matt Murphy: It's less about the emerging technologies and more about the investment strategies behind them. Overall, things are getting harder, not easier, next year in terms of raising capital and fundraising because investors have been betting that any company with a bit of traction will make it big. Unfortunately, that's just not the case for every startup. We'll see a lot of over-investments play out this year, which reveal cracks in the foundation of these over-inflated expectations and valuations.[Editor's note: This is part of aseries of

In a memo to Apple's 120,000 employees on Aug 3, two days later, chief executive Tim Cook praised the company, but urged staff that such financial metrics were \"not the most important measure of our success\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Just as Steve always did in moments like this,\" Mr Cook wrote, drawing on the legacy of his predecessor Steve Jobs. \"We should all look forward to Apple's bright future.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But for investors, that bright future may be a little more distant for Apple and the four other tech stocks which comprise the so-called FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.</p><p>For years, their stellar performance has served as rocket fuel for the wider US market, helping drive a bull run in stocks that has reverberated around the globe.</p><p>Yesterday however, all five officially entered bear market territory, meaning they have all dropped 20pc from their highest points. Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company, are down 20pc, Amazon is down 25pc, Netflix 35pc and Facebook 39pc. Put together, more than $1 trillion has been wiped from their valuations since they touched 52-week highs only a few weeks ago.</p><p>The market slump has taken a chunk out of other tech stocks, from chip makers to software providers, as concerns mount over trade tensions between the US and China and a slowdown in Asia has rippled through the industry.</p><p>While their share prices have been grabbing the headlines, the giants of Silicon Valley are facing a variety of different challenges.</p><p>Shareholders are now pondering the extent to which these tech stocks are the victims of an inevitable correction after a dizzying rise in their valuations over recent months, and to what degree is their fundamental value suffering?</p><p>Saturation</p><p>Peak iPhone? Peak Facebook? One concern that has been plaguing some of the big tech names is that they are running out of momentum in key markets as rates of growth start to slow. The Facebook app's market penetration in the US was shown to be wobbling at the start of 2018, when the number of daily active users fell for the first time.</p><p>Apple, meanwhile, has run into problems that are affecting all smartphone sellers. The simple truth is that almost everyone who is likely to buy an iPhone already owns one.</p><p>Apple has not returned to the peaks of iPhone sales it made in 2015, despite reporting record profits. While Apple's market cap hit $1 trillion in August, and for a while continued to climb, it has since dropped to around $882bn.</p><p>Not everyone is downcast on the opportunities for growth. \"Even though we have seen some saturation on the main Facebook platform, Facebook is still seen as having a stranglehold,\" says Bill Fisher, an analyst at eMarketer. \"The parent company has Instagram, which is seen as the new Facebook. It has been hedging its bets, it has been spreading itself around.\"</p><p>Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight, is similarly confident on Apple's return to form. \"Apple are making gravity defying margins on the phones that they are selling\" despite the slowdown in smartphone demand, he says.</p><p>Others believe this is a strategy that may not work forever as consumers grow tired of shelling out such high sums for products that are no longer a novelty.</p><p>Regulation and reputation</p><p>Potentially the biggest one-day falls in the stock price of the big tech companies in recent weeks have stemmed from damage to the reputation of specific companies. Facebook, above all, has been dented by simmering scandals over privacy, misinformation and the way management has handled them. A string of key departures from some of its core businesses, including the founders of Instagram and WhatsApp, have not helped.</p><p>\"Facebook is down for a lot of reasons,\" says Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, a senior Wall Street digital economy expert. \"Concerns are mounting on how well the company is run and about management changes.\"</p><p>The threat of further regulation to bring tech companies to heel has not abated. In the US, some states have begun implementing their own data privacy bills to mirror Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. There have also been mounting calls to break the chokehold of some of tech's monopolies - not least Facebook's domination of social media and Amazon's increasingly allencompassing retail empire. Rivals have also been hitting back. Netflix, which has largely been unaffected by reputational tarring that has hit Facebook, is facing growing pressure from a host of rivals - including a new streaming effort from Disney.</p><p>Digital ad market</p><p>Despite the gloomy outlook of the past week, the digital advertising market, a core driver of Facebook, Google and increasingly Amazon's income, appears to show no signs of slowing. The latest figures from the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a US trade body, suggested ad income grew 23pc in the first half of the year.</p><p>Such figures should be cause for celebration for tech investors, but more conservative analysts have said the bigger picture is not as rosy. In a note to clients, Wieser said the long run for the ad market will almost certainly be hit by a slow down.</p><p>\"Every passing period ... means we get closer to the point in time where growth for digital media owners approaches the level we would expect to see for the overall advertising industry,\" he said.</p><p>The Trump effect</p><p>While the US/China trade war tensions may not obviously hit Facebook and Google, both have been hoping to find ways to break into the Chinese market for some time now as an avenue to future growth. With the ante upped by US President Donald Trump, that possibility seems slimmer than ever. Hardware-maker Apple is likely to have felt the trade tensions most directly, given a large number of its suppliers for the iPhone are based in China.</p><p>It may also be that shareholders are seeing the end of the big share buybacks that were enabled by President Trump's tax relief for big US companies to bring their cash piles home from overseas.</p><p>Red October becomes Red November</p><p>The last six weeks have hit global stocks, not just tech, with big falls across markets, oil indexes and asset classes.</p><p>And tech stocks are just the worst hit because they have been the most overvalued, some analysts argue.</p><p>\"The large technology companies (the so-called FAANGs) have been looking frothy for a while, which makes their recent sell-off rather unsurprising,\" says TS Lombard analyst Dario Perkin.</p><p>Etoro analyst Mati Greenspan concurs: \"In the tech sector we are seeing shares that are trading 100 times their earnings. Everyone is saying: 'We are now closer to the end of the cycle than we were at the beginning'.\"</p><p>If the markets are coming to the natural conclusion of their bull run, it is trillion-dollar babies of the Big Tech shares that have the furthest to fall.</p><p>Sign up for your daily technology update <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk\">www.telegraph.co.uk</url>/ technewsletter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The giants of the tech world, the so-called FAANG stocks have had a rollercoaster ride this year and are now in bear market territoryTim Cook: Industrial engineer, now CEO of Apple.

And, no, it's not a vampire movie, although the metaphor of a behemoth that thrives on our data as its lifeblood might be apt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whether you shop for shoes on Amazon, call your mom on your iPhone, click on Facebook for your news or on Netflix and chill on the weekends, FAANG impacts just about every aspect of your life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's an acronym for some of the world's biggest technology companies, including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. Add in Microsoft and you pretty much have the wealth of some nations in companies that have become superpowers unto themselves.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Combined, the six have annual revenues of approximately $865 billion (U.S.), greater than the GDP of Saudi Arabia, the 18th largest economy in the world based on 2018 figures. (Canada, with a GDP of $1.7 trillion is the 10th largest world economy.) Data has become the new oil.</p><p>\"How dominant they've become has been amazing,\" says professor Tyler Chamberlain of the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management. \"These are truly global companies. The major businesses of the past had international operations. But the scale of the digital companies is unprecedented. They have dominated like no other companies before.\"</p><p>Canada has certainly been a beneficiary of the tech boom. This year, Toronto was ranked as one of the top North American cities for tech talent by commercial real estate consultants CBRE. Toronto's talent pool grew at the fastest pace of 50 markets measured, with 80,100 jobs created in the past five years, making the city the third best market in North America.</p><p>Only Silicon Valley (the San Francisco Bay area) and Seattle were ranked higher for their overall talent pools.</p><p>While the companies have undoubtedly created great wealth and prosperity for shareholders, the dominance of the big six has also created problems.</p><p>\"They have, to some, become the robber barons of the modern era,\" says Chamberlain.</p><p>Governments worldwide, including Canada, are grappling with how to regulate the foreign enterprises that are disrupting domestic economies on a massive scale.</p><p>That includes issues such as corporate taxation, privacy, fake news, antitrust and even cultural concerns such as contributing to Canadian content.</p><p>The Canadian government is looking at ways to regulate and tax the digital entities with a federal review panel that will make recommendations in January. What makes regulation more difficult is that the companies are notoriously secretive, guarding their information and data, while monetizing the data of consumers.</p><p>Basic information such as the number of employees or Canadian revenue is not always publicly revealed, making it difficult to gauge the exact footprint of Big Tech on the Canadian economy.</p><p>Netflix, for example, doesn't reveal how many viewers are watching their shows. A Netflix Canada spokesperson told the Star \"no comment\" when asked repeatedly about the most basic information such as how many employees or offices they had in Canada. With an estimated 6.3 million subscribers in Canada alone, according to U.K.-based third-party analysts Comparitech Ltd., the country is the company's fifth-largest market.</p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, told The Logic, a news outlet that reports on the innovation economy, that, globally, the company had 30,000 workers in safety and security by the end of 2018. But the company would not reveal a breakdown of the number of employees working in safety and security in Canada.</p><p>\"It's a major issue how we deal with these tech giants at this point because it will impact us in a significant way down the line,\" says BMO Financial Group chief economist Doug Porter. \"It bears extremely close watching to see what happens because, at the end of the day, it will affect Canadian government revenues fundamentally.\"</p><p>But citizens are demanding change. In August, a coalition of Canadian arts organizations representing producers, writers, publishers, directors, actors and artists launched a pressure campaign demanding that political parties update digital laws to protect Canadian culture. The #SaveOurCulture campaign is aimed at politicians running in the October federal election.</p><p>\"Digital has not only transformed the ways in which cultural content is accessed, it has also disrupted the cultural economy without adapting the rules of the game,\" said spokesperson Bill Skolnik, co-chair of the campaign and executive director of the Directors Guild of Canada.</p><p>Canada's Competition Bureau told the Star it is \"monitoring\" tech giants for anti-competitive behaviour in the wake of a sweeping U.S. Justice Department investigation as well as an inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Regulators are looking at whether the digital companies are abusing their power by stifling innovation and competition. As a result, Canada's Competition Bureau launched a wide-ranging inquiry this month on how the digital economy may be harming Canadian business, asking anyone with information to come forward.</p><p>\"Since certain digital markets tend towards a \"winner takes all\" outcome, firms in these markets have a strong incentive to adopt strategies that increase the likelihood the market tips in their favour,\" says the bureau in a paper.</p><p>On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced her office was organizing a multi-state antitrust probe into Facebook, while another group of states was preparing to launch a separate antitrust probe targeting Google.</p><p>The stakes are certainly high: Facebook was recently fined a record $5 billion by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations, and the European Commission just opened an antitrust investigation into Amazon.</p><p>Facebook has been on the firing line because of its impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election and issues of foreign interference. With the federal election next month, Canada is also on alert.</p><p>\"They all have their own sets of problems and issues. But Facebook, especially, because of their prominence on social media and impact on culture and communication,\" says the University of Ottawa's Chamberlain. \"It really puts them in the spotlight where they get a lot of attention, making it more difficult and complex.\"</p><p>Netflix, meanwhile, competes with Canadian broadcasters such as CTV, Global and Citytv, but does not have an obligation to contribute funds to produce Canadian shows.</p><p>And tax rules that were made during the heyday of print journalism puts legacy publishers at a disadvantage compared to platforms such as Google and Facebook. They have grown so large they now command almost three-quarters of all digital advertising dollars.</p><p>The digital economy has also put a squeeze on artists, including writers, musicians and actors struggling to attain the kind of middle-class living status that, while never assured, seems more difficult to attain now than in the past.</p><p>Interestingly, a government bureaucrat didn't coin the term FAANG, but it was popularized by CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer, who used it to describe high-performing technology stocks. The original FANG consisted of only four high-performing stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (owned by parent company, Alphabet). Since then, it's been expanded in various versions, but the old guard of Apple and Microsoft - because of their market dominance and importance - are worth adding to the list.</p><p>The dominance of big tech companies has some critics calling for them to be broken up into smaller companies. That's not a new reaction, says Chamberlain.</p><p>\"If you go back in history when you have these dominant firms, there is always pushback, a desire to split them up and tear them down. But the reality is market forces say they certainly won't be there forever.\"</p><p>While Facebook is being scrutinized now, Chamberlain says it wasn't that long ago that Microsoft, for example, was demonized as the thousand-pound gorilla that threatened to stifle development of other companies.</p><p>In 2008, the company was fined the equivalent of $1.35 billion (U.S.) by the European Union over antitrust violations.</p><p>Since then, Microsoft has transformed itself from essentially a device-based company to a mobile and cloud company, as the negative attention has focused on the other tech leaders.</p><p>\"Someone's head is always on the chopping block, but that changes. What everyone is afraid of today will invariably change tomorrow,\" says Chamberlain. \"That doesn't mean we shouldn't regulate and have rules. But it's good to have perspective.\"</p><p>BMO economist Porter says a chart of the biggest firms in earlier decades would look far different than the FAANG-dominated chart of today. Traditionally, automobile, real estate, oil and bricks and mortar retailing were the bread and butter stocks.</p><p>\"We unquestionably have a very different picture at the top this time around,\" says Porter. \"But for Canada, success in technology goes beyond the FAANG companies.\"</p><p>Porter says there is a wave of smaller homegrown companies that are doing exceptionally well in areas such as artificial intelligence, but are under the radar that could one day be part of the next FAANG.</p><p>\"It's maybe something that is not as celebrated as it should be. But we are seeing solid employment gains in the technology sector and the birth of a lot of very interesting companies and that bodes well for Canada and for the future. That is the bulwark against the dominance of FAANG.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

And, no, it's not a vampire movie, although the metaphor of a behemoth that thrives on our data as its lifeblood might be apt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whether you shop for shoes on Amazon, call your mom on your iPhone, click on Facebook for your news or on Netflix and chill on the weekends, FAANG impacts just about every aspect of your life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's an acronym for some of the world's biggest technology companies, including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. Add in Microsoft and you pretty much have the wealth of some nations in companies that have become superpowers unto themselves.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Combined, the six have annual revenues of approximately $865 billion (U.S.), greater than the GDP of Saudi Arabia, the 18th largest economy in the world based on 2018 figures. (Canada, with a GDP of $1.7 trillion is the 10th largest world economy.) Data has become the new oil.</p><p>\"How dominant they've become has been amazing,\" says professor Tyler Chamberlain of the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management. \"These are truly global companies. The major businesses of the past had international operations. But the scale of the digital companies is unprecedented. They have dominated like no other companies before.\"</p><p>Canada has certainly been a beneficiary of the tech boom. This year, Toronto was ranked as one of the top North American cities for tech talent by commercial real estate consultants CBRE. Toronto's talent pool grew at the fastest pace of 50 markets measured, with 80,100 jobs created in the past five years, making the city the third best market in North America.</p><p>Only Silicon Valley (the San Francisco Bay area) and Seattle were ranked higher for their overall talent pools.</p><p>While the companies have undoubtedly created great wealth and prosperity for shareholders, the dominance of the big six has also created problems.</p><p>\"They have, to some, become the robber barons of the modern era,\" says Chamberlain.</p><p>Governments worldwide, including Canada, are grappling with how to regulate the foreign enterprises that are disrupting domestic economies on a massive scale.</p><p>That includes issues such as corporate taxation, privacy, fake news, antitrust and even cultural concerns such as contributing to Canadian content.</p><p>The Canadian government is looking at ways to regulate and tax the digital entities with a federal review panel that will make recommendations in January. What makes regulation more difficult is that the companies are notoriously secretive, guarding their information and data, while monetizing the data of consumers.</p><p>Basic information such as the number of employees or Canadian revenue is not always publicly revealed, making it difficult to gauge the exact footprint of Big Tech on the Canadian economy.</p><p>Netflix, for example, doesn't reveal how many viewers are watching their shows. A Netflix Canada spokesperson told the Star \"no comment\" when asked repeatedly about the most basic information such as how many employees or offices they had in Canada. With an estimated 6.3 million subscribers in Canada alone, according to U.K.-based third-party analysts Comparitech Ltd., the country is the company's fifth-largest market.</p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, told The Logic, a news outlet that reports on the innovation economy, that, globally, the company had 30,000 workers in safety and security by the end of 2018. But the company would not reveal a breakdown of the number of employees working in safety and security in Canada.</p><p>\"It's a major issue how we deal with these tech giants at this point because it will impact us in a significant way down the line,\" says BMO Financial Group chief economist Doug Porter. \"It bears extremely close watching to see what happens because, at the end of the day, it will affect Canadian government revenues fundamentally.\"</p><p>But citizens are demanding change. In August, a coalition of Canadian arts organizations representing producers, writers, publishers, directors, actors and artists launched a pressure campaign demanding that political parties update digital laws to protect Canadian culture. The #SaveOurCulture campaign is aimed at politicians running in the October federal election.</p><p>\"Digital has not only transformed the ways in which cultural content is accessed, it has also disrupted the cultural economy without adapting the rules of the game,\" said spokesperson Bill Skolnik, co-chair of the campaign and executive director of the Directors Guild of Canada.</p><p>Canada's Competition Bureau told the Star it is \"monitoring\" tech giants for anti-competitive behaviour in the wake of a sweeping U.S. Justice Department investigation as well as an inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Regulators are looking at whether the digital companies are abusing their power by stifling innovation and competition. As a result, Canada's Competition Bureau launched a wide-ranging inquiry this month on how the digital economy may be harming Canadian business, asking anyone with information to come forward.</p><p>\"Since certain digital markets tend towards a \"winner takes all\" outcome, firms in these markets have a strong incentive to adopt strategies that increase the likelihood the market tips in their favour,\" says the bureau in a paper.</p><p>On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced her office was organizing a multi-state antitrust probe into Facebook, while another group of states was preparing to launch a separate antitrust probe targeting Google.</p><p>The stakes are certainly high: Facebook was recently fined a record $5 billion by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations, and the European Commission just opened an antitrust investigation into Amazon.</p><p>Facebook has been on the firing line because of its impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election and issues of foreign interference. With the federal election next month, Canada is also on alert.</p><p>\"They all have their own sets of problems and issues. But Facebook, especially, because of their prominence on social media and impact on culture and communication,\" says the University of Ottawa's Chamberlain. \"It really puts them in the spotlight where they get a lot of attention, making it more difficult and complex.\"</p><p>Netflix, meanwhile, competes with Canadian broadcasters such as CTV, Global and Citytv, but does not have an obligation to contribute funds to produce Canadian shows.</p><p>And tax rules that were made during the heyday of print journalism puts legacy publishers at a disadvantage compared to platforms such as Google and Facebook. They have grown so large they now command almost three-quarters of all digital advertising dollars.</p><p>The digital economy has also put a squeeze on artists, including writers, musicians and actors struggling to attain the kind of middle-class living status that, while never assured, seems more difficult to attain now than in the past.</p><p>Interestingly, a government bureaucrat didn't coin the term FAANG, but it was popularized by CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer, who used it to describe high-performing technology stocks. The original FANG consisted of only four high-performing stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (owned by parent company, Alphabet). Since then, it's been expanded in various versions, but the old guard of Apple and Microsoft - because of their market dominance and importance - are worth adding to the list.</p><p>The dominance of big tech companies has some critics calling for them to be broken up into smaller companies. That's not a new reaction, says Chamberlain.</p><p>\"If you go back in history when you have these dominant firms, there is always pushback, a desire to split them up and tear them down. But the reality is market forces say they certainly won't be there forever.\"</p><p>While Facebook is being scrutinized now, Chamberlain says it wasn't that long ago that Microsoft, for example, was demonized as the thousand-pound gorilla that threatened to stifle development of other companies.</p><p>In 2008, the company was fined the equivalent of $1.35 billion (U.S.) by the European Union over antitrust violations.</p><p>Since then, Microsoft has transformed itself from essentially a device-based company to a mobile and cloud company, as the negative attention has focused on the other tech leaders.</p><p>\"Someone's head is always on the chopping block, but that changes. What everyone is afraid of today will invariably change tomorrow,\" says Chamberlain. \"That doesn't mean we shouldn't regulate and have rules. But it's good to have perspective.\"</p><p>BMO economist Porter says a chart of the biggest firms in earlier decades would look far different than the FAANG-dominated chart of today. Traditionally, automobile, real estate, oil and bricks and mortar retailing were the bread and butter stocks.</p><p>\"We unquestionably have a very different picture at the top this time around,\" says Porter. \"But for Canada, success in technology goes beyond the FAANG companies.\"</p><p>Porter says there is a wave of smaller homegrown companies that are doing exceptionally well in areas such as artificial intelligence, but are under the radar that could one day be part of the next FAANG.</p><p>\"It's maybe something that is not as celebrated as it should be. But we are seeing solid employment gains in the technology sector and the birth of a lot of very interesting companies and that bodes well for Canada and for the future. That is the bulwark against the dominance of FAANG.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Asked a question about the collapse of the retail institution Sears, Bezos said that large companies are often only dominant for around 30 years, and that he saw his job as delaying his company's collapse for as long as possible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A brief look at US stock markets last week might have suggested that moment is coming for Amazon sooner rather than later. The company's market value, which passed a trillion dollars earlier in the summer, has fallen by a quarter in a prolonged tech slump.</p><p>Bezos's personal wealth has tumbled by $42bn (33bn) since the start of August, or around $17m an hour, although he remains by some distance the world's richest person.</p><p>Amazon is not alone, however. The last few weeks has been the worst period for big technology companies since the financial crisis, at least in stock market terms.</p><p>The \"FAANGs\" - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet - the five companies that have epitomised tech's stock market boom in the decade since the crisis, have all lost between 25pc and 40pc of their value since their peaks this summer. In market value terms, their collective decline has added up to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/bezos-tells-employees-one-day-amazon-will-fail-and-to-stay-hungry.html\">more than one trillion dollars</url> .\u00a0</p><p>Apple is now on the verge of being overtaken as the world's most valuable company by fusty old Microsoft for the first time in eight years: on Friday, their market capitalisations differed by a mere $26bn. Some tech companies have fared even worse, such as the chipmaker Nvidia, which has lost half of its value in a month.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/bezos-tells-employees-one-day-amazon-will-fail-and-to-stay-hungry.html\">FAANGs cut down to size Declines since peak</url></p><p>There are several reasons for this broad sell-off. Rising interest rates are making equities comparatively less appealing to investors. The Trump tax cuts, which brought hundreds of billions in overseas cash back to the US and were spent on share buybacks, are wearing off.\u00a0</p><p>And global growth prospects for 2019 are fading. These phenomena affect the whole stock market, but high-growth tech shares more than most, because they are seen as riskier than the more reliable consumer staples.</p><p>But ignore the wider economic picture, and its easy to see things another way. Apple is not selling as many iPhones as investors had hoped. Earlier this month, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/bezos-tells-employees-one-day-amazon-will-fail-and-to-stay-hungry.html\">the company announced</url> that it would stop telling investors how many of each gadget it sells during quarterly results, which investors interpreted as a sign that the figures would not be as pretty as they had been in the past.\u00a0</p><p>This was compounded by a flurry of announcements from component suppliers that suggested iPhone production orders had been slashed. Last week, it was reported that Apple was considering cutting the price of its recently-released phones, something that would be an extremely unusual move.</p><p>Or look at Facebook. The company's recent share decline has coincided with yet another scandal at the social networking giant, this time over its use of a shady PR firm that attempted to smear its rivals. The revelations have led to more calls for regulation of the company, and left Mark Zuckerberg and his second-in-command Sheryl Sandberg under pressure to restore its reputation, something they have failed to do.</p><p>Among the other FAANGs there is also a lingering feeling that the unchecked growth enjoyed in recent years might not continue in the future. Combine this with a growing distrust of big tech, and one might think that the share price fall since this summer is only the beginning of the end.\u00a0</p><p>Bezos' statement that all things come to an end has been especially true of technology companies. The sector has been uniquely prone to bubbles, and success is never guaranteed in an industry where a teenager can create a giant-killer in their garage.</p><p>If another economic crisis is round the corner, nobody knows how the tech companies will fare. Yes, four of the five were on the stock market during the 2008 crash (Facebook being the exception), but their businesses were completely different - Apple was an iPod company, Netflix rented out DVDs in the post, Amazon and Alphabet were a fraction of their current size.</p><p>But it would be a mistake to think that the FAANGs are going anywhere, or that they have peaked. Unlike in previous tech bubbles, where fever got ahead of profits, the tech giants make huge amounts of money. Netflix is an exception here, but could be very profitable if it wanted to stop investing in growth.</p><p>Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet's statuses as the world's most valuable companies is not a results of outlandish earnings multiples or irrational optimism. It reflects their dominance in the modern economy, as well as their impressive staying power. For all the talk of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/bezos-tells-employees-one-day-amazon-will-fail-and-to-stay-hungry.html\">peak iPhone</url>, Apple still sells millions of them a week, and at ever-higher prices.</p><p>The business models of Google and Facebook are routinely criticised, but no politician seems willing to regulate them, and the companies themselves are ruthless in stamping out competition. Amazon has no shortage of growth potential - in addition to the internet's growing share of shopping, it is starting to open brick and mortar stores.</p><p>The FAANGs may have lost some of their bite, but they are not about to fall.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-49534496</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TTM-KSR1-F021-60S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><timeReceived>9:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 25, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Asked a question about the collapse of the retail institution Sears, Bezos said large companies are often dominant for only about 30 years, and that he saw his job as delaying his company's collapse for as long as possible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A brief look at US stock markets last week might have suggested that moment is coming for Amazon sooner rather than later. The company's market value, which passed a trillion dollars earlier in the summer, has fallen by a quarter in a prolonged tech slump.</p><p>Bezos's personal wealth has tumbled by $42bn (\u00a333bn) since the start of August, or around $17m an hour, although he remains by some distance the world's richest person.</p><p>Amazon is not alone, however. The last few weeks has represented the worst period for big technology companies since the financial crisis, at least in stock market terms.</p><p>The \"FAANGs\" - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet - the five companies that have epitomised tech's stock market boom in the decade since the crisis - have all lost between 25pc and 40pc of their value since their peaks this summer. In market value terms, their collective decline has added up to more than one trillion dollars.</p><p>Apple is now on the verge of being overtaken as the world's most valuable company by fusty old Microsoft for the first time in eight years: on Friday, their market capitalisations differed by a mere $26bn. Some tech companies have fared even worse, such as the chip maker Nvidia, which has lost half of its value in a month.</p><p>There are several reasons for this broad sell-off. Rising interest rates are making equities comparatively less appealing to investors. The Trump tax cuts, which brought hundreds of billions in overseas cash back to the US and were spent on share buy-backs, are wearing off.</p><p>And global growth prospects for 2019 are fading. These phenomena affect the whole stock market, but high-growth tech shares more than most, because they are seen as riskier than the more reliable consumer staples.</p><p>But ignore the wider economic picture, and it's easy to see things another way. Apple is not selling as many iPhones as investors had hoped. Earlier this month, the company announced it would stop telling investors how many of each gadget it sells during quarterly results, which investors interpreted as a sign that the figures would not be as pretty as they had been in the past.</p><p>This was compounded by a flurry of announcements from component suppliers that suggested iPhone production orders had been slashed. Last week, it was reported that Apple was considering cutting the price of its recently released phones, which would be an extremely unusual move.</p><p>Or look at Facebook. The company's recent share decline has coincided with yet another scandal at the social networking giant, this time over its use of a shady PR firm that attempted to smear its rivals. The revelations have led to more calls for regulation of the company, and left Mark Zuckerberg and his second-in-command Sheryl Sandberg under pressure to restore its reputation, something they have failed to do.</p><p>Among the other FAANGs there is a lingering feeling that the unchecked growth enjoyed in recent years might not continue in the future. Combine this with a growing distrust of big tech, and one might think that the share-price fall since this summer is only the beginning of the end.</p><p>Bezos' statement that all things come to an end has been especially true of technology companies. The sector has been uniquely prone to bubbles, and success is never guaranteed in an industry where a teenager can create a giantkiller in their garage.</p><p>If another economic crisis is round the corner, nobody knows how the tech companies will fare. Yes, four of the five were on the stock market during the 2008 crash (Facebook being the exception), but their businesses were completely different - Apple was an iPod company, Netflix rented out DVDs in the post, Amazon and Alphabet were a fraction of their current size.</p><p>But it would be a mistake to think that the FAANGs are going anywhere, or that they have peaked. Unlike in previous tech bubbles, where fever got ahead of profits, the tech giants make huge amounts of money. Netflix is an exception here, but could be very profitable if it wanted to stop investing in growth.</p><p>Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet's status as the world's most valuable companies is not a results of outlandish earnings multiples or irrational optimism. It reflects their dominance in the modern economy, as well as their impressive staying power.</p><p>For all the talk of \"peak iPhone\", Apple still sells millions of them a week, and at ever-higher prices. The business models of Google and Facebook are routinely criticised, but no politician seems willing to regulate them, and the companies themselves are ruthless in stamping out competition.</p><p>Amazon has no shortage of growth potential - in addition to the internet's growing share of shopping, it is starting to open bricks-and-mortar stores.</p><p>The FAANGs may have lost some of their bite, but they are not about to fall.</p><p>'For all the talk of \"peak iPhone\", Apple still sells millions of them a week'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-143971918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TTR-RW41-JCBW-N4XJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"868\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 26, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001YLV</classCode><className>NVIDIA CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Walmart (US:WMT) sells more products than any other company. In the year to January 2019, it reported $514bn (\u00a3393bn) of total revenues - more than twice the annual revenues of digital retailer Amazon (US:AMZN). Apple (US:AAPL) tops the profit table, with $13.7bn of net income in the three months to September 2019. For company assets, head to the banking sector where JP Morgan (US:JPM) has $2.8 trillion of total assets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in the battle for market capitalisation, companies in the tech industry are the only real contenders for the top spot. In the past decade, as stock markets have strengthened, digital behemoths have claimed higher valuations than any company in history. In 2019, three of them have hit a peak market capitalisation of more than $1 trillion.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that investors value these companies so highly. Tech has infiltrated almost every industry in the world and digital companies account for seven of the top 10 most valuable brands, according to Kantar US Insights. With the growth of the tech industry unlikely to let up, companies that can benefit from the changes or - even better - drive them, are likely to remain favoured by global investors.</p><p>But there is a potential downside to the rising use of technology across multiple industries: if traditionally non-tech companies gain the digital expertise that once belonged exclusively to businesses like the FAANGs - the acronym applied to five of the world's biggest tech beasts, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google - is the era of tech company dominance coming to an end? And will the tech titans be able to retain their positions as the most valuable companies in the world?</p><p>                     Beware the ubiquity of technology                   </p><p>Netflix (US:NFLX) is a prime example of these dangers. In the next few months it will face its first real competition when Walt Disney (US:DIS) and AT&amp;T's (US:T.) HBO launch their own streaming platforms. To deal with the battle, the company has a $10bn content budget for 2019 and is churning out more original titles than ever before. Chief executive Reid Hastings acknowledges this threat. \"We did well during the first decade of streaming,\" he wrote in his third quarter letter to shareholders. \"We've been preparing for this new wave of competition for a long time.\"</p><p>Preparation is all well and good, but competing with two of the world's most loved production companies on their own turf is not going to be easy. Netflix has won a global audience of 158m thanks to its content recommendation features, ease of use and ability to satisfy its audience's love of binge-watching. If DisneyPlus or HBO Max can match Netflix's technological expertise, they can let their superior production skills win over new customers. Netflix will then struggle to continue to maintain its quarterly revenue growth, which has averaged 28 per cent in the past three years.</p><p>Facebook (US: FB.) could go the same way. Alongside Google, it has gained a duopoly in the advertising industry built on a remarkable ability to collect data from an enormous global user base. But more media companies are beginning to use tech to capture large, targeted audiences, thus encroaching on Facebook and Google's space. The two companies' share of the digital advertising industry has begun to fall in the past few years. </p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"7\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col7\" namest=\"col1\">FAANG financial results in three months to Sept 2019</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col7\" namest=\"col1\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">Revenue ($bn)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Growth (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Operating Profit ($bn)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Growth (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">EPS ($)</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">P/E Ratio (x)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Facebook</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">17.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">28.5</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">7.2</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">24.2</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">2.1</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">30.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Apple</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">64.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">15.6</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">-3.1</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">3.1</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">19.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Amazon</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">70.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">24.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3.2</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">-18.0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">4.3</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">87.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Netflix</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">31.1</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">104.0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">1.5</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">85.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Alphabet</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">40.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">20.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">9.2</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">6.4</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">10.1</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">26.2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col7\" namest=\"col1\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col7\" namest=\"col1\">Data collected from company results statements.

True, third-quarter numbers helped to expel any immediate doubt about the popularity of its platforms (which include Instagram and WhatsApp): monthly active users rose 8 per cent and advertising revenue was up 28 per cent to $17.4bn. But that doesn't take away from the fact that the company has been criticised for supporting addictive algorithms, allowing political advertising and damaging mental health. Regulators don't want Facebook to continue to make huge amounts of money from the personal data of its customers. A clampdown could eventually restrict its advertising sales.</p><p>The same is true of Twitter (US:TWTR), which fell short of revenue and profit guidance in the third quarter. Advertising revenue in the quarter might have risen 8 per cent to $702m, but that was significantly lower than the $756m forecast by FactSet - not good enough considering Twitter generates 85 per cent of its revenue from advertising. By contrast, fellow social media group Snap (US:SNAP) managed to beat analysts' expectations after adding 7m daily active users in the third quarter to send revenues up 50 per cent. But, like Facebook and Twitter, it also relies on gathering personal data of users. If the model comes under threat from regulation, there won't be much room for any of these new age media companies to grow.</p><p>                     The superiority of software                    </p><p>Apple's troubles start in China where the rising popularity of Huawei mobile phones has cut into the market long-dominated by the iPhone. Apple has been forced to trim its prices, which sent product sales down 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, despite reports of unexpectedly high demand for the new iPhone 11.</p><p>Fortunately, another surge in the group's services division - which includes its iOS operating system - helped make up the shortfall. Apple's services business generated gross margins of over 64 per cent, compared with 32 per cent in the products division. This level of profitability is more akin to software giants such as Microsoft (US:MSFT) and Adobe (US:ADBE), which generated gross margins of 69 per cent and 85 per cent in their respective third quarters.</p><p>The global software industry is in its prime thanks to a rise in the subscription business model, which was pioneered by Adobe when it switched from a licensing business in 2013. In the third quarter of 2019, 90 per cent of Adobe's revenues came from reliable, recurring subscriptions, compared with 28 per cent in 2013. Subscriptions require very low ongoing expenditure, meaning the bulk of Adobe's costs are sales and marketing ($812m in Q3) and research and development ($490m in Q3) - both of which in turn drive revenue growth. In the three months to August 2019, revenue rose 24 per cent to $2.8bn.</p><p>Many of the world's software companies have jumped on the subscription bandwagon and are reaping the rewards. Intuit (US:INTU) - which will release its fiscal first-quarter results on 21 November - recently announced that it expects 10-11 per cent revenue growth in the year to July 2020, driven by strong demand for its QuickBooks software subscription.</p><p>But growth is most impressive at the king of all software companies: Microsoft. In the three months to September 2019, the world's largest public company reported a 14 per cent increase in revenues and 22 per cent increase in earnings - substantially ahead of analyst expectations.</p><p>                     A trio of tech titans of the future                   </p><p>Microsoft's Azure was the company's standout product in the quarter, reporting 59 per cent revenue growth to drive sales in its intelligent cloud division up 27 per cent to $10.8bn. Amazon's cloud business, AWS, was similarly impressive, with revenues up 35 per cent to $9bn and operating profits up 9 per cent to $2.3bn. The two companies boast a combined 63 per cent share of the fast-growing cloud computing market, which means they are in an enviable position as the world's reliance on cloud-hosted data storage continues to grow.</p><p>                     Alphabet (US:GOOGL) is also well placed to benefit from the growth of the cloud. True, its market share (9 per cent) isn't as impressive as Microsoft or Amazon, but it stands above its peers in its ability to understand and manipulate data. Extensive investment in artificial intelligence, including its 2014 acquisition of British AI start-up DeepMind Technologies, means the company can sell its pioneering AI alongside its cloud hosting services to companies seeking to make better use of their data.</p><p>Cloud and AI, which sit alongside Androids, Maps, Play and hardware in Google's non-advertising division, reported $6.4bn of sales in the third quarter - a 39 per cent increase compared with the previous year, which reflects the company's focus on investing in products set to drive growth in the future. Amazon is employing a similar strategy. In 2019, the group will spend $800m on improving its logistics, including automating its warehouses, improving the capabilities of its drones and investing in driverless lorries. The period of heavy spending seems to have spooked investors, who have sent the share price down 10 per cent since its summer peak, but chief executive Jeff Bezos insists the investment will drive even more impressive growth. In the third quarter, revenues leapt 24 per cent to $70bn - well ahead of expectations.</p><p>Alphabet and Amazon might have been the only two FAANGs to miss third-quarter expectations, but they are readying their businesses for the demands of the future better than many of their big tech peers. Microsoft is also very well placed to benefit from changing consumer and industry demands. By contrast, companies that haven't continued to innovate will struggle to live up to the expectations of their lofty valuations. So, while the world's most valuable companies are likely to remain tech-orientated, we think investors will have to be more selective with their choices and not simply buy shares in a company because it claims digital expertise. The FAANGs must be prepared for the future - we think Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet are the picks of the US tech sector.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-57642983</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFK-0BF1-JCJY-G2WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1680\"/><timeReceived>11:35 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Walmart (US:WMT) sells more products than any other company. In the year to January 2019, it reported $514bn (\u00a3393bn) of total revenues - more than twice the annual revenues of digital retailer Amazon (US:AMZN). Apple (US:AAPL) tops the profit table, with $13.7bn of net income in the three months to September 2019. For company assets, head to the banking sector where JP Morgan (US:JPM) has $2.8 trillion of total assets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in the battle for market capitalisation, companies in the tech industry are the only real contenders for the top spot. In the past decade, as stock markets have strengthened, digital behemoths have claimed higher valuations than any company in history. In 2019, three of them have hit a peak market capitalisation of more than $1 trillion.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that investors value these companies so highly. Technology has infiltrated almost every industry in the world and digital companies account for seven of the top 10 most valuable brands, according to Kantar US Insights. With the growth of the tech industry unlikely to let up, companies that can benefit from the changes or - even better - drive them, are likely to remain favoured by global investors.</p><p>But there is a potential downside to the rising use of technology across multiple industries: if traditionally non-tech companies gain the digital expertise that once belonged exclusively to businesses like the FAANGs - the acronym applied to five of the world's biggest tech beasts, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google - is the era of tech company dominance coming to an end? And will the tech titans be able to retain their positions as the most valuable companies in the world? Beware the ubiquity of technology Netflix (US:NFLX) is a prime example of these dangers. In the next few months, it will face its first real competition when Walt Disney (US:DIS) and AT&amp;T's (US:T.) HBO launch their own streaming platforms. To deal with the battle, the company has a $10bn content budget for 2019 and is churning out more original titles than ever before. Netflix chief executive Reid Hastings acknowledges this threat. \"We did well during the first decade of streaming,\" he wrote in his third quarter letter to shareholders. \"We've been preparing for this new wave of competition for a long time.\"</p><p>Preparation is all well and good, but competing with two of the world's most loved production companies on their own turf is not going to be easy. Netflix has won a global audience of 158m thanks to its content recommendation features, ease of use and ability to satisfy its audience's love of binge-watching. If the streaming services DisneyPlus or HBO Max can match Netflix's technological expertise, they can let their superior production skills win over new customers. Netflix will then struggle to continue to maintain its quarterly revenue growth, which has averaged 28 per cent in the past three years.</p><p>Facebook (US: FB.) could go the same way. Alongside Google, it has gained a duopoly in the advertising industry built on a remarkable ability to collect data from an enormous global user base. But more media companies are beginning to use technology to capture large, targeted audiences, thus encroaching on Facebook and Google's spaces. The two companies' share of the digital advertising industry has begun to fall in the past few years.</p><p>Compounding this potential issue is the fact that Facebook has a major image problem. True, third-quarter numbers helped to expel any immediate doubt about the popularity of its platforms (which include Instagram and WhatsApp): monthly active users rose 8 per cent and advertising revenue was up 28 per cent to $17.4bn. But that doesn't take away from the fact that the company has been criticised for supporting addictive algorithms, allowing political advertising and damaging mental health. Regulators don't want Facebook to continue to make huge amounts of money from the personal data of its customers. A clampdown could eventually restrict its advertising sales.</p><p>The same is true of Twitter (US:TWTR), which fell short of revenue and profit guidance in the third quarter. Advertising revenue in the quarter might have risen 8 per cent to $702m, but that was significantly lower than the $756m forecast by FactSet - not good enough considering Twitter generates 85 per cent of its revenue from advertising. By contrast, fellow social media group Snap (US:SNAP) managed to beat analysts' expectations after adding 7m daily active users in the third quarter to send revenues up 50 per cent. But, like Facebook and Twitter, it relies on gathering personal data of users. If the model comes under threat from regulation, there won't be much room for any of these new media companies to grow.</p><p>The superiority of software Apple's troubles start in China where the rising popularity of Huawei mobile phones has cut into the market long-dominated by the iPhone. Apple has been forced to trim its prices, which sent product sales down 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, despite reports of unexpectedly high demand for the new iPhone 11.</p><p>Fortunately, another surge in the group's services division - which includes its iOS operating system - helped make up the shortfall. Apple's services business generated gross margins of more than 64 per cent, compared with 32 per cent in the products division. This level of profitability is more akin to software giants such as Microsoft (US:MSFT) and Adobe (US:ADBE), which generated gross margins of 69 per cent and 85 per cent in their respective third quarters.</p><p>The global software industry is in its prime thanks to a rise in the subscription business model, which was pioneered by Adobe when it switched from a licensing business in 2013. In the third quarter of 2019, 90 per cent of Adobe's revenues came from reliable, recurring subscriptions, compared with 28 per cent in 2013. Subscriptions require very low ongoing expenditure, meaning the bulk of Adobe's costs are sales and marketing ($812m in Q3) and research and development ($490m in Q3) - both of which in turn drive revenue growth. In the three months to August 2019, revenue rose 24 per cent to $2.8bn.</p><p>Many of the world's software companies have jumped on the subscription bandwagon and are reaping the rewards. Intuit (US:INTU) - which will release its fiscal first-quarter results on 21 November - recently announced that it expects 10-11 per cent revenue growth in the year to July 2020, driven by strong demand for its QuickBooks software subscription.</p><p>But growth is most impressive at the king of all software companies: Microsoft. In the three months to September 2019, the world's largest public company reported a 14 per cent increase in revenues and a 22 per cent increase in earnings - substantially ahead of analyst expectations.</p><p>A trio of tech titans of the future Microsoft's Azure was the company's standout product in the quarter, reporting 59 per cent revenue growth to drive sales in its intelligent cloud division up 27 per cent to $10.8bn. Amazon's cloud business, AWS, was similarly impressive, with revenues up 35 per cent to $9bn and operating profits up 9 per cent to $2.3bn. The two companies boast a combined 63 per cent share of the fast-growing cloud computing market, which means they are in an enviable position as the world's reliance on cloud-hosted data storage continues to grow.</p><p>Alphabet (US:GOOGL) is also well placed to benefit from the growth of the cloud. True, its market share (4 per cent) isn't as impressive as Microsoft or Amazon, but it stands above its peers in its ability to understand and manipulate data. Extensive investment in artificial intelligence, including its 2014 acquisition of British AI start-up DeepMind Technologies, means the company can sell its pioneering AI alongside its cloud hosting services to companies seeking to make better use of their data.</p><p>Cloud and AI, which sit alongside Androids, Maps, Play and hardware in Google's non-advertising division, reported $6.4bn of sales in the third quarter - a 39 per cent increase compared with the previous year. This reflects the company's focus on investing in products set to drive growth in the future. Amazon is employing a similar strategy. In 2019, the group will spend $800m on improving its logistics, including automating its warehouses, improving the capabilities of its drones and investing in driverless lorries. The period of heavy spending appears to have spooked investors, who have sent the share price down 10 per cent since its summer peak. But chief executive Jeff Bezos insists the investment will drive even more impressive growth. In the third quarter, revenues leapt 24 per cent to $70bn - well ahead of expectations.</p><p>\u2022 Alphabet and Amazon might have been the only two FAANGs to miss third-quarter expectations, but they are readying their businesses for the demands of the future better than many of their big tech peers. Microsoft is also very well placed to benefit from changing consumer and industry demands. By contrast, companies that haven't continued to innovate will struggle to live up to the expectations of their lofty valuations. So, while the world's most valuable companies are likely to remain tech-orientated, investors will have to be more selective with their choices and not simply buy shares in a company because it claims digital expertise. The FAANGs must be prepared for the future. Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet are the picks of the US tech sector.</p><p>'In the past decade, as stock markets have strengthened, digital behemoths have claimed higher valuations than any company in history'  ;</p><p>'Alphabet is well placed to benefit from the growth of the cloud.

Les Am\u00e9ricains devraient se montrer \" un peu plus reconnaissants \" envers les grandes entreprises technologiques, estimait-il - \u00e0 bonne distance - devant l'audience tri\u00e9e sur le volet de cette v\u00e9n\u00e9rable association. \" Pensez \u00e0 ce que serait, en ce moment, votre vie sans Amazon. Les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de la tech, que nous adorons d\u00e9nigrer, ont accumul\u00e9 le capital, r\u00e9alis\u00e9 les investissements, construit les outils qui nous aident aujourd'hui. Imaginez la m\u00eame r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sans eux. J'esp\u00e8re que les gens sauront s'en souvenir lorsque cette crise sanitaire sera enfin termin\u00e9e. \" Bien qu'il ne soit plus actif chez Google, o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait encore conseiller technique jusqu'\u00e0 r\u00e9cemment, Eric Schmidt reste tr\u00e8s influent dans les sph\u00e8res du pouvoir : il pr\u00e9side non seulement le Defense Innovation Board, un groupe consultatif qui a ses entr\u00e9es au Pentagone, et la National Security Commission of Artificial Intelligence, proche du Congr\u00e8s, mais il vient d'\u00eatre charg\u00e9 par le gouverneur Andrew Cuomo d'imaginer les r\u00e9formes d'\u00e9ducation et de sant\u00e9 qui permettront \u00e0 l'Etat de New York de se r\u00e9inventer apr\u00e8s la pand\u00e9mie. Hier conspu\u00e9s pour leurs pratiques anticoncurrentielles, vilipend\u00e9s pour leurs montages fiscaux et souvent per\u00e7us comme les symboles des exc\u00e8s de l'Am\u00e9rique, les Gafam vivent aujourd'hui un retour en gr\u00e2ce tant ils se sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s utiles, pour ne pas dire incontournables, en temps de pand\u00e9mie. L'acronyme, apparu au milieu des ann\u00e9es 2000 pour regrouper Google, Amazon, Facebook et Apple et \u00e9largi \u00e0 Microsoft depuis son retour dans la course au cloud, a longtemps eu une connotation n\u00e9gative. Le Covid-19 a chang\u00e9 la donne. \"  Il est int\u00e9ressant de voir \u00e0 quel point cette crise a rendu la Big Tech sympathique \", s'\u00e9tonne Luca Paolini, responsable de la strat\u00e9gie du gestionnaire de fortunes Pictet Asset Management, qui misait pourtant jusque-l\u00e0 sur la d\u00e9saffection des valeurs technologiques. \" Agile, fiable, quasi indispensable, Amazon est presque devenu un service public \", confirme son confr\u00e8re de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de conseil financier Ritholtz Wealth Management, Josh Brown. St\u00e9phane Distinguin, le PDG de l'agence de veille num\u00e9rique fran\u00e7aise Fabernovel, le confirme avec une formule choc : \" Internet a gagn\u00e9 par K.-O. le match du confinement \". Ces derniers mois, en effet, les derniers r\u00e9fractaires au commerce en ligne ont confi\u00e9 leurs pr\u00e9cieux ravitaillements en p\u00e2tes et farine \u00e0 Amazon. Des seniors ont pris l'habitude de tromper leur isolement en encha\u00eenant des r\u00e9unions vid\u00e9o familiales sur WhatsApp. Le confinement a permis \u00e0 Facebook de franchir la barre des 3 milliards d'utilisateurs mensuels. Et des dizaines de millions de salari\u00e9s se sont convertis au t\u00e9l\u00e9travail gr\u00e2ce aux produits de Microsoft (Teams et Skype), leur prog\u00e9niture utilisant des outils comparables pour suivre des classes \u00e0 distance. \" Il a suffi de quelques semaines pour que la perception des Big Tech par le grand public change radicalement, estime St\u00e9phane Distinguin dont l'entreprise Fabernovel vient de sortir un ouvrage sur Les superpouvoirs des Gafa (Editions Eyrolles). A tel point que le politique est, sur ce sujet, en retard sur l'opinion. Bruno Le Maire, ( ministre fran\u00e7ais de l'Economie, Ndlr) semble pour le moins d\u00e9cal\u00e9 lorsqu'il met des b\u00e2tons dans les roues \u00e0 Amazon dans ce que je consid\u00e8re comme une d\u00e9fense douteuse de la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence nationale. \" La d\u00e9cision de la justice fran\u00e7aise de contraindre le g\u00e9ant am\u00e9ricain \u00e0 r\u00e9duire drastiquement ses activit\u00e9s \" non essentielles \" tant qu'il n'aurait pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 les risques li\u00e9s au virus, sous peine d'amende, a en effet divis\u00e9 l'opinion. Certains n'ont pas compris que \" la Fnac puisse continuer de livrer des grille-pains \" alors que les six centres logistiques d'Amazon dans l'Hexagone demeuraient ferm\u00e9s durant plusieurs semaines jusqu'au 19 mai. La Big Tech n'\u00e9tait pas toujours tr\u00e8s port\u00e9e sur le remote avant l'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie, pour des raisons essentiellement manag\u00e9riales. La crise sanitaire a pouss\u00e9 les g\u00e9ants du secteur \u00e0 se repenser. Google, Facebook et Microsoft ont \u00e9t\u00e9 parmi les premiers employeurs de la c\u00f4te Ouest \u00e0 fermer leurs bureaux d\u00e9but mars ; ils seront sans doute parmi les derniers \u00e0 les rouvrir. Facebook a \u00e9t\u00e9 le plus loin dans cette transformation en proposant de devenir une remote company, sans bureaux ! M\u00eame r\u00e9flexion chez Twitter, o\u00f9 le patron Jack Dorsey a ouvert l'option du t\u00e9l\u00e9travail \u00e0 vie pour la plupart des 5.000 salari\u00e9s. Chez Google, seuls 10% des 100.000 employ\u00e9s reviendront au bureau en juillet et 30% en septembre. Les autres toucheront 1.000 dollars de prime pour am\u00e9nager leur domicile, le t\u00e9l\u00e9travail restant de mise jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de 2020. Microsoft reste aussi prudent sur le pr\u00e9sentiel. Apple est le seul \u00e0 s'\u00eatre d\u00e9marqu\u00e9 en faisant physiquement revenir ses \u00e9quipes d\u00e8s la fin mai, y compris dans l'Apple Park. Certes, vanter les m\u00e9rites de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pas franchement r\u00e9put\u00e9e pour sa dimension sociale reste pol\u00e9mique dans le contexte actuel. Aux Etats-Unis comme en France, le groupe de Jeff Bezos est montr\u00e9 du doigt pour les conditions sanitaires dans lesquelles ses employ\u00e9s continuent d'exercer leur m\u00e9tier. Les m\u00e9dias lui reprochent avec de plus en plus d'insistance le renvoi des collaborateurs critiques. Ce qui n'emp\u00eache pas l'enseigne, qui d\u00e9tenait d\u00e9j\u00e0 40% du march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain avant la pand\u00e9mie, d'\u00eatre pl\u00e9biscit\u00e9e par des consommateurs trop prudents pour s'aventurer dans les magasins physiques. Ils passent chez Amazon des commandes plus fr\u00e9quentes, massives et diversifi\u00e9es - il y a de grandes chances que la tendance perdure. Sur les 12 derniers mois, les quantit\u00e9s de papier- toilette et de mouchoirs livr\u00e9es aux m\u00e9nages am\u00e9ricains depuis les entrep\u00f4ts d'Amazon ont ainsi tripl\u00e9, celles de nourriture pour chiens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 multipli\u00e9es par 13 ! Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette demande, Jeff Bezos a revisit\u00e9 \u00e0 sa fa\u00e7on les affichettes \" Help Wanted \" qui fleurissent traditionnellement dans les commerces am\u00e9ricains quand le moteur \u00e9conomique tourne \u00e0 plein r\u00e9gime. Sur le blog d'Amazon, il a invit\u00e9 \" tous ceux ayant perdu leur emploi \" \u00e0 rejoindre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la situation revienne \u00e0 la normale. Appel largement entendu : 175.000 personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es en renfort ces derniers mois, portant les effectifs totaux \u00e0... 1 million d'employ\u00e9s. En Europe \u00e9galement, les derni\u00e8res r\u00e9ticences face \u00e0 l'e-commerce tombent. En Allemagne, sur les 22% de n\u00e9ophytes qui ont pour la premi\u00e8re fois fait des achats en ligne en avril, pr\u00e8s des deux tiers avaient choisi Amazon, selon l'institut IFH de Cologne. Dans ce contexte, Amazon est le membre du quintette qui s'en tire le mieux. Alors que les quatre autres ont mis un peu de temps \u00e0 se remettre du plongeon boursier de la fin f\u00e9vrier (1.000 milliards de dollars effac\u00e9s en un mois ! ) mais affichent d\u00e9sormais tous une progression de leur cours en 2020, l'e-commer\u00e7ant a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9, d\u00e8s le 11 avril, d'un \u00e9poustouflant rallye. Premi\u00e8re fortune mondiale, Jeff Bezos, toujours d\u00e9tenteur de 11% de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il a fond\u00e9e en 1994, p\u00e8se d\u00e9sormais quelque 148,8 milliards de dollars. Jamais dans leur (relativement courte) histoire, les Gafam n'ont exerc\u00e9 un tel ascendant. La capitalisation du Club des cinq d\u00e9passe les 5.000 milliards de dollars, soit plus de 20% de l'indice S&amp;P 500 et m\u00eame 50% du Nasdaq 100, l'indice phare de la tech. Avant la crise financi\u00e8re de 2008, les cinq plus grosses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s cot\u00e9es (ExxonMobil, General Electric, AT&amp;T, Procter &amp; Gamble et, d\u00e9j\u00e0, Microsoft) valaient 1.600 milliards de dollars. Aujourd'hui, Apple et Microsoft se disputent la premi\u00e8re place autour de 1.400 milliards de dollars de capitalisation. Pas endett\u00e9es, dot\u00e9es d'\u00e9normes r\u00e9serves en cash accumul\u00e9es depuis 2009 et pr\u00e9sentes dans des gammes de produits dont la pand\u00e9mie ne fait qu'accro\u00eetre la demande (les florissants services de cloud, les outils de travail ou d'apprentissage \u00e0 distance, les messageries, les plateformes de divertissement, etc.), ces valeurs ont tout pour plaire. Fin avril, la valse de leurs r\u00e9sultats trimestriels a confirm\u00e9 leur attractivit\u00e9. Pas de grosse casse \u00e0 d\u00e9plorer, loin de l\u00e0, bien que 80% des recettes de Google ou Facebook proviennent d'annonces publicitaires aujourd'hui en berne, qu'Apple d\u00e9pende \u00e9troitement de la Chine pour sa production et ses d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s (le pays repr\u00e9sente 17% de son chiffre d'affaires) et que, chez Microsoft, Teams ou Skype ne profitent pas autant du boom des visioconf\u00e9rences que le disrupteur Zoom, plus facile d'utilisation et moins gourmand en bande passante. Globalement, les performances des Big Tech ont d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les attentes du march\u00e9. Tout en se gardant d'un triomphalisme d\u00e9plac\u00e9, leurs dirigeants donnent l'impression d'avoir \u00e9vit\u00e9 le pire. Tout au plus Google, qui pourrait encaisser le premier recul du chiffre d'affaires annuel de son histoire, se r\u00e9sout-il \u00e0 geler les embauches alors qu'il avait encore recrut\u00e9 20.000 personnes en 2019. Le budget marketing y est aussi r\u00e9duit de moiti\u00e9. Amazon pr\u00e9voit, pour sa part, des pertes op\u00e9rationnelles au deuxi\u00e8me trimestre, au lieu des 4 milliards de dollars de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices anticip\u00e9s \u00e0 l'origine, mais c'est le prix \u00e0 payer pour renforcer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de ses \u00e9quipes, augmenter leur salaire horaire et soutenir financi\u00e8rement les entreprises partenaires. Avec 300 millions d'utilisateurs chaque jour et une capitalisation de 59 milliards de dollars, Zoom s'est impos\u00e9e comme l'appli star de la pand\u00e9mie. Malgr\u00e9 les nombreuses critiques sur ses failles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, l'entreprise californienne de visioconf\u00e9rence n\u00e9e en 2011 a r\u00e9ussi l'exploit de \" disrupter \" un secteur domin\u00e9 par les Gafam. Mais ceux-ci n'ont pas tard\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9agir. Google et Facebook ont lanc\u00e9 des services gratuits destin\u00e9s aux particuliers (Hangouts Meet, aujourd'hui Google Meet, et Messenger Rooms) dont l'interface copie les aspects les plus ludiques de Zoom. Microsoft compte, lui, sur Teams, dont la derni\u00e8re campagne de pub vante la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Une offre gratuite de six mois a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9e pour s\u00e9duire les professionnels et une version grand public devrait, d'apr\u00e8s le site The Verge, sortir d'ici l'\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 destination des familles \u00e9clat\u00e9es, des groupes d'amis pr\u00e9parant un projet commun ou des membres de clubs de lecture. Dans ce contexte, les Gafam peuvent se payer le luxe de se diversifier et de pr\u00e9parer ainsi un avenir encore plus rose. \" Ils sont les seuls \u00e0 pouvoir jouer l'offensive \", souligne Scott Galloway, professeur \u00e0 la Stern School of Business de l'universit\u00e9 de New York et auteur d'un best-seller intitul\u00e9 The Four - Le R\u00e8gne des quatre : la face cach\u00e9e d'Amazon, Apple, Facebook et Google (Editions Quanto). Charles Dickens avait, il y a plus de 150 ans, compar\u00e9 la condition de Londres et de Paris durant la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise dans son c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Conte des deux cit\u00e9s. Aujourd'hui, c'est, selon cet universitaire new-yorkais jamais \u00e0 court de petites phrases, \" le conte des deux Am\u00e9riques qui s'\u00e9crit devant nous \". \" Il y a les Big Tech et les autres \", r\u00e9sume-t-il sans nuance. Alors que tant de concurrents, m\u00eame chez les plus agiles (Airbnb, Uber, etc.) licencient en masse, les Gafam peuvent se permettre de prendre des d\u00e9cisions strat\u00e9giques de nature \u00e0 les renforcer \u00e0 moyen terme. Ils investissent notamment dans les cr\u00e9neaux o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient relativement en retard. Avec ses 83 milliards de dollars de tr\u00e9sorerie nette, Apple peut presque tout racheter. \" Ces 10 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, l'entreprise avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 mis la main sur 86 soci\u00e9t\u00e9s tech, plut\u00f4t de petits deals en dehors du rachat de Beats en 2014. Elle a, depuis le d\u00e9but de la pand\u00e9mie, acquis plusieurs entreprises qui augmentent sa proposition de valeur \", explique J\u00e9r\u00e9my Ta\u00efeb, analyste financier chez Fabernovel. Sont ainsi tomb\u00e9s dans son escarcelle l'appli m\u00e9t\u00e9o Dark Sky, le sp\u00e9cialiste de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle NextVR, la p\u00e9pite de l'intelligence artificielle Voysis et celle de machine learning Inductiv, qui permettront d'am\u00e9liorer le fonctionnement de son assistant vocal Siri. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Tim Cook a parall\u00e8lement d\u00e9voil\u00e9 un nouvel iPhone moins cher que les mod\u00e8les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et propos\u00e9 une offre gratuite d'Apple Music pendant six mois dans 52 pays. Quel meilleur contexte que le confinement pour promouvoir un service de divertissement ? Dans la m\u00eame logique, Google offrait deux mois sur Stadia, sa plateforme de cloud gaming lanc\u00e9e \u00e0 l'automne, alors que Facebook anticipait de trois mois le lancement de son appli mobile de gaming, dans l'espoir de grignoter les positions bien \u00e9tablies des poids lourds Twitch (propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Amazon) et YouTube (Google). Les Gafam se tirent frontalement la bourre. Mark Zuckerberg part ainsi \u00e0 l'assaut d'Amazon avec ses \" Shops \", lanc\u00e9s le 19 mai, qui permettent aux entreprises de vendre leurs produits sur Facebook et Instagram moyennant une commission minime. Il a investi 5,7 milliards de dollars dans Reliance Jio, le premier op\u00e9rateur t\u00e9l\u00e9coms indien, dans l'espoir de d\u00e9fier Amazon et Flipkart (Walmart) sur ce march\u00e9 extr\u00eamement convoit\u00e9. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, Amazon arriverait sur le terrain de Google en rachetant la start-up Zoox pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer dans la voiture autonome, selon le Wall Street Journal. Les Big Five ont \u00e9galement profit\u00e9 du d\u00e9sarroi d'autorit\u00e9s d\u00e9pass\u00e9es par la pand\u00e9mie pour se pr\u00e9senter comme leurs alli\u00e9s dans la lutte contre ce mal inconnu. Mark Zuckerberg a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 l'\u00e9tat d'esprit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en publiant dans le Washington Post une tribune sur l'utilit\u00e9 des data pour mod\u00e9liser la pand\u00e9mie. Les malades du Covid-19 utilisateurs de Facebook, mais aussi de Google, sont invit\u00e9s \u00e0 signaler leurs sympt\u00f4mes pour permettre au r\u00e9seau social, en coop\u00e9ration avec l'universit\u00e9 Carnegie Mellon, de visualiser la propagation du virus. Microsoft a, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, aid\u00e9 l'universit\u00e9 John Hopkins dans ses statistiques. Google et Apple ont m\u00eame laiss\u00e9 leurs vieilles escarmouches de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour sortir une appli qui trace les donn\u00e9es des personnes contamin\u00e9es. Cet Exposure Notification System a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 la disposition des gouvernements le 20 mai : 22 pays sur les cinq continents auraient manifest\u00e9 leur int\u00e9r\u00eat. \" C'est le reflet d'une profonde \u00e9volution, expliquait r\u00e9cemment Thomas Gomart, le directeur de l'Ifri (Institut fran\u00e7ais des relations internationales). Les Etats entrent dans des logiques de r\u00e9seaux priv\u00e9s et les plateformes num\u00e9riques dans des logiques souveraines. Cette interaction a pour cons\u00e9quence de faire voler en \u00e9clat la ligne de d\u00e9marcation public-priv\u00e9, en particulier en ce qui concerne la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e. \" Ce glissement divise les Europ\u00e9ens : si l'Italie et l'Allemagne ont fait confiance au duo am\u00e9ricain pour son appli de tracing, les discussions ont achopp\u00e9 en France comme au Royaume-Uni sur des consid\u00e9rations aussi techniques que politiques. \" Et pourquoi pas, apr\u00e8s-demain, une appli qui permettra aux Gafam de collecter nos imp\u00f4ts ? \", s'indigne Gilles Babinet. Le vice-pr\u00e9sident du Conseil national du num\u00e9rique et voix de la France \u00e0 la Commission europ\u00e9enne s'alarme que certains Etats proposent de \" substituer \u00e0 nos qualit\u00e9s de citoyens celles de consommateurs \". La pand\u00e9mie aura-t-elle balay\u00e9 les menaces r\u00e9glementaires qui planaient sur les Gafam ? Certaines initiatives semblent avoir perdu leur caract\u00e8re d'urgence, comme les discussions de l'OCDE sur la taxation du num\u00e9rique. La perspective d'un accord politique est repouss\u00e9e \u00e0 octobre, au mieux. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, Bruxelles est tiraill\u00e9e entre la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de s'attaquer \u00e0 la question br\u00fblante du rachat par la Chine des entreprises europ\u00e9ennes affaiblies par la crise, et le besoin de muscler la lutte contre les Gafam, peu concluante jusqu'ici. Sous la pression de la vice-pr\u00e9sidente de l'ex\u00e9cutif europ\u00e9en Margrethe Vestager, une concertation vient d'\u00eatre ouverte sur la cr\u00e9ation d'un nouvel outil de concurrence, qui permettrait de d\u00e9clencher des enqu\u00eates tr\u00e8s en amont sur les monopoles num\u00e9riques. Le dossier aboutirait d'ici la fin de l'ann\u00e9e ou d\u00e9but 2021, si les Etats membres arrivent \u00e0 s'entendre. \"  En temps normal, les Europ\u00e9ens ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 du mal \u00e0 s'aligner sur une position unique envers les Gafam, l'Allemagne et la Grande-Bretagne penchant traditionnellement du c\u00f4t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain, d\u00e9plore Gilles Babinet. Comme le poids de Berlin va se renforcer avec la pr\u00e9sidence du Conseil de l'Union europ\u00e9enne \u00e0 partir de juillet, je suis plut\u00f4t inquiet. \" Difficile de pr\u00e9dire, \u00e9galement, le r\u00e9sultat des enqu\u00eates lanc\u00e9es l'an dernier par le Departement of Justice et la Federal Trade Commission sur les violations potentielles des r\u00e8gles antitrust par Amazon, Apple, Facebook et Google. L'administration Trump se pr\u00e9parerait \u00e0 ouvrir une enqu\u00eate de grande ampleur sur le moteur de recherche du groupe Alphabet, mais sera-t-elle aussi historique que celle visant Microsoft au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1990 ? Au nom du principe de r\u00e9alit\u00e9, beaucoup d'Etats seront sans doute tent\u00e9s d'arrondir les angles. Car rares sont les entreprises \u00e0 pouvoir investir autant dans la reprise et l'emploi. Facebook mise par exemple sur 10.000 cr\u00e9ations de postes d'ing\u00e9nieurs et de managers produits d'ici la fin de 2020. Alors que l'autorit\u00e9 britannique de la concurrence bloquait depuis pr\u00e8s d'un an l'investissement minoritaire d'Amazon dans Deliveroo, elle a accept\u00e9 de reconsid\u00e9rer le dossier face au risque de faillite du fleuron national. Le g\u00e9ant de Seattle a les reins suffisamment solides pour s'imposer sur le march\u00e9.

Cela fait neuf ans que ce businessman du genre expansif a \u00e9t\u00e9 contraint de rendre son titre de PDG de Google, et presque trois qu'il a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 celui de pr\u00e9sident ex\u00e9cutif d'Alphabet (le holding qui englobe la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e par Larry Page et Sergue\u00ef Brin), mais le sexag\u00e9naire n'a rien perdu de ce franc-parler qui lui a si souvent valu d'\u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de gaffeur en chef de la \u00ab Corporate America \u00bb. Celui qui dirigea Google de 2001 \u00e0 2011 se permettait ainsi de bousculer \u00e0 nouveau les convenances lors d'un livestream organis\u00e9 le 14 avril par l'Economic Club de New York.</p><p>Les Am\u00e9ricains devraient se montrer \u00ab un peu plus reconnaissants \u00bb envers les grandes entreprises technologiques, estimait-il - \u00e0 bonne distance - devant l'audience tri\u00e9e sur le volet de cette v\u00e9n\u00e9rable association. \u00ab Pensez \u00e0 ce que serait, en ce moment, votre vie sans Amazon. Les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de la tech, que nous adorons d\u00e9nigrer, ont accumul\u00e9 le capital, r\u00e9alis\u00e9 les investissements, construit les outils qui nous aident aujourd'hui. Imaginez la m\u00eame r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sans eux. J'esp\u00e8re que les gens sauront s'en souvenir lorsque cette crise sanitaire sera enfin termin\u00e9e. \u00bb</p><p>Bien qu'il ne soit plus actif chez Google, o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait encore conseiller technique jusqu'\u00e0 r\u00e9cemment, Eric Schmidt reste tr\u00e8s influent dans les sph\u00e8res du pouvoir : il pr\u00e9side non seulement le Defense Innovation Board, un groupe consultatif qui a ses entr\u00e9es au Pentagone, et la National Security Commission of Artificial Intelligence, proche du Congr\u00e8s, mais il vient d'\u00eatre charg\u00e9 par le gouverneur Andrew Cuomo d'imaginer les r\u00e9formes d'\u00e9ducation et de sant\u00e9 qui permettront \u00e0 l'Etat de New York de se r\u00e9inventer apr\u00e8s la pand\u00e9mie.</p><p>Hier conspu\u00e9s pour leurs pratiques anticoncurrentielles, vilipend\u00e9s pour leurs montages fiscaux et souvent per\u00e7us comme les symboles des exc\u00e8s de l'Am\u00e9rique, les Gafam vivent aujourd'hui un retour en gr ce tant ils se sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s utiles, pour ne pas dire incontournables, en temps de pand\u00e9mie. L'acronyme, apparu au milieu des ann\u00e9es 2000 pour regrouper Google, Amazon, Facebook et Apple et \u00e9largi \u00e0 Microsoft depuis son retour dans la course au cloud, a longtemps eu une connotation n\u00e9gative. Le Covid-19 a chang\u00e9 la donne.</p><p>\u00ab Il est int\u00e9ressant de voir \u00e0 quel point cette crise a rendu la Big Tech sympathique \u00bb, s'\u00e9tonne Luca Paolini, responsable de la strat\u00e9gie du gestionnaire de fortunes Pictet Asset Management, qui misait pourtant jusque-l\u00e0 sur la d\u00e9saffection des valeurs technologiques. \u00ab Agile, fiable, quasi indispensable, Amazon est presque devenu un service public \u00bb, confirme son confr\u00e8re de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de conseil financier Ritholtz Wealth Management, Josh Brown. St\u00e9phane Distinguin, le PDG de l'agence de veille num\u00e9rique fran\u00e7aise Fabernovel, le confirme avec une formule choc : \u00ab Internet a gagn\u00e9 par K.-O. le match du confinement \u00bb. Ces derniers mois, en effet, les derniers r\u00e9fractaires au commerce en ligne ont confi\u00e9 leurs pr\u00e9cieux ravitaillements en p tes et farine \u00e0 Amazon. Des seniors ont pris l'habitude de tromper leur isolement en encha\u00eenant des r\u00e9unions vid\u00e9o familiales sur WhatsApp. Le confinement a permis \u00e0 Facebook de franchir la barre des 3 milliards d'utilisateurs mensuels. Et des dizaines de millions de salari\u00e9s se sont convertis au t\u00e9l\u00e9travail gr ce aux produits de Microsoft (Teams et Skype), leur prog\u00e9niture utilisant des outils comparables pour suivre des classes \u00e0 distance.</p><p>\u00ab Il a suffi de quelques semaines pour que la perception des Big Tech par le grand public change radicalement, estime St\u00e9phane Distinguin dont l'entreprise Fabernovel vient de sortir un ouvrage sur Les superpouvoirs des Gafa (Editions Eyrolles). A tel point que le politique est, sur ce sujet, en retard sur l'opinion. Bruno Le Maire, (ministre fran\u00e7ais de l'Economie, Ndlr) semble pour le moins d\u00e9cal\u00e9 lorsqu'il met des b tons dans les roues \u00e0 Amazon dans ce que je consid\u00e8re comme une d\u00e9fense douteuse de la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence nationale. \u00bb</p><p>La d\u00e9cision de la justice fran\u00e7aise de contraindre le g\u00e9ant am\u00e9ricain \u00e0 r\u00e9duire drastiquement ses activit\u00e9s \u00ab non essentielles \u00bb tant qu'il n'aurait pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 les risques li\u00e9s au virus, sous peine d'amende, a en effet divis\u00e9 l'opinion. Certains n'ont pas compris que \u00ab la Fnac puisse continuer de livrer des grille-pains \u00bb alors que les six centres logistiques d'Amazon dans l'Hexagone demeuraient ferm\u00e9s durant plusieurs semaines jusqu'au 19 mai.</p><p>La Big Tech n'\u00e9tait pas toujours tr\u00e8s port\u00e9e sur le remote avant l'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie, pour des raisons essentiellement manag\u00e9riales. La crise sanitaire a pouss\u00e9 les g\u00e9ants du secteur \u00e0 se repenser. Google, Facebook et Microsoft ont \u00e9t\u00e9 parmi les premiers employeurs de la c\u00f4te Ouest \u00e0 fermer leurs bureaux d\u00e9but mars ; ils seront sans doute parmi les derniers \u00e0 les rouvrir. Facebook a \u00e9t\u00e9 le plus loin dans cette transformation en proposant de devenir une remote company, sans bureaux ! M\u00eame r\u00e9flexion chez Twitter, o\u00f9 le patron Jack Dorsey a ouvert l'option du t\u00e9l\u00e9travail \u00e0 vie pour la plupart des 5.000 salari\u00e9s. Chez Google, seuls 10% des 100.000 employ\u00e9s reviendront au bureau en juillet et 30% en septembre. Les autres toucheront 1.000 dollars de prime pour am\u00e9nager leur domicile, le t\u00e9l\u00e9travail restant de mise jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de 2020. Microsoft reste aussi prudent sur le pr\u00e9sentiel. Apple est le seul \u00e0 s'\u00eatre d\u00e9marqu\u00e9 en faisant physiquement revenir ses \u00e9quipes d\u00e8s la fin mai, y compris dans l'Apple Park.</p><p>Certes, vanter les m\u00e9rites de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pas franchement r\u00e9put\u00e9e pour sa dimension sociale reste pol\u00e9mique dans le contexte actuel. Aux Etats-Unis comme en France, le groupe de Jeff Bezos est montr\u00e9 du doigt pour les conditions sanitaires dans lesquelles ses employ\u00e9s continuent d'exercer leur m\u00e9tier. Les m\u00e9dias lui reprochent avec de plus en plus d'insistance le renvoi des collaborateurs critiques. Ce qui n'emp\u00eache pas l'enseigne, qui d\u00e9tenait d\u00e9j\u00e0 40% du march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain avant la pand\u00e9mie, d'\u00eatre pl\u00e9biscit\u00e9e par des consommateurs trop prudents pour s'aventurer dans les magasins physiques.</p><p>Ils passent chez Amazon des commandes plus fr\u00e9quentes, massives et diversifi\u00e9es - il y a de grandes chances que la tendance perdure. Sur les 12 derniers mois, les quantit\u00e9s de papier- toilette et de mouchoirs livr\u00e9es aux m\u00e9nages am\u00e9ricains depuis les entrep\u00f4ts d'Amazon ont ainsi tripl\u00e9, celles de nourriture pour chiens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 multipli\u00e9es par 13 ! Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette demande, Jeff Bezos a revisit\u00e9 \u00e0 sa fa\u00e7on les affichettes \u00ab Help Wanted \u00bb qui fleurissent traditionnellement dans les commerces am\u00e9ricains quand le moteur \u00e9conomique tourne \u00e0 plein r\u00e9gime. Sur le blog d'Amazon, il a invit\u00e9 \u00ab tous ceux ayant perdu leur emploi \u00bb \u00e0 rejoindre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la situation revienne \u00e0 la normale.</p><p>Appel largement entendu : 175.000 personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es en renfort ces derniers mois, portant les effectifs totaux \u00e0... 1 million d'employ\u00e9s. En Europe \u00e9galement, les derni\u00e8res r\u00e9ticences face \u00e0 l'e-commerce tombent. En Allemagne, sur les 22% de n\u00e9ophytes qui ont pour la premi\u00e8re fois fait des achats en ligne en avril, pr\u00e8s des deux tiers avaient choisi Amazon, selon l'institut IFH de Cologne.</p><p>Dans ce contexte, Amazon est le membre du quintette qui s'en tire le mieux. Alors que les quatre autres ont mis un peu de temps \u00e0 se remettre du plongeon boursier de la fin f\u00e9vrier (1.000 milliards de dollars effac\u00e9s en un mois ! ) mais affichent d\u00e9sormais tous une progression de leur cours en 2020, l'e-commer\u00e7ant a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9, d\u00e8s le 11 avril, d'un \u00e9poustouflant rallye.</p><p>Premi\u00e8re fortune mondiale, Jeff Bezos, toujours d\u00e9tenteur de 11% de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il a fond\u00e9e en 1994, p\u00e8se d\u00e9sormais quelque 148,8 milliards de dollars. Jamais dans leur (relativement courte) histoire, les Gafam n'ont exerc\u00e9 un tel ascendant. La capitalisation du Club des cinq d\u00e9passe les 5.000 milliards de dollars, soit plus de 20% de l'indice S&amp;P 500 et m\u00eame 50% du Nasdaq 100, l'indice phare de la tech.</p><p>Avant la crise financi\u00e8re de 2008, les cinq plus grosses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s cot\u00e9es (ExxonMobil, General Electric, AT&amp;T, Procter &amp; Gamble et, d\u00e9j\u00e0, Microsoft) valaient 1.600 milliards de dollars. Aujourd'hui, Apple et Microsoft se disputent la premi\u00e8re place autour de 1.400 milliards de dollars de capitalisation. Pas endett\u00e9es, dot\u00e9es d'\u00e9normes r\u00e9serves en cash accumul\u00e9es depuis 2009 et pr\u00e9sentes dans des gammes de produits dont la pand\u00e9mie ne fait qu'accro\u00eetre la demande (les florissants services de cloud, les outils de travail ou d'apprentissage \u00e0 distance, les messageries, les plateformes de divertissement, etc.), ces valeurs ont tout pour plaire.</p><p>Fin avril, la valse de leurs r\u00e9sultats trimestriels a confirm\u00e9 leur attractivit\u00e9. Pas de grosse casse \u00e0 d\u00e9plorer, loin de l\u00e0, bien que 80% des recettes de Google ou Facebook proviennent d'annonces publicitaires aujourd'hui en berne, qu'Apple d\u00e9pende \u00e9troitement de la Chine pour sa production et ses d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s (le pays repr\u00e9sente 17% de son chiffre d'affaires) et que, chez Microsoft, Teams ou Skype ne profitent pas autant du boom des visioconf\u00e9rences que le disrupteur Zoom, plus facile d'utilisation et moins gourmand en bande passante.</p><p>Globalement, les performances des Big Tech ont d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les attentes du march\u00e9. Tout en se gardant d'un triomphalisme d\u00e9plac\u00e9, leurs dirigeants donnent l'impression d'avoir \u00e9vit\u00e9 le pire. Tout au plus Google, qui pourrait encaisser le premier recul du chiffre d'affaires annuel de son histoire, se r\u00e9sout-il \u00e0 geler les embauches alors qu'il avait encore recrut\u00e9 20.000 personnes en 2019. Le budget marketing y est aussi r\u00e9duit de moiti\u00e9.</p><p>Amazon pr\u00e9voit, pour sa part, des pertes op\u00e9rationnelles au deuxi\u00e8me trimestre, au lieu des 4 milliards de dollars de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices anticip\u00e9s \u00e0 l'origine, mais c'est le prix \u00e0 payer pour renforcer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de ses \u00e9quipes, augmenter leur salaire horaire et soutenir financi\u00e8rement les entreprises partenaires.</p><p>Avec 300 millions d'utilisateurs chaque jour et une capitalisation de 59 milliards de dollars, Zoom s'est impos\u00e9e comme l'appli star de la pand\u00e9mie. Malgr\u00e9 les nombreuses critiques sur ses failles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, l'entreprise californienne de visioconf\u00e9rence n\u00e9e en 2011 a r\u00e9ussi l'exploit de \u00ab disrupter \u00bb un secteur domin\u00e9 par les Gafam. Mais ceux-ci n'ont pas tard\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9agir. Google et Facebook ont lanc\u00e9 des services gratuits destin\u00e9s aux particuliers (Hangouts Meet, aujourd'hui Google Meet, et Messenger Rooms) dont l'interface copie les aspects les plus ludiques de Zoom. Microsoft compte, lui, sur Teams, dont la derni\u00e8re campagne de pub vante la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Une offre gratuite de six mois a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9e pour s\u00e9duire les professionnels et une version grand public devrait, d'apr\u00e8s le site The Verge, sortir d'ici l'\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 destination des familles \u00e9clat\u00e9es, des groupes d'amis pr\u00e9parant un projet commun ou des membres de clubs de lecture.</p><p>Dans ce contexte, les Gafam peuvent se payer le luxe de se diversifier et de pr\u00e9parer ainsi un avenir encore plus rose. \u00ab Ils sont les seuls \u00e0 pouvoir jouer l'offensive \u00bb, souligne Scott Galloway, professeur \u00e0 la Stern School of Business de l'universit\u00e9 de New York et auteur d'un best-seller intitul\u00e9 The Four - Le R\u00e8gne des quatre : la face cach\u00e9e d'Amazon, Apple, Facebook et Google(Editions Quanto). Charles Dickens avait, il y a plus de 150 ans, compar\u00e9 la condition de Londres et de Paris durant la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise dans son c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Conte des deux cit\u00e9s. Aujourd'hui, c'est, selon cet universitaire new-yorkais jamais \u00e0 court de petites phrases, \u00ab le conte des deux Am\u00e9riques qui s'\u00e9crit devant nous \u00bb. \u00ab Il y a les Big Tech et les autres \u00bb, r\u00e9sume-t-il sans nuance. Alors que tant de concurrents, m\u00eame chez les plus agiles (Airbnb, Uber, etc.) licencient en masse, les Gafam peuvent se permettre de prendre des d\u00e9cisions strat\u00e9giques de nature \u00e0 les renforcer \u00e0 moyen terme.</p><p>Ils investissent notamment dans les cr\u00e9neaux o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient relativement en retard. Avec ses 83 milliards de dollars de tr\u00e9sorerie nette, Apple peut presque tout racheter. \u00ab Ces 10 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, l'entreprise avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 mis la main sur 86 soci\u00e9t\u00e9s tech, plut\u00f4t de petits deals en dehors du rachat de Beats en 2014. Elle a, depuis le d\u00e9but de la pand\u00e9mie, acquis plusieurs entreprises qui augmentent sa proposition de valeur \u00bb, explique J\u00e9r\u00e9my Ta\u00efeb, analyste financier chez Fabernovel.</p><p>Sont ainsi tomb\u00e9s dans son escarcelle l'appli m\u00e9t\u00e9o Dark Sky, le sp\u00e9cialiste de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle NextVR, la p\u00e9pite de l'intelligence artificielle Voysis et celle de machine learningInductiv, qui permettront d'am\u00e9liorer le fonctionnement de son assistant vocal Siri. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Tim Cook a parall\u00e8lement d\u00e9voil\u00e9 un nouvel iPhone moins cher que les mod\u00e8les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et propos\u00e9 une offre gratuite d'Apple Music pendant six mois dans 52 pays. Quel meilleur contexte que le confinement pour promouvoir un service de divertissement ?</p><p>Dans la m\u00eame logique, Google offrait deux mois sur Stadia, sa plateforme de cloud gaming lanc\u00e9e \u00e0 l'automne, alors que Facebook anticipait de trois mois le lancement de son appli mobile de gaming, dans l'espoir de grignoter les positions bien \u00e9tablies des poids lourds Twitch (propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Amazon) et YouTube (Google). Les Gafam se tirent frontalement la bourre. Mark Zuckerberg part ainsi \u00e0 l'assaut d'Amazon avec ses \u00ab Shops \u00bb, lanc\u00e9s le 19 mai, qui permettent aux entreprises de vendre leurs produits sur Facebook et Instagram moyennant une commission minime. Il a investi 5,7 milliards de dollars dans Reliance Jio, le premier op\u00e9rateur t\u00e9l\u00e9coms indien, dans l'espoir de d\u00e9fier Amazon et Flipkart (Walmart) sur ce march\u00e9 extr\u00eamement convoit\u00e9. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, Amazon arriverait sur le terrain de Google en rachetant la start-up Zoox pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer dans la voiture autonome, selon le Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Les Big Five ont \u00e9galement profit\u00e9 du d\u00e9sarroi d'autorit\u00e9s d\u00e9pass\u00e9es par la pand\u00e9mie pour se pr\u00e9senter comme leurs alli\u00e9s dans la lutte contre ce mal inconnu. Mark Zuckerberg a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 l'\u00e9tat d'esprit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en publiant dans le Washington Post une tribune sur l'utilit\u00e9 des data pour mod\u00e9liser la pand\u00e9mie. Les malades du Covid-19 utilisateurs de Facebook, mais aussi de Google, sont invit\u00e9s \u00e0 signaler leurs sympt\u00f4mes pour permettre au r\u00e9seau social, en coop\u00e9ration avec l'universit\u00e9 Carnegie Mellon, de visualiser la propagation du virus. Microsoft a, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, aid\u00e9 l'universit\u00e9 John Hopkins dans ses statistiques.</p><p>Google et Apple ont m\u00eame laiss\u00e9 leurs vieilles escarmouches de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour sortir une appli qui trace les donn\u00e9es des personnes contamin\u00e9es. Cet Exposure Notification System a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 la disposition des gouvernements le 20 mai : 22 pays sur les cinq continents auraient manifest\u00e9 leur int\u00e9r\u00eat. \u00ab C'est le reflet d'une profonde \u00e9volution, expliquait r\u00e9cemment Thomas Gomart, le directeur de l'Ifri (Institut fran\u00e7ais des relations internationales). Les Etats entrent dans des logiques de r\u00e9seaux priv\u00e9s et les plateformes num\u00e9riques dans des logiques souveraines. Cette interaction a pour cons\u00e9quence de faire voler en \u00e9clat la ligne de d\u00e9marcation public-priv\u00e9, en particulier en ce qui concerne la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e. \u00bb</p><p>Ce glissement divise les Europ\u00e9ens : si l'Italie et l'Allemagne ont fait confiance au duo am\u00e9ricain pour son appli de tracing, les discussions ont achopp\u00e9 en France comme au Royaume-Uni sur des consid\u00e9rations aussi techniques que politiques. \u00ab Et pourquoi pas, apr\u00e8s-demain, une appli qui permettra aux Gafam de collecter nos imp\u00f4ts ? \u00bb, s'indigne Gilles Babinet. Le vice-pr\u00e9sident du Conseil national du num\u00e9rique et voix de la France \u00e0 la Commission europ\u00e9enne s'alarme que certains Etats proposent de \u00ab substituer \u00e0 nos qualit\u00e9s de citoyens celles de consommateurs \u00bb.</p><p>La pand\u00e9mie aura-t-elle balay\u00e9 les menaces r\u00e9glementaires qui planaient sur les Gafam ? Certaines initiatives semblent avoir perdu leur caract\u00e8re d'urgence, comme les discussions de l'OCDE sur la taxation du num\u00e9rique. La perspective d'un accord politique est repouss\u00e9e \u00e0 octobre, au mieux. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, Bruxelles est tiraill\u00e9e entre la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de s'attaquer \u00e0 la question br\u00fblante du rachat par la Chine des entreprises europ\u00e9ennes affaiblies par la crise, et le besoin de muscler la lutte contre les Gafam, peu concluante jusqu'ici.</p><p>Sous la pression de la vice-pr\u00e9sidente de l'ex\u00e9cutif europ\u00e9en Margrethe Vestager, une concertation vient d'\u00eatre ouverte sur la cr\u00e9ation d'un nouvel outil de concurrence, qui permettrait de d\u00e9clencher des enqu\u00eates tr\u00e8s en amont sur les monopoles num\u00e9riques. Le dossier aboutirait d'ici la fin de l'ann\u00e9e ou d\u00e9but 2021, si les Etats membres arrivent \u00e0 s'entendre. \u00ab En temps normal, les Europ\u00e9ens ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 du mal \u00e0 s'aligner sur une position unique envers les Gafam, l'Allemagne et la Grande-Bretagne penchant traditionnellement du c\u00f4t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain, d\u00e9plore Gilles Babinet. Comme le poids de Berlin va se renforcer avec la pr\u00e9sidence du Conseil de l'Union europ\u00e9enne \u00e0 partir de juillet, je suis plut\u00f4t inquiet. \u00bb</p><p>Difficile de pr\u00e9dire, \u00e9galement, le r\u00e9sultat des enqu\u00eates lanc\u00e9es l'an dernier par le Departement of Justice et la Federal Trade Commission sur les violations potentielles des r\u00e8gles antitrust par Amazon, Apple, Facebook et Google. L'administration Trump se pr\u00e9parerait \u00e0 ouvrir une enqu\u00eate de grande ampleur sur le moteur de recherche du groupe Alphabet, mais sera-t-elle aussi historique que celle visant Microsoft au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1990 ?</p><p>Au nom du principe de r\u00e9alit\u00e9, beaucoup d'Etats seront sans doute tent\u00e9s d'arrondir les angles. Car rares sont les entreprises \u00e0 pouvoir investir autant dans la reprise et l'emploi. Facebook mise par exemple sur 10.000 cr\u00e9ations de postes d'ing\u00e9nieurs et de managers produits d'ici la fin de 2020. Alors que l'autorit\u00e9 britannique de la concurrence bloquait depuis pr\u00e8s d'un an l'investissement minoritaire d'Amazon dans Deliveroo, elle a accept\u00e9 de reconsid\u00e9rer le dossier face au risque de faillite du fleuron national. Le g\u00e9ant de Seattle a les reins suffisamment solides pour s'imposer sur le march\u00e9. Avec ou sans ce rachat...</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRNDFR-TE20270561intern</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRNDFR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6085-HB31-JCSJ-119F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306763</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3087\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Roularta Media Group Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Trends/Tendances</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"41051\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>2 Juillet 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Le 30 mars, le d\u00e9bat organis\u00e9 par son institut a r\u00e9uni pas moins de quatre candidats : la s\u00e9natrice du Minnesota Amy Klobuchar, l'\u00e9toile montante du parti d\u00e9mocrate Julian Castro, l'ancien d\u00e9put\u00e9 du Maryland John Delaney et l'ex-professeure \u00e0 Harvard Elizabeth Warren, une des favorites de la primaire. Deux d'entre eux tiennent les plateformes en joue : ex-membre de la commission de la concurrence au S\u00e9nat, Amy Klobuchar a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, en f\u00e9vrier, un projet de loi durcissant les conditions des fusions. Quant \u00e0 Elizabeth Warren, elle veut que les groupes r\u00e9alisant plus de 25 milliards de dollars de chiffre d'affaires, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00ab plateformes de service public \u00bb, n'aient plus le droit de commercialiser leurs propres produits : Amazon devrait cesser de vendre ses articles Amazon Basic Products, Facebook se s\u00e9parerait d'Instagram et de WhatsApp, Google ne pourrait plus promouvoir ses propres services.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Je suis d'accord sur le diagnostic mais pas sur les rem\u00e8des \u00bb</emphasis>, r\u00e9agit l'\u00e9conomiste Hal Singer. Cet expert en droit de la concurrence a lui aussi constat\u00e9 les effets d\u00e9vastateurs des concentrations. L'un des pr\u00e9judices les plus graves caus\u00e9s par les big tech est de tuer dans l'oeuf les innovations. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Une \u00e9tude r\u00e9alis\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de vingt grands fonds de capital-risque de la Silicon Valley montre que la premi\u00e8re raison invoqu\u00e9e pour ne pas financer un projet est le risque que Facebook se l'approprie \u00bb,</emphasis>souligne-t-il.

Certains militent pour une nouvelle autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation. Expert des t\u00e9l\u00e9coms, Harold Feld, directeur de l'ONG Public Knowledge, pr\u00f4ne ainsi la cr\u00e9ation d'un nouveau r\u00e9gulateur. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab L'importance des plateformes d\u00e9borde l'\u00e9conomie.

En octobre dernier, le s\u00e9nateur d\u00e9mocrate Mark Warner a propos\u00e9 un arsenal de vingt mesures pour encadrer les plateformes en ligne. Il y sugg\u00e8re entre autres l'adoption d'un texte \u00e9quivalent au R\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la protection des donn\u00e9es (RGPD), l'obligation d'identifier et interdire les robots, des r\u00e8gles plus muscl\u00e9es sur la publicit\u00e9 \u00e9lectorale... <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab Une prise de conscience \u00e9merge, aussi bien chez les d\u00e9mocrates que chez les r\u00e9publicains, sur l'\u00e9norme pouvoir des plateformes.

Lorsqu'en mai 1998, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, suivi par une vingtaine d'Etats am\u00e9ricains, d\u00e9cide d'attaquer Microsoft pour ses pratiques anticoncurrentielles, le jeu du chat et de la souris dure depuis huit ans d\u00e9j\u00e0. L'entreprise \u00e9tait accus\u00e9e d'abuser de sa position dominante - Windows \u00e9quipait plus de huit PC sur 10. Et les \u00e9quipes de Bill Gates ont profit\u00e9 de cet avantage pour d\u00e9molir leur rival Netscape, concurrent de leur navigateur Explorer.</p><p> La division antitrust a voulu frapper un grand coup. Et en 2000, les juges ont ordonn\u00e9 le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement du g\u00e9ant informatique : le syst\u00e8me d'exploitation Windows serait commercialis\u00e9 par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et les logiciels applicatifs, comme la suite bureautique Office, par une autre. Mais les cohortes de juristes de Microsoft r\u00e9ussiront \u00e0 trouver un accord amiable, deux ans plus tard. Dans la d\u00e9cennie qui a suivi, l'\u00e9diteur informatique subira une s\u00e9rie d'actions en justice men\u00e9es par la Commission europ\u00e9enne sur ses pratiques anticoncurrentielles. Le groupe sera notamment contraint de donner le choix de plusieurs navigateurs aux utilisateurs de son programme Windows et \u00e9copera d'une amende de 561 millions d'euros pour non-respect de cette obligation. Ces batailles judiciaires n'ont pas d\u00e9truit Microsoft, loin de l\u00e0. Mais elles ont favoris\u00e9 l'\u00e9mergence d'un mastodonte dans l'industrie Internet : Android de Google poss\u00e8de aujourd'hui 75 % du march\u00e9 des syst\u00e8mes d'exploitation pour mobile. Microsoft en d\u00e9tient moins de 1 %.  </p><p> Elizabeth Warren, en campagne pour la primaire d\u00e9mocrate, \u00e0 New York, d\u00e9but mars.

The social media giant is reportedly working with three local digital fintech firms and plans to launch payments services in Indonesia at the earliest.Payments services have gained immense popularity over the past few months, following the coronavirus outbreak. Contactless payment services is gaining steam as an increasing number of people are staying at homes and maintaining social distancing, which has seen a decline in transaction through currency notes.Facebook to Expand Payments ServiceIf the plan gets regulatory approval, it could become one of the first payments service under the unified service Facebook Pay. </p><p>According to a Reuters report, Facebook is initiating talks to partner with three local companies \u2014 ride hailing firm Gojek's GoPay, fintech startup OVO, which is backed by Singapore-based riding hailing company Grab, and state-backed LinkAja.Facebook launched its contactless payments service Facebook Pay in November 2019. The service allows users to make payments across multiple platforms including WhatsApp and Instagram without exiting the app. Facebook is trying to tap the fast-growing Indonesian market and has been in talks with these firms since last year.Payment services are gaining popularity, with a number of big tech companies treading the same path. According to a Facebook spokesperson, the company plans to expand its digital payments platform to more countries, as there is tremendous growth potential for the business.Contactless Payments Grow on Users' TrustIncreasing use of Internet and smartphones to make payments along with online banking transactions via mobile wallets are working in favor of payment apps. Also, payment of utility and telephone bills through online payments apps is gaining popularity.Moreover, the past couple of months have witnessed a surge in users of payments services following the COVID-19 outbreak. Governments are imposing travel bans and implementing stricter social distancing measures. This has seen more people shying away from physical transactions through currency notes. Instead, contactless payments are being preferred.This has resulted in big tech companies like Apple, Inc. AAPL[2], Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN[3] and Paypal Holdings, Inc.PYPL[4] increasingly shifting focus to payments services. However, reliance on payment apps also depends on the trust factor and credibility, which are assured when services are provided by big tech companies.Facebook Pay allows users to view payment history and manage payment methods. It also provides real-time customer support via live chat. Facebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company's shares have gained 19% in the past one month.Square, Inc.SQ[5] with its user-friendly interface is fast becoming a hit.

British politicians concluded an 18-month investigation into disinformation, and said democracy was \"at risk\" from foreign countries trying to influence UK elections through social media ads. Lawmakers called for an independent regulator to make sure tech firms like Facebook take down illegal content. </p><p>They also accused Facebook of blocking their investigation. Facebook said it shares the concerns of the committee and is taking steps to improve its processes. British lawmakers have accused Facebook of behaving like \"digital gangsters\", abusing its dominant power in social networks, and behaving \"ahead of and beyond the law.\" The comments come in a devastating report on fake news[1] by British Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, made up of cross-party UK politicians and led by Conservative MP Damian Collins. Facebook deliberately flouted privacy and competition laws and should be subject to new regulation, the committee wrote. Lawmakers accused Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing \"contempt\" for UK Parliament, and a larger gathering of international parliaments after he refused to give evidence three times. The report is the culmination of a sprawling, 18-month parliamentary investigation into disinformation and fake news online, which heard from 73 witnesses and received 170 written submissions. It examined Facebook's role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal and its overall privacy practices. The report also touched on possible Russian interference in the Brexit referendum. Collins said: \"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia. \"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.\" The committee claimed that Facebook had deliberately \"sought to frustrate\" its work, putting up executives who were poorly briefed on areas such as election interference. The report calls for major changes to the way the UK regulates its elections and technology, including: Stricter rules that will force tech firms to take down illegal content on their site A code of ethics that defines \"harmful content\" An independent regulator to oversee enforcement of that code New laws around political advertising online The UK Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright will head to the US this week[2] to meet with the heads of major tech firms, including Zuckerberg, to talk about harmful content online. Facebook denied it had breached competition and privacy laws, and said it hadn't found evidence of foreign interference in the Brexit referendum. In a statement, Facebook's public policy manager Karim Palant said the company shares the concerns of the committee and said it is taking steps to improve its processes. He said: \"We share the Committee's concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence. \"We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee's recommendation for electoral law reform. But we're not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for 7 years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do. \"We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users. \"While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.\"NOW WATCH: We compared the $1,200 MacBook Air with the $500 Surface Go, and the results were a mess[3]See Also: Facebook catches yet another covert political influence campaign \u2014 this time in Moldova[4]Mark Zuckerberg sent a 2,500-word email in 2015 laying out his big plan for Facebook to dominate virtual-reality[5]Jeff Bezos shot straight to the top of a ranking of America's biggest donors \u2014 here's how much tech moguls gave away to good causes in 2018[6] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/1791.pdf\">https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/1791.pdf</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p071486y\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p071486y</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-macbook-air-laptop-microsoft-surface-go-tablet-review-2019-1?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-macbook-air-laptop-microsoft-surface-go-tablet-review-2019-1?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-political-influence-campaign-moldova-2019-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-political-influence-campaign-moldova-2019-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-email-on-facebook-virtual-reality-vision-2019-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-email-on-facebook-virtual-reality-vision-2019-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-leads-tech-mogul-donations-to-good-causes-in-2018-2019-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-leads-tech-mogul-donations-to-good-causes-in-2018-2019-2?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BZIN1056451550484348152251764100196</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BZIN-5352</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFP-GVN1-F03R-N4CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"962\"/><timeReceived>10:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Insider</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002KDX</classCode><className>GETTY IMAGES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In the latest in a string of complaints against the company sent to regulators, the groups called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Facebook violated consumer protection and child privacy laws by duping children into making in-app purchases in games like Angry Birds, PetVille and Ninja Saga, and then making it nearly impossible for kids or their parents to seek refunds. The accusation stems from a 2012 lawsuit. The complaint, filed by 17 groups including Common Sense Media, Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy, says the purchases often were done without a parent's permission. </p><p>In some cases, they amounted to hundreds or thousands of dollars. \"Facebook's exploitative practices targeted a population universally recognized as vulnerable - young people,\" the groups said in the complaint. In Washington's greater focus on the power of Big Tech, Facebook has taken center stage. The social network's role in state-sponsored election interference, harmful content and privacy violations has set off a push for new privacy laws and multiple investigations of the company. Next week, Congress will debate proposals for a federal privacy law. The FTC started investigating Facebook in March after the New York Times reported that the data of tens of millions of Facebook users was unknowingly shared with the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The agency is in the final stages of that investigation, with staff members and Facebook negotiating over a potential settlement that could include a multibillion-dollar fine and new restraints on the company's business practices, people familiar with the talks say. The consumer groups don't believe the complaint will be included in the FTC's privacy investigation of Facebook because that case appears to be nearing its completion. But the children's advocacy groups said they hoped their complaint would continue a drumbeat of pressure for Facebook to take more forceful steps to change its business practices oriented toward children. \"This is a pattern of behavior,\" said James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media. \"Facebook has a moral obligation to change its culture toward practices that foster the well-being of kids and families, and the FTC should ensure Facebook is acting responsibly.\" In a statement, Facebook said that in 2016 it had updated some of its policies governing purchases by minors. \"We have in place mechanisms to prevent fraud at the time of purchase, and we offer people the option to dispute purchases and seek refunds,\" the statement said. \"As part of our long history of working with parents and experts to offer tools for families navigating Facebook and the web, Facebook also has safeguards in place regarding minors' purchases.\" The FTC declined to comment. Details about the in-app purchases came from court documents that were unsealed at the request of the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit journalism organization. The documents were part of a class-action lawsuit brought in 2012 and settled in 2016 for an undisclosed sum. The 135 pages of unsealed documents included internal corporate memos and emails in which Facebook employees encouraged game developers to create features that would get children to make credit card charges while playing games. In many cases, the children didn't realize their parents' credit cards were attached to the games or that they were spending real money, the consumer groups argued in their complaint. The FTC polices consumer fraud, deception and unfair practices and is well versed in the issue of in-app purchases - the charges made within an app and directly charged through iTunes or Google Play stores, for example. In 2013, the agency started an investigation into major charges by children using in-app purchases for things like \"gold coins\" in smartphone games. The FTC reached a $32.5 million settlement with Apple and a $19 million settlement with Google over accusations that children were deceived into making such purchases and that the companies didn't properly disclose to parents that they were being charged for their children's purchases.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN64672901</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGR-9881-JC8S-D4JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

The officials left roles in government and with regulators to work on policy and communications for Facebook, indicating that mandarins are being offered significant incentives to do so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senior Conservative MPs said that Facebook was seeking to limit regulations before they were introduced.</p><p>Julian Knight, the Tory chairman of the Commons committee on digital, culture, media and sport, said that the public \"have a right to question the cosy relationship between government and big tech at all levels\". He added: \"The truth is big tech has taken over from the likes of banking, oil and pharmaceuticals in terms of their lobbying power.\"</p><p>Damian Collins, a Tory MP and former chairman of the committee, said that Facebook was \"clearly hiring people who have both direct personal knowledge of the latest thinking on how this could be developed, and extensive networks amongst the officials who will be advising ministers on these issues. They are doing this to try and change the direction of policy before it is even launched.\"</p><p>The moves are not published in official transparency releases, either because the officials were not senior enough or because they worked for independent regulators such as Ofcom. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, which vets appointments of former crown servants, only checks at director-general level and above, and its advice is non-binding.</p><p>Three senior regulatory staff at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are among those who recently joined Facebook. They are Shane Murphy, former head of policy on international data transfers, Caroline Hurst, former senior policy adviser on internet safety, and Annabel Brody, who led media regulation at the department. Other policy officials joined from the Cabinet Office, the Home Office and UK Counterterrorism Policing.</p><p>Steve Goodrich, of Transparency International UK, said: \"In theory, there are restrictions on former civil servants using privileged information to benefit their new employers but how much this is enforced in practice is up for debate.\"</p><p>                   The Times                    </p><p>also found that at least 14 special advisers had moved to tech companies including Uber, Google, Facebook in the past five years after a stint in ministerial offices. The advisers would have had access to departmental chiefs and the policy formation process.</p><p>The government has come under pressure to introduce long-delayed online harms regulation, which will attempt to force companies such as Google and Facebook to take more responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>Lucy Purdon, policy director at Privacy International said: \"No doubt Facebook has one eye on the future and what influence they can hire in as the government edges towards increasing protections for users and demanding more transparency from platforms.\"</p><p>Susan Hawley, executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said: \"The system for regulating the revolving door in the UK is badly broken and urgently needs reform.\"</p><p>Facebook said: \"Our policy teams play a key role in developing and applying Facebook's policies such as our community standards - which set out what is and isn't allowed on our platforms. Having people with a range of expertise helps ensure that those policies and rules are effective and up to date. Facebook has actively called for new regulations to set high standards across the internet and so that private companies aren't making so many of these important decisions alone.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-65443111</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NS-6B11-JCJY-G01J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The officials left roles in government and with regulators to work on policy and communications for Facebook, indicating that mandarins are being offered significant incentives to do so.</p><p>Senior Conservative MPs said that Facebook was seeking to limit regulations before they were introduced. Julian Knight, the Tory chairman of the Commons committee on digital, culture, media and sport, said that the public \"have a right to question the cosy relationship between government and big tech at all levels\". He added: \"The truth is big tech has taken over from the likes of banking, oil and pharmaceuticals in terms of their lobbying power.\" Damian Collins, a Tory MP and former chairman of the committee, said that Facebook was \"clearly hiring people who have both direct personal knowledge of the latest thinking on how this could be developed, and extensive networks amongst the officials who will be advising ministers on these issues. They are doing this to try and change the direction of policy before it is even launched.\"</p><p>The moves are not published as part of official transparency releases, either because the officials were not senior enough or because they worked for independent regulators such as Ofcom. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, which vets appointments by former Crown servants, only checks former director-generals and permanent secretaries and its advice is non-binding.</p><p>Three senior regulatory staff at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport are among those who recently joined Facebook. They are Shane Murphy, former head of policy on international data transfers, Caroline Hurst, former senior policy adviser on internet safety, and Annabel Brody, who headed media regulation at the department. Other policy officials left the Cabinet Office, the Home Office and UK Counterterrorism Policing to join.</p><p>Steve Goodrich, of Transparency International UK, said: \"In theory, there are restrictions on former civil servants using privileged information to benefit their new employers but how much this is enforced in practice is up for debate.\"</p><p>The Times also found that at least 14 special advisers have moved to tech companies including Uber, Google, Facebook in the past five years after their stint in ministerial offices. The advisers would have had access to departmental chiefs and the policy formation process.</p><p>The government has come under pressure to introduce long-delayed online harms regulation, which will attempt to force firms such as Google and Facebook to take more responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>Facebook said: \"Our policy teams play a key role in developing and applying Facebook's policies such as our community standards - which set out what is and isn't allowed on our platforms. Having people with a range of expertise helps ensure that those policies and rules are effective and up to date. Facebook has actively called for new regulations to set high standards across the internet and so that private companies aren't making so many of these important decisions alone.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-162626613</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NT-0N41-JCBW-N1R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Only it\u2019s not regulated,\u201d Ms Morton told the Financial Times, referring to the telephone monopoly AT&amp;T held until the US government broke up the company in the 1980s.</p><p>Though the paper relies on information in the UK Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s 2019 interim study of online platforms and digital advertising, Ms Morton and Mr Dinielli suggest the facts in the US market would not differ greatly.\u00a0</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on the paper ahead of its publication.</p><p>In a submission to the CMA earlier this year, the company said it operated in markets where \u201cconsumer preferences change all the time\u201d, adding that it was committed \u201cto more choice and transparency for consumers and advertisers\u201d.</p><p>\u201cPeople are ultimately the best judge of the value of a company\u2019s products and services and if we stop innovating people will simply spend more time on other services,\u201d Facebook said in its submission.</p><p>The paper by Ms Morton and Mr Dinielli argues that Facebook unfairly built a monopoly position by misleading its users about its data privacy policies to gain a competitive edge over other networks, snapping up rivals like Instagram and WhatsApp, and cutting off access to other competitors.</p><p>They argue that these tactics allowed Facebook to reach a tipping point where it became a dominant social network because so many people were already on it, and subsequently ensured that other companies could not replicate its success.</p><p>Ms Morton said the dynamic in social networking, where websites become more appealing as more people join, gives incumbents like Facebook an added incentive to squash or acquire competitors before they gain too much momentum.</p><p>If Facebook had not acquired WhatsApp and Instagram, she said: \u201cThere would be a chance that the market would tip away from Facebook to one of those other platforms.\u201d</p><p>The paper is the second from Ms Morton and Mr Dinielli that looks at Big Tech. Last month, they set out a possible case against Alphabet, the parent company of Google, in a similar paper.</p><p>Big tech companies have come under heavy pressure for possible competition violations in recent years after a long period where regulators generally viewed their conduct and acquisitions favourably.</p><p>Companies such as Facebook and Google generally do not charge users for their services, while Amazon, another focus of antitrust scrutiny, has been viewed as driving down prices in the markets in which it operates.</p><p>Their growing power \u2014 all five of the most valuable US public companies are tech companies \u2014 has forced a rethink, however. The DoJ, as well as the FTC, has been investigating the technology sector, while Republican and Democratic lawmakers are looking at possible new legislation.</p><p>The questions have gained political salience as President Donald Trump and his conservative allies have claimed social media platforms like Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube are censoring their views, while liberals have attacked those same platforms for failing to do enough moderation.</p><p>\u201cRecent events underscore what we might be missing, as politicians as well as members of the polity decry the power of just a few internet platforms in shaping the democratic discourse on issues ranging from voting rights protection to police-involved violence to the pandemic,\u201d argue Ms Morton and Mr Dinielli.</p><p>If there were many networks competing, they conclude, \u201cusers would be able to depart from a platform that did not adhere to their standard of quality or values. But this world with choice requires Facebook to be compelled to compete.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-0ebca696a1fa43dba6bbfd407239f32f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603M-K1S1-DXP9-94F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 10, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0009YTF</classCode><className>OMIDYAR NETWORK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The accusation stems from a 2012 lawsuit.</p><p>The complaint, filed by 17 groups including Common Sense Media, Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy, says the purchases were often done without a parent's permission. In some cases, they amounted to hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p><p>\"Facebook's exploitative practices targeted a population universally recognized as vulnerable \u2014 young people,\" the groups said in the complaint.</p><p>In Washington's greater focus on the power of Big Tech, Facebook has taken center stage. The social network's role in state-sponsored election interference, harmful content, and privacy violations has set off a push for new privacy laws and multiple investigations of the company. Next week, Congress will debate proposals for a federal privacy law.</p><p>The FTC started investigating Facebook in March after The New York Times reported that the data of tens of millions of Facebook users was unknowingly shared with the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The agency is in the final stages of that investigation, with staff members and Facebook negotiating over a potential settlement that could include a multibillion-dollar fine and new restraints on the company's business practices, according to people familiar with the talks.</p><p>But the children's advocacy groups said they hoped their complaint would continue a drumbeat of pressure for Facebook to take more forceful steps to change its business practices oriented toward children.</p><p>Details about the in-app purchases came from court documents that were unsealed at the request of the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit journalism organization. The documents were part of a class-action lawsuit brought in 2012 and settled in 2016 for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>The 135 pages of unsealed documents included internal corporate memos and e-mails in which Facebook employees encouraged game developers to create features that would get children to make credit card charges while playing games. In many cases, the children did not realize that their parents' credit cards were attached to the games or that they were spending real money, the consumer groups argued in their complaint.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-b99e733a-3624-11e9-b5d2-ed9ae9c311df</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGJ-15H1-DYHJ-320W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Is it a good move? Will gaining control over Giphy help Facebook to keep users around on both its flagship platform and broader family of apps? And how can this ultimately create more value for what is already the largest social media company in the world?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The short answer is that when you are a company with as much money as Facebook, no government is truly blocking you from doing what you want, and the 3 billion people you want to stay on your platforms are going absolutely nuts for gifs right now as an added layer of nuance in their digital communications, then why the hell not.</p><p>The long answer requires thinking about where Facebook sits in the broader online ecosystem right now and why an animated sticker search tool and content library even matters to the Internet economy.</p><p>A quick refresher of Facebook's financials: the 16-year-old company has a market capitalisation of US$669.3 billion, it closed on Friday at $US234.91, up 29.7 per cent from this time last year.</p><p>Last quarter, Facebook wrapped with US$60 billion cash in the bank. And while the company is looking to spruik its hardware products like those Oculus VR glasses and this tablet thing called Facebook Portal, 98 per cent of its sales in the quarter were still from advertising revenue.</p><p>In the hybrid tech/social media/marketing landscape, fundamentally, the name of the game is still about attracting users, keeping them on your service, and preferably - and this is particularly key in the context of rising Facebook hate and backlash at the individual, society, and government level - having people enjoy being on that service.</p><p>Innovations like Facebook's own currency Libra were a kind of weird move in that regard (it read more like a Silicon Valley flex than something users actually wanted), whereas acquiring Giphy and using that play to make your user experience more fun in the face of a globally declining ad market makes eminently more sense.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Okay. So what are gifs and why should Facebook care?</emphasis></p><p>Gifs are essentially a series of moving images played on a loop. They have been around online for eons, but are increasing in popularity now due to the global rise in instant messaging usage and also the rise of meme culture.</p><p>From a brand perspective, they are another way to create shareable art, logos and whatnot that people then hopefully insert into their daily conversations online, be it via Instagram Story or Facebook Messenger. Note that locally, Australians are relatively heavy Facebook Messenger users, so anything that keeps them there for longer will mean more time spent on the platform more broadly.</p><p>Giphy is a search tool and massive content library in one, chock full of user-generated gifs, which under its T&amp;Cs, it owns.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/happy-birthday-google-maps-a-free-labour-pioneer-20200206-p53yc4\"> Tech platforms and the utility of service often grow off the back of users free labour in exchange for a good time rather than cash </url>and in that respect, Giphy is not too different.</p><p>What Giphy has done well is to become the kind of go-to gif search engine and get integrated across a bunch of apps. What Giphy did badly was monetise its business, meaning that it only had a very nascent advertising revenue model and a weirdly complicated one at that. Consequently, it was a 'distressed' business if you will, looking around for a buyer that could still appreciate its rising value in online life. Facebook was that buyer.</p><p>Right now, Facebook is looking at what user trends are gaining traction, and gifs, micro video, and short video are all on that list. This is because as people's mobile plans bump them more data, they can download, send, and view more complex files, but also by sheer random luck, the whole global lockdown and social distancing aspect of 2020 in response to COVID-19 means that an already happening online trend is seeing a hefty boost.</p><p>In terms of timing, Facebook has said that in countries hit hard by the virus messaging volume has increased by more than 50 per cent, whereas voice and voice calling through Messenger and WhatsApp more than doubled.</p><p>Again, more than 3 billion people use at least one of Facebook's apps each month, and the slowing trend for user growth for the core Facebook social network reversed last quarter, with growth of 10 per cent.</p><p>Despite this global entrenchment, other players are rising in this space. Yes, SnapChat and Twitter still exist, but the thing to be most worried about right now if you are Facebook is TikTok. And as NYU Stern marketing professor Scott Galloway has opined on the technology podcast Pivot, \"Facebook is a company that is always looking over its shoulder at what is coming next\".</p><p>So while TikTok is yet to have the relative law and order of Facebook and Google-owned YouTube, which have both built out their content moderation capabilities to try and crack down on fake news and extremist content, people absolutely loveee TikTok right now.</p><p>Some may retort that TikTok is mostly filled with young people, but firstly, that is simply true of any new social media, and secondly, if you go on the platform today, it is clear that older generations have started to join.</p><p>During the COVID-19 lockdowns especially, professional content creators and celebrities have cropped up on TikTok en masse. Writing off TikTok as a Gen Z play in the social media space is now year-old analysis, and while many will resist its chaotic energy for good or even be put off by its connection to China, more people still are flocking to see what all the fuss is about.</p><p>Given the TikTok frenzy, Giphy's feel-good moving product fun is particularly appealing for Facebook. And in terms of general optics, no one hates gifs yet for poisoning political discourse, or ruining relationships, or causing mental illness in the young, or whatever, which is also a plus for the company.</p><p>Another piece of this puzzle here is the potential data story: gifs are a neat way of measuring sentiment, and aggregating how people use them will allow Facebook to have an even more powerful understanding of the mood and tone of its users.</p><p>It does not take a huge amount of imagination to dream up the types of AI-led technology that gif trends could be run through, and how Facebook might use that information to expand its share of the data analytics pie.</p><p>One drawback of Giphy is that its search function and results could be a whole lot better. For example, if you type in \"Kylie Jenner hair flick\" you might get a gif of Kylie Jenner, but not the exact match that you are looking for.</p><p>So we are not talking the razor-like pinpoint accuracy of Google search. But that's not a huge problem, if Facebook plays it right, people will leap into action and create and upload even more gifs, thereby boosting the content library on hand.</p><p>In practical terms, that could look like making it super duper easy for users to create their own gifs with Giphy on apps like Instagram.</p><p>There is also the legal risks Facebook is taking on in the fact that Giphy no doubt has a fair amount of copyrighted content floating around on its site, but this is the Internet, so what's new.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regulatory issues?</emphasis></p><p>If you have an issue with any one company essentially owning the entire internet, and what that means for speech, censorship, democracy and what have you, then every acquisition, even one that looks like it's just about stickers (it's not, it's about owning an evolving way in which humans communicate), should give you serious pause.</p><p>With all this talk about Facebook's monopoly power, an acquisition like this prima facie flies in the face of any talk about breaking up the tech giant's sprawling power.</p><p>Regulators should be trying to understand the value of each and every acquisition any huge corporation makes and the implications for market competition, and in fairness, that is already happening.</p><p>In June 2019, the Federal Trade Commission opened an antitrust investigation into Facebook. In July that same year, The Department of Justice announced that it will begin an antitrust review of market leading online platforms, going back through the catalogue of Facebook's various acquisitions and assessing its monopoly power.</p><p>But such investigations take years.</p><p>A bunch of both Republican and Democrat US senators did make a ruckus this week about the Giphy acquisition, which means that they are paying attention and doing their job, but noise is one thing, action is another.</p><p>Furthermore, with a Biden-Trump US Presidential race, neither of whom have expressed breaking up Big Tech as a policy priority, Facebook might get away with this one without too much scrutiny.</p><p>Indeed, FDA analyst Hannelore van Twist argued in an April 30 report that the regulatory view has kind of softened in the last three months due to the global pandemic.</p><p>\"The utility and added value of Facebook's social services during these times are evident. It might help the firm to strengthen its reputation again after it was hit by several scandals in recent years, which has attributed to a more critical stance towards large tech firms in general,\" Ms van Twist wrote.</p><p>\"This in turn has fuelled political support to implement stricter regulations in areas like online privacy, content liability and competition. Due to the pandemic, such regulatory risks have eased in the short term.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, in Australia, the ACCC's appetite to quell Facebook's insane market power in the advertising space is well underway, as is the local regulator's wont to scrutinise mergers and acquisitions that take place in other jurisdictions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Did Facebook pay too much for this? </emphasis></p><p>No, not when as a company they are now relatively cash rich, and in a broader global context where the economy is uncertain. In fact, this is the exact time for a company of this magnitude to pick up a few playthings along the way - when everyone else is freaking out about survival.</p><p>Indeed, Swell Asset Management chief executive and chief investment officer Lachlan Hughes characterises this particular acquisition as \"opportunistic\", notes that Facebook has a good track record of \"well-timed buys\", and thinks that the dollar figure behind this purchase price is not too relevant in the context of Facebook's actual buying power.</p><p>So unless the Facebook and Giphy team rollout some bizarre set of features that no one wants, and thus drive users into the arms of competitors, it's hard to see how this could go badly for the company.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520279900</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6001-7V61-JBJ7-N22P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1816\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Is it a good move? Will gaining control of it help Facebook to keep users around on both its flagship platform and broader family of apps? And how can it create more value for what is already the largest social media company in the world?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The short answer is that when you are a company with as much money as Facebook, no government can truly block you from doing what you want, and the 3 billion people you want to stay on your platforms are going absolutely nuts for gifs right now as an added layer of nuance in their digital communications, then why the hell not.</p><p>The long answer requires thinking about where Facebook sits in the broader online ecosystem right now and why an animated sticker search tool and content library even matters to the internet economy.</p><p>A quick refresher of Facebook's financials: the 16-year-old company has a market capitalisation of $US670 billion, it closed on Friday at $US234.91, up 30 per cent from this time last year.</p><p>Last quarter, Facebook had $US60 billion cash in the bank. And while the company is looking to spruik hardware like those Oculus VR glasses and this tablet thing called Facebook Portal, 98 per cent of sales in the quarter were from advertising revenue.</p><p>In the hybrid tech/social media/marketing landscape, fundamentally, the name of the game is about attracting users, keeping them on your service, and preferably - and this is particularly key in the context of rising Facebook hate and backlash at the individual, society, and government level - having people enjoy being on that service.</p><p>Innovations like Facebook's own currency Libra were a kind of weird move in that regard (it read more like a Silicon Valley flex than something users actually wanted), whereas acquiring Giphy and using that play to make your user experience more fun in the face of a globally declining ad market makes eminently more sense.</p><p>Okay. So what are gifs and why should Facebook care?</p><p>Gifs are essentially a series of moving images played on a loop. They have been around online for eons, but are increasing in popularity now due to the global increase in instant messaging use and the rise of meme culture.</p><p>From a brand perspective, they are another way to create shareable art, logos and whatnot that people then hopefully insert into their daily conversations online, be it via Instagram Story or Facebook Messenger. Note that locally, Australians are relatively heavy Facebook Messenger users, so anything that keeps them there for longer will mean more time spent on the platform more broadly.</p><p>Giphy is a search tool and massive content library in one, chock full of user-generated gifs, which under its T&amp;Cs, it owns. Tech platforms and the utility of service often grow off the back of users' free labour in exchange for a good time rather than cash and in that respect, Giphy is not too different.</p><p>What Giphy has done well is to become the kind of go-to gif search engine and become integrated across a bunch of apps. What Giphy did badly was monetise its business, meaning that it only had a very nascent advertising revenue model and a weirdly complicated one at that. Consequently, it was a \"distressed\" business if you will, looking for a buyer that could appreciate its rising value in online life. Facebook was that buyer.</p><p>Right now, Facebook is looking at what user trends are gaining traction, and gifs, micro video, and short video are all on that list. This is because as people's mobile plans bump them more data, they can download, send, and view more complex files, but also by sheer random luck, the whole global lockdown and social distancing aspect of 2020 in response to COVID-19 means that an already happening online trend is seeing a hefty boost.</p><p>In terms of timing, Facebook has said that in countries hit hard by the virus messaging volume has increased by more than 50 per cent.</p><p>Again, more than 3 billion people use at least one of Facebook's apps each month, and the slowing trend for user growth for the core Facebook social network reversed last quarter, with growth of 10 per cent.</p><p>Despite this global entrenchment, other players are rising, and the most worrying thing for Facebook right now is TikTok. And as NYU Stern marketing professor Scott Galloway said on the technology podcast Pivot, \"Facebook is a company that is always looking over its shoulder at what is coming next\".</p><p>Some may retort that TikTok is mostly filled with young people, but firstly, that is true of any new social media, and secondly, if you go on the platform today, it is clear that older generations have started to join.</p><p>During the COVID-19 lockdowns especially, professional content creators and celebrities cropped up on TikTok en masse. Writing off TikTok as a Gen Z play in the social media space is now year-old analysis, and while many will resist its chaotic energy for good, more people still are flocking to see what all the fuss is about.</p><p>Given the TikTok frenzy, Giphy's feel-good moving product fun is particularly appealing for Facebook. And in terms of general optics, no one hates gifs yet for poisoning political discourse, or ruining relationships, or causing mental illness in the young, or whatever, which is also a plus for the company.</p><p>Another piece of this puzzle is the potential data story: gifs are a neat way of measuring sentiment, and aggregating how people use them will allow Facebook to have an even more powerful understanding of the mood and tone of its users.</p><p>It does not take a huge amount of imagination to dream up the types of AI-led technology that gif trends could be run through, and how Facebook might use that information to expand its share of the data analytics pie.</p><p>One drawback of Giphy is that its search function and results could be a whole lot better. For example, if you type in \"Kylie Jenner hair flick\" you might get a gif of Kylie Jenner, but not the exact match that you are looking for.</p><p>There is also the legal risks Facebook is taking on in the fact that Giphy no doubt has a fair amount of copyrighted content floating around on its site, but this is the internet, so what's new.</p><p>Regulatory issues?</p><p>If you have an issue with any one company essentially owning the entire internet, and what that means for speech, censorship, democracy and what have you, then every acquisition, even one that looks like it's just about stickers (it's not, it's about owning an evolving way of communication), should give you serious pause.</p><p>With all the talk about Facebook's monopoly power, an acquisition like this prima facie flies in the face of any talk about breaking up the tech giant's sprawling power.</p><p>Regulators should try to understand the value of each and every acquisition any huge corporation makes and the implications for market competition, and in fairness, that is already happening.</p><p>In June 2019, the Federal Trade Commission opened an antitrust investigation into Facebook. In July that same year, The US Department of Justice announced that it will begin an antitrust review of market leading online platforms, going back through the catalogue of Facebook's various acquisitions and assessing its monopoly power.</p><p>But such investigations take years.</p><p>A bunch of both Republican and Democrat US senators did make a ruckus this week about the Giphy acquisition, which means that they are paying attention and doing their job, but noise is one thing, action is another.</p><p>Furthermore, with a Biden-Trump US Presidential race, neither of whom have expressed breaking up Big Tech as a policy priority, Facebook might get away with this one without too much scrutiny.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Australia, the ACCC's appetite to quell Facebook's insane market power in advertising is well underway, as is the local regulator's wont to scrutinise mergers and acquisitions that take place in other jurisdictions.</p><p>Did Facebook pay too much?</p><p>No, not when as a company they are now relatively cash rich, and in a broader global context where the economy is uncertain. In fact, this is the exact time for a company of this magnitude to pick up a few playthings along the way - when everyone else is freaking out about survival.</p><p>Swell Asset Management chief executive Lachlan Hughes characterises this particular acquisition as \"opportunistic\", notes that Facebook has a good track record of \"well-timed buys\", and thinks that the dollar figure behind this purchase price is not too relevant in the context of Facebook's actual buying power.</p><p>NATASHA GILLEZEAU</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7apmdwscm4i10miluc3e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600P-7391-JD34-V230-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1501\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

(Kurt Wagner,Bloomberg Law[1]). The startup, CTRL-Labs (pronounced 'Control'), is developing a non-invasive neural interface that would convert user's electrical muscle impulses into digital signals. (Polina Marinova,Fortune[2]). This would allow users to move a mouse, or video game character, without having to move a muscle. Although the financial details of the acquisition are being kept private, according to people familiar with the deal, Facebook offered between $500 million and $1 billion for the startup. </p><p>(Kurt Wagner,Bloomberg Law[3]). The acquisition of CTRL-Labs comes at a time when technology companies, especially Facebook, are facing a bipartisan political attack on anti-competitive behavior within the industry. (David McLaughlin et al.,Fortune[4]). This post will also briefly address Facebook's entry into and aspirations of the AR hardware market, and recent governmental oversight concerning Facebook's history of absorbing potential competitors.CTRL-Labs is the brainchild of Thomas Reardon and Patrick Kaifosh. (Steven Levy,Wired[5]). Mr. Reardon gained notoriety for establishing the project that eventually became Internet Explorer, before leaving the tech industry to get his Ph.D. in neuroscience.Id. His partner, Mr. Kaifosh, is also a neuroscientist who specializes in 'neural circuit mechanisms of memory.' (Losonczy Lab[6]). The company, now four years old, uses a mix of machine learning and neuroscience to allow users to manipulate computer interfaces. (Kurt Wagner,Bloomberg Law[7]). One of its most significant breakthroughs was its ability to observe the human motor nervous system at the level of an individual neuron. (Polina Marinova,Fortune[8]). Using a bracelet wrapped around the user's arm, CTRL-Lab's device measures the neuron activity in the limb and translates the user's thoughts of movement into actual movements on a digital screen.Id. Based on a post by Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's AR and VR Vice President, it appears that Facebook intends for the technology to be used with its AR headset, Oculus. (Andrew Bosworth,Facebook[9]). However, the technology being developed by CTRL-Lab could have many significant impacts in the future outside of entertainment because it could potentially allow individuals suffering from physical disabilities to control computer interfaces, mobility devices, or digital speech mechanisms.Facebook has made a significant push in the last couple of years to bolster its foothold in the augmented reality market. Zuckerberg orchestrated the acquisition of start-up Oculus VR for $2 billion in 2014 as Facebook's initial pivot away from being simply a social media platform. Oculus, founded with a focus on developing and producing virtual reality video game headsets, was Facebook's first foray into the hardware market. (Steven Kovach,Business Insider[10]). Zuckerberg had grand envisions for the AR headset, including uber-realistic video games, allowing people to virtually sit courtside for sporting events, and allowing students to enter a virtual classroom from anywhere in the world. (Mark Zuckerberg,Facebook[11]). Recently, Facebook announced a partnership with Luxottica to develop augmented reality Ray-Ban glasses that would be designed to replace smartphones. (Salvador Rodriguez,CNBC[12]). The two companies are hoping that the glasses could reach consumers by as early as 2023.Id.The acquisition of CTRL-Labs comes at a time when Facebook, and the entire technology sector, are facing mounting concerns from politicians about anti-competitive behavior and privacy. President Donald Trump recently criticized the growing power of social media platforms during his address to the United Nations General Assembly, indicating that the industry could soon face scrutiny from federal antitrust regulators. (Sarah Ponczek,Bloomberg[13]). Last month, attorney generals from 48 states, including Puerto Rico and DC (while California and Alabama abstained) launched antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google. (Casey Newton et al.,The Verge[14]). Currently, there are 16 government inquiries and investigations surrounding Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon at the state, federal, and congressional levels. (New York Times[15]).Facebook's acquisition of CTRL-Lab has even garnered the attention of Minnesota Senator, and candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Amy Klobuchar. (David McLaughlin et al.,Fortune[16]). In a recent hearing on Capitol Hill concerning the competitive effects of digital platforms acquiring startups, the Senator expressed her concern by stating that, 'If digital giants use strategic acquisitions to snuff out emerging or potential future competitors the harm may not be as immediately obvious but those harms are no less damaging or enduring in the long run.\"Id. Many others, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have criticized the FTC for allowing Facebook to acquire social networking startups Instagram and WhatsApp in massive deals that were likely attempts by Zuckerberg to prevent competition in the sector.Id. Currently, a broad investigation has been opened by the FTC into Facebook's 'program of serial defensive acquisitions,' as attempts to maintain the company's social media dominance. (Jack Nicas et al.,New York Times[17]).Moving forward, it will be interesting to see if the FTC or Justice Department decides to prevent Facebook's acquisition of CLTR-Lab or even attempts to unwind their approved acquisitions of Instagram or WhatsApp. Based on the FTC Chairman's recent announcement regarding the new regulatory protocol for acquisitions of nascent competitors, it is likely the FTC will be pursuing an antitrust review of the Facebook-CTRL-Lab acquisition. (David McLaughlin et al.,Fortune[18]). Also significant is the release by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a top candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, of an aggressive approach to breaking up tech giants Amazon, Google, and Facebook. (MJ Lee et al.,CNN[19]). Senator Warren specifically targeted Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in a plan to unwind some of the highest-profile tech mergers.Id. Regardless, moving forward Facebook will be facing a serious political headwind after its acquisition of CTRL-Labs if it is even allowed to do so.

The boycotters say they want Facebook to prioritize decency and provide human support to users.</p><p> The boycott is the latest front in a growing clash over Big Tech's role in policing political speech, with the left pushing for more restrictions on content while the right accuses internet giants of anti-conservative bias.</p><p> Several companies that decided to pause advertising on Facebook platforms also have reeled in ad spending on Twitter.</p><p> Protesters have taken their complaints on the issue directly to the billionaires running the tech giants, including arriving outside Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' D.C. residence with a guillotine in recent days, according to reports.</p><p> Content cited by boycott supporters as inappropriate includes posts blaming liberal billionaire George Soros for civil unrest and a post depicting Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota on an Aunt Jemima syrup bottle with the label \"Aunt Jihadi,\" according to the Anti-Defamation League.</p><p> The coalition, which says Facebook collects $70 billion in advertising revenue annually, says going after the social media giant's bottom line is the best way to prompt change.</p><p> \"What would you do with $70 billion? We know what Facebook did,\" the coalition writes on its website. \"They allowed incitement to violence against protesters fighting for racial justice in America in the wake of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks and so many others.\"</p><p> The campaign website lists more than 90 businesses that reportedly cut social media spending amid concerns about hate speech and racial injustice  though not all of the companies listed say they are part of a boycott.</p><p>Coca-Cola said it did not join the campaign's boycott despite being listed on the website. Coca-Cola said it is pausing social media advertising across a host of platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitch.</p><p> \"There is no place for racism in the world and there is no place for racism on social media,\" Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in a statement to The Washington Times. \"The Coca-Cola Company will pause paid advertising on all social media platforms globally for at least 30 days. We will take this time to reassess our advertising policies to determine whether revisions are needed. We also expect greater accountability and transparency from our social media partners.\"</p><p> But candy-maker Hershey gave a full-throated endorsement of the boycott, telling Facebook that the company was unhappy with Facebook's stance on hate speech and vowing to cut Facebook advertising spending by a third for the rest of the year.</p><p> \"We do not believe that Facebook is effectively managing violent and divisive speech on their platform,\" Hershey said in a statement. \"Despite repeated assertions by Facebook to take action, we have not seen meaningful change.\"</p><p> Some boycotters, such as the outdoor apparel company Patagonia, have signed on for a long-term break with Facebook. Patagonia said it would last at least through July and maybe longer.</p><p> Others favored a more limited approach, such as Honda, which told The Washington Times it was suspending spending on Facebook for July to \"stand with people united against hate and racism,\" but did not point to how the advertising shift accomplished that goal.</p><p> Some business analysts said companies may have wanted to pare back social media advertising expenditures before the boycott for other reasons, including because of the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus and were using the campaign as a way to earn goodwill.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg attempted to stop the financial bleeding on Friday with an announcement of new policies that will alter the nature of content about elections and voting on company platforms.</p><p> On Monday, Facebook told The Times its investments in artificial intelligence mean 90% of hate speech on Facebook is caught before users report it and the company is working with civil rights groups and unnamed experts to develop new tools, technologies and policies to stamp out hate speech on its sites.</p><p> \"We invest billions of dollars each year to keep our community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update our policies,\" a Facebook representative said. \"We've opened ourselves up to a civil rights audit, and we have banned 250 white supremacist organizations from Facebook and Instagram.\"</p><p>Facebook did not say whether it has communicated with the coalition organizing the boycott, but some business and technology experts think Facebook's decision-making is less responsive to the boycott and more responsive to 2020 politics.</p><p> Kara Swisher, co-founder of the tech news website Recode, told CNBC she thought Mr. Zuckerberg was motivated to act now in response to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joseph R. Biden winning in November.</p><p> \"Facebook plays the long game, at some point they'll cozy up to whatever administration is there and they'll do what it takes,\" Ms. Swisher told CNBC. \"But I'll tell you a lot of this [regulatory] legislation is coming down the pike, especially if certain people get in, if the administration changes, if you have something like Attorney General Kamala Harris or Attorney General Elizabeth Warren or vice president of either of those people, you're going to see some real change happening at these companies and some real regulation and action that has a lot of muscle behind it.\"</p><p> Meanwhile, Reddit is cracking down on what it considers hate speech and is expected to remove forums used both by President Trump's supporters and far-left liberals.</p><p> The subreddit forums r/The_Donald, which is popular with Mr. Trump's fans, and r/ChapoTrapHouse, which is a favorite of liberal Reddit users, are slated for removal alongside about 2,000 other communities, according to The Verge tech website.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-17BEB97F220F21A8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607W-DGG1-JBCN-40HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1072\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>30 June 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0001OKO</classCode><className>HERSHEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As Bickert pointed out in her Jan. 8 statement to an Energy and Commerce subcommittee, \"Facebook is a community of more than 2 billion people, spanning countries, cultures and languages across the globe.\" That's a quarter of the world's population.</p><p>The firm has massive monopoly power to influence public opinion.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims that Facebook has adopted this policy because it is committed to protecting \"free expression,\" and that the company should not be the arbiter of truth.</p><p>In fact, this policy has nothing to do with protecting free expression. Instead, it is aimed at letting Facebook make hundreds of millions of dollars showing ads on its platform, even if they're untrue. In fact, the moment Facebook stops simply allowing others to make posts on its platform and begins taking millions of dollars from them to show ads, the company stops allowing the free speech of others and Facebook itself becomes guilty of spreading lies for pay.</p><p>Under his policy, for instance, Facebook would presumably allow a candidate to spend hundreds of millions of dollars claiming that his or her opponent ran a pedophile ring in a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C. That outrageous conspiracy theory actually circulated widely about Hillary Clinton in right-wing circles before the last election - but was never circulated as paid advertising. Now, Facebook is saying that if you want to spend a fortune to promote that conspiracy, they are happy to take your money.</p><p>In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi excoriated Facebook: \"They have said very blatantly, very clearly that they intend to be accomplices for misleading the American people with money from God knows where.\"</p><p>It is true that under federal law, internet platforms like Facebook are not liable for what third parties post on their sites. But Facebook still reserves the right to remove posts that violate its rules, or so-called community standards. In fact, it does serve the cause of free speech for those who post on platforms like Facebook to be subject only to the same limitations on speech that our legal system has determined apply in other arenas of life.</p><p>People should be able to speak freely about their views - but should not be allowed to advocate violence or to cry \"fire\" in a crowded theater, because the exercise of that free speech right impinges on other critical rights.</p><p>As things stands now, however, the same does not apply to Facebook when it takes money from a person or organization to advertise their points of view. Once Facebook takes money to promote a candidate or cause, the company becomes an agent of the campaign or organization promoting that message. And once it is an agent of a campaign or cause, it should be held responsible and liable for ads that contain provable lies.</p><p>Facebook should be held to the same standards as TV networks like CNN and CBS, since it is really exactly the same kind of broadcast service.</p><p>Its refusal to do so opens a massive opportunity for conspiracy theorists and demagogues to spend fortunes promoting provably false allegations with absolute impunity. And the sad fact is that if even the most outrageous lie is repeated often enough, large numbers of people will come to believe it. Donald Trump understands that.</p><p>In fact, Trump has shown himself willing to shamelessly lie about both the most insignificant and monumental questions. The Washington Post counts over 16,000 occasions when he made provably false or misleading statements since he became president. What makes anyone think that he - or his organization - will do anything different in the coming campaign?</p><p>Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, is an expert on, and devotee of, social media campaigning. As of November, the Trump campaign had outspent all other campaigns on social media. Facebook provides Parscale with the perfect mechanism to communicate his messages directly to his target audience through a medium that does nothing to check the truthfulness of his communication.</p><p>And we're not just talking about opinions. If Parscale decides to make up a story that the Democratic candidate has a long record of child abuse, and then spends huge sums of money on Facebook to promote that story, there is nothing to stop him.</p><p>Zuckerberg is increasingly concerned about the growing movement to regulate and break up big tech, especially virtual monopolies like Facebook. The president could do a lot to protect Zuckerberg's empire - especially if he is reelected. Democratic candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have openly advocated breaking up Facebook and other big tech companies, cause Zuckerberg special concern.</p><p>All of that makes you wonder what was said in Zuckerberg's private dinner with Trump last fall at the White House.</p><p>It is impossible to overstate the danger that Facebook's policy poses to American democracy.

As Bickert pointed out in her Jan. 8 statement to an Energy and Commerce subcommittee, \"Facebook is a community of more than 2 billion people, spanning countries, cultures and languages across the globe.\" That's a quarter of the world's population.</p><p>The firm has massive monopoly power to influence public opinion.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims that Facebook has adopted this policy because it is committed to protecting \"free expression,\" and that the company should not be the arbiter of truth.</p><p>In fact, this policy has nothing to do with protecting free expression. Instead, it is aimed at letting Facebook make hundreds of millions of dollars showing ads on its platform, even if they're untrue. In fact, the moment Facebook stops simply allowing others to make posts on its platform and begins taking millions of dollars from them to show ads, the company stops allowing the free speech of others and Facebook itself becomes guilty of spreading lies for pay.</p><p>Under his policy, for instance, Facebook would presumably allow a candidate to spend hundreds of millions of dollars claiming that his or her opponent ran a pedophile ring in a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C. That outrageous conspiracy theory actually circulated widely about Hillary Clinton in right-wing circles before the last election - but was never circulated as paid advertising. Now, Facebook is saying that if you want to spend a fortune to promote that conspiracy, they are happy to take your money.</p><p>In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi excoriated Facebook: \"They have said very blatantly, very clearly that they intend to be accomplices for misleading the American people with money from God knows where.\"</p><p>It is true that under federal law, internet platforms like Facebook are not liable for what third parties post on their sites. But Facebook still reserves the right to remove posts that violate its rules, or so-called community standards. In fact, it does serve the cause of free speech for those who post on platforms like Facebook to be subject only to the same limitations on speech that our legal system has determined apply in other arenas of life.</p><p>People should be able to speak freely about their views - but should not be allowed to advocate violence or to cry \"fire\" in a crowded theater, because the exercise of that free speech right impinges on other critical rights.</p><p>As things stands now, however, the same does not apply to Facebook when it takes money from a person or organization to advertise their points of view. Once Facebook takes money to promote a candidate or cause, the company becomes an agent of the campaign or organization promoting that message. And once it is an agent of a campaign or cause, it should be held responsible and liable for ads that contain provable lies.</p><p>Facebook should be held to the same standards as TV networks like CNN and CBS, since it is really exactly the same kind of broadcast service.</p><p>Its refusal to do so opens a massive opportunity for conspiracy theorists and demagogues to spend fortunes promoting provably false allegations with absolute impunity. And the sad fact is that if even the most outrageous lie is repeated often enough, large numbers of people will come to believe it. Donald Trump understands that.</p><p>In fact, Trump has shown himself willing to shamelessly lie about both the most insignificant and monumental questions. The Washington Post counts over 16,000 occasions when he made provably false or misleading statements since he became president. What makes anyone think that he - or his organization - will do anything different in the coming campaign?</p><p>Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, is an expert on, and devotee of, social media campaigning. As of November, the Trump campaign had outspent all other campaigns on social media. Facebook provides Parscale with the perfect mechanism to communicate his messages directly to his target audience through a medium that does nothing to check the truthfulness of his communication.</p><p>And we're not just talking about opinions. If Parscale decides to make up a story that the Democratic candidate has a long record of child abuse, and then spends huge sums of money on Facebook to promote that story, there is nothing to stop him.</p><p>Zuckerberg is increasingly concerned about the growing movement to regulate and break up big tech, especially virtual monopolies like Facebook. The president could do a lot to protect Zuckerberg's empire - especially if he is reelected. Democratic candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have openly advocated breaking up Facebook and other big tech companies, cause Zuckerberg special concern.</p><p>All of that makes you wonder what was said in Zuckerberg's private dinner with Trump last fall at the White House.</p><p>It is impossible to overstate the danger that Facebook's policy poses to American democracy. It opens up a gigantic breach in the bulwark of our democratic institutions - and to the integrity of the next election.</p><p>Ordinary citizens need to take matters into their own hands. That's why a number of major progressive organizations are considering a nationwide petition campaign to demand that Facebook refuse to run advertising that contains objectively false statements. We need to join them.</p><p>Robert Creamer, a partner at Democracy Partners, has been a political organizer and strategist for five decades and was a consultant in the last three Democratic presidential campaigns. He is the author of \"Listen to Your Mother: Stand Up Straight: How Progressives Can Win.\"</p><p>In fact, the moment Facebook stops simply allowing others to make posts on its platform and begins taking millions of dollars from them to show ads, the company stops allowing the free speech of others and Facebook itself becomes guilty of spreading lies for pay.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLLEDG-jak-2092994797</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLLEDG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2M-MGY1-JC3H-008H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">254392</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1080\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Clarion-Ledger All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Clarion-Ledger (Jackson, Mississippi)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As Bickert pointed out in her Jan. 8 statement to an Energy and Commerce subcommittee, \"Facebook is a community of more than 2 billion people, spanning countries, cultures and languages across the globe.\"</p><p>That's a quarter of the world's population.</p><p>The firm has massive monopoly power to influence public opinion.</p><p>Facebook's real motivation is money</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims Facebook has adopted this policy because it is committed to protecting \"free expression,\" and that the company should not be the arbiter of truth.</p><p>In fact, this policy has nothing to do with protecting free expression.</p><p>Instead, it is aimed at letting Facebook make hundreds of millions of dollars showing ads on its platform, even if they're untrue.</p><p>In fact, the moment Facebook stops simply allowing others to make posts on its platform and begins taking millions of dollars from them to show ads, the company stops allowing the free speech of others and Facebook itself becomes guilty of spreading lies for pay.</p><p>Under his policy, for instance, Facebook would presumably allow a candidate to spend hundreds of millions of dollars claiming that his or her opponent ran a pedophile ring in a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C.</p><p>That outrageous conspiracy theory actually circulated widely about Hillary Clinton in right-wing circles before the last election - but was never circulated as paid advertising.</p><p>Now, Facebook is saying that if you want to spend a fortune to promote that conspiracy, they are happy to take your money.</p><p>In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi excoriated Facebook: \"They have said very blatantly, very clearly that they intend to be accomplices for misleading the American people with money from God knows where.\"</p><p>It is true that under federal law, internet platforms like Facebook are not liable for what third parties post on their sites. But Facebook still reserves the right to remove posts that violate its rules, or so-called community standards.</p><p>In fact, it does serve the cause of free speech for those who post on platforms like Facebook to be subject only to the same limitations on speech that our legal system has determined apply in other arenas of life.</p><p>People should be able to speak freely about their views - but should not be allowed to advocate violence or to cry \"fire\" in a crowded theater, because the exercise of that free speech right impinges on other critical rights.</p><p>As things stands now, however, the same does not apply to Facebook when it takes money from a person or organization to advertise their points of view. Once Facebook takes money to promote a candidate or cause, the company becomes an agent of the campaign or organization promoting that message. And once it is an agent of a campaign or cause, it should be held responsible and liable for ads that contain provable lies.</p><p>Facebook should be held to the same standards as TV networks like CNN and CBS, since it is really exactly the same kind of broadcast service.</p><p>Its refusal to do so opens a massive opportunity for conspiracy theorists and demagogues to spend fortunes promoting provably false allegations with absolute impunity. And the sad fact is that if even the most outrageous lie is repeated often enough, large numbers of people will come to believe it. Donald Trump understands that.</p><p>Will we let Trump keep spewing lies?</p><p>In fact, Trump has shown himself willing to shamelessly lie about both the most insignificant and monumental questions.</p><p>The Washington Post counts over 16,000 occasions when he made provably false or misleading statements since he became president. What makes anyone think that he - or his organization - will do anything different in the coming campaign?</p><p>Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, is an expert on, and devotee of, social media campaigning. As of November, the Trump campaign had outspent all other campaigns on social media. Facebook provides Parscale with the perfect mechanism to communicate his messages directly to his target audience through a medium that does nothing to check the truthfulness of his communication.</p><p>And we're not just talking about opinions. If Parscale decides to make up a story that the Democratic candidate has a long record of child abuse, and then spends huge sums of money on Facebook to promote that story, there is nothing to stop him.</p><p>Zuckerberg is increasingly concerned about the growing movement to regulate and break up big tech, especially virtual monopolies such as Facebook. The president could do a lot to protect Zuckerberg's empire - especially if he is reelected.</p><p>Democratic candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have openly advocated breaking up Facebook and other big tech companies, cause Zuckerberg special concern.</p><p>All of that makes you wonder what was said in Zuckerberg's private dinner with Trump last fall at the White House.</p><p>It is impossible to overstate the danger that Facebook's policy poses to American democracy. It opens up a gigantic breach in the bulwark of our democratic institutions - and to the integrity of the next election.</p><p>Ordinary citizens need to take matters into their own hands.</p><p>That's why a number of major progressive organizations are considering a nationwide petition campaign to demand that Facebook refuse to run advertising that contains objectively false statements. We need to join them.</p><p>Robert Creamer, a partner at Democracy Partners, has been a political organizer and strategist for five decades and was a consultant in the last three Democratic presidential campaigns.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABIRPT-arn-2093038006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABIRPT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2M-MGY1-JC3H-00YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317181</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"988\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Abilene Reporter-News (Abilene Texas) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Abilene Reporter-News (Texas)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As Bickert pointed out in her Jan. 8 statement to an Energy and Commerce subcommittee, \"Facebook is a community of more than 2 billion people, spanning countries, cultures and languages across the globe.\" That's a quarter of the world's population.</p><p>The firm has massive monopoly power to influence public opinion.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims that Facebook has adopted this policy because it is committed to protecting \"free expression,\" and that the company should not be the arbiter of truth.</p><p>In fact, this policy has nothing to do with protecting free expression. Instead, it is aimed at letting Facebook make hundreds of millions of dollars showing ads on its platform, even if they're untrue. In fact, the moment Facebook stops simply allowing others to make posts on its platform and begins taking millions of dollars from them to show ads, the company stops allowing the free speech of others and Facebook itself becomes guilty of spreading lies for pay.</p><p>Under his policy, for instance, Facebook would presumably allow a candidate to spend hundreds of millions of dollars claiming that his or her opponent ran a pedophile ring in a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C. That outrageous conspiracy theory actually circulated widely about Hillary Clinton in right-wing circles before the last election - but was never circulated as paid advertising. Now, Facebook is saying that if you want to spend a fortune to promote that conspiracy, they are happy to take your money.</p><p>In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi excoriated Facebook: \"They have said very blatantly, very clearly that they intend to be accomplices for misleading the American people with money from God knows where.\"</p><p>Facebook should be held to the same standards as TV networks like CNN and CBS, since it is really exactly the same kind of broadcast service.</p><p>Its refusal to do so opens a massive opportunity for conspiracy theorists and demagogues to spend fortunes promoting provably false allegations with absolute impunity. And the sad fact is that if even the most outrageous lie is repeated often enough, large numbers of people will come to believe it. Donald Trump understands that.</p><p>In fact, Trump has shown himself willing to shamelessly lie about both the most insignificant and monumental questions. The Washington Post counts over 16,000 occasions when he made provably false or misleading statements since he became president. What makes anyone think that he - or his organization - will do anything different in the coming campaign?</p><p>As of November, the Trump campaign had outspent all other campaigns on social media.</p><p>Zuckerberg is increasingly concerned about the growing movement to regulate and break up big tech, especially virtual monopolies like Facebook. The president could do a lot to protect Zuckerberg's empire - especially if he is reelected. Democratic candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have openly advocated breaking up Facebook and other big tech companies, cause Zuckerberg special concern.</p><p>All of that makes you wonder what was said in Zuckerberg's private dinner with Trump last fall at the White House.</p><p>It is impossible to overstate the danger that Facebook's policy poses to American democracy. It opens up a gigantic breach in the bulwark of our democratic institutions - and to the integrity of the next election.</p><p>Ordinary citizens need to take matters into their own hands. That's why a number of major progressive organizations are considering a nationwide petition campaign to demand that Facebook refuse to run advertising that contains objectively false statements. We need to join them.</p><p>Robert Creamer, a partner at Democracy Partners, has been a political organizer and strategist for five decades.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook office in London.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NAPDNW-ndn-2093079713</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NAPDNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2M-MGY1-JC3H-01JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"692\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Naples Daily News (Florida)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As Bickert pointed out in her Jan. 8 statement to an Energy and Commerce subcommittee, \"Facebook is a community of more than 2 billion people, spanning countries, cultures and languages across the globe.\" That's a quarter of the world's population.</p><p>The firm has massive monopoly power to influence public opinion.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims that Facebook has adopted this policy because it is committed to protecting \"free expression,\" and that it should not be the arbiter of truth.</p><p>In fact, this policy has nothing to do with protecting free expression. It is aimed at letting Facebook make hundreds of millions of dollars showing ads on its platform, even if they're untrue. In fact, the moment Facebook stops simply allowing others to make posts on its platform and begins taking millions of dollars from them to show ads, the company stops allowing the free speech of others and Facebook itself becomes guilty of spreading lies for pay.</p><p>Under his policy,  Facebook would presumably allow a candidate to spend hundreds of millions of dollars claiming that his or her opponent ran a pedophile ring in a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C. That outrageous conspiracy theory actually circulated widely about Hillary Clinton in right-wing circles before the last election - but was never circulated as paid advertising. Now, Facebook is saying that if you want to spend a fortune to promote that conspiracy, they are happy to take your money.</p><p>In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi excoriated Facebook: \"They have said very blatantly, very clearly that they intend to be accomplices for misleading the American people with money from God knows where.\"</p><p>It is true that under federal law, internet platforms like Facebook are not liable for what third parties post on their sites. But Facebook still reserves the right to remove posts that violate its rules, or so-called community standards. In fact, it does serve the cause of free speech for those who post on platforms like Facebook to be subject only to the same limitations on speech that our legal system has determined apply in other arenas of life.</p><p>Facebook should be held to the same standards as TV networks like CNN and CBS, since it is really exactly the same kind of broadcast service.</p><p>Its refusal to do so opens a massive opportunity for conspiracy theorists and demagogues to spend fortunes promoting provably false allegations with absolute impunity. And the sad fact is that if even the most outrageous lie is repeated often enough, large numbers of people will come to believe it. Donald Trump understands that.</p><p>In fact, Trump has shown himself willing to shamelessly lie about both the most insignificant and monumental questions. The Washington Post counts over 16,000 occasions when he made provably false or misleading statements since he became president. What makes anyone think that he - or his organization - will do anything different in the coming campaign?</p><p>Zuckerberg is increasingly concerned about the growing movement to regulate and break up big tech, especially virtual monopolies like Facebook. The president could do a lot to protect Zuckerberg's empire - especially if he is reelected. Democratic candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have openly advocated breaking up Facebook and other big tech companies, cause Zuckerberg special concern.</p><p>All of that makes you wonder what was said in Zuckerberg's private dinner with Trump last fall at the White House.</p><p>It is impossible to overstate the danger that Facebook's policy poses to American democracy. It opens up a gigantic breach in the bulwark of our democratic institutions - and to the integrity of the next election.</p><p>Ordinary citizens need to take matters into their own hands. That's why a number of major progressive organizations are considering a nationwide petition campaign to demand that Facebook refuse to run advertising that contains objectively false statements. We need to join them.</p><p>Robert Creamer, a partner at Democracy Partners, was a consultant in the last three Democratic presidential campaigns.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMAPP-mca-2093026533</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMAPP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2M-MGY1-JC3H-00SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Commercial Appeal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There was just one catch: None of it was true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist. While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future comeons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by stategovernment officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied five million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn't make that information available for other ads until Thursday, when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only.</p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them.</p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors'offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors'offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them.</p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time.</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-storey home in Mount Tabor, New Jersey, 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100-million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address - a mailbox in Carlsbad, California - that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company - then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough - for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records.</p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1-million fine.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associated Press Photo;

There was just one catch: None of it was true. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor -- and sometimes President Trump -- to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist. </p><p>While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly -- and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads -- they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner. </p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads. </p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections -- and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation -- loom. </p><p>\"This is definitely concerning -- definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\" </p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms. </p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn't make that information available for other ads until Thursday, when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only. </p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them. </p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program. </p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them. </p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\" </p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies. </p><p>Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\" </p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them. </p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time. </p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, N.J., 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be. </p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said. </p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address -- a mailbox in Carlsbad, Calif. -- that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company -- then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough -- for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records. </p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings. </p><p>Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business. </p><p>Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers. </p><p>Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello, vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc. </p><p>The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers, Marinello said. \"That's how this whole process plays out.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PTR-971029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-2X51-DYG9-62JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279079</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"920\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pittsburgh Tribune Review</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The agency also formally imposed a record $5 billion fine against Facebook for deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet the measures, which the F.T.C.\u2019s commissioners <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/technology/facebook-ftc-fine.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fcecilia-kang&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\">approved in a 3-to-2 vote this month</url>, drew sharp criticism for not going far enough in curbing the data habits of the world\u2019s largest social media company. Republican and Democratic lawmakers pilloried the settlement as a drop in the bucket for Facebook and said the F.T.C. failed to limit a core practice that has repeatedly raised privacy questions: the company\u2019s gathering, sharing and use of people\u2019s personal information.</p><p>That puts American regulators in a difficult position as authorities around the world have stepped up their actions to crimp the power of tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Over the past few years, the United States has been seen as a lesser force in tech regulation, especially compared with European officials who have passed laws and imposed a series of large penalties against the tech giants.</p><p>The F.T.C. agreement \u201cutterly fails to penalize Facebook in any effective way,\u201d said Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri.</p><p>Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is pushing for new federal privacy laws, said the settlement would not deter Facebook from further privacy violations.</p><p>\u201cThe F.T.C. is sending the message that wealthy executives and massive corporations can rampantly violate Americans\u2019 privacy and lie about how our personal information is used and abused and get off with no meaningful consequences,\u201d he said.</p><p>Within the F.T.C., the settlement was divisive, with the agency\u2019s three Republican commissioners voting to approve the deal while the two Democratic commissioners dissented. The agreement stopped short of more punitive measures that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/technology/federal-trade-commission-facebook-mark-zuckerberg.html\">the F.T.C. had previously discussed</url> against Facebook, including holding the chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally liable for missteps and potentially taking the company to court. The fine was also a fraction of Facebook\u2019s $56 billion in annual revenue.</p><p>The agency also agreed the settlement would shield Facebook from known claims of violations before June 12, 2019, essentially giving the company a pass on its past. And it provided immunity to Facebook officers and directors.</p><p>In a statement, the F.T.C.\u2019s Republican commissioners \u2014 including the chairman, Joseph J. Simons \u2014 said they were \u201cproud\u201d of the agreement. The measures \u201cwill provide significant deterrence not just to Facebook, but to every other company that collects or uses consumer data,\u201d they said.</p><p>The F.T.C.\u2019s two Democratic commissioners disagreed. \u201cI fear it leaves the American public vulnerable,\u201d said Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner.</p><p>Rohit Chopra, another Democratic commissioner, warned that the terms of the settlement shielded Facebook from a wide range of problematic practices. \u201cThis shield represents a major win for Facebook, but leaves the public in the dark as to how the company violated the law and what violations, if any, are going unaddressed,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/07/ftc-agreement/\">said in a Facebook post</url> that the F.T.C.\u2019s orders \u201cgo beyond anything required under U.S. law today.\u201d He added that he supported the agreement because it would \u201creduce the number of mistakes we make and help us deliver stronger privacy protections for everyone.\u201d Facebook will report its quarterly earnings later on Wednesday.</p><p>The F.T.C. unveiled the settlement as lawmakers and regulators have recently ratcheted up pressure on Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Last week, Congress held several hearings to question the companies on whether they were stifling free speech and competition. President Trump has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/technology/big-tech-strange-bedfellows.html\">weighed in</url>, calling the tech platforms \u201ccrooked\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d and saying \u201csomething is going to be done.\u201d On Tuesday, the Justice Department said it would start an       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html?module=inline\">antitrust review</url> into how internet giants had amassed market power and whether they had acted to reduce competition.</p><p>Yet it\u2019s unclear if those moves will lead to penalties or changes at the tech companies. That made the F.T.C. agreement the clearest indicator of how far American regulators would go to limit the firms.</p><p>For Facebook, the F.T.C. settlement does not end its regulatory and legal headaches.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that it had imposed a penalty of $100 million against Facebook for making misleading disclosures to investors about the risks of misuse of user data. The agency charged that Facebook had known for two years about the misuse of users\u2019 data \u2014 and had shared that information with company employees \u2014 yet misleadingly presented those risks to investors as merely hypothetical.</p><p>And around the world, Facebook faces other fights. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/technology/facebook-privacy-investigations.html\">The authorities in Europe and elsewhere are lining up to probe and limit tech companies</url> on issues including privacy, antitrust and harmful content such as disinformation and hate speech.</p><p>The F.T.C.\u2019s investigation of Facebook for privacy violations was prompted by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">a report from The New York Times and The Observer of London last year</url> on how the social network allowed Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm to the Trump campaign, to harvest the personal information of its users. Cambridge Analytica used the data to build profiles of American voters without the consent of Facebook users.</p><p>The F.T.C. began examining whether the Cambridge Analytica scandal meant that Facebook had violated a 2011 privacy settlement with the agency. Under that earlier agreement, the company had agreed not to deceive people over how their information was used and shared.</p><p>On Wednesday, the F.T.C. said it had also agreed to settle with Cambridge Analytica\u2019s former chief executive, Alexander Nix, and Aleksandr Kogan, an app developer who worked with the company. In contrast to the immunity the F.T.C. gave Facebook executives, the agency prohibited Mr. Nix and Mr. Kogan from certain business practices.</p><p>With Facebook, the F.T.C. mandated the social network create an independently appointed privacy committee on its board that would review decisions affecting user privacy. The agency also ordered the company to designate compliance officers to oversee a privacy program, undergo regular privacy audits that Mr. Zuckerberg and others must submit to, and appoint an outside assessor to monitor the handling of data.</p><p>During the discussions about the settlement with Facebook, one point of contention among the F.T.C. commissioners was whether it should shield Mr. Zuckerberg; Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg; and other Facebook executives and directors from any personal liability for the company\u2019s transgressions. The Democratic commissioners argued the violations warranted holding the executives personally liable, while the Republican commissioners said new oversight would reduce the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg and others to make unilateral decisions.</p><p>The Democratic commissioners also said that Facebook\u2019s financial gains for violating its previous privacy commitments to the F.T.C. would far surpass the $5 billion fine that the agency was imposing.</p><p>\u201cWhen companies can violate the law, pay big penalties and still turn a profit while keeping their business model intact, enforcement agencies cannot claim victory,\u201d Mr. Chopra said in his dissent.</p><p>The three Republican commissioners said the $5 billion fine was \u201crecord breaking\u201d and that it reset the baseline for privacy cases.</p><p>They also said the F.T.C. did not have a strong enough case to move forward with any litigation against Facebook. Ultimately, Mr. Simons and the other two Republican commissioners, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, said the concessions they were able to extract with a settlement were more valuable \u2014 and far more certain \u2014 than what might be achieved with a drawn-out legal battle in public.</p><p>\u201cIs the relief we would obtain through this settlement equal to or better than what we could reasonably obtain through litigation?\u201d they said. \u201cIf the answer had been \u2018no,\u2019 it would have made sense to aggressively move forward in court. The answer, however, was \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Follow Mike Isaac on Twitter: @MikeIsaac.

The agency also formally imposed a record $5 billion fine against Facebook for deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal data.</p><p> Yet the measures, which the FTC's commissioners approved in a 3-2 vote this month, drew sharp criticism for not going far enough in curbing the data habits of the world's largest social media company. Republican and Democratic lawmakers pilloried the settlement as a drop in the bucket for Facebook and said the FTC failed to limit a core practice that has repeatedly raised privacy questions: the company's gathering, sharing and use of people's personal information.</p><p> The FTC agreement \"utterly fails to penalize Facebook in any effective way,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a R-Mo.</p><p> Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who is pushing for new federal privacy laws, said the settlement would not deter Facebook from further privacy violations.</p><p> The agreement stopped short of more punitive measures that the FTC had previously discussed against Facebook, including holding chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally liable for missteps and potentially taking the company to court. The fine was also a fraction of Facebook's $56 billion in annual revenue.</p><p> The agency also agreed the settlement would shield Facebook from known claims of violations before June 12, 2019, essentially giving the company a pass on its past. And it provided immunity to Facebook officers and directors.</p><p> Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post that the FTC's orders \"go beyond anything required under U.S. law today.\" He added that he supported the agreement because it would \"reduce the number of mistakes we make and help us deliver stronger privacy protections for everyone.\" \u2014 (The New York Times)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-a04f2f5dec2755c28125afe82edfa238ed305e57</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899D9772552F0 NWBKPA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN7-1BM1-DXVP-V1WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"371\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Philadelphia Tribune<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Facebook agreed Tuesday night to hand French judges the identification data of French users who are suspected of distributing hate speech, the country's digital affairs minister said. Who decides what's hate speech?</p><p> Who decides what's good and what's forbidden? Facebook, an American communications company, is aiding and abetting the criminalization of speech. It is unthinkable. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. The globalized, 'bobo-ized [bourgeois Bohemian] upper classes' are filling the 'new citadels' \u2014 as in Medieval France \u2014 and are voting en masse for Macron. They have developed 'a single way of talking and thinking that allows the dominant classes to substitute for the reality of a nation subject to severe stress and strain the fable of a kind and welcoming society.' \u2014 Christophe Guilluy, Twilight of the Elites, Yale University Press, 2019. The suicide of France.[1]Facebook To Give French Judges Identifying Data Of People Suspected Of Hate Speech, Official SaysBy Chris White, Daily Caller,[2] June 26, 2019 Facebook agreed Tuesday night to hand French judges the identification data of French users who are suspected of distributing hate speech, the country's digital affairs minister said. The decisioncomes after several meetings[3]between Zuckerberg and French President Emmanuel Macron, who wants to take a leading role globally on the regulation of hate speech. France's minister for digital affairs Cedric O, one of Macron's advisers, has been an influential person directing Macron's thinking on big tech issues. 'This is huge news, it means that the judicial process will be able to run normally,' O told Reuters. 'It's really very important, they're only doing it for France.' Facebook previously refused to provide such identification data because the Silicon Valley company was worried countries without an independent judiciary could abuse it. It was also not required to fork over data under U.S.-French legal conventions. The company hasbeen under intense pressure[4]to crack down on misinformation. Some are hailing the move, calling it a decision that could have implications across the industry. 'It is a strong signal in terms of regulation,' Sonia Cisse, a counsel at law firm Linklaters, told reporters Tuesday. 'Hate speech is no longer considered part of freedom of speech, it's now on the same level as terrorism.' The decision comes at an awkward moment for government officials and the company. Facebook has increasingly come under fire for being lax with the private data of its users, especially after lawmakers opened an investigation of the company'sdecision[5]to provide data to Cambridge Analytica before the 2016 presidential election. The company disclosed to investors in April that company officials are putting $3 billion aside in the event the Federal Trade Commission fines them for their role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. They have not reached a settlement with the FTC. The fine could be as high as $5 billion. Facebook did not immediately respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.

But it was the first regulatory penalty against Facebook in a scandal that swelled into a reputational nightmare for Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. The debacle prompted government hearings in the U.S. and Europe, as well as calls for stricter rules on the data-sharing practices of big tech companies.</p><p>The U.K.'s Information Commissioner's Office on Wednesday said an agreement had been reached with Facebook over the fine but that the social network had \"made no admission of liability.\"</p><p>The settlement resolves that first regulatory headache from the scandal and highlights Facebook's legal tenacity in fighting privacy cases even as its public posture on the issue has softened.</p><p>Both Facebook and the privacy regulator launched appeals against one another, with Facebook demanding to see documents the ICO had seized from Cambridge Analytica, which has since closed down. It also disputed how the regulator conducted its investigation.</p><p>The ICO has said its investigation confirmed that Cambridge Analytica got access to data on tens of millions of Facebook users from the developer of a third-party app that plugged into the social network. That included data on roughly a million U.K. residents, it said.</p><p>While Facebook has now settled the U.K. probe, it still faces antitrust inquiries in the U.S. and 11 more privacy investigations in Ireland, which could lead to major fines. Ireland's Data Protection Commission is Facebook's lead privacy regulator under the European Union's new privacy law because the company's regional headquarters are in Dublin.</p><p>The most advanced case in Ireland involves whether Facebook's WhatsApp chat service gives adequate notice to users for how it shares their data, while others are examining topics such as whether Facebook gets sufficient consent for its use of personal data for advertising.</p><p>The &amp;#163;500,000 fine in the U.K. was the maximum penalty under the country's older privacy law. However, it could have been much bigger under the new EU law. Now, the U.K. regulator can issue fines of up to 4% of a company's annual global revenue. In Facebook's case that could have been roughly $1.6 billion.</p><p>\"We are pleased to have reached a settlement with the ICO,\" said Harry Kinmonth, Facebook's director and associate general counsel. \"As we have said before, we wish we had done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica in 2015.\"</p><p>Mr. Kinmonth added that Facebook would cooperate with the ICO's wider investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes.</p><p>Facebook's political advertising policies have become the focus of sharp debate.

This means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review,\" Clegg said in a statement.\u00a0However, when a politician shares previously debunked content including links, videos and photos, Facebook plans to demote that content, display related information from fact-checkers, and reject its inclusion in advertisements.\u00a0\"From now on, we will treat speech from politicians as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard.\"\u00a0\"However, in keeping with the principle that we apply different standards to content for which we receive payment, this will not apply to ads -- if someone chooses to post an ad on Facebook, they must still fall within our Community Standards and our advertising policies,\" Clegg elaborated.\u00a0Since the 2016 US presidential election, Facebook has been trying to tackle the spread of misinformation on its platform.\u00a0Clegg spent two decades in European politics, including as Deputy Prime Minister in the UK for five years.\u00a0\"A company that has created 40,000 US jobs in the last two years, is set to create 40,000 more in the coming years, and contribute tens of billions of dollars to the economy. </p><p>And with plans to spend more than $250 billion in the US in the next four years,\" he informed.\u00a0\"And while Facebook is subject to a lot of criticism in Europe, in India where I was earlier this month, and in many other places, the only place where it is being proposed that Facebook and other big Silicon Valley companies should be dismembered is here,\" Clegg added.\u00a0Facebook and other US tech companies not only face fierce competition from each other for every service they provide -- for photo and video sharing and messaging there are rival apps with millions or billions of users -- but they also face increasingly fierce competition from their Chinese rivals -- Giants like Alibaba, TikTok and WeChat.\u00a0\"More importantly, pulling apart globally successful American businesses won't actually do anything to solve the big issues we are all grappling with -- privacy, the use of data, harmful content and the integrity of our elections,\" Clegg emphasized, amid global calls to break up Facebook.\u00a0It is no secret that Facebook made mistakes in 2016, and that Russia tried to use Facebook to interfere with the election by spreading division and misinformation.\u00a0Clegg said the company will recruit 30,000 people and invest hugely in artificial intelligence systems to take down harmful content.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Last year, a Stanford report found that interactions with fake news on Facebook were down by two-thirds since 2016.\u00a0<br/>\"Crucially, we have also tightened our\u00a0<br/>rules<br/>\u00a0on political ads. Political advertising on Facebook is now far more transparent than anywhere else -- including TV, radio and print advertising,\" said Clegg.\u00a0<br/>\"I understand the debate about big tech companies and how to tackle the real concerns that exist about data, privacy, content and election integrity.\"\u00a0<br/>\"But I firmly believe that simply breaking them up will not make the problems go away.

He memorized them and knew right where to find them if he needed them in the middle of a cross-examination.   Of those 50, maybe two dozen were the kind you just don\u2019t forget \u2014 bald, vivid illustrations of what the government hoped to prove: that Microsoft was using its monopoly power to squeeze Netscape, the upstart browser company that Microsoft viewed as a potential threat to its Windows monopoly.   \u201cHow much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape?\u201d Microsoft founder Bill Gates asked, according to an email recapping a meeting with AOL executives. (He added, \u201cThis is your lucky day.\u201d)   In another email, Gates suggested that Microsoft offer Intuit \u201csomething like $1M \u2026 in return for switching browsers\u201d from Netscape to Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer.   There were plenty of others just like those. Collectively, they showed Microsoft was willing to use every trick in the monopolist\u2019s handbook to \u201ccut off Netscape\u2019s air supply,\u201d to use another memorable phrase that came out of the trial: offering financial incentives to computer makers that stopped pre-installing Netscape; giving away its browser free; leveraging its operating system to favor its own browser over its rival\u2019s.   If you read about the recent hearing before the House Judiciary Committee antitrust subcommittee, you already know why I took this little trip down memory lane. The news articles focused on what was said during the five-hour hearing, both by the lawmakers asking the questions and the four tech CEOs who were answering them \u2014 Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai.   But the committee also posted on its website a handful of internal emails the companies had turned over. My colleague Tara Lachapelle  made the point that the nation\u2019s primary competition law, the Sherman Antitrust Act, was enacted more than 100 years ago and was aimed at then-dominant businesses like railroads. Preventing abusive monopoly practices by today\u2019s dominant technology companies has proved to be difficult in part because antitrust law never anticipated the business models that have made Google, Facebook and others so powerful.   Up to a point, I agree. That\u2019s why a new breed of antitrust thinkers such as Lena Khan (who is working with the Democrats on the antitrust panel) and the economist Hal Singer have developed new ideas for reining in Big Tech.    But the emails suggest that even without passing new laws, a lot can be done to stop Big Tech\u2019s monopolistic practices. There are enough similarities between those old Bill Gates emails and the documents released by the antitrust panel to make me think that a few good old-fashioned lawsuits might well do the trick.   Let\u2019s take a look at what the committee unearthed from Facebook, Amazon and Google,(2) shall we?   \u201cInstagram is eating our lunch,\u201d begins an internal Facebook discussion. \u201cWe should have owned this space but we are already losing quite badly. \u2026 I find myself checking it far more often than FB mobile. It is a far more focused, compelling way to keep up with what my friends are doing.\u201d   Someone in the discussion responds, \u201cIsn\u2019t that why we\u2019re building an Instagram clone?\u201d   In another email, Zuckerberg considers a different way to deal with the new competition: \u201cYeah, I remember your internal post about how Instagram was our threat,\u201d he writes to an executive whose name has been redacted. \u201cOne thing about startups though is that you can often acquire them. I think this is a good outcome for everyone.\u201d Which of course is what happened: Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012. It was an excellent outcome for Facebook but not so much for anyone who hoped to see competition among social media companies.   Amazon:   \u201cMore evidence these guys are our #1 short-term competitor,\u201d read a 2009 email referring to Diapers.com. \u201cAs I\u2019ve mentioned to each of you, we need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost.\u201d Another email in the same chain read, \u201cThey may be giving us a run for our money. We can approach them through the \u2018We would be willing to explore a range of relationships\u2019 angle.\u201d In 2011, Amazon bought Diapers.com\u2019s parent company, Quidsi, for $545 million. (It shut down the brand in 2017).   During the hearing, Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal confronted Bezos with reports that Amazon used data it gleaned from firms that sell their wares on the company\u2019s platform to favor its own competing products. Bezos responded by saying that while that was against company policy, \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you that policy has never been violated.\u201d    Google:   Most of the Google documents released by the committee had to do with acquisitions \u2014 of DoubleClick and YouTube especially \u2014 but there was one in particular that caught my eye. It was about \u201cverticals,\u201d in which Google uses its main search engine to promote its own industry-specific products in areas such as travel and local business reviews over those from companies such as Expedia and Yelp. At the time the email was written, the company was trying to decide whether \u2014 and how \u2014 to start offering verticals.    \u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d   a) \u201cLoss of traffic from google.com \u2026 .   b) Related revenue loss to high spend verticals like travel.   c) Missing oppty if someone else creates the platform to build verticals.   d) If one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high quality verticals, we are hurt badly.\u201d   Google of course did begin offering \u201chigh quality verticals,\u201d and companies such as Yelp have complained to antitrust regulators ever since that Google is using its platform to favor itself at the expense of companies that rely on it for their lifeblood.   Even though antitrust law might need to be amended to clarify what is \u2014and isn\u2019t \u2014 acceptable practices by the big tech companies, these emails and documents show that there is already enough evidence to file antitrust lawsuits. \u201cMergers and acquisitions that buy off potential competitive threats violate the antitrust laws,\u201d Jerry Nadler, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said to Zuckerberg. \u201cIn your own words, you purchased Instagram to neutralize a competitive threat.\u201d   Amazon\u2019s practice of losing money on a product to hurt a rival isn\u2019t all that different from Microsoft giving Internet Explorer away free knowing that would make it difficult for Netscape to compete. Google using its platform \u2014 a platform thousands of companies can\u2019t live without \u2014 to favor itself is also similar to Microsoft behavior the Justice Department viewed as illegal.   Would these lawsuits take years to play out in the courts? Yes. But the common complaint that technology moves too fast for the court system is wrong. Microsoft lost at the trial stage, and although much of the district court\u2019s decision was overturned on appeal, that had less to do with the facts than with the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, who had foolishly talked to certain reporters behind the scenes during the trial.    In the end, though, the Justice Department won. In 2001, Microsoft settled with the federal government; more important, its behavior changed. Microsoft ended its abusive practices. Operating systems became less important. Google, Facebook and Amazon were all able to emerge without having to worry about threats from Microsoft.   Google, Facebook and Amazon can also be forced to end their abusive practices. What\u2019s needed is an antitrust department willing to take the companies to court. Thanks to the congressional panel, the evidence is already there.   (1) My wife has been Boies\u2019s longtime media adviser. But she had no connection to him \u2014 or me, for that matter \u2014 when I covered the Microsoft trial for Fortune magazine.   (2) The committee released emails from Apple as well. The primary antitrust issue with Apple is the power of its app store to help or hurt companies offering apps. Although many of the Apple emails related to app store issues, the antitrust implications of most of them was not readily apparent.

El hecho de que por el momento las exigencias regulatorias a las big tech sean menores distorsiona la competencia. Si se acaba con esta diferencia puede ser un xito desde el punto de vista de la estabilidad financiera, reconoce, aunque quiz evita que las big tech puedan competir 'cara a cara' con los bancos tradicionales y ve muy complicado que esta medida se implemente. Las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas han irrumpido con fuerza sobre todo en los sistemas de pago. Por ejemplo, Google fue la primera gran tecnol\u00f3gica en obtener licencia para operar como entidad de pago en Reino Unido, pero con el Brexit tuvo que registrarse en Irlanda en marzo de 2019 para poder iniciar su actividad en Europa. Sin embargo, las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas rehuyen captar dep\u00f3sitos para evitar una regulaci\u00f3n ms severa. En otro artculo de la revista de estabilidad financiera, el Banco de Espa\u00f1a advirti\u00f3 ayer de que la presi\u00f3n del mercado en el entorno de transformaci\u00f3n digital 'puede forzar' a los bancos a tomar decisiones que aumenten significativamente los riesgos a los que estn expuestos y propone incorporar al consejo de administraci\u00f3n miembros con experiencia en aspectos relacionados con la tecnologa.Ms inters por los bancos digitalesUn 42% de los usuarios de servicios financieros elegira a un proveedor que no fuera su entidad tradicional si tuvieran que cambiar de entidad, decantndose prioritariamente por un nuevo banco digital. Esta es una de las conclusiones del V Bar\u00f3metro de Innovaci\u00f3n Financiera elaborado por Funcas junto a Finnovating, donde se revela que esta predilecci\u00f3n se ha acentuado en los \u00faltimos meses. El 42% supera, de hecho, en 13 puntos porcentuales a los que ya manifestaban su predilecci\u00f3n por una entidad no tradicional en el a\u00f1o 2018 y en cinco puntos al semestre anterior, siendo un nuevo banco digital el primero que elegiran, con un 39% del total. Aunque la predisposici\u00f3n a abrir una cuenta corriente con una gran compa\u00f1a tecnol\u00f3gica aumenta, menos de la mitad la abrira con Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Uber o Netflix.COMPARTIR:<url normalizedValue=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.tynmagazine.com/facebook-amazon-apple-y-google-ponen-bajo-estres-el-sistema-financiero/http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;#38;url=http://www.tynmagazine.com/facebook-amazon-apple-y-google-ponen-bajo-estres-el-sistema-financiero/\">https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.tynmagazine.com/facebook-amazon-apple-y-google-ponen-bajo-estres-el-sistema-financiero/http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;#38;url=http://www.tynmagazine.com/facebook-amazon-apple-y-google-ponen-bajo-estres-el-sistema-financiero/</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tynmagazine.com/asi-sera-el-futuro-de-las-big-tech-tras-la-crisis\">https://www.tynmagazine.com/asi-sera-el-futuro-de-las-big-tech-tras-la-crisis</url>/ [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tynmagazine.com/facebook-adopta-el-teletrabajo-de-forma-permanente\">https://www.tynmagazine.com/facebook-adopta-el-teletrabajo-de-forma-permanente</url>/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tynmagazine.com/estados-unidos-presentaria-denuncia-por-monopolio-contra-google\">https://www.tynmagazine.com/estados-unidos-presentaria-denuncia-por-monopolio-contra-google</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TYNL129545159084404367775776100219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TYNL-129545</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6019-Y2R1-F03R-N24M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><timeReceived>1:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>TyN Magazine</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 30, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>Spanish</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002OTO</classCode><className>BANCO SANTANDER SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amazon's owner, is one of the faces of the conglomerate of what is known worldwide as the four giants of technology, or the \"Big Tech\": Amazon, Google, directed by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sundar Pichai;</emphasis>Apple, by Steve Jobs' successor, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Cook;</emphasis> and Facebook, by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Zuckerberg.</emphasis><br/>All of them are being investigated in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">United States Congress,</emphasis>suspected of engaging in monopoly practices.</p><p><br/>\"These companies, as they exist today, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">have monopoly power.</emphasis> Some should be divided. All must be adequately <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">regulated </emphasis>and explained,\" said <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Cicilline,</emphasis>a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and host of the session.<br/>\"When these laws were written, the monopolys were men named <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rockefeller and Carnegie,\"</emphasis>he continued. \"Today the men are called Zuckerberg, Cook, Pichai and Bezos. Once again, their market control allows them to do whatever it takes to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">crush independent businesses and expand their own power.</emphasis> This must end,\" he said.<br/>The Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee saved no criticism of big tech. And one of the most common reviews was encompassed in a term: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gatekeepers.</emphasis> Owners of the \"doors\", that is, they can control access to information or services, despite having <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">an extreme free market discourse.</emphasis><br/>Of course, Amazon isn't the only one at the center of the controversy. If we had to summarize the question that was most heard, in different ways, this Wednesday, could be: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">how did your company become such a big thing?</emphasis> Under what practices?<br/>For various (and suspicious) actions had to give explanations four of the most powerful men in the world, who spoke through a videoconference (Webex), in the context of the coronavirus pandemic?.<br/>Amazon<br/>The most common criticism of Amazon has to do with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">its business model of manufacturing products.</emphasis> Unlike other ecommerce pages, Amazon also makes its own products. To understand it with a very much at-hand example: Free Market? it does not manufacture products, but also plays an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Amazon goes further.<br/>When the company identifies that a product of a brand is selling very well, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">it has a very valuable asset</emphasis>: all the information of the seller.<br/>So <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the main accusation is that Amazon destroys the competition by generating its own \"first-party\" products </emphasis>(which is paradoxical because in turn those sellers pay a commission to Amazon), as revealed by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wall Street Journal</emphasis> in an article that was cited at the hearing.<br/>This would be monopoly, the article notes, because it does not let competitors move on the platform because of the demand for their products, but the heaviest actor, Amazon,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> plannedly takes them out of the competition.</emphasis><br/>Of course, Bezos denied this at the hearing, but ended up admitting that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">there is a window open to this happening.</emphasis><br/>\"I can't answer that question for yes or no, we have a policy against using seller information to help our own business, but<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> I can't guarantee that policy hasn't been violated,\"</emphasis>he explained.<br/>Google<br/>One of Google's most questioned points is not at all minor, as it is directly related to the election in the United States: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">how the famous search engine handles searches and</emphasis>Advertising.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sundar Pichai,</emphasis>its CEO, had to answer several questions in this regard. And the accusation is always the same: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google routes searches to its products</emphasis> and even \"steals\" content from other services like Yelp.<br/>Pichai's answers were always in this regard: Google gives the information that users are looking for and goes through a manual intervention system when it comes to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">displaying</emphasis> a result (except when, he explained, there is some national law asking to download a search).<br/>\"We approach our work nonpartisanly,\" he said, adding, \"We will continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way.\"<br/>Facebook<br/>Zuckerberg's is perhaps the most sensitive case for the upcoming U.S. presidential election. How the advertising shows the platform, next to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Instagram</emphasis> (owned by the conglomerate), is something that was asked over and over again in the session.<br/>The monstrosity of Facebook's holding company was the starting point. That's why they<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">asked Zuckerberg about purchases from other companies,</emphasis>particularly for buying Instagram in 2012 for<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> $1 billion.</emphasis><br/>Rep. Jerry Nadler quoted an email from Zuckerberg discussing the need <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">to \"neutralize the competition.\"</emphasis> A practice of \"bullying\" and \"aggressive acquisitions\" that he was raised, appears to be common currency in Facebook politics.<br/>\"This is exactly the kind of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">anti-competitive </emphasis>acquisition by which antitrust laws were designed,\" Nadler said.<br/>The Case of Facebook was one of the most complex, where they skipped more themes. For example, it was noted that Zuckerberg <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">bought an app to monitor user behaviors on their phones,</emphasis>to see from that information what services they used the most.<br/>If there were any middle actors or boys, Facebook would go out and buy it to \"neutralize the competition, the reps instigated.<br/>Zuckerberg defended himself by saying that it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">was \"more than obvious\" that Instagram was going to grow,</emphasis>and that because Facebook is a \"social media\" platform, it was part of his business plan to buy it.<br/>Apple<br/>No doubt Apple was the least questioned.

But Democrats and Republicans took different approaches in questioning how the tech giants wield power and, at times, veered far away from the hearing's stated purpose of market dominance and competition. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The chief executives of the nation's top technology companies -- Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple -- testified virtually before a House antitrust panel that conducted a year-long investigation into whether the tech titans have crushed competition and how lawmakers may need to rethink federal laws to regulate them. The hearing comes as the companies face multiple probes both across the country and in Europe that could challenge their stature and how they operate. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The CEOs represent areas of the tech world ranging from social media to e-commerce and have accumulated massive net worths and celebrity status. Their companies have endured scrutiny and, at times, scorn, from the American public and have been caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump. </p><p>Democrats largely grilled the four CEOs over practices that they believe resembled that of past monopolies, with lawmakers arguing that they've gathered evidence and documents on how the companies have used data to crush competition and acquired competitors in order to neutralize them. </p><p>\"Many of the practices used by these companies have harmful economic effects. They discourage entrepreneurship, destroy jobs, hike costs and degrade quality. Simply put, they have too much power,\" Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline of Rhode Island said. </p><p>Several Republicans cautioned against going after massive companies because of their size alone, arguing that regulating big companies can have adverse effects on small businesses. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, ranking member of the antitrust subcommittee, argued that companies should be held accountable as it relates to existing antitrust law. </p><p>\"I have reached the conclusion that we do not need to change our antitrust laws,\" the Wisconsin Republican said at a later point in the hearing. \"They've been working just fine. The question here is the question of enforcement of those antitrust laws.\" </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2020-07-03/advertisers-flee-facebook-amid-progressive-led-boycott\">Advertisers Flee Facebook Amid Progressive-Led Boycott</url>]</p><p>But Republicans on the committee pursued their own grievances against the tech giants, using much of their time to lambaste Facebook and Google for perceived -- and largely unfounded -- anti-conservative bias. The chief executives have all denied any censorship on their online platforms based on political ideology. </p><p>\"I'll cut to the chase: Big tech's out to get conservatives,\" Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the full House Judiciary Committee, said in his opening remarks. </p><p>All four CEOs defended their companies' practices, arguing that they each exist in markets where competition thrives. The chief executives used their opening statements to tout the benefits of their companies, particularly during a global pandemic, by connecting them with family and friends and providing access to vital goods and services. </p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in particular faced some of the sharpest questioning from members of both parties. </p><p>A number of Democrats aggressively questioned Zuckerberg over Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram, a popular photo-sharing platform. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York argued that the merger resembled an \"anti-competitive acquisition\" and questioned why Instagram shouldn't be broken off into a separate company. </p><p>Zuckerberg argued that when he purchased Instagram, there was no guarantee that it'd be as successful as it now is. He also noted that the Federal Trade Commission decided against challenging the acquisition at the time. </p><p>\"In hindsight, it looks obvious that Instagram reached the scale it has,\" Zuckerberg said. \"At the time, it was far from obvious.\" </p><p>Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado cited internal emails between Zuckerberg and other executives in which he mused about the company's ability to \"always just buy any competitive startups, but it'll be awhile before we can buy Google.\" Another email from a company executive compared Facebook's merger tactics to a \"land grab.\" Zuckerberg said he didn't remember the email about buying the competition but responded that it \"sounds like a joke.\" </p><p>In Jeff Bezos' first congressional hearing since launching Amazon in 1994, the executive was pressed by both Republicans and Democrats over a report from The Wall Street Journal alleging that Amazon uses data from third-party sellers to help create and boost its own competing products. </p><p>\"I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated,\" said Bezos, the wealthiest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $180 billion. \"We continue to look into that very carefully. I'm not yet satisfied that we've gotten to the bottom of it, and we're going to keep looking at it.\" </p><p>Amazon's policies ban the use of third-party seller data, but Rep. Pramila Jayapal pointed to employee interviews conducted through the committee's investigation that indicated that the policy hasn't been enforced. She also argued that the company's ability to collect aggregate data -- or information from multiple sellers -- on products gives them the upper hand. </p><p>\"So you can set the rules of the game for your competitors but not actually follow those same rules for yourself,\" said the Washington Democrat, whose district includes Amazon's Seattle headquarters. </p><p>Republicans, meanwhile, challenged Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai on political bias and a host of other issues that had little to do with antitrust law. Both chief executives responded that their companies seek to operate in a nonpartisan fashion and promote free speech and expression regardless of political views. </p><p>Some members targeted Google for its relationships with China and lamented the company's withdrawal from competing for a bid with the Defense Department. Pichai responded that Google has a \"very limited presence\" in China. Others questioned if Google will continue to work with law enforcement agencies in light of some employees' concerns amid the protests against police brutality. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2020-06-18/facebook-removes-trump-campaign-ads-citing-organized-hate\">Facebook Removes Trump Campaign Ads Citing 'Organized Hate'</url>]</p><p>When it comes to accusations of anti-conservative bias, Rep. Greg Steube of Florida questioned why a conservative website couldn't be found on Google searches when he checked a few months ago. He also noted that some of his campaign emails were blocked or sent to a person's spam folder through Gmail. </p><p>\"We approach our work with a deep sense of responsibility in a nonpartisan way,\" Pichai said. \"There's nothing in the algorithm which has anything to do with political ideology. We do get complaints across the aisle.\" </p><p>The blockbuster hearing got tense at several points between lawmakers particularly over a Democrat's characterization of a GOP member's line of questioning. </p><p>After Jordan's questioning on whether Google would help presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the 2020 election, Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania said she wanted to redirect the focus of the hearing \"to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories.\" </p><p>Shouting erupted as Jordan interrupted Scanlon's questioning and Cicilline gaveled for him to cede the floor to his Democratic colleague. The situation escalated with an increasingly common partisan rejoinder, as Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland interjected by demanding that Jordan, \"Put your mask on.\" </p><p/><p>Lisa Hagen is a politics reporter for U.S. News &amp; World Report covering Congress, the 2020 campaign and the Supreme Court.
