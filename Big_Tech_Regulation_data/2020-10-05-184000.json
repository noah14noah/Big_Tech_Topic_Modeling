state prosecutors are readying a joint antitrust investigation into big tech, including Facebook and Amazon, as soon as next month. </p><p>The attorneys are expected to issue investigative demands, similar to subpoenas, to the tech companies and affiliated business, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.</p><p>The prosecutors' action coincides with a move by the Department of Justice, which announced its own antitrust review into big tech last month.</p><p>The big four, Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, have been accused of using their marketplace dominance to bulldoze opposition. </p><p>An official announcement of the start of the attorneys' investigation is anticipated next month.</p><p>The four big tech companies likely to be scrutinized declined to comment. </p><p>The DOJ said last month it is reviewing 'whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.' </p><p>The political forces behind the states' probe are not yet clear, but the Journal reported, a bipartisan legal team could provide the investigation defense against accusations it is fueled by the GOP's concerns for freedom of speech.</p><p>Social media companies have frequently been accused of a heavy-handed approach to conservative views and having employees with a liberal bias. </p><p>In July, around a dozen state attorneys, both Republican and Democrat, met with DOJ officials in Washington to discuss their concerns with the tech industry, the Journal reported.</p><p>Those Justice Department chiefs are understood to have included Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim.</p><p>'The attorneys general involved have concerns over the control of personal data by large tech companies and will hold them accountable for anticompetitive practices that endanger privacy and consumer data,' a spokesman for New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, told the paper.</p><p>In addition to the state attorneys and the DOJ, the Federal Trade Commission, an independent government agency, is also looking into issues surrounding competitiveness in the industry.</p><p>Once seen as the darlings of Washington, Silicon Valley firms have become targets for politicians of all stripes.</p><p>US regulators recently imposed a record $5 billion fine on Facebook for lapses in privacy and data protection, including the leaking of private data for political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. </p><p>Tech firms and their backers deny monopolistic conduct and argue the fast-evolving digital economy has robust competition and has led to lower prices and more choice for consumers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

So once a year I list my firm\u2019s holdings in this column.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Currently I own 20 stocks for most of my clients. I own most of them personally as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I hold two stocks that depend on consumer discretionary spending \u2013 NVR Inc. (NVR), a homebuilder, and Sony Corp. (SNE), a Japanese consumer electronics company. NVR is my longest-standing holding, going back to 2012. I\u2019ve owned Sony for two years; it went nowhere for a while but is up 32 percent this year.</p><p>Consumer-staples stocks are popular these days, but I deem most of them overpriced. I own only Sanderson Farms Inc. (SAFM), a Mississippi-based chicken producer and processor. It\u2019s a long-standing trend for Americans to eat less beef and more chicken each year.</p><p>In the energy sector, I own nothing. There will be big gains to be made by piling back into energy at the right time \u2013 but in my opinion that time hasn\u2019t yet come.</p><p>I hold four financial stocks. Two of them are big banks, JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC). They are likely to earn better lending spreads if interest rates rise over the next two to three years. They might also benefit from looser regulation, if the Trump administration gets its way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Two from Tom</emphasis></p><p>My other two financial holdings are stocks that my colleague Tom Macpherson is sweet on \u2013 Mastercard Inc. (MA) and T. Rowe Price Inc. (TROW). Mastercard has earned a return on stockholders\u2019 equity of more than 40 percent in nine of the past 10 years.</p><p>T. Rowe Price, which runs mutual funds, has also been unusually profitable but is fighting the increasing popularity of \u201cpassive\u201d or index investing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Up for grabs</emphasis></p><p>I am light in health care because the rules for financing health care in the U.S. are up for grabs. However, I like Fonar Corp. (FONR) of Melville, N.Y., which makes MRI machines in which patients can stand up, allowing doctors to see a weight-bearing image. We also own Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO), a Danish company that is a world leader in diabetes treatments.</p><p>In the industrial sector, I hold a pair of defense stocks, General Dynamics Corp. (GD) and Leonardo SpA (FINMY). General Dynamics is a broad-stream defense contractor that I have liked for many years. Leonardo is an Italian defense contractor.</p><p>I figure that European defense companies will do more business as Europe reacts on the east to the threat of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and on the west to President Trump\u2019s insistence that it pay more of its own defense cost.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What glitters?</emphasis></p><p>The only security I own in the materials sector is SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which represents holdings of physical gold. Gold frequently (not always) does well during periods of inflation or international turmoil. Both conditions seem reasonably likely to me in the next two to three years.</p><p>In technology, my firm has several holdings, mostly picked by my colleague Katharine Davidge. We have two semiconductor equipment stocks, Lam Research Corp. (LRCX) and Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT).</p><p>From Israel comes Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP), a leader in loss prevention and cybersecurity. And from Canada comes Computer Modelling Group Ltd. (CMDXF), which makes software used to more efficiently drill for oil and gas.</p><p>The uber-popular big tech stocks such as Microsoft and Facebook are represented by Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Naked</emphasis></p><p>In telecommunications, utilities and real estate, we are naked, with no positions at all for most clients.</p><p>To me, the utilities are way too expensive considering what slow-growth companies they are. I have nothing against telecom in the abstract but find little to excite me there.</p><p>As for real estate, I\u2019m troubled that the \u201ccap rate\u201d (rents as a percentage of the price to purchase a building) are now ranging mostly between 5.5 percent and 7 percent. So, buyers of buildings are counting on capital appreciation, which may or may not come.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Foreign exposure</emphasis></p><p>Rounding out our model portfolio, we own three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in addition to XLK, mentioned above. They are iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG), SPDR S&amp;P Emerging Markets Dividend ETF (EDIV), and Index IQ Australia Small Cap ETF (KROO).</p><p>As you can surmise from these holdings, I\u2019m specifically looking for equity exposure outside the U.S. I think the American economy is OK and strengthening, but stock prices here are on the high side, about 25 times earnings compared to a normal multiple of about 15.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAPILT-a025ffcc4a1c11e7910400163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAPILT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NTM-30X1-DYR7-R0DB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144571</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Virginian-Pilot Companies LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Virginian - Pilot (Norfolk, VA.)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 18, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002HW0</classCode><className>SONY CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002869</classCode><className>NVR INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

So, once a year I list my firm's holdings in this column. Currently I own 20 stocks for most of my clients. </p><p>I own most of them personally as well. I hold two stocks that depend on consumer discretionary spending - NVR Inc. (NYSE:NVR[1]), a homebuilder, and Sony Corp. (NYSE:SNE[2]), a Japanese consumer electronics company. NVR is my longest-standing holding, going back to 2012. I've owned Sony for two years; it went nowhere for a while but is up 32% this year.Consumer-staples stocks are popular these days, but I deem most of them overpriced. I own only Sanderson Farms Inc. (SAFM), a Mississippi-based chicken producer and processor. It's a longstanding trend for Americans to eat less beef and more chicken each year. In the energy sector, I own nothing. There will be big gains to be made by piling back into energy at the right time - but in my opinion that time hasn't yet come. I hold four financial stocks. Two of them are big banks, JPMorgan Chase .... (NYSE:JPM[3]) and Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC[4]). They are likely to earn better lending spreads if interest rates rise over the next two to three years. They might also benefit from looser regulation, if the Trump administration gets its way. Two from Tom My other two financial holdings are stocks that my colleague Tom Macpherson is sweet on - Mastercard Inc. (MA) and T. Rowe Price Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW[5]). Mastercard has earned a return on stockholders' equity of more than 40% in nine of the past ten years. T. Rowe Price, which runs mutual funds, has also been unusually profitable but is fighting the increasing popularity of 'passive' or index investing. Up for Grabs I am light in health care, because the rules for financing health care in the U.S. are up for grabs. However, I like Fonar Corp. (NASDAQ:FONR[6]) of Melville, New York, which makes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines in which patients can stand up, allowing doctors to see a weight-bearing image. We also own Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO), a Danish company that is a world leader in diabetes treatments. In the industrial sector, I hold a pair of defense stocks, General Dynamics Corp. (GD) and Leonardo SA (FINMY). General Dynamics is a broad-stream defense contractor that I have liked for many years. Leonardo is an Italian defense contractor. I figure that European defense companies will do more business as Europe reacts on the east to the threat of Vladimir Putin's Russia, and on the west to President Trump's insistence that it pay more of its own defense cost. What Glitters? The only security I own in the materials sector is SPDR Gold Shares (GLD[7]), which represents holdings of physical gold. Gold frequently (not always) does well during periods of inflation or international turmoil. Both conditions seem reasonably likely to me in the next two to three years. In technology, my firm has several holdings, mostly picked by my colleague Katharine Davidge. We have two semiconductor equipment stocks, Lam Research Corp. (NASDAQ:LRCX[8]) and Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT[9]). From Israel comes Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP[10]), a leader in loss prevention and cybersecurity. And from Canada comes Computer Modelling Group Ltd. (CMDXF[11]), which makes software used to more efficiently drill for oil and gas. The uber-popular big tech stocks such as Microsoft and Facebook are represented by Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK). Naked In telecommunications, utilities and real estate, we are naked, with no positions at all for most clients. To me, the utilities are way too expensive considering what slow-growth companies they are. I have nothing against telecom in the abstract, but find little to excite me there. As for real estate, I'm troubled that the 'cap rate' (rents as a percentage of the price to purchase a building) are now ranging mostly between 5.5%-7%. So buyers of buildings are counting on capital appreciation, which may or may not come. Foreign Exposure Rounding out our model portfolio, we own three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in addition to XLK, mentioned above. They are iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG), SPDR S...merging Markets Dividend ETF (EDIV), and Index IQ Australia Small Cap ETF (KROO). As you can surmise from these holdings, I'm specifically looking for equity exposure outside the U.S. I think the American economy is OK and strengthening but stock prices here are on the high side, about 25 earnings compared to a normal multiple of about 15.

It's Monday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to all our first movers around the globe. Good to be with you on a milestone day here in New York City, as the reopening continues. For the first time in three months, we can now get a haircut. Yes, it's the simple pleasures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Restaurants can serve outside. Some workers are heading back to the city, too. I'll emphasize the some. Sadly, the news in many parts of the United States and around the world, too remains sobering. Twenty three U.S. states are reporting a rise in infections and the World Health Organization recorded its largest ever jump in global COVID-19 cases on Sunday. So the battle, well and truly continues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Right now, I'll give you a look at what we're seeing for U.S. stock market futures. Solidly higher after gains last week, too. Friday's session though was dented by news that Apple plans to shut 11 stores in states with rising COVID cases. The stop start recovery.</p><p>Asian stocks meanwhile are treading water, as you can see today, though the Nikkei and the Hang Seng have gained more than three percent over the last five sessions. Let's take at European stocks, too. They are soft, but all the majors as well rising some three percent last week.</p><p>For investors, there's a tug of war going on between economic data and stimulus on the one hand, and health data I think on the other.</p><p>Here in the United States, you can compare statistics like the better than expected job gains, the retail sales numbers that we've got over the past couple of weeks, versus the worsening state of the nation's health.</p><p>This is the best illustration I can give you to compare the virus cases in the United States and the E.U.</p><p>It is okay preparing for a second wave in the fall here in the U.S., as long as you acknowledge that wave one is simply not over. That comparison chart for me speaks volumes.</p><p>Blackrock now saying Europe's economic growth could outperform the United States in the second half of the year because of its robust economic response to the crisis, never mind the policy response. Let's get to the drivers. Rosa Flores has more on the surge of new coronavirus cases here in the U.S.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The Trump administration says it's preparing for a possible second wave of the coronavirus after a week of downplaying the recent surge sweeping across nearly half the nation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: We are filling the stockpile in anticipation of a possible problem in the fall. We're doing everything we can beneath the surface, working as hard as we possibly can.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLORES (voice over): Last week, Vice President Mike Pence said in a \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed that panic over a second wave was overblown. And on Saturday, President Trump said this to supporters about coronavirus testing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So I said to my people, slow the testing down, please. They test, and they test. We had tests of people who don't know what's going on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLORES (voice over): His staff later said he was joking, but the increase in cases within at least 23 states is very serious for many state leaders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS (D), ATLANTA: Do you think the people, the 120,000 families out there who are missing their loved ones thought it was funny?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLORES (voice over): With a focus now on Florida as a possible epicenter of coronavirus, Governor Ron DeSantis is now admitting the recent spike in cases isn't only due to testing while highlighting a shift in just who is receiving positive results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Increasing or being flat, the number of people testing positive is accelerating faster than that. And so, you know, that's evidence that there's transmission within those communities, particularly the 20s and 30s.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLORES (voice over): While some officials say more young people are being diagnosed due to widespread testing, others suggest it's because they failed to follow social distancing measures.</p><p>Either way, health experts sending this warning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, PROFESSOR, DIVISION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER: These people tend to be less symptomatic. They get less ill. And they tend, therefore, to be spreaders. They can spread it among their fellow workers, their family members.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLORES (voice over): There's also a surge in Arizona, where Trump is scheduled to hold a campaign rally tomorrow. Cases nearly doubling there over the past two weeks and passing the 50,000 mark.</p><p>Still, Republican Governor Doug Ducey says he has no plans to slow the reopening of the state.</p><p>In Phoenix, City Council voting to make masks mandatory in public for its residents, with the county also issuing an order. Phoenix's Democratic mayor says she hopes the President will comply during his visit, despite repeatedly avoiding masks at other events during the pandemic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR KATE GALLEGO (D), PHOENIX: One of the reasons we have this growth in Arizona is complacency. We've had elected officials say that the worst was over a month ago. That was not the case, and we are seeing records of the type we don't want to break.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[09:05:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Rosa Flores reporting there. Now to China where Beijing says it has more than doubled its coronavirus testing capabilities to around one million people a day. This comes as PepsiCo shuts down one of its plants in the Chinese capital after several workers tested positive for COVID-19.</p><p>China also suspending poultry imports from a Tyson food plant in the United States, following an outbreak of the virus at the facility. David Culver is live in Beijing for us.</p><p>David, always great to have you on. Two very important stories, one, the ramp-up in testing there, but also supply chain concerns. Talk us through both, please.</p><p>DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Julia, good to be with you as well. And you point out this is having an impact on businesses in particular. Now, as far as the capacity increase is concerned, that is significant. You're talking about a million people a day capacity that they could do for screening for the coronavirus here within Beijing. That's just within the Capital City.</p><p>Now, they currently have done about 2.3 million tests. That's the number of people that they have gone through with certain screening linked to the original outbreak about ten days or so ago with the Xinfadi seafood and regular produce market and that obviously has been shut down.</p><p>The perimeter and several of the surrounding neighborhoods have been shuttered and kind of put into a Wuhan-like lockdown.</p><p>Outside of that area, life continues mostly normal, however, the screening is intense and it's something that they anticipate will continue over the next several days.</p><p>The most recent increase in cases is only about nine and that seems relatively low when you compare it internationally in particular. However, it's most concerning because it is the Capital City we're talking about here.</p><p>Now, going forward, they do anticipate these cases to continue each and every day to be added to the total and right now, they're looking at 236 with regards to this most recent outbreak.</p><p>But as far as the business is impacted, you mentioned that PepsiCo being one of them, they had a factory that makes potato chips here in Beijing, it is shut down and it had eight employees who tested positive. And then with regards to the imports, they have Tyson Meats that normally are coming in here to China from the U.S. in particular, they had to stop all that import for now because of concerns linked to the outbreak within the U.S. in those particular manufacturing plants there.</p><p>All in all though, they are looking at this as something under control here in Beijing and that's something that they're stressing and they also stress that this is a European strain of the virus. It's going to be interesting to see in the coming days if that control and calm is maintained, because one thing we looked at are the anecdotal experiences and that particularly relates to what the hospitals are dealing with.</p><p>And you look at Wuhan and after we made those trips there initially, dating back even to January, you wanted to see the influx that the hospitals were having to deal with and that gave us a good idea as to how accurate the numbers were.</p><p>As of now, we've been making the rounds and looking at a few hospitals here and things seem relatively calm and appear to be under control -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, good to know. Also very important point on the supply chains, because we've allowed the supplies of goods to move around the world even as we've stopped people. So, when you start to see suspensions on food imports, you have to raise some eyebrows here.</p><p>But, yes, we don't want to be connecting too many dots here. For now it's important to note. David, great to have you with us. David Culver there, as always, fantastic job.</p><p>All right, missing cash, plunging shares. Wirecard stock is down over 85 percent in the past three sessions. This after the payments firm acknowledged that the $2 billion sum that auditors can't find probably never existed.</p><p>Anna Stewart is following this remarkable story for us. Just explain what brought us to this point, Anna, so that our viewers can understand what's going on, and where were the auditors when $2 billion can't be found?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: It's an incredibly complex and thrilling tale, really. $2.1 billion is a large amount by any measure, but this represents a quarter of the company's assets.</p><p>The story really begins last year when \"The Financial Times\" first reported on accounting irregularities. It did this through the help of some whistleblowers and as a result of that, KPMG they were employed to do a special audit of Wirecard.</p><p>Now, they couldn't point to direct manipulation, but they said certain information was missing, particularly regarding bank accounts, and this vast sum of money related to Wirecard's so-called third-party acquiring business. This is where Wirecard operates in a country that doesn't have a direct license, it outsourced to another processing company.</p><p>And the money was thought to be held in Asia, largely in the Philippines and some bank accounts there. Now, since the KPMG report, EY were meant to do their regular audit. They've done it for around 10 years now and following KPMG, they also discovered that they really couldn't find this money or the accounting for it.</p><p>[09:10:13]</p><p>STEWART: Over the weekend, the Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, this is where we head to next, did confirm that Wirecard says they have two bank accounts at two different banks within the Philippines, but he says that no money related to this ever entered the country's system.</p><p>So what was emerging last week is this story of a missing $2 billion has now turned into, did it ever even exist? And if it didn't exist, well that brings into huge question the scale of fraudulent activity within Wirecard if that is the case, but also how did it bypass auditors and regulators for so long?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I couldn't agree more, Anna. What on Earth was going on? The CEO, who has been there almost two decades has now stepped down. He is the largest shareholder. What next?</p><p>STEWART: I would love to know what the next chapter is. Now, in any ordinary situation with an accountancy scandal, you would expect more heads to roll, an internal probe, an audit that could actually be completed so they know what's happened and potentially criminal prosecution if it shows major fraudulent activity, which it suggests at this stage that it would.</p><p>The question is can Wirecard survive through that process? Will it have any employees? This is a huge amount of its business. It needs to roll over some loans, who and which creditor is going to give it money at this stage? So, there's a question of the viability of the actual business itself.</p><p>And then actually, if you just broaden it out, you've got to look at the fact that this story wouldn't really emerge without \"The Financial Times.\" What about the auditor that has been auditing them for a decade -- EY? What about the German regulator, which when this tory first emerged last year, BaFin, the German financial regulator stopped short selling on this stock, which many people saw as a way of trying to protect the stock, rather than focus on investigating it.</p><p>So yes, what happens next within the actual story itself? And then what kind of ramifications we see throughout the system?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Odes of Enron over in Germany there, and of course, to your point, as well, a lot of investors here getting burned. Anna Stewart, great job. That's a complex story and you explained well. Thank you. Anna Stewart there.</p><p>All right, these are the stories making headlines now around the world. John Bolton, who worked for U.S. President Trump for 17 months as his National Security Adviser, says the President is not fit for office.</p><p>Bolton spoke to ABC News ahead of the release of a damning book about his time in the White House, which on Saturday, a judge refused to block from publication.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: I hope it will remember him as a one-term President who didn't plunge the country irretrievably into a downward spiral we can't recall from. We can get over one term. Two terms, I am more troubled about.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: NASCAR says an investigation is under way to find out who placed a noose in the garage belonging to Bubba Wallace, the only black driver in the main NASCAR championship.</p><p>The organization says the culprit will be excluded from the sport. Wallace's public criticism of Confederate flags being displayed at races was followed recently by NASCAR banning the emblem.</p><p>The anger and frustration felt by black people in the United Kingdom is laid bare in a detailed new poll by CNN. The findings from policing to politics say they feel their country has failed them. It reveals a stark divide between black and white people's perceptions of racism.</p><p>Black Britons are twice as likely as white people to say the U.K. has not done enough to address historical racial injustice.</p><p>Today is Wind Rush Day in the U.K. It's named after the Empire Wind Rush Ocean Liner. In 1948, the ship brought hundreds of Caribbean families to Britain. They answered the government's call to help rebuild a country ravished by World War II.</p><p>Senior international correspondent Nima Elbagir is live at Wind Rush Square in London, the crucible of black consciousness in the U.K. A very appropriate place to be, Nima, great to have you on the show with us this morning, but stark findings, I think, in the contrast in perceptions about racism in the U.K.</p><p>NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It really sheds light on the depths of the divide along racial lines with regards to the experiences, but also the perceptions of the experiences. For almost most of our answers, black Britons responses versus white Britons responses were twice as likely.</p><p>So, when it came to the experience of disrespect by the police, black Britons said it was twice as likely to have happened to them. When it came to their perception that the party in power, the Conservatives were institutionally racist, twice as likely to believe that to be true.</p><p>And most heartbreaking, the belief that their race had an impact on their ability to move forward within whatever profession they chose, that their ethnicity had an impact on their success in life. Black Britons were three times as likely as white Britons to agree.</p><p>And when you break down those numbers, Julia, the picture that emerges is not just that black Britons don't appear to have been heard when it comes to the stories that they have been telling for decades regarding their experience of life in the U.K., but it's clear that they have not been believed by their white countrymen.</p><p>There is no other explanation for such a stark, stark gap with regards to the responses that we got when we break it down by race -- Julia.</p><p>[09:15:45]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Nima, great to have you with us. Thank you so much for that. We're going to be talking about this more later on in the show. Thank you for now.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a break here on FIRST MOVE. But still to come, digital driving -- a thaw in the hiring freeze. Singapore's biggest bank is looking to recruit coders. We speak to the CEO next. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. A quick look at stock markets as we head towards the U.S. open. Today, we're on track for a higher open. It's the first trading day of summer, of course.</p><p>Investors not ignoring rising COVID-19 cases, and that may mean more unsettled action ahead. Airline stocks in particular in focus, remaining volatile. American airlines leading the declines in fact, pre-market. They've announced they will raise $3.5 billion in new financing to steady up the balance sheet. That includes selling new shares. As you can see, the entire sector under a bit of pressure there.</p><p>To Singapore now, under the second phase of reopening its economy. Malls, gyms and restaurants reopened their doors last Friday. The country meanwhile has reported more than 42,000 coronavirus cases. In fact, that's one of the highest infections in Asia.</p><p>Last month, Singapore also warned growth could shrink as much as seven percent this year. Joining us now, Piyush Gupta. He is the CEO of Southeast Asia's largest bank, DBS. Piyush, always fantastic to have you on the show.</p><p>[15:20:16]</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA, CEO, DBS GROUP: Good morning, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Clearly, many small and medium size -- good morning. Clearly many small and medium-size enterprises, in particular will be relieved to get under way, to start the reopening of the economy. What are your expectations in terms of what recovery looks like for Singapore, but more broadly, too?</p><p>GUPTA: Well, I think in Singapore lockdowns were kind of unfortunate and therefore, a lot of the parts of the economy, actually continued working at least, in banking, for example, we did not really see a slowdown.</p><p>But the sector which did get impacted were food and beverages, retail, the consumer goods industries as well, and for them of course, the reopening is a God send, the task of putting up -- we transmit and people coming in for business.</p><p>Now, the reality though is that when you think about the macroeconomic construct both for Singapore and the region, this is unlikely to be enough. But it is going to be a long hard winter.</p><p>For Singapore, we are more impacted by global economies. Our trade to GDP is 350 to 400 percent, but what matters to us is growth in the U.S., growth in Europe and growth in China, and our own take is that that is going to be hard to come by.</p><p>In rest of the region, it's actually been quite interesting that the bounce back in the short term has been sharp, but I do think that there will be head winds as we go forward.</p><p>I think a lot of countries have limited fiscal space, so I think that will be a bit of a drag. I think the second phase of the pandemic could happen and if that does happen, that would be a serious concern.</p><p>But I think closer to home, from my own industry, I think for most countries, the Central Bank action and the fiscal policy action has bought people time. They just kicked the can down the road.</p><p>As in when the government programs run out, I think you'll begin to see the second shoe start to drop. You will see a wave of bankruptcies and, as a consequence, you will start seeing some of the real sector challenges begin to spill over into the financial system as well.</p><p>So I do think that the next couple of years are not going to be easy for anybody here or in Singapore.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What sectors are you most worried about? I was just mentioning there, the airlines, clearly that's a challenged industry. Restaurants, anywhere where capacity is limited by the requirement for social distancing or human interaction. What are your thoughts there?</p><p>GUPTA: I think the biggest challenge will be anything that requires cross- border activity more than domestic activity. It is going to be some time before people are willing to travel internationally, and frankly, for corporate travel, I think it is going to see a more permanent decline, and therefore, airlines, tourism, the hotel industry will be impacted.</p><p>But you have to understand that in Asia, in addition to the challenges of COVID, there are also the geopolitical challenges that we have to contend with. And therefore, the tensions between China and the U.S., the possibility of shifts in supply chain, mean that even manufacturing sectors and the manufacturing industry might be impacted.</p><p>And for Singapore, which is a big country port, the notion of shifting pattern means you're going to start seeing impact in other pattern industries as well, logistics for example and shipping, so, I do think there's a lot of uncertainty as we go forward.</p><p>I think what you'll need to do is what we're trying to do in Singapore, it is prepare for the medium term, but also begin to prepare for the longer term, we just think about new avenues for growth, and reconstructing the economy for a different kind of future.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's such an important point. Speaking of avenues of growth, you had a head start as a bank in terms of the dramatic shift to the need for digitization, to be able to access banks, facilities, whatever it was, from a distance.</p><p>And I mentioned this in the introduction as well, looking to hire, actually to add capacity to support the digital growth that you've seen and will see going forward. Talk to me about your hiring plans.</p><p>GUPTA: Julia, as you correctly mention, we got onto the digitization wave some five or six years ago and that's been extraordinarily helpful for us, both in terms of giving our customers very easy access, as well as letting our employees work from home.</p><p>For us, we didn't skip a beat. And frankly, our volumes are up year-on-year and productivity has been keeping pace, so that's actually been quite helpful.</p><p>[09:25:09]</p><p>GUPTA: For us, we tend to believe in investing through cycles and down cycles of this nature are frankly a good time to add capacity to make investments which will prepare us for the longer term.</p><p>So that is something that we are doing. We are hiring people for gender coding. We are hiring people in artificial intelligence and machine learning, in data analytics, design people and so on and so forth.</p><p>But we are also hiring for a different reason. We believe that one of the biggest challenges right now is going to be jobs and particularly jobs for the young kids coming out of colleges.</p><p>I really worry this is going to be a lost generation, maybe one to three years of kids who are going to be struggling for employment and as a meaningful and material parenting, in Singapore we think it is incumbent on us to try and create some possibilities, some hope for these young kids.</p><p>So we're likely stretching ourselves to try and create jobs for many of these people, training, entry-level jobs and apprenticeship jobs so that people really have something that they could do, they can occupy themselves, learn along the way, and frankly, I think it will benefit us, too, in the long term.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's an important point and it needs to be a focus all around the world, a potential lost generation, I think you said it perfectly there. I want to talk about the work you're doing as a bank and that your employees are doing to give back at this time, too.</p><p>I know you've been buying food from local businesses to give to people and also virtual volunteering. Talk to me about this as well.</p><p>GUPTA: Well, you know, one of the things that we think will happen post- COVID, is a very sharp focus on this idea of purpose. You know, why do companies exists? What is the social agenda they serve? And I think it's very likely you wind up into very distinct categories, you're a hero or you're a villain.</p><p>People will be looking for companies who do real things for real people. So in that regard, we've been wanting to try and make sure that we're here for the community and we're here for society. And like other people, we set up together a fund called Forward Together Fund. We are trying to look at 700,000 who needs -- the poor people across the region.</p><p>But one of the more innovative ideas our people came up with was this idea of virtual volunteering. There are hundreds and thousands of elderly people stuck in their home isolated and they need companionship.</p><p>So, what we did is we figured we could do a voluntary companion program where our employees would sort of dial in and talk to the elderly people in their home and give them someone to call in and something to take their minds off all of the tensions and the crisis that they see day to day.</p><p>That has actually picked up for the record. In fact, we have held a series of different programs but I'm particularly pleased with this one.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: This is a phenomenal program. Thank you so much for talking about it, and to your employees as well for engaging in this. I do want to ask you very quickly, Piyush, while I have you, we have the Foreign Minister of Singapore on last week and he was talking to me about the policy of the government promoting the hiring of Singaporean nationals versus perhaps migrants, or those from abroad.</p><p>How is that going to filter into your hiring decisions, just in light of everything you said about the challenge of readjusting things like supply chains, the focus on national policies, but also the need to engage with talent, particularly the younger generations?</p><p>GUPTA: Julia, I think, first of all, this is part of our philosophy. Ninety percent of our talent in every country is local talent. We believe that's the right way to run business. On top of that, I do think that, again, post-COVID, you will find this huge pressure in every country and every market to protect local jobs, because a lot of people are going to be unemployed.</p><p>You think about the U.S., I mean, 20 or 30 million people unemployed, and there's going to be a lot of social pressure on trying to find jobs for local citizens. I don't think it is unrealistic or frankly even indirect, and so I do think you'll see some of that.</p><p>Having said that, the Singapore government has always been pragmatic, so in our case, we do not anticipate any challenges in hiring specific talent for specific areas and jobs if we do need those people. But I do think it behooves us to be socially conscious and make sure, as I said before, that we are relevant to the society in which we operate. And this is not just true for Singaporeans and Singapore, it's true as much for the people we hire in Indonesia and the people we hire in India as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a global conversation that's being had. Social conscience and pragmatism. The combination.</p><p>Always fantastic to have a conversation with you on FIRST MOVE. Piyush, great to have you with us. Stay safe, sir.</p><p>GUPTA: Thanks so much.</p><p>[15:30:01]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you. The CEO of DBS Bank there.</p><p>All right, the market open is next.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE where U.S. stocks are up and running as we kick off the new trading week and it's the last full week of trading for the second quarter, too, and we do see early gains.</p><p>Tech stocks looking set to outperform. Maybe I spoke too soon. We're already slumping in the first few minutes here. Apple and Microsoft are going to be in focus of course, too after Friday's pullback. Yes, there you go, you see they are bouncing a little bit.</p><p>Tech was the strongest sector last week, rising more than 3.5 percent. Though it was the small cap stocks, so think more domestically focused businesses that easily outperformed.</p><p>The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 as you can see, it is another sign perhaps that the market breadth is improving with more stocks on the whole contributing to the overall gains. It's not just a handful of the big tech names that are pulling everybody higher. This is important if you want to see a sustained rally.</p><p>That said, more U.S. companies are cautious. A new survey from Moody's Analytics say only one-fifth of firms are investing for the future, a higher rate of retrenchment in fact than during the financial crisis, so more companies this time are hoarding cash and are cutting costs. That points to uncertainty and we know we've got that going forward.</p><p>In the meantime, San Francisco startup Kinsa says it can detect a COVID-19 outbreak more than two weeks before it happens. Its product is a small thermometer used in households across the United States.</p><p>Data from the devices allow the company to map transmission hot spots in real time. Today, the company is warning of spikes in Oklahoma, Missouri, Louisiana and Maine.</p><p>Joining us on the show, Inder Singh, CEO and founder of Kinsa. Inder, great to have you on the show once again.</p><p>We talked to you at the height of the crisis and you were warning about hot spots. At this point, talk me through what you're seeing in the places that you're concerned about today.</p><p>[09:35:10]</p><p>INDER SINGH, CEO AND FOUNDER, KINSA: Yes, we're deeply concerned about those four states that you mentioned, particularly the southern states. We're seeing higher than what you would expect in terms of transmission rates.</p><p>The speed at which illness is spreading is faster in those locations and that's concerning. It's above and beyond what you would expect for cold and flu season and it's probably indicative of COVID-19 spreading.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So it's not just about the number of cases that you're seeing, to your point, it's about the speed or the increase of them that you're seeing in these areas?</p><p>SINGH: That's exactly right. That's exactly right. So, we look at two things in particular. We look at the level of fever, how many people have fever and is it above and beyond what you would expect for cold and flu season, and the second thing we look at is the rate of transmission, how fast is it spreading. Both of those things are starting to indicate that those could become COVID hotspots in the coming weeks, two to three weeks out.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Just explain how your thermometer works? How the data is collected? Because there will be people watching that didn't watch the interview with you last time, and they are thinking, hang on a second, if I take my temperature, is my data at risk? How is this working?</p><p>So, talk me through the product again.</p><p>SINGH: Yes, so we make these. These are smart thermometers and they do far more than take a temperature. They help you understand some fundamental questions. What do I do? How sick am I? And what's going around? That inevitable question you ask when you get very sick.</p><p>They connect to an app and the app helps you -- helps provide guidance in the moment of need. That data is all aggregated and privacy is fully protected because what we're looking at is population level data, the percentage of people ill, the percentage -- the rate of transmission. We're looking at that level of data, not at the individual data.</p><p>And this is essentially an early warning system. We've been building this for the last eight years. In any epidemic response, there's a four-part response. The first is early warning, and if you don't have an early warning signal, there's no way to get in front of the epidemic. So this is really critical, these new kinds of technologies, this new way of thinking to get ahead of an epidemic is really important so we can be proactive and not reactive. And that's what we've been building for eight years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I remember thinking the last time we spoke, and thinking about it afterwards, that actually when I went online to have a look at your product, I will be honest, that there are other options out there for smart thermometers and if you guys could all speak and aggregate the data then the map of potential cases, the spread of those thermometers would be that much larger.</p><p>Are you talking to other producers of smart thermometers to potentially do this? Because it would help the authorities tackle this?</p><p>SINGH: We would be delighted to partner with other companies. This concept and concepts like it need to be -- they need to be had by the public health system.</p><p>Again, my public health colleagues for years have thought about drugs, diagnostics and vaccines, as they should. But we need to also start leveraging 21st Century technology to identify where and when illness is spreading.</p><p>You know, I go back to the same question that I posed eight years ago when I started Kinsa. How do you stop an outbreak before it becomes an epidemic if you don't know where and when it's starting? And the answer is, you don't.</p><p>So we would be delighted to partner with other smart thermometer manufacturers. We would be delighted to partner with the government to really make sure we can get ahead of these epidemics.</p><p>You know, if you want to stop an outbreak early. You want to stop it when it's aflame, not when it's an inferno, and that's what's going to bring us back to an economy that's open.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, at some point as well, you should be able to use this data to compare states, places around the world where mask use has a high prevalence versus states and areas that don't and compare spread versus people who are checking their thermometers and have a temperature.</p><p>Are we at that stage yet or is it too early?</p><p>SINGH: We're right in that stage right now. There's a natural experiment going on to see whether the speed of spread is higher or lower in places that have masks.</p><p>Now, I think most people's intuition, mine certainly, is that those locations where a large percentage of the population is wearing a mask, those places should have lower spread, and we have that natural experiment going on right now because we are seeing differences in locations in terms of the percentage of people using masks. So I'm very happy to bring that data back to you once we have it ready.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, please do. You let us know as soon as you've got it. Very quickly, production, because that was one of the challenges, ramping up production for the amount of demand that you've seen. Where are you on that?</p><p>SINGH: We have a capability of making millions of units per month and can scale that up further. And so, we are ahead of the demand cycle at this point. So if anyone wants to order thermometers, please contact us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I see you used the opportunity there to pitch. Inder, great to have you with us. Come back when you have that data because I do think it's so important to refute or otherwise those that don't want to wear masks at this moment. Inder Singh, CEO and founder of Kinsa. Thank you.</p><p>[09:40:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're going to take a break here on FIRST MOVE. Coming up, CNN reveals stark differences in attitudes to racism, depending on your background. We will show the huge disparities when it comes to opportunities in life, too. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. As you already heard on the show this morning, a new CNN survey has laid bare the extent of potential racism in the U.K., the huge disparity at least in the perception of racism, depending on the color of your skin.</p><p>Let me run through three key stats on business and entrepreneurship, specifically. The poll found 69 percent of black people believe there's less opportunity to succeed professionally, compared to just 29 percent of white people.</p><p>Meanwhile, 42 percent of white people say non-whites have the same opportunities to succeed, while 12 percent of black people think that. While 64 percent of black people say employers are doing too little to promote black, Asian and minority people, some stark contrast there in perceptions.</p><p>Eric Collins, the CEO and general partner at Impact X Capital, it is a venture capital firm aimed at minority-led businesses across Europe.</p><p>Eric, fantastic to have you with us. You were just listening to those stats there. A stark contrast between the perceptions of white people and their perception of the opportunities out there, versus what black people see. Does that surprise you?</p><p>ERIC COLLINS, CEO AND GENERAL PARTNER, IMPACT X CAPITAL: Thank you for having me. No, it does not surprise me. When you look at some of the activities that have precipitated conversations like this, which I welcomed from CNN International, you'll note that some of the dynamics are very much seen not only in the States, but also in Europe.</p><p>In the U.K. for instance, you've seen a series of violent clashes with police, police deaths -- citizen deaths at the hands of police, shooting in homes, some of the same sort of dynamics which have prompted people marching in the streets with Black Lives Matter, not only in the United States but in the U.K.</p><p>And the people that I see that are marching are not marching are not marching because they feel as though there is not a problem or the problem exists over and across the ocean, but the problem exists very precipitously and very tangibly at home.</p><p>[09:45:30]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, it is fueling all sorts of questions. Finally, I think, to be asked that the statistics have long spoken for themselves. I mentioned on our show last week that when you look at -- in venture capital money that goes particularly to black-led businesses, it's less than one percent of all the money out there in the United States. Is the situation any better in Europe? Because this is what you do. You look for these opportunities.</p><p>COLLINS: Correct. Impact X is very much looking for and has been for the last two years since our inception for underrepresented entrepreneurs, particularly black-led companies and female-led companies.</p><p>What we've found about the 700 companies that we've been able to source is there's a great deal of talent and the talent actually exists across the board. But when you get to the financial capability to then back that talent and to bring forward some of the ideas that we think have solutions for COVID, we think will create the next Amazon, there's not a proportionate amount of funding which is going into those organizations.</p><p>So Impact X made it our business to focus on the places that are underrepresented in the venture capital portfolios in Europe, and we found that in digital technology, there's still disparities in health, education and lifestyle investing, as well as media and entertainment investing.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Why? Why isn't the money going to women-led businesses, to black or minority-led businesses? Is it about contacts? Is it about the networks? Is it about lower returns? Because you're seeing actually what the capacity of these businesses that you're investing in is. How do they perform relative to white business led?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, we're proving out the thesis that in fact they perform just as well, if not slightly better. It will take a little bit of time for that to happen as we get returns on capital, but the returns on capital we will be looking at are both returns that are financial returns, which is our fiduciary responsibility to our limited partners and investors, but also we're looking for positive social impact measured in terms of job creation, particularly at the C-suite, the founder ranks, Boards of Directors and the technology roles within technology and other organizations.</p><p>So what we have noticed, what I think, quite frankly, Julia, is that it's a very complex web, just like systemic racism, which you all have been talking about so well and sort of reporting on. One of the things that I note is that there is this very entrenched approach. The entrenched approach is that you have a group of individuals called venture capitalists who promote themselves as being extremely successful and that success is measured by the return that they have actually had in investment.</p><p>And in fact, the return they've had in investment has meant that there are very few investments made in women and minorities. If you look across the United States, for instance, look at Silicon Valley, look at New York City, look at Atlanta, Georgia, look at Boston, Massachusetts, all of those places that have very developed and robust ecosystems for venture capital, almost none of the partners in firms are of color or are women.</p><p>In addition, almost none of the portfolio companies are led by women or by blacks. And quite frankly, in many ways, I believe that the venture capitalists themselves think that that's okay and that's the way to success.</p><p>And quite frankly, so there's no incentive for them to actually change their ways of doing things and there's not even any pressure externally. They are LPs. These are the foundations. What would you expect from foundations? You would expect the pension funds.</p><p>You would expect the philanthropic organizations whose endowments are actually being invested. You would expect them to say enough is enough and we want to see something different. But there seems to be this complicity, this silence, this conspiracy of silence around this particular issue and we'll keep on putting the money in our pockets and putting the money in our pockets is much more important, and the way to do it is by doing it the way we have been doing it, and there's no reason to rock the boat. There is no reason to change anything. What's wrong?</p><p>This is the system that created Amazon, even though Amazon and Google don't necessarily have any sort of black people in very high level positions. It's very interesting and an insidious kind of a problem.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's such an important conversation, and we have to wrap this up here, but you're going to come back on very soon and we're going to continue this conversation because you make so many great points. The returns are good enough, you don't have to challenge the current existing system because the returns are good enough. You have to make concerted changes because you wish to and then you find other opportunities.</p><p>Eric, great point and great to have you with us. Eric Collins, CEO at Impact X Capital there. Thank you.</p><p>All right, coming up after the break, did teenagers on TikTok help to derail President Trump's rally attendance? We'll investigate, next.</p><p>[09:52:27]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Questions being asked after President Trump's Oklahoma rally. The Trump campaign said over one million people registered to attend the event, but the Tulsa Fire Department says just over 6,000 people showed up. Some of those who requested tickets may have been trolling the President in a stunt organized mainly through users of the social media platform, TikTok.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Guys, I actually just reserved two free tickets for the Tulsa, Oklahoma Trump rally on Juneteenth and now I can't go because my dog's goldfish's funeral is that day. So, it would be a shame though if everyone else did this and then there were empty seats at the rally. That would be really bad because we don't want that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: CNN's Donie O'Sullivan is all over this story for us. So, was the president TikTok'd in Tulsa or was something else going on here, Donie? What do we know?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Hey, Julia. Well, as you can see in that sort of video there with the sarcasm and humor mixed in is very representative of what is all across TikTok this past week of people saying that they were registering for the event and then not going to show up.</p><p>Obviously, TikTok is extremely popular with teenagers and it does appear that young people all across the U.S. took part in this protest. Now, I will say that there wasn't a cap on the number of people that could request tickets for the event. So it wasn't as if these TikTok users were blocking real supporters from going to the rally in some way.</p><p>So the fact that the Trump campaign was unable to fill this 20,000 capacity arena isn't the TikTokers' fault, but what probably did contribute to was the idea that there was going to be a million people showing up at this event.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's fascinating -- or maybe people -- always an alternative here -- which is concern about their health because cases in the area have been rising, of course.</p><p>But there has been scrutiny over TikTok's power. We've heard the likes of Chuck Schumer, Senator Tom Cotton raising questions about national security risks surrounding TikTok. Of course, it's owned by China's Bytedance. Do we think as a result of what happened here, whether it was contributory factor or not, will mean more scrutiny, Donie?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes. I mean, what's interesting was that the earlier concern, the letter from a Democratic and a Republican senator last year, bipartisan concern about China's -- the Chinese ownership of TikTok and what that could mean for American national security.</p><p>[09:55:06]</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: We might now see that TikTok becomes a more partisan issue like everything else in the United States.</p><p>We should mention, though, that the Trump campaign came out with a statement yesterday specifically addressing TikTok, Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign manager said, \"These leftists and online trolls doing a victory lap thinking they somehow impacted rally attendance don't know what they're talking about or how our rallies work. Registering for a rally means you've RSVP'd with a cell phone number and we constantly weed out bogus phone numbers. These phony ticket requests never factor into our thinking.\"</p><p>But that does raise the question, Julia, if he really did weed out all of the bogus ticket requests, where were those one million people on Saturday night?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, or even just the 100,000 that they perhaps talked about here. Maybe they decided to stay at home for health purposes. Donie O'Sullivan, we're in a pandemic. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>That's it for the show. Stay safe and we'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020062201cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606D-3XG1-JB20-G4CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 22, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002DBA</classCode><className>PEPSICO INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS312111 SOFT DRINK MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS311919 OTHER SNACK FOOD MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS311513 CHEESE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS311511 FLUID MILK MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS311411 FROZEN FRUIT, JUICE &amp;

A Twitter spokesman declined to comment further.<br/>Trump Jr. is still able to browse the app, but is unable to tweet, retweet, follow or like posts for a 12-hour period.<br/>In a statement to CNBC, Andy Surabian, a spokesman for Trump Jr., echoed unproven complaints from conservatives that social media companies like Twitter try to silence them on their respective platforms.<br/>\"Twitter suspending Don Jr. for sharing a viral video of medical professionals discussing their views on Hydroxychloroquine is further proof that Big Tech is intent on killing free expression online and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices,\" Surabian said in the statement.<br/>Twitter said it did not suspend Trump Jr.'s account, just limited his access. With the exception of the tweet that Twitter said violates its policies, the rest of Trump Jr.'s tweets are still visible on his page.<br/>Twitter has been cracking down on misinformation and harassment on its platform over the past several weeks, causing several conservative commentators and politicians to condemn the app for how it moderates content.

A Twitter spokesman declined to comment further.<br/>Trump Jr. is still able to browse the app, but is unable to tweet, retweet, follow or like posts for a 12-hour period.<br/>In a statement to CNBC, Andy Surabian, a spokesman for Trump Jr., echoed unproven complaints from conservatives that social media companies like Twitter try to silence them on their respective platforms.<br/>\"Twitter suspending Don Jr. for sharing a viral video of medical professionals discussing their views on Hydroxychloroquine is further proof that Big Tech is intent on killing free expression online and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices,\" Surabian said in the statement.<br/>Twitter said it did not suspend Trump Jr.'s account, just limited his access. With the exception of the tweet that Twitter said violates its policies, the rest of Trump Jr.'s tweets are still visible on his page.<br/>Twitter has been cracking down on misinformation and harassment on its platform over the past several weeks, causing several conservative commentators and politicians to condemn the app for how it moderates content.

In one tweet, which has now been deleted, he compared Jews to the Ku Klux Klan.<br/>Ahead of the boycott, the Liberal Democrats announced they would joining \"in protest over the shameful inaction against anti-Semitic comments.\"<br/>While the Labour party supports the boycott, it said it couldn't afford to be absent from social media platforms.<br/>A Twitter spokesperson said: \"Abuse and harassment have no place on our service and we have policies in place - that apply to everyone, everywhere - that address abuse and harassment, violent threats, and hateful conduct.\"</p><p>July 24: Recent hacking incident could create credibility issues for Twitter and put advertisers off<br/>It is unclear if Twitter had been investing enough into the security of its platform, evident by the recent hack, and the company needs to make that a priority or risk undermining credibility, says Mark Mahaney, lead technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 24: Twitter's user growth is strong but can it boost ad revenue?<br/>Twitter has announced a big jump in daily users for the second-quarter but Wedbush Securities' Michael Pachter is keeping a neutral rating on the stock.

This massive fraud was orchestrated right here in our backyard, and we will not stand for that.\"<br/>Warren's office has filed 30 felony charges against the 17-year-old. The charges include organized fraud, communications fraud, fraudulent use of personal information and access of computer or electronic device without authority.<br/>Two adults were also charged, the Department of Justice said Friday.<br/>Mason Sheppard, aka \"Chaewon,\" 19, of Bognor Regis, in the United Kingdom, was charged in a criminal complaint in the Northern District of California with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and the intentional access of a protected computer.<br/>Nima Fazeli, aka \"Rolex,\" 22, of Orlando, Florida, was charged in a criminal complaint in the Northern District of California with aiding and abetting the intentional access of a protected computer.<br/>The teen's scam reaped more than $100,000 worth of bitcoin on July 15, according to Warren's office.<br/>Twitter provided its most recent update into the attack on Thursday evening.<br/>\"The social engineering that occurred on July 15, 2020, targeted a small number of employees through a phone spear phishing attack,\" Twitter said in a blog post.</p><p>July 31: Teen arrested in connection with high-profile Twitter hack<br/>The Tampa state attorney general has filed 30 felony charges against a seventeen year old male in connection with the hack of high-profile Twitter accounts earlier this month.

A Twitter spokesman declined to comment further.<br/>Trump Jr. is still able to browse the app, but is unable to tweet, retweet, follow or like posts for a 12-hour period.<br/>In a statement to CNBC, Andy Surabian, a spokesman for Trump Jr., echoed unproven complaints from conservatives that social media companies like Twitter try to silence them on their respective platforms.<br/>\"Twitter suspending Don Jr. for sharing a viral video of medical professionals discussing their views on Hydroxychloroquine is further proof that Big Tech is intent on killing free expression online and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices,\" Surabian said in the statement.<br/>Twitter said it did not suspend Trump Jr.'s account, just limited his access. With the exception of the tweet that Twitter said violates its policies, the rest of Trump Jr.'s tweets are still visible on his page.<br/>Twitter has been cracking down on misinformation and harassment on its platform over the past several weeks, causing several conservative commentators and politicians to condemn the app for how it moderates content. It has also in recent weeks started labeling tweets from President Trump, including one that Twitter said glorified violence during the George Floyd protests in May.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 28: Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pull 'false' coronavirus video after it goes viral<br/>A video containing misleading information on the coronavirus clocked up millions of views before it was pulled from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.<br/>The video was created by right-wing media outlet Breitbart. It depicts a group of people dressed in white lab coats - who call themselves \"America's Frontline Doctors\" - staging a press conference outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington. Those in the video claim that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is \"a cure for Covid\" and \"you don't need a mask\" to slow the spread of coronavirus.<br/>\"This virus has a cure, it's called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax,\" one of the women in the video claims. \"You don't need masks, there is a cure.\"<br/>The claims are in contrast to the advice from public health officials to prevent the spread of the virus.<br/>Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced it had ended the emergency use authorization of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, saying the drugs were \"unlikely to be effective in treating Covid-19.\"<br/>Masks are also widely accepted to be a reliable safety measure that helps to reduce the spread of the virus.<br/>By late Monday, the video had racked up 20 million views on Facebook, according to NBC News reporter Brandy Zadrozny.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 27: Twitter faces 'walkout' over its handling of British grime star's anti-Semitic tweets<br/>Twitter is facing a \"walkout\" over its handling of a string of anti-Semitic tweets that appeared on the account of British rapper Wiley on Friday and Saturday.<br/>The 41-year-old London grime artist, whose real name is Richard Cowie, has been dropped by his management company, A-List Management.

In one tweet, which has now been deleted, he compared Jews to the Ku Klux Klan.<br/>Ahead of the boycott, the Liberal Democrats announced they would joining \"in protest over the shameful inaction against anti-Semitic comments.\"<br/>While the Labour party supports the boycott, it said it couldn't afford to be absent from social media platforms.<br/>A Twitter spokesperson said: \"Abuse and harassment have no place on our service and we have policies in place - that apply to everyone, everywhere - that address abuse and harassment, violent threats, and hateful conduct.\"</p><p>July 24: Recent hacking incident could create credibility issues for Twitter and put advertisers off<br/>It is unclear if Twitter had been investing enough into the security of its platform, evident by the recent hack, and the company needs to make that a priority or risk undermining credibility, says Mark Mahaney, lead technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 24: Twitter's user growth is strong but can it boost ad revenue?<br/>Twitter has announced a big jump in daily users for the second-quarter but Wedbush Securities' Michael Pachter is keeping a neutral rating on the stock.

By the way, Vince, congratulations again. Great job. Here's Lou.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good evening, everybody. Our top stories, day two of the Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the radical Dems still trying to disrupt and delay those hearings in spite of the outrageous ignorant conduct of the committee Dems and leftist protestors, President Trump's high court nominee handling their ignorance with grace and constraint.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've watched his remarks, I've watched his performance, I've watched his statements and honestly they've been totally brilliant. I think that the other side is grasping at straws and really the other side should embrace it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Embrace it. We'll take up the latest on those hearings tonight, Congressman Andy Biggs among our guest. Also Fox Legal Analyst, Gregg Jarrett. Also, social media executives embarrassingly unprepared on Capitol Hill exposing themselves as unable, unwilling to address election meddling issues and acknowledge their political bias.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PATRICK DORSEY, FOUNDER AND CEO, TWITTER: We found ourselves unprepared and ill-equipped for the immensity of the problems that we've acknowledged.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: As for Google, didn't even show up, leaving lawmakers staring at empty an chair and perhaps -- just perhaps dreaming of ways to bring Google to heel. We take that up tonight with conservative social media starts, Diamond and Silk. And \"The New York Times\" taking fake news to the next level from anonymous sources to entire anonymous op-eds with anonymous quotes thrown in.</p><p>The President isn't too impressed by either \"The Times\" or the gutless wonder anonymous op-ed author.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If the failing \"New York Times\" has an anonymous editorial, can you believe it? Anonymous, meaning gutless, a gutless editorial, we're doing a great job, the poll numbers are through the roof, our poll numbers are great and guess what, nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: We'll have more on the cowardly self-proclaimed senior official little worm who chose to betray and to attack the President that is if you believe the Times' claim about any of this. Our top story, the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh still underway despite Dems spewing ignorance and vitriol all over the hearing room above it all Kavanaugh who makes his little effusion inquisitors from the left look ever smaller.</p><p>Fox News Chief Legal Correspondent and Anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" Shannon Bream joining us from Capitol Hill with the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: I've watched his performance, I've watched his statements and honestly they've been totally brilliant.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST: President Trump praising his second Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh as the judge continues to run a gauntlet marked by protestors. And Senators still jousting over document production.</p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), VERMONT: I would ask the chairman if he might look at some of these remarked committee confidential.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let me answer that for you, if you're interested in it, you could have been asking ever since August the 25th, I believe.</p><p>BREAM: Today's question centering on guns.</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-), CALIFORNIA: I never thought this would happen in our country that someone would bring a semiautomatic assault weapon into a school and just mow down children and staff. And so I've been very interested in your thinking on assault weapons.</p><p>BREAM: Abortion.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: I mean, you just can't -- what are you -- what are you doing for lunch, let's overrule Roe v. Wade, it doesn't work that way, right?</p><p>BREAM: And on this evolution regarding whether a sitting President should be subjected to criminal and civil investigations while in office. As a member of Ken Starr's team, he advocated for aggressively questioning then- President Bill Clinton and helped to write a Starr report, outlining the grounds for Clinton's eventual impeachment. Years later he authored a law review article questioning the wisdom of subjecting sitting Presidents to invasive investigations.</p><p>While noting Congress holds the ultimate remedy, impeachment.</p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: What changed was September 11th. That's what's changed. President Bush said this will not happen again and he was a single-minded focus every morning for the next seven years for President Bush was still September 12th, 2001.</p><p>BREAM: And at Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White House post 9/11 that sparked numerous questions about whether he was involved in crafting warrantless surveillance programs or enhanced interrogation policies and the legal memos used to justify them.</p><p>KAVANAUGH: I was not read into that program, not involved in crafting that program nor crafting the legal justifications for that program.</p><p>BREAM: Also today spectators got a glimpse of human side of the nominee who -- when asked how he'd like to be remembered as good dad and judge and then paused.</p><p>FEINSTEIN: Good husband.</p><p>GRAHAM: I think he's getting there.</p><p>KAVANAUGH: Good husband.</p><p>GARAHAM: Thanks, Dianne, you helped him a lot.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: Late in the day, Democratic Senator Dick Blumenthal asked the nominee to commit to recusing himself from any civil or criminal case involving the President that would come before him as justice, he repeatedly declined. Lou?</p><p>DOBBS: Shannon, thank you. Shannon Bream. Joining us tonight, Republican Congressman Andy Biggs, he is a member of House Judiciary Committee and the Freedom Caucus. Congressman, good to have you with us. Your impression of the conduct of the Dems on the Senate Judiciary Committee over two days.</p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA: Well, I'm kind of embarrassed for them. I mean, I watched for instance Mr. Durbin -- Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy asked questions and quite frankly they're fishing and I will just tell you, Judge Kavanaugh made them look so inept and unable to even understand that they were -- they were looking inept. So, not only is he far more brilliant, far more articulate.</p><p>He's got an encyclopedic memory, he's gracious about embarrassing the Democrats in such a way that they don't even realize how small they are compared to him.</p><p>BREAM: I think you have expressed exactly -- when I listened to Kamala Harris and Dick Durbin, frankly some of the Republicans as they try to stay up with him, it was a very -- it was very revealing both as to their capacity and the -- and the nominee's extraordinary talent and intellect as you say. Let's turn to where we go from here. Are we are going to see this nominee be approved and be ready for the fall term on the Supreme Court?</p><p>BIGGS: My understanding is that they're going wrap this thing up sometime mid to late September and that he will be confirmed and that he'll be sitting there for the October session and that's my hope. I mean, look, this guy is really talented. He is really a brilliant jurist, great -- just a great man.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. You know, this nominee Kavanaugh and sitting on the court, the President's other nominee, Neil Gorsuch, I mean, these are -- these are world-class intellects and legal minds, it's wonderful to behold. Let's turn now to social media. We had a couple of folks show up to talk about their bias and what they were doing with Russian meddling and frankly smart people, they seem to have a lot of trouble with the language.</p><p>BIGGS: Well, you know, they really do, Lou. And here's the part I love about it. I mean, speaking of anonymous things that have gone on today, yes, they're saying, well, this happened for liberals too, well, can you name some? Well, no, we can't. We're not going the name some. The reason is because I can name people, I can name organizations right now who I know were -- had this prejudice against and they were censored but -- and I'll name them.</p><p>But they won't even do that because I don't think it's there, I think their algorithms were designed to specifically root out the conservatives and what -- to blame it on the people who are hitting on the conservative sites was outrageous in my opinion.</p><p>DOBBS: Are we headed toward regulations of the social media and big tech organizations? Because they are threatening to be arbiters of what is tasteful, what is acceptable, what is appropriate, what is the standard for discourse?</p><p>BIGGS: Well, I think the root of where we need to go is to determine who owns the content. I mean, first of all, they don't know whether a lot of people are boxed or real people that they're trying to weed out, but beyond that, we -- let's find out who really owns the content because if they own the content, then they're liable for suppression, they're liable for slander, they're liable for any of this.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, there are two ways that the signals get set around the worldwide web, one is by wire and the other is by air and the fact is, the government of the United States, the people of the United States have claimed them both. Congressman, as always, great to see you, we appreciate it. Andy Biggs.</p><p>BIGGS: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you. Up next, social media giants Twitter and Facebook answering questions about why they silenced conservative voices and even admit to dropping -- well, just failing to detect or act on Russian election meddling.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, FACEBOOK: Russia used social media as part of and I quote, \"a comprehensive and multifaceted campaign to set discord, undermine Democratic institutions and interfere in U.S. election and those of our allies. We were too slow to spot this and to slow to act.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Mnemonic, don't you think? We take it up after the break with folks who are -- their minds are alive, Diamond and Silk, electric and coming up next. Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I can't wait to talk with Diamond and Silk about what is going on in Washington and social media. As Congress is -- well, they're - - in some cases hinting that they may want to regulate social media, big tech, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey among those on Capitol Hill today talking about his company silencing of conservative voices and his defense leaving just a little to be desired.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DORSEY: We don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives or party affiliation in any of our policies or enforcement decisions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The allegation that we made, the Republicans, is that you're discriminatory against us, against the republicans.</p><p>DORSEY: We agree that the result was not impartial and that is why we corrected and we fixed it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So do you agree that there were more Republicans than Democrats?</p><p>DORSEY: I didn't say that but I do -- I do --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, you can't have it both ways, sir.</p><p>DORSEY: We don't always have the best methods to determine who is a Republican, who is a Democrat or we have to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, usually it's known because we run as Republicans or Democrats, that's not hard to identify.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Dorsey not impressing us certainly on this broadcast, investors weren't too impressed either. Twitter stock falling more than six percent today. Dorsey is going to have to up his game, we will see how that goes from here. Joining us now, social media super stars, President Trump supporters, Diamond and Silk. Great to have you here on a day in which social media was, well, in the court of public opinion on Capitol Hill.</p><p>What did you make of Dorsey and his comments and Sandberg from Facebook, her comments of the day, Diamond?</p><p>LYNNETTE HARDAWAY, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITY: Well, you know what, here is the deal, you have the same people that go up to the Capitol Hill and they just chat and they just talk, and they get nothing done, they say nothing that will take and apiece the American people especially conservatives that's being centered on their platform.</p><p>ROCHELLE RICHARDSON, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITY: That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY: To think that you can influence, you can influence what we talk about or what we socialize about on social media, that is dictatorship and that is tyranny and that has got to stop.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you're exactly right because it is -- this is Soviet stuff, talking about whether Facebook or Twitter, who -- whatever platform it might be, they decide what can be said, they decide what will be an acceptable expression, they become the arbiters of taste and judgment and appropriate speech, go to hell.</p><p>HARDAWAY: Absolutely.</p><p>RICHARDSON: You got that right. And then they want to sit and talk about that Russia as the one that's influencing the election. It's these platforms, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, the social media platforms that is -- are the ones that's influencing this election because you know what, I don't speak Russia, I speak English, I've never been to Russia and I don't -- you know, if anybody said anything to me in Russia, I wouldn't know what they're talking about.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>RICHARDSON: It's the social media platforms that's influencing this election by silencing and censoring conservative lawyers.</p><p>HARDAWAY: That's right.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Sandberg acknowledging that the -- they were slow to respond at Facebook. It turns out that the first collusion may have been on Facebook with the Russians and they didn't react, they didn't bring in authorities from the, you know, from our intelligence agencies, Twitter, you know, I couldn't understand what Dorsey was even trying to say, he wanted to be the guy who decides whether or not conservatives have a voice.</p><p>But then he said he couldn't tell which is which, it got really kind of ambiguous for him, could you straighten him out on that, Diamond?</p><p>HARDAWAY: Well, first of all, he's not the arbitrator of truth.</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY: So to think that he can influence but he's not the school, he's not the school of speech, this is free speech that we're talking about being stifled.</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY: This is conservative free speech. And what they did, the pretext of all of these here is algorithms that they put in place to silence conservative voices. If you say the word Trump, you're silenced, if you say anything patriotic, stand for the flag or anything about god, you are silenced. If you are a conservative, you are being silenced on the social media of platforms because they want to act like they are the arbitrators of truth and they nothing but liars and really thieves. Yes, lairs and thieves.</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's right.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Diamond and Silk, it's great to have you here. We thank you, I want to apologize for swearing, my wife is going to chastise me strongly after the broadcast I'm sure. Forgive me and we're delight to see you, all the best. Thanks so much.</p><p>HARDAWAY: Thank you so much.</p><p>RICHARDSON: Thank you for having us.</p><p>DOBBS: Be sure to check out Diamond and Silk's chitchat tour, their next stop is October 7 in Marietta, Georgia. Nike launching its controversial ad campaign featuring NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Tomorrow Nike will run its ad on the NFL'S season opener but the social justice warriors and newly self-proclaimed at Nike have a -- well, something of a spotty history when it comes to social justice and the American worker.</p><p>Nike, it turns out -- are you ready? Has 127 footwear factories located in 15 countries. Well, Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufacturing 94 percent of Nike footwear. Also, Nike has 363 apparel factories. They're in 37 countries and make 52 percent of Nike apparel in China, Vietnam and Thailand. That's right, not Ohio, not Oklahoma, not in Oregon, by the way, let's don't forget.</p><p>Nike is the same company that put a New York screen printing company out of business and shipped T-shirt printing and production from a factory in New York to Honduras just three years ago. That resulted in the loss of 85 American jobs, 1700 laid off last year, so much for social warrior footwear company or wearing at least at the margin about American workers. Odd, but they're claiming and what they're actually doing. Nike raising our consciousness.</p><p>Be sure to vote on our poll tonight, the question is do you think \"The New York Times\" anonymous op-ed is merely further evidence that President Trump is right when he calls the national left-wing media fake news? Cast your vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight. Up next, a new call for President Trump to declassify FISA documents.</p><p>And further expose the systematic bias and efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald J. Trump at the Justice Department and the FBI. I'll be joined by Gregg Jarrett right after this quick break. Stay with us. We're coming right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Key members of the House of Representatives will be calling on President Trump tomorrow to declassify the Carter-Page FISA application and notes from disgraced Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, Freedom Caucus Chair, Mark Meadows along with Congressman Jim Jordan, Matt Gaetz, and Lee Zeldin say, they will make that formal request of the President tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us now to assess all of this and much more, Gregg Jarrett, a Fox Legal Analyst and author of \"The New York Times\" best-selling book, The Russia Hoax. Great to have you here.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX BUSINESS LEGAL ANALYST: Good to be here, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's start with Meadows and Jordan and Gaetz going over to -- and Zeldin going over to the White House to talk to the President.</p><p>JARRETT: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: This, you know, for a example, Tom Fitton has been calling for this, we've all been calling this for ages. The President, why in your judgment has he not already done it?</p><p>JARRETT: He's being misled by the intelligence community. I suspect it's not just the FBI director but the DNI, Dan Coats. As well as others, probably Rod Rosenstein, why? Because first of all for the intelligence community, they think when they order a pizza it's national security and ought to be classified. There's this mentality that everything they do is so important. It's got to be classified and that's nonsense.</p><p>Every time something is declassified we find out it shouldn't have been classified to begin with and second of all, I think the FBI, Christopher Wray is covering up the wrongdoing of his own bureau and these documents will reveal a level of corruption that will stun most Americans and it'll be largely exculpatory of the President.</p><p>DOBBS: People forget, some of the Congressmen have seen --</p><p>JARRETT: Oh sure. So they know what's in it.</p><p>DOBBS: They know, they can make independent judgment and they can --</p><p>JARRETT: And they have.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, they have and have made it very clear that it's B.S. what is being peddled whether it's by the intelligence community whether it's being his attorneys and his, you know, his political folks. There is just no way in the world this President needs to let this go any further, it has got to stop, it's got to stop now.</p><p>JARRETT: The American public deserves to see what's in these documents. They deserve to see the impropriety and I believe illegality perpetrated by the FBI and the Department of Justice to target Trump to try to influence the election and undo the results.</p><p>DOBBS: I think in your rack it is called so stipulated. I mean, this has been demonstrated evidence throughout. We know what we're dealing with, a corrupt leadership that's still entrenched in the FBI. They have taken out the top but they haven't taken out all of the -- of the corruption. It's a toxic agency.</p><p>JARRETT: It is.</p><p>DOBBS: And only perhaps a competitive with that agency is the Department of Justice itself.</p><p>JARRETT: Absolutely.</p><p>DOBBS: And that's got to be fixed. This is a president who is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: -- should be on Jeff Sessions who has been abysmal and derelict in his duties as attorney general. And now he has an opportunity to make things happen irrespective of the willful resistance within his administration.</p><p>JARRETT: Everybody in Washington and America at large knows that Jeff Sessions is finished. Jeff Sessions may not get it but he will right after the elections. But the perfect example is he's allowed Bruce Ohr of all people to still be employed in the Department of Justice and we learned 10 days ago when when he implicated all of the people at the FBI who were involved in elicit scheme including believe it or not, Andrew Weissmann, the lead prosecutor in the Special Counsel Bob Mueller's investigation.</p><p>Which is now tainted and corrupted the integrity and credibility of that investigation.</p><p>DOBBS: Which had none to begin with.</p><p>JARRETT: Exactly.</p><p>DOBBS: So stipulated.</p><p>JARRETT: So stipulated, counselor.</p><p>DOBBS: All right. Thanks so much for being with us, Gregg. Thank you.</p><p>JARRETT: My pleasure.</p><p>DOBBS: Gregg Jarrett. And the book is \"The Russia Hoax.\" Buy a couple more copies, would you?</p><p>JARRETT: Buy 10.</p><p>DOBBS: I mean, this guy has got to think at some point about his children.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JARRETT: Getting old.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, his retirement as well, we'll throw that in. Up next, the resistance making its way inside the White House, that's what an op-ed in \"The New York Times\" by an anonymous, anonymous author would have -- \"The New York Times\" would have you believe. Oh. Wow. That's pretty bad. We'll take up that so called senior official in the Trump administration.</p><p>Yale professor Paul Bracken joins us. We're going to take up a lot of issues within as we continue here tonight. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: The left wing \"New York Times\", I know that's partly Redundant elevating its ideological fervour and that's kind -- a very kind way to call it what it is. Publishing not just an anonymous quote but an entire anonymous op-ed from an alleged member of the administration who bashed the president, and that's not allegedly that's definitively. If this is just the latest escalation in the fourth estates assault on President Trump. And no one -- no one should take seriously the claim that the author of this anonymous op-ed is truly a senior administration official. President Trump addressed the op-ed during the White House event this very afternoon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes, the sheriffs can imagine this, we have somebody in what I call the failing \"New York Times\", that's talking about he's part of the resistance within the Trump administration. This is what we have to deal with. And you know, the dishonest media because you people deal with it as well as I do but it's really a disgrace. I will say this, nobody has done what this administration has done in terms of getting things passed and getting things through.</p><p>When you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration probably who's failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons now. And \"The New York Times\" is failing. If I weren't here, I believe \"The New York Times\" probably wouldn't even exist. And someday, (INAUDIBLE) and someday when I'm not president, which hopefully will be in about 6-1/2 years from now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: \"The \"New York Times\"\" and CNN and all of these phony media outlets will be out of business folks, they'll be out of business. Because there'll be nothing to write and there'll be nothing of interest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Well the president is absolutely correct when he suggests that the copy won't be quite as elevated or exciting when he finally leaves the presidency.</p><p>Joining us tonight Paul Bracken, he's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, he's professor of political science and business at Yale University. A great American, it's great to have you here.</p><p>PAUL BRACKEN, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND BUSINESS, YALE UNIVERSITY: Good to be here.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's start with the President and this anonymous quote by some worm that allegedly is in the -- who is allegedly a part of the administration. Your thoughts about where the \"New York Times\" is.</p><p>BRACKEN: My thoughts are this, first of all, the \"The New York Times\" would have vetted this very carefully about who it is. So, I don't have any doubts about that. My feeling is yet another example of partisan politics run riot, it's the way I would put it. DOBBS: Right.</p><p>BRACKEN: It's happening everywhere and it's not good for the democracy. I don't think it's good for U.S. security overseas. It can tempt people to think the wrong things about that we have a weak government.</p><p>And I was shocked that the individual in question would not resign and put it out there under his own name.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, I wasn't surprised. Anyone who would betray the man they work for this president of the United States, is a delusional ego maniacal, self-aggrandizing jackass. I don't see any other way to call it. I would think that that person would I hope stand out clearly amongst the top officials of the administration.</p><p>BRACKEN: See, this is not like that you work for a big business.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>BRACKEN: And you don't agree with the CEO or something like that.</p><p>DOBBS: Right, it's national security.</p><p>BRACKEN: This is -- this is you work for the United States government and you worked with the Constitution. And if you really don't agree with it, you should be in there and you have special obligations that are far larger than people who work at most kinds of organizations.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, this would also be a call. This would also be a call to the deep state, whether it's in the FBI. We've seen the corruption that is rampant in its leadership, the Department of Justice. All of those people should be walking out the door because they are appalling in their disloyalty. The ignorance of their conduct, the political corruption that they have with which they've stained those that Department and that agency.</p><p>BRACKEN: Well, the way I would put it is that we have made it much easier to impeach the next president whoever it is after this one.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>BRACKEN: We are lowering the bar here and we are going to suffer for the sins of both parties but especially in recent times. It is not good for the strength of this country and a lot of other things going well on the economic front and the foreign policy front. And but on the political front, they're not.</p><p>DOBBS: This president is his successes to this point in time in his administration are unprecedented in the modern era, am I correct?</p><p>BRACKEN: You are correct. The one that gets me is the charge that he's drawn to authoritarian governments like Russia and China, which belies the fact that he's -- he has launched the largest nuclear build up, it's going to add thousands of hydrogen bombs aimed at Russia and China. I do not see this is coddling the Russians.</p><p>DOBBS: Nor do I.</p><p>BRACKEN: And the Russians do not see it that way. I was just in Russia as you know.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>BRACKEN: And talking to a lot of officials there, they are absolutely stunned at the thought that we believe that they could hack the U.S. election and make a difference. They can't do anything right in their own country and they're stunned to think that we think they won our election, they tilted it.</p><p>DOBBS: Folks have a -- should have a pretty good insight into Russian government just by the historical facts that is in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union and Marxist Leninist. I mean, the country is struggling now not just because of the sanctions, although there are a tremendous burden. But because the country has yet to embrace markets and --</p><p>BRACKEN: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: -- to achieve its potential.</p><p>BRACKEN: Their backward technologically. There is no Silicon Valley in Russia, they've tried to sort it several times.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>BRACKEN: The Ruble is collapsing. The biggest thing I -- you know what I and people talk about in Russia, it wasn't hacking the election, it wasn't Donald Trump, they are extremely upset because the Ruble is going down so much.</p><p>DOBBS: Sure.</p><p>BRACKEN: That they can't take their vacations on the Riviera this year.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>BRACKEN: That's what the Russians I spoke to were really upset about.</p><p>DOBBS: They're upset about that, they're also obviously very interested in reclaiming at least full power in the Atlantic. The United States now creating a countervailing Atlantic Fleet to the force that already the Russians have put into the Atlantic.</p><p>BRACKEN: Well, we've done a lot in the last few years. We've got some very interesting military technologies. And there are now NATO battalions in the three Baltic countries.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>BRACKEN: They would have to kill NATO troops if they come in and invade. And that gets them into a ball game that they do not want to get into.</p><p>DOBBS: And the reason they're there in large measure is because Estonia that the Baltic -- the Baltic are without question historically they've had enough of Russian invasion.</p><p>BRACKEN: That's an understatement. Yes, they do not like the Russians.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, we like you and we're delighted that you have taken time to join us. Hope you'll be back with us soon.</p><p>BRACKEN: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Thanks professor. Appreciate it, Paul Bracken.</p><p>In other headlines tonight, more than 500 passengers aboard an aircraft from Dubai had to be screened by health officials.

Black lives don't seem to matter of the 382 people killed in Chicago this year. 308 of them African-American. This is the same city that is now begging for a larger more engaged police force.

This is the president's tweet, does the so-called senior administration official really exist or is it just the failing New York Times with another phony source?

Well, joining us tonight, I am pleased to tell you is David Kaplan he's former legal affairs editor for Newsweek. Author of the new book The Most Dangerous Branch: Inside The Supreme Courts Assault On The Constitution. David, great to have you with us.</p><p>DAVID KAPLAN, AUTHOR, THE MOST DANGEROUS BRANCH: Good to be with you.</p><p>DOBBS: I want to first show folks a picture of the two of us in Fortune Magazine.</p><p>KAPLAN: No.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, we got that please. One, two, three. I did it on three. I timely (INAUDIBLE) here.</p><p>KAPLAN: Fake armrest.</p><p>DOBBS: That was fake?</p><p>KAPLAN: It looks real.</p><p>DOBBS: I was working like heck to just stay a parody there.</p><p>KAPLAN: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, what do you think of the sweater David?</p><p>KAPLAN: It's a lot nicer than my sport jacket.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, that's us. What year was that? 90?</p><p>KAPLAN: I think that was like 2010.</p><p>DOBBS: That's what I said 2010.</p><p>KAPLAN: Once upon a time.</p><p>DOBBS: That's it. It seemed like 93 to me but there it is.</p><p>KAPLAN: Who won that match?</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you and I both can claim it.</p><p>KAPLAN: Yes, I think I probably let you win.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, thank you -- thank you. I'm sure that I deferred. But I do - -</p><p>KAPLAN: We do that to most of the people we wrote about it Newsweek and fortune.</p><p>DOBBS: You got it -- you got it.</p><p>DOBBS: It's great to have you here. Congratulations on the book.</p><p>KAPLAN: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: It couldn't be more timely and judge Brett Kavanaugh. I'm watching these hearings and I honestly have never seen anything like it. This is --</p><p>KAPLAN: Sure you have, last year.</p><p>DOBBS: No.</p><p>KAPLAN: Except for the protest, fair enough.</p><p>DOBBS: This is -- this is venomous. 76 people arrested in two days. This is -- the Dimms are putting on a show that it looks to me like it's politically suicidal.</p><p>KAPLAN: I don't know how it's going to play politically but it's predictable. It's illogical -- it's a logical extension of where hearings have been going for 20 years. And if Hillary Clinton was president and she had put up a nominee, I think you'd see Republicans misbehaving. Neither side has a claim to good behavior.</p><p>But in the first instance -- in the first instance, the problem with these hearings isn't senators, it's not even presidents. It's the Supreme Court. They're complicit in this because by issuing rulings on so many controversial issues they raise the stakes of being on the Supreme Court. And you're seeing that play out now.</p><p>DOBBS: Now you argue in your book that the Supreme Court has overreached and it's -- that's an understatement in its rulings. Which is to you the most egregious, which is the most profound in its impact.</p><p>KAPLAN: Well, you know, choosing among bad rulings is like deciding which of your children you love most. But I think if I had to choose Bush v. Gore in 2000.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>KAPLAN: Was the most egregious but I criticized Roe v. Wade. I criticized the campaign-finance ruling as citizens united the gun control ruling and I criticized the gay marriage decision. There's plenty of criticism on left and right. So, there's plenty in the book for both sides to like or to hate.</p><p>DOBBS: So, we have to turn to The Most Dangerous Branch. We recommend the book to you highly by David Kaplan. You're fair and balanced and you're an equal-opportunity -- well, sceptic of both in a detractor of both. The Gore v. --</p><p>KAPLAN: Bush v. Gore.</p><p>DOBBS: Bush v. -- I knew I had it backwards, Bush v. Gore.</p><p>KAPLAN: They're easily confused.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, they are. They were actually -- they were a little more alike than we would like to think I think. The idea that you don't like that hurts me, because I thought we were friends and that you would automatically signed with Bush. You obviously chosen a separate path.</p><p>KAPLAN: But we're -- it's between friends. But the mistake I fear Lou that you're making is confusing criticism of the court's decision to intervene at all --</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>KAPLAN: -- with the outcome.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>KAPLAN: To the extent for example that I criticize Roe v. Wade, it's not because I disagree with the outcome. Politically, I'm liberal. I believe in very liberalized abortion laws. I don't think though that victory should be achieved in court, I think it should be achieved in Congress or in state legislatures similarly, whether you wanted Bush or Gore to win. The victory was best one in Congress because that's what the Constitution provided for in the case of a disputed presidential election. Instead, both sides went to court to achieve victory and that's what I criticize.</p><p>DOBBS: As you have studied this and written about it over two years -- written about it over two years to produce the book. Is there a point at which you think that the court can be either be righted or right itself?</p><p>KAPLAN: I'm not optimistic, what you're seeing playing out in the Kavanaugh hearings is an indication of how bad things have become. But I think the best hope lies not with presidents or senators but with the court itself. The courts going to have to learn to restrain itself.</p><p>DOBBS: David Kaplan, again, congratulations.</p><p>KAPLAN: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Great to see you.</p><p>KAPLAN: Good to see you. We're not going to arm-wrestle here. All right, next time.</p><p>DOBBS: I got to have a couple of more days in the weight room.</p><p>Up next President Trump mulling whether or not he should declassified documents at the heart of the Mueller never-ending witch-hunt. We'll have the latest when we come back.</p><p>This is the book, \"The Most Dangerous, Dangerous Branch,\" David Kaplan. We recommend it to you. We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2018090501cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6G-K2G1-JB20-G248-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6374\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 5, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Supreme Court</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>\"The New York Times\"</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Neil Gorsuch</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Twitter</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jack Dorsey</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>YouTube</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Colin Kaepernick</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nike</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FISA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Department of Justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>The Russia Hoax</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp;

By the  way, Vince, congratulations again.  Great job.  Here's Lou.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good evening, everybody.  Our top  stories, day two of the Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the  radical Dems still trying to disrupt and delay those hearings in spite of  the outrageous ignorant conduct of the committee Dems and leftist  protestors, President Trump's high court nominee handling their ignorance  with grace and constraint. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I've watched his remarks,  I've watched his performance, I've watched his statements and honestly  they've been totally brilliant.  I think that the other side is grasping at  straws and really the other side should embrace it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Embrace it.  We'll take up the latest on those hearings tonight,  Congressman Andy Biggs among our guest.  Also Fox Legal Analyst, Gregg  Jarrett.  Also, social media executives embarrassingly unprepared on  Capitol Hill exposing themselves as unable, unwilling to address election  meddling issues and acknowledge their political bias.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PATRICK DORSEY, FOUNDER AND CEO, TWITTER:  We found ourselves unprepared  and ill-equipped for the immensity of the problems that we've acknowledged.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  As for Google, didn't even show up, leaving lawmakers staring at  empty an chair and perhaps -- just perhaps dreaming of ways to bring Google  to heel.  We take that up tonight with conservative social media starts,  Diamond and Silk.  And \"The New York Times\" taking fake news to the next  level from anonymous sources to entire anonymous op-eds with anonymous  quotes thrown in.</p><p>The President isn't too impressed by either \"The Times\" or the gutless  wonder anonymous op-ed author. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  If the failing \"New York Times\" has an anonymous editorial, can you  believe it?  Anonymous, meaning gutless, a gutless editorial, we're doing a  great job, the poll numbers are through the roof, our poll numbers are  great and guess what, nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  We'll have more on the cowardly self-proclaimed senior official  little worm who chose to betray and to attack the President that is if you  believe the Times' claim about any of this.  Our top story, the  confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh still  underway despite Dems spewing ignorance and vitriol all over the hearing  room above it all Kavanaugh who makes his little effusion inquisitors from  the left look ever smaller.</p><p>Fox News Chief Legal Correspondent and Anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" Shannon  Bream joining us from Capitol Hill with the latest.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP:  I've watched his performance, I've watched his statements and  honestly they've been totally brilliant.  </p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  President Trump praising his second Supreme  Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh as the judge continues to run a gauntlet  marked by protestors.  And Senators still jousting over document  production.  </p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), VERMONT:  I would ask the chairman if he might look  at some of these remarked committee confidential.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let me answer that for you, if you're interested in it,  you could have been asking ever since August the 25th, I believe.  </p><p>BREAM:  Today's question centering on guns.  </p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-), CALIFORNIA:  I never thought this would happen  in our country that someone would bring a semiautomatic assault weapon into  a school and just mow down children and staff.  And so I've been very  interested in your thinking on assault weapons.  </p><p>BREAM:  Abortion.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I mean, you just can't -- what  are you -- what are you doing for lunch, let's overrule Roe v. Wade, it  doesn't work that way, right? </p><p>BREAM:  And on this evolution regarding whether a sitting President should  be subjected to criminal and civil investigations while in office.  As a  member of Ken Starr's team, he advocated for aggressively questioning then- President Bill Clinton and helped to write a Starr report, outlining the  grounds for Clinton's eventual impeachment.  Years later he authored a law  review article questioning the wisdom of subjecting sitting Presidents to  invasive investigations.</p><p>While noting Congress holds the ultimate remedy, impeachment.  </p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  What changed was September 11th.   That's what's changed.  President Bush said this will not happen again and  he was a single-minded focus every morning for the next seven years for  President Bush was still September 12th, 2001.  </p><p>BREAM:  And at Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White House post 9/11 that  sparked numerous questions about whether he was involved in crafting  warrantless surveillance programs or enhanced interrogation policies and  the legal memos used to justify them.  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  I was not read into that program, not involved in crafting that  program nor crafting the legal justifications for that program.  </p><p>BREAM:  Also today spectators got a glimpse of human side of the nominee  who -- when asked how he'd like to be remembered as good dad and judge and  then paused.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN:  Good husband.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  I think he's getting there.  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  Good husband.</p><p>GARAHAM:  Thanks, Dianne, you helped him a lot.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BREAM:  Late in the day, Democratic Senator Dick Blumenthal asked the  nominee to commit to recusing himself from any civil or criminal case  involving the President that would come before him as justice, he  repeatedly declined.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Shannon, thank you.  Shannon Bream.  Joining us tonight, Republican  Congressman Andy Biggs, he is a member of House Judiciary Committee and the  Freedom Caucus.  Congressman, good to have you with us.  Your impression of  the conduct of the Dems on the Senate Judiciary Committee over two days.  </p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA:  Well, I'm kind of embarrassed for them.  I  mean, I watched for instance Mr. Durbin -- Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy  asked questions and quite frankly they're fishing and I will just tell you,  Judge Kavanaugh made them look so inept and unable to even understand that  they were -- they were looking inept.  So, not only is he far more  brilliant, far more articulate.</p><p>He's got an encyclopedic memory, he's gracious about embarrassing the  Democrats in such a way that they don't even realize how small they are  compared to him.  </p><p>BREAM:  I think you have expressed exactly -- when I listened to Kamala  Harris and Dick Durbin, frankly some of the Republicans as they try to stay  up with him, it was a very -- it was very revealing both as to their  capacity and the -- and the nominee's extraordinary talent and intellect as  you say.  Let's turn to where we go from here.  Are we are going to see  this nominee be approved and be ready for the fall term on the Supreme  Court?  </p><p>BIGGS:  My understanding is that they're going wrap this thing up sometime  mid to late September and that he will be confirmed and that he'll be  sitting there for the October session and that's my hope.  I mean, look,  this guy is really talented.  He is really a brilliant jurist, great --  just a great man.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  You know, this nominee Kavanaugh and sitting on the court,  the President's other nominee, Neil Gorsuch, I mean, these are -- these are  world-class intellects and legal minds, it's  wonderful to behold.  Let's  turn now to social media.  We had a couple of folks show up to talk about  their bias and what they were doing with Russian meddling and frankly smart  people, they seem to have a lot of trouble with the language.  </p><p>BIGGS:  Well, you know, they really do, Lou.  And here's the part I love  about it.  I mean, speaking of anonymous things that have gone on today,  yes, they're saying, well, this happened for liberals too, well, can you  name some?  Well, no, we can't.  We're not going the name some.  The reason  is because I can name people, I can name organizations right now who I know  were -- had this prejudice against and they were censored but -- and I'll  name them.</p><p>But they won't even do that because I don't think it's there, I think their  algorithms were designed to specifically root out the conservatives and  what -- to blame it on the people who are hitting on the conservative sites  was outrageous in my opinion.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Are we headed toward regulations of the social media and big tech  organizations?  Because they are threatening to be arbiters of what is  tasteful, what is acceptable, what is appropriate, what is the standard for  discourse?  </p><p>BIGGS:  Well, I think the root of where we need to go is to determine who  owns the content.  I mean, first of all, they don't know whether a lot of  people are boxed or real people that they're trying to weed out, but beyond  that, we -- let's find out who really owns the content because if they own  the content, then they're liable for suppression, they're liable for  slander, they're liable for any of this.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there are two ways that the signals get set around the  worldwide web, one is by wire and the other is by air and the fact is, the  government of the United States, the people of the United States have  claimed them both.  Congressman, as always, great to see you, we appreciate  it.  Andy Biggs.</p><p>BIGGS:  Thanks, Lou.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you.  Up next, social media giants Twitter and Facebook  answering questions about why they silenced conservative voices and even  admit to dropping -- well, just failing to detect or act on Russian  election meddling.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, FACEBOOK:  Russia used social  media as part of and I quote, \"a comprehensive and multifaceted campaign to  set discord, undermine Democratic institutions and interfere in U.S.  election and those of our allies.  We were too slow to spot this and to  slow to act.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Mnemonic, don't you think?  We take it up after the break with  folks who are -- their minds are alive, Diamond and Silk, electric and  coming up next.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I can't wait to talk with Diamond and Silk about what is  going on in Washington and social media.  As Congress is -- well, they're - - in some cases hinting that they may want to regulate social media, big  tech, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey among those on Capitol Hill today talking  about his company silencing of conservative voices and his defense leaving  just a little to be desired. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DORSEY:  We don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives or party  affiliation in any of our policies or enforcement decisions.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The allegation that we made, the Republicans, is that  you're discriminatory against us, against the republicans.</p><p>DORSEY:  We agree that the result was not impartial and that is why we  corrected and we fixed it.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So do you agree that there were more Republicans than  Democrats?  </p><p>DORSEY:  I didn't say that but I do -- I do --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, you can't have it both ways, sir.  </p><p>DORSEY:  We don't always have the best methods to determine who is a  Republican, who is a Democrat or we have to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, usually it's known because we run as Republicans  or Democrats, that's not hard to identify.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Dorsey not impressing us certainly on this broadcast, investors  weren't too impressed either.  Twitter stock falling more than six percent  today.  Dorsey is going to have to up his game, we will see how that goes  from here.  Joining us now, social media super stars, President Trump  supporters, Diamond and Silk.  Great to have you here on a day in which  social media was, well, in the court of public opinion on Capitol Hill.</p><p>What did you make of Dorsey and his comments and Sandberg from Facebook,  her comments of the day, Diamond?  </p><p>LYNNETTE HARDAWAY, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITY:  Well, you know what, here is  the deal, you have the same people that go up to the Capitol Hill and they  just chat and they just talk, and they get nothing done, they say nothing  that will take and apiece the American people especially conservatives  that's being centered on their platform.  </p><p>ROCHELLE RICHARDSON, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITY:  That's right.  </p><p>HARDAWAY:  To think that you can influence, you can influence what we talk  about or what we socialize about on social media, that is dictatorship and  that is tyranny and that has got to stop.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you're exactly right because it is -- this is Soviet stuff,  talking about whether Facebook or Twitter, who -- whatever platform it  might be, they decide what can be said, they decide what will be an  acceptable expression, they become the arbiters of taste and judgment and  appropriate speech, go to hell. </p><p>HARDAWAY:  Absolutely.  </p><p>RICHARDSON:  You got that right.  And then they want to sit and talk about  that Russia as the one that's influencing the election.  It's these  platforms, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, the social media platforms  that is -- are the ones that's influencing this election because you know  what, I don't speak Russia, I speak English, I've never been to Russia and  I don't -- you know, if anybody said anything to me in Russia, I wouldn't  know what they're talking about.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's the social media platforms that's influencing this  election by silencing and censoring conservative lawyers.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Sandberg acknowledging that the -- they were slow to respond  at Facebook.  It turns out that the first collusion may have been on  Facebook with the Russians and they didn't react, they didn't bring in  authorities from the, you know, from our intelligence agencies, Twitter,  you know, I couldn't understand what Dorsey was even trying to say, he  wanted to be the guy who decides whether or not conservatives have a voice.</p><p>But then he said he couldn't tell which is which, it got really kind of  ambiguous for him, could you straighten him out on that, Diamond?</p><p>HARDAWAY:  Well, first of all, he's not the arbitrator of truth.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  So to think that he can influence but he's not the school, he's  not the school of speech, this is free speech that we're talking about  being stifled. </p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.  </p><p>HARDAWAY:  This is conservative free speech.  And what they did, the  pretext of all of these here is algorithms that they put in place to  silence conservative voices.  If you say the word Trump, you're silenced,  if you say anything patriotic, stand for the flag or anything about god,  you are silenced.  If you are a conservative, you are being silenced on the  social media of platforms because they want to act like they are the  arbitrators of truth and they nothing but liars and really thieves.  Yes,  lairs and thieves.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Diamond and Silk, it's great to have you here.  We thank you,  I want to apologize for swearing, my wife is going to chastise me strongly  after the broadcast I'm sure.  Forgive me and we're delight to see you, all  the best.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>HARDAWAY:  Thank you so much.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Thank you for having us.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Be sure to check out Diamond and Silk's chitchat tour, their next  stop is October 7 in Marietta, Georgia.  Nike launching its controversial  ad campaign featuring NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.  Tomorrow Nike will  run its ad on the NFL'S season opener but the social justice warriors and  newly self-proclaimed at Nike have a -- well, something of a spotty history  when it comes to social justice and the American worker.</p><p>Nike, it turns out -- are you ready?  Has 127 footwear factories located in  15 countries.  Well, Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufacturing 94 percent  of Nike footwear.  Also, Nike has 363 apparel factories.  They're in 37  countries and make 52 percent of Nike apparel in China, Vietnam and  Thailand.  That's right, not Ohio, not Oklahoma, not in Oregon, by the way,  let's don't forget.</p><p>Nike is the same company that put a New York screen printing company out of  business and shipped T-shirt printing and production from a factory in New  York to Honduras just three years ago.  That resulted in the loss of 85  American jobs, 1700 laid off last year, so much for social warrior footwear  company or wearing at least at the margin about American workers.  Odd, but  they're claiming and what they're actually doing.  Nike raising our  consciousness.</p><p>Be sure to vote on our poll tonight, the question is do you think \"The New  York Times\" anonymous op-ed is merely further evidence that President Trump  is right when he calls the national left-wing media fake news? Cast your  vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on  Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Up next, a new call for  President Trump to declassify FISA documents.</p><p>And further expose the systematic bias and efforts to subvert the  presidency of Donald J. Trump at the Justice Department and the FBI.  I'll  be joined by Gregg Jarrett right after this quick break.  Stay with us.   We're coming right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Key members of the House of Representatives will be calling on  President Trump tomorrow to declassify the Carter-Page FISA application and  notes from disgraced Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, Freedom Caucus  Chair, Mark Meadows along with Congressman Jim Jordan, Matt Gaetz, and Lee  Zeldin say, they will make that formal request of the President tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us now to assess all of this and much more, Gregg Jarrett, a Fox  Legal Analyst and author of \"The New York Times\" best-selling book, The  Russia Hoax.  Great to have you here.  </p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX BUSINESS LEGAL ANALYST:  Good to be here, Lou.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Meadows and Jordan and Gaetz going over to -- and  Zeldin going over to the White House to talk to the President.</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  This, you know, for a example, Tom Fitton has been calling for  this, we've all been calling this for ages.  The President, why in your  judgment has he not already done it?  </p><p>JARRETT:  He's being misled by the intelligence community.  I suspect it's  not just the FBI director but the DNI, Dan Coats.  As well as others,  probably Rod Rosenstein, why?  Because first of all for the intelligence  community, they think when they order a pizza it's national security and  ought to be classified.  There's this mentality that everything they do is  so important.  It's got to be classified and that's nonsense.</p><p>Every time something is declassified we find out it shouldn't have been  classified to begin with and second of all, I think the FBI, Christopher  Wray is covering up the wrongdoing of his own bureau and these documents  will reveal a level of corruption that will stun most Americans and it'll  be largely exculpatory of the President.  </p><p>DOBBS:  People forget, some of the Congressmen have seen --</p><p>JARRETT:  Oh sure.  So they know what's in it.</p><p>DOBBS:  They know, they can make independent judgment and they can --</p><p>JARRETT:  And they have.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, they have and have made it very clear that it's B.S. what is  being peddled whether it's by the intelligence community whether it's being  his attorneys and his, you know, his political folks.  There is just no way  in the world this President needs to let this go any further, it has got to  stop, it's got to stop now.  </p><p>JARRETT:  The American public deserves to see what's in these documents.   They deserve to see the impropriety and I believe illegality perpetrated by  the FBI and the Department of Justice to target Trump to try to influence  the election and undo the results.  </p><p>DOBBS:  I think in your rack it is called so stipulated.  I mean, this has  been demonstrated evidence throughout.  We know what we're dealing with, a  corrupt leadership that's still entrenched in the FBI.  They have taken out  the top but they haven't taken out all of the -- of the corruption.  It's a  toxic agency.  </p><p>JARRETT:  It is.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And only perhaps a competitive with that agency is the Department  of Justice itself.  </p><p>JARRETT:  Absolutely.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And that's got to be fixed.  This is a president who is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- should be on Jeff Sessions who has been abysmal and derelict in  his duties as attorney general.  And now he has an opportunity to make  things happen irrespective of the willful resistance within his  administration.  </p><p>JARRETT:  Everybody in Washington and America at large knows that Jeff  Sessions is finished.  Jeff Sessions may not get it but he will right after  the elections.  But the perfect example is he's allowed Bruce Ohr of all  people to still be employed in the Department of Justice and we learned 10  days ago when when he implicated all of the people at the FBI who were  involved in elicit scheme including believe it or not, Andrew Weissmann,  the lead prosecutor in the Special Counsel Bob Mueller's investigation.</p><p>Which is now tainted and corrupted the integrity and credibility of that  investigation.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Which had none to begin with.  </p><p>JARRETT:  Exactly.  </p><p>DOBBS:  So stipulated.  </p><p>JARRETT:  So stipulated, counselor.  </p><p>DOBBS:  All right.  Thanks so much for being with us, Gregg.  Thank you.</p><p>JARRETT:  My pleasure.</p><p>DOBBS:  Gregg Jarrett.  And the book is \"The Russia Hoax.\"  Buy a couple  more copies, would you?  </p><p>JARRETT:  Buy 10.</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, this guy has got to think at some point about his children.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>JARRETT:  Getting old.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, his retirement as well, we'll throw that in.  Up next, the  resistance making its way inside the White House, that's what an op-ed in  \"The New York Times\" by an anonymous, anonymous author would have -- \"The  New York Times\" would have you believe.  Oh.  Wow.  That's pretty bad.   We'll take up that so called senior official in the Trump administration.  </p><p>Yale professor Paul Bracken joins us.  We're going to take up a lot of  issues within as we continue here tonight.  Stay with us, we'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The left wing \"New York Times\", I know that's partly Redundant  elevating its ideological fervour and that's kind -- a very kind way to  call it what it is.  Publishing not just an anonymous quote but an entire  anonymous op-ed from an alleged member of the administration who bashed the  president, and that's not allegedly that's definitively.  If this is just  the latest escalation in the fourth estates assault on President Trump.   And no one -- no one should take seriously the claim that the author of  this anonymous op-ed is truly a senior administration official.  President  Trump addressed the op-ed during the White House event this very afternoon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Yes, the sheriffs can  imagine this, we have somebody in what I call the failing \"New York Times\",  that's talking about he's part of the resistance within the Trump  administration.  This is what we have to deal with.  And you know, the  dishonest media because you people deal with it as well as I do but it's  really a disgrace.  I will say this, nobody has done what this  administration has done in terms of getting things passed and getting  things through.</p><p>When you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration  probably who's failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons now.   And \"The New York Times\" is failing.  If I weren't here, I believe \"The New  York Times\" probably wouldn't even exist.  And someday, (INAUDIBLE) and  someday when I'm not president, which hopefully will be in about 6-1/2  years from now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: \"The \"New York Times\"\" and CNN and all of these phony media outlets  will be out of business folks, they'll be out of business.  Because  there'll be nothing to write and there'll be nothing of interest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well the president is absolutely correct when he suggests that the  copy won't be quite as elevated or exciting when he finally leaves the  presidency.</p><p>Joining us tonight Paul Bracken, he's a member of the Council on Foreign  Relations, he's professor of political science and business at Yale  University.  A great American, it's great to have you here.</p><p>PAUL BRACKEN, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND BUSINESS, YALE UNIVERSITY:   Good to be here.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with the President and this anonymous quote by some  worm that allegedly is in the -- who is allegedly a part of the  administration.  Your thoughts about where the \"New York Times\" is.</p><p>BRACKEN:  My thoughts are this, first of all, the \"The New York Times\"  would have vetted this very carefully about who it is.  So, I don't have  any doubts about that.  My feeling is yet another example of partisan  politics run riot, it's the way I would put it.  DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  It's happening everywhere and it's not good for the democracy.  I  don't think it's good for U.S. security overseas.  It can tempt people to  think the wrong things about that we have a weak government.</p><p>And I was shocked that the individual in question would not resign and put  it out there under his own name.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, I wasn't surprised.  Anyone who would betray the man they work  for this president of the United States, is a delusional ego maniacal,  self-aggrandizing jackass.  I don't see any other way to call it.  I would  think that that person would I hope stand out clearly amongst the top  officials of the administration.</p><p>BRACKEN:  See, this is not like that you work for a big business.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  And you don't agree with the CEO or something like that.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right, it's national security.</p><p>BRACKEN:  This is -- this is you work for the United States government and  you worked with the Constitution.  And if you really don't agree with it,  you should be in there and you have special obligations that are far larger  than people who work at most kinds of organizations.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, this would also be a call.  This would also be a call to the  deep state, whether it's in the FBI.  We've seen the corruption that is  rampant in its leadership, the Department of Justice.  All of those people  should be walking out the door because they are appalling in their  disloyalty.  The ignorance of their conduct, the political corruption that  they have with which they've stained those that Department and that agency.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Well, the way I would put it is that we have made it much easier  to impeach the next president whoever it is after this one.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  We are lowering the bar here and we are going to suffer for the  sins of both parties but especially in recent times.  It is not good for  the strength of this country and a lot of other things going well on the  economic front and the foreign policy front.  And but on the political  front, they're not.</p><p>DOBBS:  This president is his successes to this point in time in his  administration are unprecedented in the modern era, am I correct?</p><p>BRACKEN:  You are correct.  The one that gets me is the charge that he's  drawn to authoritarian governments like Russia and China, which belies the  fact that he's -- he has launched the largest nuclear build up, it's going  to add thousands of hydrogen bombs aimed at Russia and China.  I do not see  this is coddling the Russians.</p><p>DOBBS:  Nor do I.</p><p>BRACKEN:  And the Russians do not see it that way.  I was just in Russia as  you know.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  And talking to a lot of officials there, they are absolutely  stunned at the thought that we believe that they could hack the U.S.  election and make a difference.  They can't do anything right in their own  country and they're stunned to think that we think they won our election,  they tilted it.</p><p>DOBBS:  Folks have a -- should have a pretty good insight into Russian  government just by the historical facts that is in 1991 with the collapse  of the Soviet Union and Marxist Leninist.  I mean, the country is  struggling now not just because of the sanctions, although there are a  tremendous burden.  But because the country has yet to embrace markets and  --</p><p>BRACKEN:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- to achieve its potential.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Their backward technologically.  There is no Silicon Valley in  Russia, they've tried to sort it several times.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  The Ruble is collapsing.  The biggest thing I -- you know what I  and people talk about in Russia, it wasn't hacking the election, it wasn't  Donald Trump, they are extremely upset because the Ruble is going down so  much.</p><p>DOBBS:  Sure.</p><p>BRACKEN:  That they can't take their vacations on the Riviera this year.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  That's what the Russians I spoke to were really upset about.</p><p>DOBBS:  They're upset about that, they're also obviously very interested in  reclaiming at least full power in the Atlantic.  The United States now  creating a countervailing Atlantic Fleet to the force that already the  Russians have put into the Atlantic.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Well, we've done a lot in the last few years.  We've got some  very interesting military technologies.  And there are now NATO battalions  in the three Baltic countries.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  They would have to kill NATO troops if they come in and invade.   And that gets them into a ball game that they do not want to get into.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the reason they're there in large measure is because Estonia  that the Baltic -- the Baltic are without question historically they've had  enough of Russian invasion.</p><p>BRACKEN:  That's an understatement.  Yes, they do not like the Russians.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, we like you and we're delighted that you have taken time to  join us.  Hope you'll be back with us soon.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Thanks professor.  Appreciate it, Paul Bracken.</p><p>In other headlines tonight, more than 500 passengers aboard an aircraft  from Dubai had to be screened by health officials.

Taking an unpatriotic and disgraceful  stance against police officers across the country who risk their lives  every single day.  Since 2014, there have been 212 police officers killed  across the country in the line of duty.  And in some of our largest cities  such as Chicago.  Black lives don't seem to matter of the 382 people killed  in Chicago this year.  308 of them African-American.  This is the same city  that is now begging for a larger more engaged police force.  But continues  to vote for failed leaders like the outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel who after  promising to hire a thousand new police officers in 2016 has brought in  just about 600.</p><p>Instead of looking to a failed NFL quarterback who sacrificed a few million  dollars to take a knee during our national anthem.

The president tweeted this just minutes  ago.  This is the president's tweet, does the so-called senior  administration official really exist or is it just the failing New York  Times with another phony source?

Well, joining us tonight, I am pleased to tell you is  David Kaplan he's former legal affairs editor for Newsweek.  Author of the  new book The Most Dangerous Branch: Inside The Supreme Courts Assault On  The Constitution.  David, great to have you with us.</p><p>DAVID KAPLAN, AUTHOR, THE MOST DANGEROUS BRANCH:  Good to be with you.</p><p>DOBBS:  I want to first show folks a picture of the two of us in Fortune  Magazine.</p><p>KAPLAN:  No.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, we got that please.  One, two, three.  I did it on three.  I  timely (INAUDIBLE) here.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Fake armrest.</p><p>DOBBS:  That was fake?</p><p>KAPLAN:  It looks real.</p><p>DOBBS:  I was working like heck to just stay a parody there.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, what do you think of the sweater David?</p><p>KAPLAN:  It's a lot nicer than my sport jacket.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, that's us.  What year was that?  90?  </p><p>KAPLAN:  I think that was like 2010.</p><p>DOBBS:  That's what I said 2010.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Once upon a time.</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it.  It seemed like 93 to me but there it is.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Who won that match?</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you and I both can claim it.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Yes, I think I probably let you win.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, thank you -- thank you.  I'm sure that I deferred.  But I do - -</p><p>KAPLAN:  We do that to most of the people we wrote about it Newsweek and  fortune.</p><p>DOBBS:  You got it -- you got it.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's great to have you here.  Congratulations on the book.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  It couldn't be more timely and judge Brett Kavanaugh.  I'm watching  these hearings and I honestly have never seen anything like it.  This is --</p><p>KAPLAN:  Sure you have, last year.</p><p>DOBBS:  No.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Except for the protest, fair enough.</p><p>DOBBS:  This is -- this is venomous.  76 people arrested in two days.  This  is -- the Dimms are putting on a show that it looks to me like it's  politically suicidal.</p><p>KAPLAN:  I don't know how it's going to play politically but it's  predictable.  It's illogical -- it's a logical extension of where hearings  have been going for 20 years.  And if Hillary Clinton was president and she  had put up a nominee, I think you'd see Republicans misbehaving.  Neither  side has a claim to good behavior.</p><p>But in the first instance -- in the first instance, the problem with these  hearings isn't senators, it's not even presidents.  It's the Supreme Court.   They're complicit in this because by issuing rulings on so many  controversial issues they raise the stakes of being on the Supreme Court.   And you're seeing that play out now.</p><p>DOBBS:  Now you argue in your book that the Supreme Court has overreached  and it's -- that's an understatement in its rulings.  Which is to you the  most egregious, which is the most profound in its impact.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Well, you know, choosing among bad rulings is like deciding which  of your children you love most.  But I think if I had to choose Bush v.  Gore in 2000.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Was the most egregious but I criticized Roe v. Wade.  I criticized  the campaign-finance ruling as citizens united the gun control ruling and I  criticized the gay marriage decision.  There's plenty of criticism on left  and right.  So, there's plenty in the book for both sides to like or to  hate.</p><p>DOBBS:  So, we have to turn to The Most Dangerous Branch.  We recommend the  book to you highly by David Kaplan.  You're fair and balanced and you're an  equal-opportunity -- well, sceptic of both in a detractor of both.  The  Gore v. --</p><p>KAPLAN:  Bush v. Gore.</p><p>DOBBS:  Bush v. -- I knew I had it backwards, Bush v. Gore.</p><p>KAPLAN:  They're easily confused.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, they are.  They were actually -- they were a little more alike  than we would like to think I think.  The idea that you don't like that  hurts me, because I thought we were friends and that you would  automatically signed with Bush.  You obviously chosen a separate path.</p><p>KAPLAN:  But we're -- it's between friends.  But the mistake I fear Lou  that you're making is confusing criticism of the court's decision to  intervene at all --</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>KAPLAN:  -- with the outcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>KAPLAN:  To the extent for example that I criticize Roe v. Wade, it's not  because I disagree with the outcome.  Politically, I'm liberal.  I believe  in very liberalized abortion laws.  I don't think though that victory  should be achieved in court, I think it should be achieved in Congress or  in state legislatures similarly, whether you wanted Bush or Gore to win.   The victory was best one in Congress because that's what the Constitution  provided for in the case of a disputed presidential election.  Instead,  both sides went to court to achieve victory and that's what I criticize.</p><p>DOBBS:  As you have studied this and written about it over two years --  written about it over two years to produce the book.  Is there a point at  which you think that the court can be either be righted or right itself?</p><p>KAPLAN:  I'm not optimistic, what you're seeing playing out in the  Kavanaugh hearings is an indication of how bad things have become.  But I  think the best hope lies not with presidents or senators but with the court  itself.  The courts going to have to learn to restrain itself.</p><p>DOBBS:  David Kaplan, again, congratulations.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Great to see you.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Good to see you.  We're not going to arm-wrestle here.  All right,  next time.</p><p>DOBBS:  I got to have a couple of more days in the weight room.</p><p>Up next President Trump mulling whether or not he should declassified  documents at the heart of the Mueller never-ending witch-hunt.  We'll have  the latest when we come back.</p><p>This is the book, \"The Most Dangerous, Dangerous Branch,\" David Kaplan.  We  recommend it to you.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END </p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Our top  stories, day two of the Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the  radical Dems still trying to disrupt and delay those hearings in spite of  the outrageous ignorant conduct of the committee Dems and leftist  protestors, President Trump's high court nominee handling their ignorance  with grace and constraint. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I've watched his remarks,  I've watched his performance, I've watched his statements and honestly  they've been totally brilliant.  I think that the other side is grasping at  straws and really the other side should embrace it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Embrace it.  We'll take up the latest on those hearings tonight,  Congressman Andy Biggs among our guest.  Also Fox Legal Analyst, Gregg  Jarrett.  Also, social media executives embarrassingly unprepared on  Capitol Hill exposing themselves as unable, unwilling to address election  meddling issues and acknowledge their political bias.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PATRICK DORSEY, FOUNDER AND CEO, TWITTER:  We found ourselves unprepared  and ill-equipped for the immensity of the problems that we've acknowledged.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  As for Google, didn't even show up, leaving lawmakers staring at  empty an chair and perhaps -- just perhaps dreaming of ways to bring Google  to heel.  We take that up tonight with conservative social media starts,  Diamond and Silk.  And \"The New York Times\" taking fake news to the next  level from anonymous sources to entire anonymous op-eds with anonymous  quotes thrown in.</p><p>The President isn't too impressed by either \"The Times\" or the gutless  wonder anonymous op-ed author. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  If the failing \"New York Times\" has an anonymous editorial, can you  believe it?  Anonymous, meaning gutless, a gutless editorial, we're doing a  great job, the poll numbers are through the roof, our poll numbers are  great and guess what, nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  We'll have more on the cowardly self-proclaimed senior official  little worm who chose to betray and to attack the President that is if you  believe the Times' claim about any of this.  Our top story, the  confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh still  underway despite Dems spewing ignorance and vitriol all over the hearing  room above it all Kavanaugh who makes his little effusion inquisitors from  the left look ever smaller.</p><p>Fox News Chief Legal Correspondent and Anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" Shannon  Bream joining us from Capitol Hill with the latest.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP:  I've watched his performance, I've watched his statements and  honestly they've been totally brilliant.  </p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  President Trump praising his second Supreme  Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh as the judge continues to run a gauntlet  marked by protestors.  And Senators still jousting over document  production.  </p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), VERMONT:  I would ask the chairman if he might look  at some of these remarked committee confidential.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let me answer that for you, if you're interested in it,  you could have been asking ever since August the 25th, I believe.  </p><p>BREAM:  Today's question centering on guns.  </p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-), CALIFORNIA:  I never thought this would happen  in our country that someone would bring a semiautomatic assault weapon into  a school and just mow down children and staff.  And so I've been very  interested in your thinking on assault weapons.  </p><p>BREAM:  Abortion.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I mean, you just can't -- what  are you -- what are you doing for lunch, let's overrule Roe v. Wade, it  doesn't work that way, right? </p><p>BREAM:  And on this evolution regarding whether a sitting President should  be subjected to criminal and civil investigations while in office.  As a  member of Ken Starr's team, he advocated for aggressively questioning then- President Bill Clinton and helped to write a Starr report, outlining the  grounds for Clinton's eventual impeachment.  Years later he authored a law  review article questioning the wisdom of subjecting sitting Presidents to  invasive investigations.</p><p>While noting Congress holds the ultimate remedy, impeachment.  </p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  What changed was September 11th.   That's what's changed.  President Bush said this will not happen again and  he was a single-minded focus every morning for the next seven years for  President Bush was still September 12th, 2001.  </p><p>BREAM:  And at Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White House post 9/11 that  sparked numerous questions about whether he was involved in crafting  warrantless surveillance programs or enhanced interrogation policies and  the legal memos used to justify them.  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  I was not read into that program, not involved in crafting that  program nor crafting the legal justifications for that program.  </p><p>BREAM:  Also today spectators got a glimpse of human side of the nominee  who -- when asked how he'd like to be remembered as good dad and judge and  then paused.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN:  Good husband.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  I think he's getting there.  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  Good husband.</p><p>GARAHAM:  Thanks, Dianne, you helped him a lot.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BREAM:  Late in the day, Democratic Senator Dick Blumenthal asked the  nominee to commit to recusing himself from any civil or criminal case  involving the President that would come before him as justice, he  repeatedly declined.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Shannon, thank you.  Shannon Bream.  Joining us tonight, Republican  Congressman Andy Biggs, he is a member of House Judiciary Committee and the  Freedom Caucus.  Congressman, good to have you with us.  Your impression of  the conduct of the Dems on the Senate Judiciary Committee over two days.  </p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA:  Well, I'm kind of embarrassed for them.  I  mean, I watched for instance Mr. Durbin -- Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy  asked questions and quite frankly they're fishing and I will just tell you,  Judge Kavanaugh made them look so inept and unable to even understand that  they were -- they were looking inept.  So, not only is he far more  brilliant, far more articulate.</p><p>He's got an encyclopedic memory, he's gracious about embarrassing the  Democrats in such a way that they don't even realize how small they are  compared to him.  </p><p>BREAM:  I think you have expressed exactly -- when I listened to Kamala  Harris and Dick Durbin, frankly some of the Republicans as they try to stay  up with him, it was a very -- it was very revealing both as to their  capacity and the -- and the nominee's extraordinary talent and intellect as  you say.  Let's turn to where we go from here.  Are we are going to see  this nominee be approved and be ready for the fall term on the Supreme  Court?  </p><p>BIGGS:  My understanding is that they're going wrap this thing up sometime  mid to late September and that he will be confirmed and that he'll be  sitting there for the October session and that's my hope.  I mean, look,  this guy is really talented.  He is really a brilliant jurist, great --  just a great man.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  You know, this nominee Kavanaugh and sitting on the court,  the President's other nominee, Neil Gorsuch, I mean, these are -- these are  world-class intellects and legal minds, it's  wonderful to behold.  Let's  turn now to social media.  We had a couple of folks show up to talk about  their bias and what they were doing with Russian meddling and frankly smart  people, they seem to have a lot of trouble with the language.  </p><p>BIGGS:  Well, you know, they really do, Lou.  And here's the part I love  about it.  I mean, speaking of anonymous things that have gone on today,  yes, they're saying, well, this happened for liberals too, well, can you  name some?  Well, no, we can't.  We're not going the name some.  The reason  is because I can name people, I can name organizations right now who I know  were -- had this prejudice against and they were censored but -- and I'll  name them.</p><p>But they won't even do that because I don't think it's there, I think their  algorithms were designed to specifically root out the conservatives and  what -- to blame it on the people who are hitting on the conservative sites  was outrageous in my opinion.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Are we headed toward regulations of the social media and big tech  organizations?  Because they are threatening to be arbiters of what is  tasteful, what is acceptable, what is appropriate, what is the standard for  discourse?  </p><p>BIGGS:  Well, I think the root of where we need to go is to determine who  owns the content.  I mean, first of all, they don't know whether a lot of  people are boxed or real people that they're trying to weed out, but beyond  that, we -- let's find out who really owns the content because if they own  the content, then they're liable for suppression, they're liable for  slander, they're liable for any of this.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there are two ways that the signals get set around the  worldwide web, one is by wire and the other is by air and the fact is, the  government of the United States, the people of the United States have  claimed them both.  Congressman, as always, great to see you, we appreciate  it.  Andy Biggs.</p><p>BIGGS:  Thanks, Lou.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you.  Up next, social media giants Twitter and Facebook  answering questions about why they silenced conservative voices and even  admit to dropping -- well, just failing to detect or act on Russian  election meddling.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, FACEBOOK:  Russia used social  media as part of and I quote, \"a comprehensive and multifaceted campaign to  set discord, undermine Democratic institutions and interfere in U.S.  election and those of our allies.  We were too slow to spot this and to  slow to act.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Mnemonic, don't you think?  We take it up after the break with  folks who are -- their minds are alive, Diamond and Silk, electric and  coming up next.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I can't wait to talk with Diamond and Silk about what is  going on in Washington and social media.  As Congress is -- well, they're - - in some cases hinting that they may want to regulate social media, big  tech, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey among those on Capitol Hill today talking  about his company silencing of conservative voices and his defense leaving  just a little to be desired. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DORSEY:  We don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives or party  affiliation in any of our policies or enforcement decisions.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The allegation that we made, the Republicans, is that  you're discriminatory against us, against the republicans.</p><p>DORSEY:  We agree that the result was not impartial and that is why we  corrected and we fixed it.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So do you agree that there were more Republicans than  Democrats?  </p><p>DORSEY:  I didn't say that but I do -- I do --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, you can't have it both ways, sir.  </p><p>DORSEY:  We don't always have the best methods to determine who is a  Republican, who is a Democrat or we have to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, usually it's known because we run as Republicans  or Democrats, that's not hard to identify.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Dorsey not impressing us certainly on this broadcast, investors  weren't too impressed either.  Twitter stock falling more than six percent  today.  Dorsey is going to have to up his game, we will see how that goes  from here.  Joining us now, social media super stars, President Trump  supporters, Diamond and Silk.  Great to have you here on a day in which  social media was, well, in the court of public opinion on Capitol Hill.</p><p>What did you make of Dorsey and his comments and Sandberg from Facebook,  her comments of the day, Diamond?  </p><p>LYNNETTE HARDAWAY, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITY:  Well, you know what, here is  the deal, you have the same people that go up to the Capitol Hill and they  just chat and they just talk, and they get nothing done, they say nothing  that will take and apiece the American people especially conservatives  that's being centered on their platform.  </p><p>ROCHELLE RICHARDSON, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITY:  That's right.  </p><p>HARDAWAY:  To think that you can influence, you can influence what we talk  about or what we socialize about on social media, that is dictatorship and  that is tyranny and that has got to stop.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you're exactly right because it is -- this is Soviet stuff,  talking about whether Facebook or Twitter, who -- whatever platform it  might be, they decide what can be said, they decide what will be an  acceptable expression, they become the arbiters of taste and judgment and  appropriate speech, go to hell. </p><p>HARDAWAY:  Absolutely.  </p><p>RICHARDSON:  You got that right.  And then they want to sit and talk about  that Russia as the one that's influencing the election.  It's these  platforms, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, the social media platforms  that is -- are the ones that's influencing this election because you know  what, I don't speak Russia, I speak English, I've never been to Russia and  I don't -- you know, if anybody said anything to me in Russia, I wouldn't  know what they're talking about.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's the social media platforms that's influencing this  election by silencing and censoring conservative lawyers.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Sandberg acknowledging that the -- they were slow to respond  at Facebook.  It turns out that the first collusion may have been on  Facebook with the Russians and they didn't react, they didn't bring in  authorities from the, you know, from our intelligence agencies, Twitter,  you know, I couldn't understand what Dorsey was even trying to say, he  wanted to be the guy who decides whether or not conservatives have a voice.</p><p>But then he said he couldn't tell which is which, it got really kind of  ambiguous for him, could you straighten him out on that, Diamond?</p><p>HARDAWAY:  Well, first of all, he's not the arbitrator of truth.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  So to think that he can influence but he's not the school, he's  not the school of speech, this is free speech that we're talking about  being stifled. </p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.  </p><p>HARDAWAY:  This is conservative free speech.  And what they did, the  pretext of all of these here is algorithms that they put in place to  silence conservative voices.  If you say the word Trump, you're silenced,  if you say anything patriotic, stand for the flag or anything about god,  you are silenced.  If you are a conservative, you are being silenced on the  social media of platforms because they want to act like they are the  arbitrators of truth and they nothing but liars and really thieves.  Yes,  lairs and thieves.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Diamond and Silk, it's great to have you here.  We thank you,  I want to apologize for swearing, my wife is going to chastise me strongly  after the broadcast I'm sure.  Forgive me and we're delight to see you, all  the best.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>HARDAWAY:  Thank you so much.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Thank you for having us.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Be sure to check out Diamond and Silk's chitchat tour, their next  stop is October 7 in Marietta, Georgia.  Nike launching its controversial  ad campaign featuring NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.  Tomorrow Nike will  run its ad on the NFL'S season opener but the social justice warriors and  newly self-proclaimed at Nike have a -- well, something of a spotty history  when it comes to social justice and the American worker.</p><p>Nike, it turns out -- are you ready?  Has 127 footwear factories located in  15 countries.  Well, Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufacturing 94 percent  of Nike footwear.  Also, Nike has 363 apparel factories.  They're in 37  countries and make 52 percent of Nike apparel in China, Vietnam and  Thailand.  That's right, not Ohio, not Oklahoma, not in Oregon, by the way,  let's don't forget.</p><p>Nike is the same company that put a New York screen printing company out of  business and shipped T-shirt printing and production from a factory in New  York to Honduras just three years ago.  That resulted in the loss of 85  American jobs, 1700 laid off last year, so much for social warrior footwear  company or wearing at least at the margin about American workers.  Odd, but  they're claiming and what they're actually doing.  Nike raising our  consciousness.</p><p>Be sure to vote on our poll tonight, the question is do you think \"The New  York Times\" anonymous op-ed is merely further evidence that President Trump  is right when he calls the national left-wing media fake news? Cast your  vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on  Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Up next, a new call for  President Trump to declassify FISA documents.</p><p>And further expose the systematic bias and efforts to subvert the  presidency of Donald J. Trump at the Justice Department and the FBI.  I'll  be joined by Gregg Jarrett right after this quick break.  Stay with us.   We're coming right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Key members of the House of Representatives will be calling on  President Trump tomorrow to declassify the Carter-Page FISA application and  notes from disgraced Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, Freedom Caucus  Chair, Mark Meadows along with Congressman Jim Jordan, Matt Gaetz, and Lee  Zeldin say, they will make that formal request of the President tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us now to assess all of this and much more, Gregg Jarrett, a Fox  Legal Analyst and author of \"The New York Times\" best-selling book, The  Russia Hoax.  Great to have you here.  </p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX BUSINESS LEGAL ANALYST:  Good to be here, Lou.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Meadows and Jordan and Gaetz going over to -- and  Zeldin going over to the White House to talk to the President.</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  This, you know, for a example, Tom Fitton has been calling for  this, we've all been calling this for ages.  The President, why in your  judgment has he not already done it?  </p><p>JARRETT:  He's being misled by the intelligence community.  I suspect it's  not just the FBI director but the DNI, Dan Coats.  As well as others,  probably Rod Rosenstein, why?  Because first of all for the intelligence  community, they think when they order a pizza it's national security and  ought to be classified.  There's this mentality that everything they do is  so important.  It's got to be classified and that's nonsense.</p><p>Every time something is declassified we find out it shouldn't have been  classified to begin with and second of all, I think the FBI, Christopher  Wray is covering up the wrongdoing of his own bureau and these documents  will reveal a level of corruption that will stun most Americans and it'll  be largely exculpatory of the President.  </p><p>DOBBS:  People forget, some of the Congressmen have seen --</p><p>JARRETT:  Oh sure.  So they know what's in it.</p><p>DOBBS:  They know, they can make independent judgment and they can --</p><p>JARRETT:  And they have.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, they have and have made it very clear that it's B.S. what is  being peddled whether it's by the intelligence community whether it's being  his attorneys and his, you know, his political folks.  There is just no way  in the world this President needs to let this go any further, it has got to  stop, it's got to stop now.  </p><p>JARRETT:  The American public deserves to see what's in these documents.   They deserve to see the impropriety and I believe illegality perpetrated by  the FBI and the Department of Justice to target Trump to try to influence  the election and undo the results.  </p><p>DOBBS:  I think in your rack it is called so stipulated.  I mean, this has  been demonstrated evidence throughout.  We know what we're dealing with, a  corrupt leadership that's still entrenched in the FBI.  They have taken out  the top but they haven't taken out all of the -- of the corruption.  It's a  toxic agency.  </p><p>JARRETT:  It is.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And only perhaps a competitive with that agency is the Department  of Justice itself.  </p><p>JARRETT:  Absolutely.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And that's got to be fixed.  This is a president who is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- should be on Jeff Sessions who has been abysmal and derelict in  his duties as attorney general.  And now he has an opportunity to make  things happen irrespective of the willful resistance within his  administration.  </p><p>JARRETT:  Everybody in Washington and America at large knows that Jeff  Sessions is finished.  Jeff Sessions may not get it but he will right after  the elections.  But the perfect example is he's allowed Bruce Ohr of all  people to still be employed in the Department of Justice and we learned 10  days ago when when he implicated all of the people at the FBI who were  involved in elicit scheme including believe it or not, Andrew Weissmann,  the lead prosecutor in the Special Counsel Bob Mueller's investigation.</p><p>Which is now tainted and corrupted the integrity and credibility of that  investigation.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Which had none to begin with.  </p><p>JARRETT:  Exactly.  </p><p>DOBBS:  So stipulated.  </p><p>JARRETT:  So stipulated, counselor.  </p><p>DOBBS:  All right.  Thanks so much for being with us, Gregg.  Thank you.</p><p>JARRETT:  My pleasure.</p><p>DOBBS:  Gregg Jarrett.  And the book is \"The Russia Hoax.\"  Buy a couple  more copies, would you?  </p><p>JARRETT:  Buy 10.</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, this guy has got to think at some point about his children.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>JARRETT:  Getting old.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, his retirement as well, we'll throw that in.  Up next, the  resistance making its way inside the White House, that's what an op-ed in  \"The New York Times\" by an anonymous, anonymous author would have -- \"The  New York Times\" would have you believe.  Oh.  Wow.  That's pretty bad.   We'll take up that so called senior official in the Trump administration.  </p><p>Yale professor Paul Bracken joins us.  We're going to take up a lot of  issues within as we continue here tonight.  Stay with us, we'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The left wing \"New York Times\", I know that's partly Redundant  elevating its ideological fervour and that's kind -- a very kind way to  call it what it is.  Publishing not just an anonymous quote but an entire  anonymous op-ed from an alleged member of the administration who bashed the  president, and that's not allegedly that's definitively.  If this is just  the latest escalation in the fourth estates assault on President Trump.   And no one -- no one should take seriously the claim that the author of  this anonymous op-ed is truly a senior administration official.  President  Trump addressed the op-ed during the White House event this very afternoon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Yes, the sheriffs can  imagine this, we have somebody in what I call the failing \"New York Times\",  that's talking about he's part of the resistance within the Trump  administration.  This is what we have to deal with.  And you know, the  dishonest media because you people deal with it as well as I do but it's  really a disgrace.  I will say this, nobody has done what this  administration has done in terms of getting things passed and getting  things through.</p><p>When you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration  probably who's failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons now.   And \"The New York Times\" is failing.  If I weren't here, I believe \"The New  York Times\" probably wouldn't even exist.  And someday, (INAUDIBLE) and  someday when I'm not president, which hopefully will be in about 6-1/2  years from now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: \"The \"New York Times\"\" and CNN and all of these phony media outlets  will be out of business folks, they'll be out of business.  Because  there'll be nothing to write and there'll be nothing of interest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well the president is absolutely correct when he suggests that the  copy won't be quite as elevated or exciting when he finally leaves the  presidency.</p><p>Joining us tonight Paul Bracken, he's a member of the Council on Foreign  Relations, he's professor of political science and business at Yale  University.  A great American, it's great to have you here.</p><p>PAUL BRACKEN, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND BUSINESS, YALE UNIVERSITY:   Good to be here.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with the President and this anonymous quote by some  worm that allegedly is in the -- who is allegedly a part of the  administration.  Your thoughts about where the \"New York Times\" is.</p><p>BRACKEN:  My thoughts are this, first of all, the \"The New York Times\"  would have vetted this very carefully about who it is.  So, I don't have  any doubts about that.  My feeling is yet another example of partisan  politics run riot, it's the way I would put it.  DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  It's happening everywhere and it's not good for the democracy.  I  don't think it's good for U.S. security overseas.  It can tempt people to  think the wrong things about that we have a weak government.</p><p>And I was shocked that the individual in question would not resign and put  it out there under his own name.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, I wasn't surprised.  Anyone who would betray the man they work  for this president of the United States, is a delusional ego maniacal,  self-aggrandizing jackass.  I don't see any other way to call it.  I would  think that that person would I hope stand out clearly amongst the top  officials of the administration.</p><p>BRACKEN:  See, this is not like that you work for a big business.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  And you don't agree with the CEO or something like that.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right, it's national security.</p><p>BRACKEN:  This is -- this is you work for the United States government and  you worked with the Constitution.  And if you really don't agree with it,  you should be in there and you have special obligations that are far larger  than people who work at most kinds of organizations.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, this would also be a call.  This would also be a call to the  deep state, whether it's in the FBI.  We've seen the corruption that is  rampant in its leadership, the Department of Justice.  All of those people  should be walking out the door because they are appalling in their  disloyalty.  The ignorance of their conduct, the political corruption that  they have with which they've stained those that Department and that agency.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Well, the way I would put it is that we have made it much easier  to impeach the next president whoever it is after this one.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  We are lowering the bar here and we are going to suffer for the  sins of both parties but especially in recent times.  It is not good for  the strength of this country and a lot of other things going well on the  economic front and the foreign policy front.  And but on the political  front, they're not.</p><p>DOBBS:  This president is his successes to this point in time in his  administration are unprecedented in the modern era, am I correct?</p><p>BRACKEN:  You are correct.  The one that gets me is the charge that he's  drawn to authoritarian governments like Russia and China, which belies the  fact that he's -- he has launched the largest nuclear build up, it's going  to add thousands of hydrogen bombs aimed at Russia and China.  I do not see  this is coddling the Russians.</p><p>DOBBS:  Nor do I.</p><p>BRACKEN:  And the Russians do not see it that way.  I was just in Russia as  you know.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  And talking to a lot of officials there, they are absolutely  stunned at the thought that we believe that they could hack the U.S.  election and make a difference.  They can't do anything right in their own  country and they're stunned to think that we think they won our election,  they tilted it.</p><p>DOBBS:  Folks have a -- should have a pretty good insight into Russian  government just by the historical facts that is in 1991 with the collapse  of the Soviet Union and Marxist Leninist.  I mean, the country is  struggling now not just because of the sanctions, although there are a  tremendous burden.  But because the country has yet to embrace markets and  --</p><p>BRACKEN:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- to achieve its potential.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Their backward technologically.  There is no Silicon Valley in  Russia, they've tried to sort it several times.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  The Ruble is collapsing.  The biggest thing I -- you know what I  and people talk about in Russia, it wasn't hacking the election, it wasn't  Donald Trump, they are extremely upset because the Ruble is going down so  much.</p><p>DOBBS:  Sure.</p><p>BRACKEN:  That they can't take their vacations on the Riviera this year.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  That's what the Russians I spoke to were really upset about.</p><p>DOBBS:  They're upset about that, they're also obviously very interested in  reclaiming at least full power in the Atlantic.  The United States now  creating a countervailing Atlantic Fleet to the force that already the  Russians have put into the Atlantic.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Well, we've done a lot in the last few years.  We've got some  very interesting military technologies.  And there are now NATO battalions  in the three Baltic countries.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  They would have to kill NATO troops if they come in and invade.   And that gets them into a ball game that they do not want to get into.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the reason they're there in large measure is because Estonia  that the Baltic -- the Baltic are without question historically they've had  enough of Russian invasion.</p><p>BRACKEN:  That's an understatement.  Yes, they do not like the Russians.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, we like you and we're delighted that you have taken time to  join us.  Hope you'll be back with us soon.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Thanks professor.  Appreciate it, Paul Bracken.</p><p>In other headlines tonight, more than 500 passengers aboard an aircraft  from Dubai had to be screened by health officials.

Taking an unpatriotic and disgraceful  stance against police officers across the country who risk their lives  every single day.  Since 2014, there have been 212 police officers killed  across the country in the line of duty.  And in some of our largest cities  such as Chicago.  Black lives don't seem to matter of the 382 people killed  in Chicago this year.  308 of them African-American.  This is the same city  that is now begging for a larger more engaged police force.  But continues  to vote for failed leaders like the outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel who after  promising to hire a thousand new police officers in 2016 has brought in  just about 600.</p><p>Instead of looking to a failed NFL quarterback who sacrificed a few million  dollars to take a knee during our national anthem.

The president tweeted this just minutes  ago.  This is the president's tweet, does the so-called senior  administration official really exist or is it just the failing New York  Times with another phony source?

Well, joining us tonight, I am pleased to tell you is  David Kaplan he's former legal affairs editor for Newsweek.  Author of the  new book The Most Dangerous Branch: Inside The Supreme Courts Assault On  The Constitution.  David, great to have you with us.</p><p>DAVID KAPLAN, AUTHOR, THE MOST DANGEROUS BRANCH:  Good to be with you.</p><p>DOBBS:  I want to first show folks a picture of the two of us in Fortune  Magazine.</p><p>KAPLAN:  No.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, we got that please.  One, two, three.  I did it on three.  I  timely (INAUDIBLE) here.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Fake armrest.</p><p>DOBBS:  That was fake?</p><p>KAPLAN:  It looks real.</p><p>DOBBS:  I was working like heck to just stay a parody there.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, what do you think of the sweater David?</p><p>KAPLAN:  It's a lot nicer than my sport jacket.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, that's us.  What year was that?  90?  </p><p>KAPLAN:  I think that was like 2010.</p><p>DOBBS:  That's what I said 2010.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Once upon a time.</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it.  It seemed like 93 to me but there it is.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Who won that match?</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you and I both can claim it.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Yes, I think I probably let you win.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, thank you -- thank you.  I'm sure that I deferred.  But I do - -</p><p>KAPLAN:  We do that to most of the people we wrote about it Newsweek and  fortune.</p><p>DOBBS:  You got it -- you got it.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's great to have you here.  Congratulations on the book.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  It couldn't be more timely and judge Brett Kavanaugh.  I'm watching  these hearings and I honestly have never seen anything like it.  This is --</p><p>KAPLAN:  Sure you have, last year.</p><p>DOBBS:  No.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Except for the protest, fair enough.</p><p>DOBBS:  This is -- this is venomous.  76 people arrested in two days.  This  is -- the Dimms are putting on a show that it looks to me like it's  politically suicidal.</p><p>KAPLAN:  I don't know how it's going to play politically but it's  predictable.  It's illogical -- it's a logical extension of where hearings  have been going for 20 years.  And if Hillary Clinton was president and she  had put up a nominee, I think you'd see Republicans misbehaving.  Neither  side has a claim to good behavior.</p><p>But in the first instance -- in the first instance, the problem with these  hearings isn't senators, it's not even presidents.  It's the Supreme Court.   They're complicit in this because by issuing rulings on so many  controversial issues they raise the stakes of being on the Supreme Court.   And you're seeing that play out now.</p><p>DOBBS:  Now you argue in your book that the Supreme Court has overreached  and it's -- that's an understatement in its rulings.  Which is to you the  most egregious, which is the most profound in its impact.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Well, you know, choosing among bad rulings is like deciding which  of your children you love most.  But I think if I had to choose Bush v.  Gore in 2000.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Was the most egregious but I criticized Roe v. Wade.  I criticized  the campaign-finance ruling as citizens united the gun control ruling and I  criticized the gay marriage decision.  There's plenty of criticism on left  and right.  So, there's plenty in the book for both sides to like or to  hate.</p><p>DOBBS:  So, we have to turn to The Most Dangerous Branch.  We recommend the  book to you highly by David Kaplan.  You're fair and balanced and you're an  equal-opportunity -- well, sceptic of both in a detractor of both.  The  Gore v. --</p><p>KAPLAN:  Bush v. Gore.</p><p>DOBBS:  Bush v. -- I knew I had it backwards, Bush v. Gore.</p><p>KAPLAN:  They're easily confused.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, they are.  They were actually -- they were a little more alike  than we would like to think I think.  The idea that you don't like that  hurts me, because I thought we were friends and that you would  automatically signed with Bush.  You obviously chosen a separate path.</p><p>KAPLAN:  But we're -- it's between friends.  But the mistake I fear Lou  that you're making is confusing criticism of the court's decision to  intervene at all --</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>KAPLAN:  -- with the outcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>KAPLAN:  To the extent for example that I criticize Roe v. Wade, it's not  because I disagree with the outcome.  Politically, I'm liberal.  I believe  in very liberalized abortion laws.  I don't think though that victory  should be achieved in court, I think it should be achieved in Congress or  in state legislatures similarly, whether you wanted Bush or Gore to win.   The victory was best one in Congress because that's what the Constitution  provided for in the case of a disputed presidential election.  Instead,  both sides went to court to achieve victory and that's what I criticize.</p><p>DOBBS:  As you have studied this and written about it over two years --  written about it over two years to produce the book.  Is there a point at  which you think that the court can be either be righted or right itself?</p><p>KAPLAN:  I'm not optimistic, what you're seeing playing out in the  Kavanaugh hearings is an indication of how bad things have become.  But I  think the best hope lies not with presidents or senators but with the court  itself.  The courts going to have to learn to restrain itself.</p><p>DOBBS:  David Kaplan, again, congratulations.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Great to see you.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Good to see you.  We're not going to arm-wrestle here.  All right,  next time.</p><p>DOBBS:  I got to have a couple of more days in the weight room.</p><p>Up next President Trump mulling whether or not he should declassified  documents at the heart of the Mueller never-ending witch-hunt.  We'll have  the latest when we come back.</p><p>This is the book, \"The Most Dangerous, Dangerous Branch,\" David Kaplan.  We  recommend it to you.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END </p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Our top  stories, day two of the Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the  radical Dems still trying to disrupt and delay those hearings in spite of  the outrageous ignorant conduct of the committee Dems and leftist  protestors, President Trump's high court nominee handling their ignorance  with grace and constraint. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I've watched his remarks,  I've watched his performance, I've watched his statements and honestly  they've been totally brilliant.  I think that the other side is grasping at  straws and really the other side should embrace it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  Embrace it.  We'll take up the latest on those hearings tonight,  Congressman Andy Biggs among our guest.  Also Fox Legal Analyst, Gregg  Jarrett.  Also, social media executives embarrassingly unprepared on  Capitol Hill exposing themselves as unable, unwilling to address election  meddling issues and acknowledge their political bias.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> PATRICK DORSEY, FOUNDER AND CEO, TWITTER:  We found ourselves unprepared  and ill-equipped for the immensity of the problems that we've acknowledged.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  As for Google, didn't even show up, leaving lawmakers staring at  empty an chair and perhaps -- just perhaps dreaming of ways to bring Google  to heel.  We take that up tonight with conservative social media starts,  Diamond and Silk.  And \"The New York Times\" taking fake news to the next  level from anonymous sources to entire anonymous op-eds with anonymous  quotes thrown in.</p><p> The President isn't too impressed by either \"The Times\" or the gutless  wonder anonymous op-ed author. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  If the failing \"New York Times\" has an anonymous editorial, can you  believe it?  Anonymous, meaning gutless, a gutless editorial, we're doing a  great job, the poll numbers are through the roof, our poll numbers are  great and guess what, nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  We'll have more on the cowardly self-proclaimed senior official  little worm who chose to betray and to attack the President that is if you  believe the Times' claim about any of this.  Our top story, the  confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh still  underway despite Dems spewing ignorance and vitriol all over the hearing  room above it all Kavanaugh who makes his little effusion inquisitors from  the left look ever smaller.</p><p>Fox News Chief Legal Correspondent and Anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" Shannon  Bream joining us from Capitol Hill with the latest.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP:  I've watched his performance, I've watched his statements and  honestly they've been totally brilliant.  </p><p> SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  President Trump praising his second Supreme  Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh as the judge continues to run a gauntlet  marked by protestors.  And Senators still jousting over document  production.  </p><p> SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), VERMONT:  I would ask the chairman if he might look  at some of these remarked committee confidential.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let me answer that for you, if you're interested in it,  you could have been asking ever since August the 25th, I believe.  </p><p> BREAM:  Today's question centering on guns.  </p><p> SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-), CALIFORNIA:  I never thought this would happen  in our country that someone would bring a semiautomatic assault weapon into  a school and just mow down children and staff.  And so I've been very  interested in your thinking on assault weapons.  </p><p> BREAM:  Abortion.  </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I mean, you just can't -- what  are you -- what are you doing for lunch, let's overrule Roe v. Wade, it  doesn't work that way, right? </p><p> BREAM:  And on this evolution regarding whether a sitting President should  be subjected to criminal and civil investigations while in office.  As a  member of Ken Starr's team, he advocated for aggressively questioning then- President Bill Clinton and helped to write a Starr report, outlining the  grounds for Clinton's eventual impeachment.  Years later he authored a law  review article questioning the wisdom of subjecting sitting Presidents to  invasive investigations.</p><p> While noting Congress holds the ultimate remedy, impeachment.  </p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  What changed was September 11th.   That's what's changed.  President Bush said this will not happen again and  he was a single-minded focus every morning for the next seven years for  President Bush was still September 12th, 2001.  </p><p> BREAM:  And at Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White House post 9/11 that  sparked numerous questions about whether he was involved in crafting  warrantless surveillance programs or enhanced interrogation policies and  the legal memos used to justify them.  </p><p> KAVANAUGH:  I was not read into that program, not involved in crafting that  program nor crafting the legal justifications for that program.  </p><p> BREAM:  Also today spectators got a glimpse of human side of the nominee  who -- when asked how he'd like to be remembered as good dad and judge and  then paused.  </p><p> FEINSTEIN:  Good husband.  </p><p> GRAHAM:  I think he's getting there.  </p><p> KAVANAUGH:  Good husband.</p><p> GARAHAM:  Thanks, Dianne, you helped him a lot.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BREAM:  Late in the day, Democratic Senator Dick Blumenthal asked the  nominee to commit to recusing himself from any civil or criminal case  involving the President that would come before him as justice, he  repeatedly declined.  Lou?</p><p> DOBBS:  Shannon, thank you.  Shannon Bream.  Joining us tonight, Republican  Congressman Andy Biggs, he is a member of House Judiciary Committee and the  Freedom Caucus.  Congressman, good to have you with us.  Your impression of  the conduct of the Dems on the Senate Judiciary Committee over two days.  </p><p> REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA:  Well, I'm kind of embarrassed for them.  I  mean, I watched for instance Mr. Durbin -- Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy  asked questions and quite frankly they're fishing and I will just tell you,  Judge Kavanaugh made them look so inept and unable to even understand that  they were -- they were looking inept.  So, not only is he far more  brilliant, far more articulate.</p><p> He's got an encyclopedic memory, he's gracious about embarrassing the  Democrats in such a way that they don't even realize how small they are  compared to him.  </p><p> BREAM:  I think you have expressed exactly -- when I listened to Kamala  Harris and Dick Durbin, frankly some of the Republicans as they try to stay  up with him, it was a very -- it was very revealing both as to their  capacity and the -- and the nominee's extraordinary talent and intellect as  you say.  Let's turn to where we go from here.  Are we are going to see  this nominee be approved and be ready for the fall term on the Supreme  Court?  </p><p> BIGGS:  My understanding is that they're going wrap this thing up sometime  mid to late September and that he will be confirmed and that he'll be  sitting there for the October session and that's my hope.  I mean, look,  this guy is really talented.  He is really a brilliant jurist, great --  just a great man.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Yes.  You know, this nominee Kavanaugh and sitting on the court,  the President's other nominee, Neil Gorsuch, I mean, these are -- these are  world-class intellects and legal minds, it's  wonderful to behold.  Let's  turn now to social media.  We had a couple of folks show up to talk about  their bias and what they were doing with Russian meddling and frankly smart  people, they seem to have a lot of trouble with the language.  </p><p> BIGGS:  Well, you know, they really do, Lou.  And here's the part I love  about it.  I mean, speaking of anonymous things that have gone on today,  yes, they're saying, well, this happened for liberals too, well, can you  name some?  Well, no, we can't.  We're not going the name some.  The reason  is because I can name people, I can name organizations right now who I know  were -- had this prejudice against and they were censored but -- and I'll  name them.</p><p> But they won't even do that because I don't think it's there, I think their  algorithms were designed to specifically root out the conservatives and  what -- to blame it on the people who are hitting on the conservative sites  was outrageous in my opinion.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Are we headed toward regulations of the social media and big tech  organizations?  Because they are threatening to be arbiters of what is  tasteful, what is acceptable, what is appropriate, what is the standard for  discourse?  </p><p> BIGGS:  Well, I think the root of where we need to go is to determine who  owns the content.  I mean, first of all, they don't know whether a lot of  people are boxed or real people that they're trying to weed out, but beyond  that, we -- let's find out who really owns the content because if they own  the content, then they're liable for suppression, they're liable for  slander, they're liable for any of this.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, there are two ways that the signals get set around the  worldwide web, one is by wire and the other is by air and the fact is, the  government of the United States, the people of the United States have  claimed them both.  Congressman, as always, great to see you, we appreciate  it.  Andy Biggs.</p><p> BIGGS:  Thanks, Lou.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Thank you.  Up next, social media giants Twitter and Facebook  answering questions about why they silenced conservative voices and even  admit to dropping -- well, just failing to detect or act on Russian  election meddling.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHERYL SANDBERG, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, FACEBOOK:  Russia used social  media as part of and I quote, \"a comprehensive and multifaceted campaign to  set discord, undermine Democratic institutions and interfere in U.S.  election and those of our allies.  We were too slow to spot this and to  slow to act.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  Mnemonic, don't you think?  We take it up after the break with  folks who are -- their minds are alive, Diamond and Silk, electric and  coming up next.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, I can't wait to talk with Diamond and Silk about what is  going on in Washington and social media.  As Congress is -- well, they're - - in some cases hinting that they may want to regulate social media, big  tech, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey among those on Capitol Hill today talking  about his company silencing of conservative voices and his defense leaving  just a little to be desired. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DORSEY:  We don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives or party  affiliation in any of our policies or enforcement decisions.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The allegation that we made, the Republicans, is that  you're discriminatory against us, against the republicans.</p><p> DORSEY:  We agree that the result was not impartial and that is why we  corrected and we fixed it.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So do you agree that there were more Republicans than  Democrats?  </p><p> DORSEY:  I didn't say that but I do -- I do --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, you can't have it both ways, sir.  </p><p> DORSEY:  We don't always have the best methods to determine who is a  Republican, who is a Democrat or we have to --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, usually it's known because we run as Republicans  or Democrats, that's not hard to identify.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DOBBS:  Dorsey not impressing us certainly on this broadcast, investors  weren't too impressed either.  Twitter stock falling more than six percent  today.  Dorsey is going to have to up his game, we will see how that goes  from here.  Joining us now, social media super stars, President Trump  supporters, Diamond and Silk.  Great to have you here on a day in which  social media was, well, in the court of public opinion on Capitol Hill.</p><p> What did you make of Dorsey and his comments and Sandberg from Facebook,  her comments of the day, Diamond?  </p><p> LYNNETTE HARDAWAY, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITY:  Well, you know what, here is  the deal, you have the same people that go up to the Capitol Hill and they  just chat and they just talk, and they get nothing done, they say nothing  that will take and apiece the American people especially conservatives  that's being centered on their platform.  </p><p> ROCHELLE RICHARDSON, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITY:  That's right.  </p><p> HARDAWAY:  To think that you can influence, you can influence what we talk  about or what we socialize about on social media, that is dictatorship and  that is tyranny and that has got to stop.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, you're exactly right because it is -- this is Soviet stuff,  talking about whether Facebook or Twitter, who -- whatever platform it  might be, they decide what can be said, they decide what will be an  acceptable expression, they become the arbiters of taste and judgment and  appropriate speech, go to hell. </p><p> HARDAWAY:  Absolutely.  </p><p> RICHARDSON:  You got that right.  And then they want to sit and talk about  that Russia as the one that's influencing the election.  It's these  platforms, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, the social media platforms  that is -- are the ones that's influencing this election because you know  what, I don't speak Russia, I speak English, I've never been to Russia and  I don't -- you know, if anybody said anything to me in Russia, I wouldn't  know what they're talking about.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  It's the social media platforms that's influencing this  election by silencing and censoring conservative lawyers.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  That's right.</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, Sandberg acknowledging that the -- they were slow to respond  at Facebook.  It turns out that the first collusion may have been on  Facebook with the Russians and they didn't react, they didn't bring in  authorities from the, you know, from our intelligence agencies, Twitter,  you know, I couldn't understand what Dorsey was even trying to say, he  wanted to be the guy who decides whether or not conservatives have a voice.</p><p> But then he said he couldn't tell which is which, it got really kind of  ambiguous for him, could you straighten him out on that, Diamond?</p><p> HARDAWAY:  Well, first of all, he's not the arbitrator of truth.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> HARDAWAY:  So to think that he can influence but he's not the school, he's  not the school of speech, this is free speech that we're talking about  being stifled. </p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.  </p><p> HARDAWAY:  This is conservative free speech.  And what they did, the  pretext of all of these here is algorithms that they put in place to  silence conservative voices.  If you say the word Trump, you're silenced,  if you say anything patriotic, stand for the flag or anything about god,  you are silenced.  If you are a conservative, you are being silenced on the  social media of platforms because they want to act like they are the  arbitrators of truth and they nothing but liars and really thieves.  Yes,  lairs and thieves.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, Diamond and Silk, it's great to have you here.  We thank you,  I want to apologize for swearing, my wife is going to chastise me strongly  after the broadcast I'm sure.  Forgive me and we're delight to see you, all  the best.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> HARDAWAY:  Thank you so much.</p><p> RICHARDSON:  Thank you for having us.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Be sure to check out Diamond and Silk's chitchat tour, their next  stop is October 7 in Marietta, Georgia.  Nike launching its controversial  ad campaign featuring NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.  Tomorrow Nike will  run its ad on the NFL'S season opener but the social justice warriors and  newly self-proclaimed at Nike have a -- well, something of a spotty history  when it comes to social justice and the American worker.</p><p> Nike, it turns out -- are you ready?  Has 127 footwear factories located in  15 countries.  Well, Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufacturing 94 percent  of Nike footwear.  Also, Nike has 363 apparel factories.  They're in 37  countries and make 52 percent of Nike apparel in China, Vietnam and  Thailand.  That's right, not Ohio, not Oklahoma, not in Oregon, by the way,  let's don't forget.</p><p> Nike is the same company that put a New York screen printing company out of  business and shipped T-shirt printing and production from a factory in New  York to Honduras just three years ago.  That resulted in the loss of 85  American jobs, 1700 laid off last year, so much for social warrior footwear  company or wearing at least at the margin about American workers.  Odd, but  they're claiming and what they're actually doing.  Nike raising our  consciousness.</p><p> Be sure to vote on our poll tonight, the question is do you think \"The New  York Times\" anonymous op-ed is merely further evidence that President Trump  is right when he calls the national left-wing media fake news? Cast your  vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on  Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Up next, a new call for  President Trump to declassify FISA documents.</p><p> And further expose the systematic bias and efforts to subvert the  presidency of Donald J. Trump at the Justice Department and the FBI.  I'll  be joined by Gregg Jarrett right after this quick break.  Stay with us.   We're coming right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  Key members of the House of Representatives will be calling on  President Trump tomorrow to declassify the Carter-Page FISA application and  notes from disgraced Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, Freedom Caucus  Chair, Mark Meadows along with Congressman Jim Jordan, Matt Gaetz, and Lee  Zeldin say, they will make that formal request of the President tomorrow.</p><p> Joining us now to assess all of this and much more, Gregg Jarrett, a Fox  Legal Analyst and author of \"The New York Times\" best-selling book, The  Russia Hoax.  Great to have you here.  </p><p> GREGG JARRETT, FOX BUSINESS LEGAL ANALYST:  Good to be here, Lou.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Let's start with Meadows and Jordan and Gaetz going over to -- and  Zeldin going over to the White House to talk to the President.</p><p> JARRETT:  Right.</p><p> DOBBS:  This, you know, for a example, Tom Fitton has been calling for  this, we've all been calling this for ages.  The President, why in your  judgment has he not already done it?  </p><p> JARRETT:  He's being misled by the intelligence community.  I suspect it's  not just the FBI director but the DNI, Dan Coats.  As well as others,  probably Rod Rosenstein, why?  Because first of all for the intelligence  community, they think when they order a pizza it's national security and  ought to be classified.  There's this mentality that everything they do is  so important.  It's got to be classified and that's nonsense.</p><p> Every time something is declassified we find out it shouldn't have been  classified to begin with and second of all, I think the FBI, Christopher  Wray is covering up the wrongdoing of his own bureau and these documents  will reveal a level of corruption that will stun most Americans and it'll  be largely exculpatory of the President.  </p><p> DOBBS:  People forget, some of the Congressmen have seen --</p><p> JARRETT:  Oh sure.  So they know what's in it.</p><p> DOBBS:  They know, they can make independent judgment and they can --</p><p> JARRETT:  And they have.</p><p> DOBBS:  Yes, they have and have made it very clear that it's B.S. what is  being peddled whether it's by the intelligence community whether it's being  his attorneys and his, you know, his political folks.  There is just no way  in the world this President needs to let this go any further, it has got to  stop, it's got to stop now.  </p><p> JARRETT:  The American public deserves to see what's in these documents.   They deserve to see the impropriety and I believe illegality perpetrated by  the FBI and the Department of Justice to target Trump to try to influence  the election and undo the results.  </p><p> DOBBS:  I think in your rack it is called so stipulated.  I mean, this has  been demonstrated evidence throughout.  We know what we're dealing with, a  corrupt leadership that's still entrenched in the FBI.  They have taken out  the top but they haven't taken out all of the -- of the corruption.  It's a  toxic agency.  </p><p> JARRETT:  It is.  </p><p> DOBBS:  And only perhaps a competitive with that agency is the Department  of Justice itself.  </p><p> JARRETT:  Absolutely.  </p><p> DOBBS:  And that's got to be fixed.  This is a president who is --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DOBBS:  -- should be on Jeff Sessions who has been abysmal and derelict in  his duties as attorney general.  And now he has an opportunity to make  things happen irrespective of the willful resistance within his  administration.  </p><p> JARRETT:  Everybody in Washington and America at large knows that Jeff  Sessions is finished.  Jeff Sessions may not get it but he will right after  the elections.  But the perfect example is he's allowed Bruce Ohr of all  people to still be employed in the Department of Justice and we learned 10  days ago when when he implicated all of the people at the FBI who were  involved in elicit scheme including believe it or not, Andrew Weissmann,  the lead prosecutor in the Special Counsel Bob Mueller's investigation.</p><p> Which is now tainted and corrupted the integrity and credibility of that  investigation.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Which had none to begin with.  </p><p> JARRETT:  Exactly.  </p><p> DOBBS:  So stipulated.  </p><p> JARRETT:  So stipulated, counselor.  </p><p> DOBBS:  All right.  Thanks so much for being with us, Gregg.  Thank you.</p><p> JARRETT:  My pleasure.</p><p> DOBBS:  Gregg Jarrett.  And the book is \"The Russia Hoax.\"  Buy a couple  more copies, would you?  </p><p> JARRETT:  Buy 10.</p><p> DOBBS:  I mean, this guy has got to think at some point about his children.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> JARRETT:  Getting old.  </p><p> DOBBS:  Well, his retirement as well, we'll throw that in.  Up next, the  resistance making its way inside the White House, that's what an op-ed in  \"The New York Times\" by an anonymous, anonymous author would have -- \"The  New York Times\" would have you believe.  Oh.  Wow.  That's pretty bad.   We'll take up that so called senior official in the Trump administration.  </p><p> Yale professor Paul Bracken joins us.  We're going to take up a lot of  issues within as we continue here tonight.  Stay with us, we'll be right  back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DOBBS:  The left wing \"New York Times\", I know that's partly Redundant  elevating its ideological fervour and that's kind -- a very kind way to  call it what it is.  Publishing not just an anonymous quote but an entire  anonymous op-ed from an alleged member of the administration who bashed the  president, and that's not allegedly that's definitively.  If this is just  the latest escalation in the fourth estates assault on President Trump.   And no one -- no one should take seriously the claim that the author of  this anonymous op-ed is truly a senior administration official.  President  Trump addressed the op-ed during the White House event this very afternoon.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Yes, the sheriffs can  imagine this, we have somebody in what I call the failing \"New York Times\",  that's talking about he's part of the resistance within the Trump  administration.  This is what we have to deal with.  And you know, the  dishonest media because you people deal with it as well as I do but it's  really a disgrace.  I will say this, nobody has done what this  administration has done in terms of getting things passed and getting  things through.</p><p> When you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration  probably who's failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons now.   And \"The New York Times\" is failing.  If I weren't here, I believe \"The New  York Times\" probably wouldn't even exist.  And someday, (INAUDIBLE) and  someday when I'm not president, which hopefully will be in about 6-1/2  years from now.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: \"The \"New York Times\"\" and CNN and all of these phony media outlets  will be out of business folks, they'll be out of business.  Because  there'll be nothing to write and there'll be nothing of interest.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOBBS:  Well the president is absolutely correct when he suggests that the  copy won't be quite as elevated or exciting when he finally leaves the  presidency.</p><p> Joining us tonight Paul Bracken, he's a member of the Council on Foreign  Relations, he's professor of political science and business at Yale  University.  A great American, it's great to have you here.</p><p> PAUL BRACKEN, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND BUSINESS, YALE UNIVERSITY:   Good to be here.</p><p> DOBBS:  Let's start with the President and this anonymous quote by some  worm that allegedly is in the -- who is allegedly a part of the  administration.  Your thoughts about where the \"New York Times\" is.</p><p> BRACKEN:  My thoughts are this, first of all, the \"The New York Times\"  would have vetted this very carefully about who it is.  So, I don't have  any doubts about that.  My feeling is yet another example of partisan  politics run riot, it's the way I would put it.  DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> BRACKEN:  It's happening everywhere and it's not good for the democracy.  I  don't think it's good for U.S. security overseas.  It can tempt people to  think the wrong things about that we have a weak government.</p><p> And I was shocked that the individual in question would not resign and put  it out there under his own name.</p><p> DOBBS:  Yes, I wasn't surprised.  Anyone who would betray the man they work  for this president of the United States, is a delusional ego maniacal,  self-aggrandizing jackass.  I don't see any other way to call it.  I would  think that that person would I hope stand out clearly amongst the top  officials of the administration.</p><p> BRACKEN:  See, this is not like that you work for a big business.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> BRACKEN:  And you don't agree with the CEO or something like that.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right, it's national security.</p><p> BRACKEN:  This is -- this is you work for the United States government and  you worked with the Constitution.  And if you really don't agree with it,  you should be in there and you have special obligations that are far larger  than people who work at most kinds of organizations.</p><p> DOBBS:  Yes, this would also be a call.  This would also be a call to the  deep state, whether it's in the FBI.  We've seen the corruption that is  rampant in its leadership, the Department of Justice.  All of those people  should be walking out the door because they are appalling in their  disloyalty.  The ignorance of their conduct, the political corruption that  they have with which they've stained those that Department and that agency.</p><p> BRACKEN:  Well, the way I would put it is that we have made it much easier  to impeach the next president whoever it is after this one.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> BRACKEN:  We are lowering the bar here and we are going to suffer for the  sins of both parties but especially in recent times.  It is not good for  the strength of this country and a lot of other things going well on the  economic front and the foreign policy front.  And but on the political  front, they're not.</p><p> DOBBS:  This president is his successes to this point in time in his  administration are unprecedented in the modern era, am I correct?</p><p> BRACKEN:  You are correct.  The one that gets me is the charge that he's  drawn to authoritarian governments like Russia and China, which belies the  fact that he's -- he has launched the largest nuclear build up, it's going  to add thousands of hydrogen bombs aimed at Russia and China.  I do not see  this is coddling the Russians.</p><p> DOBBS:  Nor do I.</p><p> BRACKEN:  And the Russians do not see it that way.  I was just in Russia as  you know.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> BRACKEN:  And talking to a lot of officials there, they are absolutely  stunned at the thought that we believe that they could hack the U.S.  election and make a difference.  They can't do anything right in their own  country and they're stunned to think that we think they won our election,  they tilted it.</p><p> DOBBS:  Folks have a -- should have a pretty good insight into Russian  government just by the historical facts that is in 1991 with the collapse  of the Soviet Union and Marxist Leninist.  I mean, the country is  struggling now not just because of the sanctions, although there are a  tremendous burden.  But because the country has yet to embrace markets and  --</p><p> BRACKEN:  Right.</p><p> DOBBS:  -- to achieve its potential.</p><p> BRACKEN:  Their backward technologically.  There is no Silicon Valley in  Russia, they've tried to sort it several times.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> BRACKEN:  The Ruble is collapsing.  The biggest thing I -- you know what I  and people talk about in Russia, it wasn't hacking the election, it wasn't  Donald Trump, they are extremely upset because the Ruble is going down so  much.</p><p> DOBBS:  Sure.</p><p> BRACKEN:  That they can't take their vacations on the Riviera this year.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> BRACKEN:  That's what the Russians I spoke to were really upset about.</p><p> DOBBS:  They're upset about that, they're also obviously very interested in  reclaiming at least full power in the Atlantic.  The United States now  creating a countervailing Atlantic Fleet to the force that already the  Russians have put into the Atlantic.</p><p> BRACKEN:  Well, we've done a lot in the last few years.  We've got some  very interesting military technologies.  And there are now NATO battalions  in the three Baltic countries.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> BRACKEN:  They would have to kill NATO troops if they come in and invade.   And that gets them into a ball game that they do not want to get into.</p><p> DOBBS:  And the reason they're there in large measure is because Estonia  that the Baltic -- the Baltic are without question historically they've had  enough of Russian invasion.</p><p> BRACKEN:  That's an understatement.  Yes, they do not like the Russians.</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, we like you and we're delighted that you have taken time to  join us.  Hope you'll be back with us soon.</p><p> BRACKEN:  Thank you.</p><p> DOBBS:  Thanks professor.  Appreciate it, Paul Bracken.</p><p> In other headlines tonight, more than 500 passengers aboard an aircraft  from Dubai had to be screened by health officials.

Taking an unpatriotic and disgraceful  stance against police officers across the country who risk their lives  every single day.  Since 2014, there have been 212 police officers killed  across the country in the line of duty.  And in some of our largest cities  such as Chicago.  Black lives don't seem to matter of the 382 people killed  in Chicago this year.  308 of them African-American.  This is the same city  that is now begging for a larger more engaged police force.

The president tweeted this just minutes  ago.  This is the president's tweet, does the so-called senior  administration official really exist or is it just the failing New York  Times with another phony source?

Well, joining us tonight, I am pleased to tell you is  David Kaplan he's former legal affairs editor for Newsweek.  Author of the  new book The Most Dangerous Branch: Inside The Supreme Courts Assault On  The Constitution.  David, great to have you with us.</p><p> DAVID KAPLAN, AUTHOR, THE MOST DANGEROUS BRANCH:  Good to be with you.</p><p> DOBBS:  I want to first show folks a picture of the two of us in Fortune  Magazine.</p><p> KAPLAN:  No.</p><p> DOBBS:  Yes, we got that please.  One, two, three.  I did it on three.  I  timely (INAUDIBLE) here.</p><p> KAPLAN:  Fake armrest.</p><p> DOBBS:  That was fake?</p><p> KAPLAN:  It looks real.</p><p> DOBBS:  I was working like heck to just stay a parody there.</p><p> KAPLAN:  Yes.</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, what do you think of the sweater David?</p><p> KAPLAN:  It's a lot nicer than my sport jacket.</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, that's us.  What year was that?  90?  </p><p> KAPLAN:  I think that was like 2010.</p><p> DOBBS:  That's what I said 2010.</p><p> KAPLAN:  Once upon a time.</p><p> DOBBS:  That's it.  It seemed like 93 to me but there it is.</p><p> KAPLAN:  Who won that match?</p><p> DOBBS:  Well, you and I both can claim it.</p><p> KAPLAN:  Yes, I think I probably let you win.</p><p> DOBBS:  Yes, thank you -- thank you.  I'm sure that I deferred.  But I do - -</p><p> KAPLAN:  We do that to most of the people we wrote about it Newsweek and  fortune.</p><p> DOBBS:  You got it -- you got it.</p><p> DOBBS:  It's great to have you here.  Congratulations on the book.</p><p> KAPLAN:  Thank you.</p><p> DOBBS:  It couldn't be more timely and judge Brett Kavanaugh.  I'm watching  these hearings and I honestly have never seen anything like it.  This is --</p><p> KAPLAN:  Sure you have, last year.</p><p> DOBBS:  No.</p><p> KAPLAN:  Except for the protest, fair enough.</p><p> DOBBS:  This is -- this is venomous.  76 people arrested in two days.  This  is -- the Dimms are putting on a show that it looks to me like it's  politically suicidal.</p><p> KAPLAN:  I don't know how it's going to play politically but it's  predictable.  It's illogical -- it's a logical extension of where hearings  have been going for 20 years.  And if Hillary Clinton was president and she  had put up a nominee, I think you'd see Republicans misbehaving.  Neither  side has a claim to good behavior.</p><p> But in the first instance -- in the first instance, the problem with these  hearings isn't senators, it's not even presidents.  It's the Supreme Court.   They're complicit in this because by issuing rulings on so many  controversial issues they raise the stakes of being on the Supreme Court.   And you're seeing that play out now.</p><p> DOBBS:  Now you argue in your book that the Supreme Court has overreached  and it's -- that's an understatement in its rulings.  Which is to you the  most egregious, which is the most profound in its impact.</p><p> KAPLAN:  Well, you know, choosing among bad rulings is like deciding which  of your children you love most.  But I think if I had to choose Bush v.  Gore in 2000.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> KAPLAN:  Was the most egregious but I criticized Roe v. Wade.  I criticized  the campaign-finance ruling as citizens united the gun control ruling and I  criticized the gay marriage decision.  There's plenty of criticism on left  and right.  So, there's plenty in the book for both sides to like or to  hate.</p><p> DOBBS:  So, we have to turn to The Most Dangerous Branch.  We recommend the  book to you highly by David Kaplan.  You're fair and balanced and you're an  equal-opportunity -- well, sceptic of both in a detractor of both.  The  Gore v. --</p><p> KAPLAN:  Bush v. Gore.</p><p> DOBBS:  Bush v. -- I knew I had it backwards, Bush v. Gore.</p><p> KAPLAN:  They're easily confused.</p><p> DOBBS:  Yes, they are.  They were actually -- they were a little more alike  than we would like to think I think.  The idea that you don't like that  hurts me, because I thought we were friends and that you would  automatically signed with Bush.  You obviously chosen a separate path.</p><p> KAPLAN:  But we're -- it's between friends.  But the mistake I fear Lou  that you're making is confusing criticism of the court's decision to  intervene at all --</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> KAPLAN:  -- with the outcome.</p><p> DOBBS:  Right.</p><p> KAPLAN:  To the extent for example that I criticize Roe v. Wade, it's not  because I disagree with the outcome.  Politically, I'm liberal.  I believe  in very liberalized abortion laws.  I don't think though that victory  should be achieved in court, I think it should be achieved in Congress or  in state legislatures similarly, whether you wanted Bush or Gore to win.   The victory was best one in Congress because that's what the Constitution  provided for in the case of a disputed presidential election.  Instead,  both sides went to court to achieve victory and that's what I criticize.</p><p> DOBBS:  As you have studied this and written about it over two years --  written about it over two years to produce the book.  Is there a point at  which you think that the court can be either be righted or right itself?</p><p> KAPLAN:  I'm not optimistic, what you're seeing playing out in the  Kavanaugh hearings is an indication of how bad things have become.  But I  think the best hope lies not with presidents or senators but with the court  itself.  The courts going to have to learn to restrain itself.</p><p> DOBBS:  David Kaplan, again, congratulations.</p><p> KAPLAN:  Thank you.</p><p> DOBBS:  Great to see you.</p><p> KAPLAN:  Good to see you.  We're not going to arm-wrestle here.  All right,  next time.</p><p> DOBBS:  I got to have a couple of more days in the weight room.</p><p> Up next President Trump mulling whether or not he should declassified  documents at the heart of the Mueller never-ending witch-hunt.  We'll have  the latest when we come back.</p><p> This is the book, \"The Most Dangerous, Dangerous Branch,\" David Kaplan.  We  recommend it to you.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> END </p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Years later he authored a law  review article questioning the wisdom of subjecting sitting Presidents to  invasive investigations.</p><p>While noting Congress holds the ultimate remedy, impeachment.  </p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  What changed was September 11th.   That's what's changed.  President Bush said this will not happen again and  he was a single-minded focus every morning for the next seven years for  President Bush was still September 12th, 2001.  </p><p>BREAM:  And at Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White House post 9/11 that  sparked numerous questions about whether he was involved in crafting  warrantless surveillance programs or enhanced interrogation policies and  the legal memos used to justify them.  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  I was not read into that program, not involved in crafting that  program nor crafting the legal justifications for that program.  </p><p>BREAM:  Also today spectators got a glimpse of human side of the nominee  who -- when asked how he'd like to be remembered as good dad and judge and  then paused.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN:  Good husband.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  I think he's getting there.  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  Good husband.</p><p>GARAHAM:  Thanks, Dianne, you helped him a lot.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BREAM:  Late in the day, Democratic Senator Dick Blumenthal asked the  nominee to commit to recusing himself from any civil or criminal case  involving the President that would come before him as justice, he  repeatedly declined.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Shannon, thank you.  Shannon Bream.  Joining us tonight, Republican  Congressman Andy Biggs, he is a member of House Judiciary Committee and the  Freedom Caucus.  Congressman, good to have you with us.  Your impression of  the conduct of the Dems on the Senate Judiciary Committee over two days.  </p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA:  Well, I'm kind of embarrassed for them.  I  mean, I watched for instance Mr. Durbin -- Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy  asked questions and quite frankly they're fishing and I will just tell you,  Judge Kavanaugh made them look so inept and unable to even understand that  they were -- they were looking inept.  So, not only is he far more  brilliant, far more articulate.</p><p>He's got an encyclopedic memory, he's gracious about embarrassing the  Democrats in such a way that they don't even realize how small they are  compared to him.  </p><p>BREAM:  I think you have expressed exactly -- when I listened to Kamala  Harris and Dick Durbin, frankly some of the Republicans as they try to stay  up with him, it was a very -- it was very revealing both as to their  capacity and the -- and the nominee's extraordinary talent and intellect as  you say.  Let's turn to where we go from here.  Are we are going to see  this nominee be approved and be ready for the fall term on the Supreme  Court?  </p><p>BIGGS:  My understanding is that they're going wrap this thing up sometime  mid to late September and that he will be confirmed and that he'll be  sitting there for the October session and that's my hope.  I mean, look,  this guy is really talented.  He is really a brilliant jurist, great --  just a great man.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  You know, this nominee Kavanaugh and sitting on the court,  the President's other nominee, Neil Gorsuch, I mean, these are -- these are  world-class intellects and legal minds, it's  wonderful to behold.  Let's  turn now to social media.  We had a couple of folks show up to talk about  their bias and what they were doing with Russian meddling and frankly smart  people, they seem to have a lot of trouble with the language.  </p><p>BIGGS:  Well, you know, they really do, Lou.  And here's the part I love  about it.  I mean, speaking of anonymous things that have gone on today,  yes, they're saying, well, this happened for liberals too, well, can you  name some?  Well, no, we can't.  We're not going the name some.  The reason  is because I can name people, I can name organizations right now who I know  were -- had this prejudice against and they were censored but -- and I'll  name them.</p><p>But they won't even do that because I don't think it's there, I think their  algorithms were designed to specifically root out the conservatives and  what -- to blame it on the people who are hitting on the conservative sites  was outrageous in my opinion.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Are we headed toward regulations of the social media and big tech  organizations?  Because they are threatening to be arbiters of what is  tasteful, what is acceptable, what is appropriate, what is the standard for  discourse?  </p><p>BIGGS:  Well, I think the root of where we need to go is to determine who  owns the content.  I mean, first of all, they don't know whether a lot of  people are boxed or real people that they're trying to weed out, but beyond  that, we -- let's find out who really owns the content because if they own  the content, then they're liable for suppression, they're liable for  slander, they're liable for any of this.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there are two ways that the signals get set around the  worldwide web, one is by wire and the other is by air and the fact is, the  government of the United States, the people of the United States have  claimed them both.  Congressman, as always, great to see you, we appreciate  it.  Andy Biggs.</p><p>BIGGS:  Thanks, Lou.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Thank you.  Up next, social media giants Twitter and Facebook  answering questions about why they silenced conservative voices and even  admit to dropping -- well, just failing to detect or act on Russian  election meddling.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, FACEBOOK:  Russia used social  media as part of and I quote, \"a comprehensive and multifaceted campaign to  set discord, undermine Democratic institutions and interfere in U.S.  election and those of our allies.  We were too slow to spot this and to  slow to act.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Mnemonic, don't you think?  We take it up after the break with  folks who are -- their minds are alive, Diamond and Silk, electric and  coming up next.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I can't wait to talk with Diamond and Silk about what is  going on in Washington and social media.  As Congress is -- well, they're - - in some cases hinting that they may want to regulate social media, big  tech, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey among those on Capitol Hill today talking  about his company silencing of conservative voices and his defense leaving  just a little to be desired. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DORSEY:  We don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives or party  affiliation in any of our policies or enforcement decisions.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The allegation that we made, the Republicans, is that  you're discriminatory against us, against the republicans.</p><p>DORSEY:  We agree that the result was not impartial and that is why we  corrected and we fixed it.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So do you agree that there were more Republicans than  Democrats?  </p><p>DORSEY:  I didn't say that but I do -- I do --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, you can't have it both ways, sir.  </p><p>DORSEY:  We don't always have the best methods to determine who is a  Republican, who is a Democrat or we have to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, usually it's known because we run as Republicans  or Democrats, that's not hard to identify.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOBBS:  Dorsey not impressing us certainly on this broadcast, investors  weren't too impressed either.  Twitter stock falling more than six percent  today.  Dorsey is going to have to up his game, we will see how that goes  from here.  Joining us now, social media super stars, President Trump  supporters, Diamond and Silk.  Great to have you here on a day in which  social media was, well, in the court of public opinion on Capitol Hill.</p><p>What did you make of Dorsey and his comments and Sandberg from Facebook,  her comments of the day, Diamond?  </p><p>LYNNETTE HARDAWAY, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITY:  Well, you know what, here is  the deal, you have the same people that go up to the Capitol Hill and they  just chat and they just talk, and they get nothing done, they say nothing  that will take and apiece the American people especially conservatives  that's being centered on their platform.  </p><p>ROCHELLE RICHARDSON, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSONALITY:  That's right.  </p><p>HARDAWAY:  To think that you can influence, you can influence what we talk  about or what we socialize about on social media, that is dictatorship and  that is tyranny and that has got to stop.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you're exactly right because it is -- this is Soviet stuff,  talking about whether Facebook or Twitter, who -- whatever platform it  might be, they decide what can be said, they decide what will be an  acceptable expression, they become the arbiters of taste and judgment and  appropriate speech, go to hell. </p><p>HARDAWAY:  Absolutely.  </p><p>RICHARDSON:  You got that right.  And then they want to sit and talk about  that Russia as the one that's influencing the election.  It's these  platforms, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, the social media platforms  that is -- are the ones that's influencing this election because you know  what, I don't speak Russia, I speak English, I've never been to Russia and  I don't -- you know, if anybody said anything to me in Russia, I wouldn't  know what they're talking about.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's the social media platforms that's influencing this  election by silencing and censoring conservative lawyers.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Sandberg acknowledging that the -- they were slow to respond  at Facebook.  It turns out that the first collusion may have been on  Facebook with the Russians and they didn't react, they didn't bring in  authorities from the, you know, from our intelligence agencies, Twitter,  you know, I couldn't understand what Dorsey was even trying to say, he  wanted to be the guy who decides whether or not conservatives have a voice.</p><p>But then he said he couldn't tell which is which, it got really kind of  ambiguous for him, could you straighten him out on that, Diamond?</p><p>HARDAWAY:  Well, first of all, he's not the arbitrator of truth.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY:  So to think that he can influence but he's not the school, he's  not the school of speech, this is free speech that we're talking about  being stifled. </p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.  </p><p>HARDAWAY:  This is conservative free speech.  And what they did, the  pretext of all of these here is algorithms that they put in place to  silence conservative voices.  If you say the word Trump, you're silenced,  if you say anything patriotic, stand for the flag or anything about god,  you are silenced.  If you are a conservative, you are being silenced on the  social media of platforms because they want to act like they are the  arbitrators of truth and they nothing but liars and really thieves.  Yes,  lairs and thieves.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Diamond and Silk, it's great to have you here.  We thank you,  I want to apologize for swearing, my wife is going to chastise me strongly  after the broadcast I'm sure.  Forgive me and we're delight to see you, all  the best.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>HARDAWAY:  Thank you so much.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Thank you for having us.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Be sure to check out Diamond and Silk's chitchat tour, their next  stop is October 7 in Marietta, Georgia.  Nike launching its controversial  ad campaign featuring NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.  Tomorrow Nike will  run its ad on the NFL'S season opener but the social justice warriors and  newly self-proclaimed at Nike have a -- well, something of a spotty history  when it comes to social justice and the American worker.</p><p>Nike, it turns out -- are you ready?  Has 127 footwear factories located in  15 countries.  Well, Vietnam, China and Indonesia manufacturing 94 percent  of Nike footwear.  Also, Nike has 363 apparel factories.  They're in 37  countries and make 52 percent of Nike apparel in China, Vietnam and  Thailand.  That's right, not Ohio, not Oklahoma, not in Oregon, by the way,  let's don't forget.</p><p>Nike is the same company that put a New York screen printing company out of  business and shipped T-shirt printing and production from a factory in New  York to Honduras just three years ago.  That resulted in the loss of 85  American jobs, 1700 laid off last year, so much for social warrior footwear  company or wearing at least at the margin about American workers.  Odd, but  they're claiming and what they're actually doing.  Nike raising our  consciousness.</p><p>Be sure to vote on our poll tonight, the question is do you think \"The New  York Times\" anonymous op-ed is merely further evidence that President Trump  is right when he calls the national left-wing media fake news? Cast your  vote on Twitter @LouDobbs, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on  Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Up next, a new call for  President Trump to declassify FISA documents.</p><p>And further expose the systematic bias and efforts to subvert the  presidency of Donald J. Trump at the Justice Department and the FBI.  I'll  be joined by Gregg Jarrett right after this quick break.  Stay with us.   We're coming right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Key members of the House of Representatives will be calling on  President Trump tomorrow to declassify the Carter-Page FISA application and  notes from disgraced Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, Freedom Caucus  Chair, Mark Meadows along with Congressman Jim Jordan, Matt Gaetz, and Lee  Zeldin say, they will make that formal request of the President tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us now to assess all of this and much more, Gregg Jarrett, a Fox  Legal Analyst and author of \"The New York Times\" best-selling book, The  Russia Hoax.  Great to have you here.  </p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX BUSINESS LEGAL ANALYST:  Good to be here, Lou.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Meadows and Jordan and Gaetz going over to -- and  Zeldin going over to the White House to talk to the President.</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  This, you know, for a example, Tom Fitton has been calling for  this, we've all been calling this for ages.  The President, why in your  judgment has he not already done it?  </p><p>JARRETT:  He's being misled by the intelligence community.  I suspect it's  not just the FBI director but the DNI, Dan Coats.  As well as others,  probably Rod Rosenstein, why?  Because first of all for the intelligence  community, they think when they order a pizza it's national security and  ought to be classified.  There's this mentality that everything they do is  so important.  It's got to be classified and that's nonsense.</p><p>Every time something is declassified we find out it shouldn't have been  classified to begin with and second of all, I think the FBI, Christopher  Wray is covering up the wrongdoing of his own bureau and these documents  will reveal a level of corruption that will stun most Americans and it'll  be largely exculpatory of the President.  </p><p>DOBBS:  People forget, some of the Congressmen have seen --</p><p>JARRETT:  Oh sure.  So they know what's in it.</p><p>DOBBS:  They know, they can make independent judgment and they can --</p><p>JARRETT:  And they have.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, they have and have made it very clear that it's B.S. what is  being peddled whether it's by the intelligence community whether it's being  his attorneys and his, you know, his political folks.  There is just no way  in the world this President needs to let this go any further, it has got to  stop, it's got to stop now.  </p><p>JARRETT:  The American public deserves to see what's in these documents.   They deserve to see the impropriety and I believe illegality perpetrated by  the FBI and the Department of Justice to target Trump to try to influence  the election and undo the results.  </p><p>DOBBS:  I think in your rack it is called so stipulated.  I mean, this has  been demonstrated evidence throughout.  We know what we're dealing with, a  corrupt leadership that's still entrenched in the FBI.  They have taken out  the top but they haven't taken out all of the -- of the corruption.  It's a  toxic agency.  </p><p>JARRETT:  It is.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And only perhaps a competitive with that agency is the Department  of Justice itself.  </p><p>JARRETT:  Absolutely.  </p><p>DOBBS:  And that's got to be fixed.  This is a president who is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- should be on Jeff Sessions who has been abysmal and derelict in  his duties as attorney general.  And now he has an opportunity to make  things happen irrespective of the willful resistance within his  administration.  </p><p>JARRETT:  Everybody in Washington and America at large knows that Jeff  Sessions is finished.  Jeff Sessions may not get it but he will right after  the elections.  But the perfect example is he's allowed Bruce Ohr of all  people to still be employed in the Department of Justice and we learned 10  days ago when when he implicated all of the people at the FBI who were  involved in elicit scheme including believe it or not, Andrew Weissmann,  the lead prosecutor in the Special Counsel Bob Mueller's investigation.</p><p>Which is now tainted and corrupted the integrity and credibility of that  investigation.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Which had none to begin with.  </p><p>JARRETT:  Exactly.  </p><p>DOBBS:  So stipulated.  </p><p>JARRETT:  So stipulated, counselor.  </p><p>DOBBS:  All right.  Thanks so much for being with us, Gregg.  Thank you.</p><p>JARRETT:  My pleasure.</p><p>DOBBS:  Gregg Jarrett.  And the book is \"The Russia Hoax.\"  Buy a couple  more copies, would you?  </p><p>JARRETT:  Buy 10.</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, this guy has got to think at some point about his children.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>JARRETT:  Getting old.  </p><p>DOBBS:  Well, his retirement as well, we'll throw that in.  Up next, the  resistance making its way inside the White House, that's what an op-ed in  \"The New York Times\" by an anonymous, anonymous author would have -- \"The  New York Times\" would have you believe.  Oh.  Wow.  That's pretty bad.   We'll take up that so called senior official in the Trump administration.  </p><p>Yale professor Paul Bracken joins us.  We're going to take up a lot of  issues within as we continue here tonight.  Stay with us, we'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The left wing \"New York Times\", I know that's partly Redundant  elevating its ideological fervour and that's kind -- a very kind way to  call it what it is.  Publishing not just an anonymous quote but an entire  anonymous op-ed from an alleged member of the administration who bashed the  president, and that's not allegedly that's definitively.  If this is just  the latest escalation in the fourth estates assault on President Trump.   And no one -- no one should take seriously the claim that the author of  this anonymous op-ed is truly a senior administration official.  President  Trump addressed the op-ed during the White House event this very afternoon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Yes, the sheriffs can  imagine this, we have somebody in what I call the failing \"New York Times\",  that's talking about he's part of the resistance within the Trump  administration.  This is what we have to deal with.  And you know, the  dishonest media because you people deal with it as well as I do but it's  really a disgrace.  I will say this, nobody has done what this  administration has done in terms of getting things passed and getting  things through.</p><p>When you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration  probably who's failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons now.   And \"The New York Times\" is failing.  If I weren't here, I believe \"The New  York Times\" probably wouldn't even exist.  And someday, (INAUDIBLE) and  someday when I'm not president, which hopefully will be in about 6-1/2  years from now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: \"The \"New York Times\"\" and CNN and all of these phony media outlets  will be out of business folks, they'll be out of business.  Because  there'll be nothing to write and there'll be nothing of interest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well the president is absolutely correct when he suggests that the  copy won't be quite as elevated or exciting when he finally leaves the  presidency.</p><p>Joining us tonight Paul Bracken, he's a member of the Council on Foreign  Relations, he's professor of political science and business at Yale  University.  A great American, it's great to have you here.</p><p>PAUL BRACKEN, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND BUSINESS, YALE UNIVERSITY:   Good to be here.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with the President and this anonymous quote by some  worm that allegedly is in the -- who is allegedly a part of the  administration.  Your thoughts about where the \"New York Times\" is.</p><p>BRACKEN:  My thoughts are this, first of all, the \"The New York Times\"  would have vetted this very carefully about who it is.  So, I don't have  any doubts about that.  My feeling is yet another example of partisan  politics run riot, it's the way I would put it.  DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  It's happening everywhere and it's not good for the democracy.  I  don't think it's good for U.S. security overseas.  It can tempt people to  think the wrong things about that we have a weak government.</p><p>And I was shocked that the individual in question would not resign and put  it out there under his own name.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, I wasn't surprised.  Anyone who would betray the man they work  for this president of the United States, is a delusional ego maniacal,  self-aggrandizing jackass.  I don't see any other way to call it.  I would  think that that person would I hope stand out clearly amongst the top  officials of the administration.</p><p>BRACKEN:  See, this is not like that you work for a big business.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  And you don't agree with the CEO or something like that.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right, it's national security.</p><p>BRACKEN:  This is -- this is you work for the United States government and  you worked with the Constitution.  And if you really don't agree with it,  you should be in there and you have special obligations that are far larger  than people who work at most kinds of organizations.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, this would also be a call.  This would also be a call to the  deep state, whether it's in the FBI.  We've seen the corruption that is  rampant in its leadership, the Department of Justice.  All of those people  should be walking out the door because they are appalling in their  disloyalty.  The ignorance of their conduct, the political corruption that  they have with which they've stained those that Department and that agency.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Well, the way I would put it is that we have made it much easier  to impeach the next president whoever it is after this one.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  We are lowering the bar here and we are going to suffer for the  sins of both parties but especially in recent times.  It is not good for  the strength of this country and a lot of other things going well on the  economic front and the foreign policy front.  And but on the political  front, they're not.</p><p>DOBBS:  This president is his successes to this point in time in his  administration are unprecedented in the modern era, am I correct?</p><p>BRACKEN:  You are correct.  The one that gets me is the charge that he's  drawn to authoritarian governments like Russia and China, which belies the  fact that he's -- he has launched the largest nuclear build up, it's going  to add thousands of hydrogen bombs aimed at Russia and China.  I do not see  this is coddling the Russians.</p><p>DOBBS:  Nor do I.</p><p>BRACKEN:  And the Russians do not see it that way.  I was just in Russia as  you know.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  And talking to a lot of officials there, they are absolutely  stunned at the thought that we believe that they could hack the U.S.  election and make a difference.  They can't do anything right in their own  country and they're stunned to think that we think they won our election,  they tilted it.</p><p>DOBBS:  Folks have a -- should have a pretty good insight into Russian  government just by the historical facts that is in 1991 with the collapse  of the Soviet Union and Marxist Leninist.  I mean, the country is  struggling now not just because of the sanctions, although there are a  tremendous burden.  But because the country has yet to embrace markets and  --</p><p>BRACKEN:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- to achieve its potential.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Their backward technologically.  There is no Silicon Valley in  Russia, they've tried to sort it several times.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  The Ruble is collapsing.  The biggest thing I -- you know what I  and people talk about in Russia, it wasn't hacking the election, it wasn't  Donald Trump, they are extremely upset because the Ruble is going down so  much.</p><p>DOBBS:  Sure.</p><p>BRACKEN:  That they can't take their vacations on the Riviera this year.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  That's what the Russians I spoke to were really upset about.</p><p>DOBBS:  They're upset about that, they're also obviously very interested in  reclaiming at least full power in the Atlantic.  The United States now  creating a countervailing Atlantic Fleet to the force that already the  Russians have put into the Atlantic.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Well, we've done a lot in the last few years.  We've got some  very interesting military technologies.  And there are now NATO battalions  in the three Baltic countries.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>BRACKEN:  They would have to kill NATO troops if they come in and invade.   And that gets them into a ball game that they do not want to get into.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the reason they're there in large measure is because Estonia  that the Baltic -- the Baltic are without question historically they've had  enough of Russian invasion.</p><p>BRACKEN:  That's an understatement.  Yes, they do not like the Russians.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, we like you and we're delighted that you have taken time to  join us.  Hope you'll be back with us soon.</p><p>BRACKEN:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Thanks professor.

The president tweeted this just minutes  ago.  This is the president's tweet, does the so-called senior  administration official really exist or is it just the failing New York  Times with another phony source?  If the gutless anonymous person does  indeed exist, the  times must, for national security purposes turn him/her over to the  government at once.  There you are.  The radical Dimms continue to  foolishly and savagely oppose.</p><p>Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh firing off outlandish questions today  in addition to orchestrating more demonstrations by protesters in the  hearing room as the president's choice for the High Court had to put up  with it all.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Be required to respond to a subpoena.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you still believe a president can fire it will a  prosecutor who is criminally investigating him?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would like your commitment that you will recuse  yourself if there is an issue involving his criminal or civil liability.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Since you became a legal adult, have you ever made  unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical  harassment or assault of a sexual nature?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Good Lord.  Well, joining us tonight, I am pleased to tell you is  David Kaplan he's former legal affairs editor for Newsweek.  Author of the  new book The Most Dangerous Branch: Inside The Supreme Courts Assault On  The Constitution.  David, great to have you with us.</p><p>DAVID KAPLAN, AUTHOR, THE MOST DANGEROUS BRANCH:  Good to be with you.</p><p>DOBBS:  I want to first show folks a picture of the two of us in Fortune  Magazine.</p><p>KAPLAN:  No.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, we got that please.  One, two, three.  I did it on three.  I  timely (INAUDIBLE) here.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Fake armrest.</p><p>DOBBS:  That was fake?</p><p>KAPLAN:  It looks real.</p><p>DOBBS:  I was working like heck to just stay a parody there.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, what do you think of the sweater David?</p><p>KAPLAN:  It's a lot nicer than my sport jacket.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, that's us.  What year was that?  90?  </p><p>KAPLAN:  I think that was like 2010.</p><p>DOBBS:  That's what I said 2010.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Once upon a time.</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it.  It seemed like 93 to me but there it is.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Who won that match?</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you and I both can claim it.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Yes, I think I probably let you win.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, thank you -- thank you.  I'm sure that I deferred.  But I do - -</p><p>KAPLAN:  We do that to most of the people we wrote about it Newsweek and  fortune.</p><p>DOBBS:  You got it -- you got it.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's great to have you here.  Congratulations on the book.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  It couldn't be more timely and judge Brett Kavanaugh.  I'm watching  these hearings and I honestly have never seen anything like it.  This is --</p><p>KAPLAN:  Sure you have, last year.</p><p>DOBBS:  No.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Except for the protest, fair enough.</p><p>DOBBS:  This is -- this is venomous.  76 people arrested in two days.  This  is -- the Dimms are putting on a show that it looks to me like it's  politically suicidal.</p><p>KAPLAN:  I don't know how it's going to play politically but it's  predictable.  It's illogical -- it's a logical extension of where hearings  have been going for 20 years.  And if Hillary Clinton was president and she  had put up a nominee, I think you'd see Republicans misbehaving.  Neither  side has a claim to good behavior.</p><p>But in the first instance -- in the first instance, the problem with these  hearings isn't senators, it's not even presidents.  It's the Supreme Court.   They're complicit in this because by issuing rulings on so many  controversial issues they raise the stakes of being on the Supreme Court.   And you're seeing that play out now.</p><p>DOBBS:  Now you argue in your book that the Supreme Court has overreached  and it's -- that's an understatement in its rulings.  Which is to you the  most egregious, which is the most profound in its impact.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Well, you know, choosing among bad rulings is like deciding which  of your children you love most.  But I think if I had to choose Bush v.  Gore in 2000.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Was the most egregious but I criticized Roe v. Wade.  I criticized  the campaign-finance ruling as citizens united the gun control ruling and I  criticized the gay marriage decision.  There's plenty of criticism on left  and right.  So, there's plenty in the book for both sides to like or to  hate.</p><p>DOBBS:  So, we have to turn to The Most Dangerous Branch.  We recommend the  book to you highly by David Kaplan.  You're fair and balanced and you're an  equal-opportunity -- well, sceptic of both in a detractor of both.  The  Gore v. --</p><p>KAPLAN:  Bush v. Gore.</p><p>DOBBS:  Bush v. -- I knew I had it backwards, Bush v. Gore.</p><p>KAPLAN:  They're easily confused.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, they are.  They were actually -- they were a little more alike  than we would like to think I think.  The idea that you don't like that  hurts me, because I thought we were friends and that you would  automatically signed with Bush.  You obviously chosen a separate path.</p><p>KAPLAN:  But we're -- it's between friends.  But the mistake I fear Lou  that you're making is confusing criticism of the court's decision to  intervene at all --</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>KAPLAN:  -- with the outcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>KAPLAN:  To the extent for example that I criticize Roe v. Wade, it's not  because I disagree with the outcome.  Politically, I'm liberal.  I believe  in very liberalized abortion laws.  I don't think though that victory  should be achieved in court, I think it should be achieved in Congress or  in state legislatures similarly, whether you wanted Bush or Gore to win.   The victory was best one in Congress because that's what the Constitution  provided for in the case of a disputed presidential election.  Instead,  both sides went to court to achieve victory and that's what I criticize.</p><p>DOBBS:  As you have studied this and written about it over two years --  written about it over two years to produce the book.  Is there a point at  which you think that the court can be either be righted or right itself?</p><p>KAPLAN:  I'm not optimistic, what you're seeing playing out in the  Kavanaugh hearings is an indication of how bad things have become.  But I  think the best hope lies not with presidents or senators but with the court  itself.  The courts going to have to learn to restrain itself.</p><p>DOBBS:  David Kaplan, again, congratulations.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Great to see you.</p><p>KAPLAN:  Good to see you.  We're not going to arm-wrestle here.  All right,  next time.</p><p>DOBBS:  I got to have a couple of more days in the weight room.</p><p>Up next President Trump mulling whether or not he should declassified  documents at the heart of the Mueller never-ending witch-hunt.  We'll have  the latest when we come back.</p><p>This is the book, \"The Most Dangerous, Dangerous Branch,\" David Kaplan.  We  recommend it to you.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END </p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Cue uproar from numerous Democrats, who warned\u00a0that bad politicians would abuse the system while Facebook continued to cash\u00a0their cheques.</p><p>Then in an apparent jab at its larger rival,\u00a0Twitter said that it would ban all political advertising \u00a0from its platform.</p><p>Alas, this approach proved\u00a0not so simple. On Friday, the group announced some carve-outs to the policy \u2014 namely that it would\u00a0continue to allow campaign groups to advertise on political issues, while businesses can do so\u00a0as long as the adverts are\u00a0not connected with specific legislation or elections.\u00a0It came\u00a0after some critics pointed out that\u00a0a blanket ban would allow, say, fossil fuel companies to buy advertisements, but not groups advocating for climate change awareness.</p><p>There are conditions, however.\u00a0In particular, campaign groups will be banned\u00a0from targeting small sections of users by\u00a0characteristics or personal information such as postcode or political preference.</p><p>So-called microtargeting has been a hot topic lately, with some politicians urging Facebook to restrict the practice. The \u201cworse case\u201d thinking goes that if the company will not fact-check political ads, then politicians could direct misleading information at those most likely to lap it up. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has said he is mulling limiting microtargeting on his\u00a0platform\u00a0but remained mum on Friday.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Twitter acknowledged that its new, somewhat complex set of rules could create confusion and be difficult to police.\u00a0\u201cWe firmly believe it is better for us to start trying and give people a chance to tell us where we\u2019re getting it wrong than to wait,\u201d Vijaya Gadde, Twitter\u2019s head of legal and policy, said.</p><p>The Internet of (Five) Things</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Amazon\u2019s appeal</emphasis><br/>Amazon is appealing the Pentagon\u2019s surprise decision to grant a\u00a0$10bn defence contract to\u00a0rival Microsoft, accusing the US government of having shown \u201cunmistakable bias\u201d in its procurement process.\u00a0The legal threat over the\u00a0Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project, known as Jedi, escalates the animosity between Jeff Bezos and Donald Trump, who has repeatedly mocked the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post. Before the cloud computing contract was awarded,\u00a0the US president said that \u201cgreat companies\u201d such as Oracle, IBM and Microsoft had complained about the process, interpreted as an attack on\u00a0Amazon, long considered the frontrunner.\u00a0<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Late-stage bonanza</emphasis><br/>Think investors have been spooked by SoftBank\u2019s latest stumbles? Think again. Many are preparing to pour billions of dollars into later-stage tech start-ups, undeterred by the plight of the Japanese conglomerate\u00a0following its\u00a0 WeWork fiasco. Miles Kruppa reports that Stephen Schwarzman\u2019s Blackstone plans to raise as much as $4bn for its first growth equity fund, while New York\u2019s Tiger Global Management, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund are also raising funds to back private groups that are nearing initial public offerings or takeovers. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Alibaba puts faith in Hong Kong</emphasis><br/>Alibaba kicked off the world\u2019s biggest capital raising of the year, with an announcement that it would sell 500m shares to investors in a secondary offering.\u00a0Earlier this week, the Chinese ecommerce company said the\u00a0 secondary listing\u00a0 in Hong Kong could raise as much as $13.4bn,\u00a0giving the protest-racked finance hub a clear vote of confidence.\u00a0<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Google and a healthy lack of trust</emphasis><br/>A whistleblower reveals a secret transfer involving the\u00a0 personal data \u00a0of tens of millions of people and a big tech company. Expressions of outrage follow, and regulators promise to investigate.

Twitter removed a post that Trump had retwee...</p><p>WASHINGTON \u2013 In another battle between Twitter and the Trump administration, the social media company has taken action against President Donald Trump and his son for posts that promoted bogus cures for COVID-19.   Twitter removed a post that Trump had retweeted in which a doctor proclaims, without evidence, that \"there is a cure\" for the coronavirus.   The social media giant also restricted the account of Donald Trump, Jr., after removing a post in which doctors touted the alleged benefits of \"hydroxychloroquine\" in fighting the coronavirus. The president's son was blocked from tweeting for 12 hours.   Protesting decisions by Twitter, Trump Jr. spokesman Andrew Surabian said that \"Big Tech is intent on killing free expression online and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices.\"   Twitter, which has fact checked previous Trump tweets, said it was following its own rules prohibiting the dissemination of bad information about the virus that has claimed nearly 150,000 American lives.   The president's re-tweet \"was in violation of our COVID-19 misinformation policy,\" Twitter said in statement.   As for the president's son, Twitter sent a notice saying \"we've temporarily limited some of your account features\" for violating the policy on \"spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19.\"   More: Twitter makes about-face on Trump tweets but stops short of banning the president   More: Trump's social media order to have agencies review whether Twitter, Facebook can be sued for content   Most of the disputes revolve around efforts by Trump and allies to tout hydroxychloroquine, despite testimony from medical experts \u2013 including members of Trump's own staff \u2013 that it is not effective in stopping the virus.   Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for the coronavirus, citing safety issues that included \"reports of serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, and liver problems and failure.\"   There is no known cure for the coronavirus, as scientists across the globe scramble to develop a vaccine.   Trump promoted hydroxychloroquine in a series of retweets late Monday. They included the retweet of a post attacking Anthony Fauci, a key member of the coronavirus task force, for dismissing the value of drug.   In an interview Tuesday on ABC's Good Morning America, Fauci said he agreed with the FDA's assessment of hydroxychloroquine and added that \"I have not been misleading the public under any circumstances.\"   Twitter removed a Trump retweet of a post featuring a Houston doctor named Stella Immanuel.   The Daily Beast reported that Immanuel has also said that face masks aren't necessary to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and has also made claims \"about alien DNA and the physical effects of having sex with witches and demons in your dreams.\"   Twitter has cracked down on Trump tweets before.   In May, Twitter fact-checked tweets by Trump claiming there was \"no way\" an election with mail-in ballots could be legitimate. The company also put a warning label on a Trump tweet in which he appeared to advocate the shooting of protesters by using the phrase \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"   Also that month, Trump signed an executive order asking federal regulators to review laws that protect websites from legal liability, a move that in theory would make it easier for people to sue companies like Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42704848471</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G1-1991-JCSC-J4G1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"639\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Greenville News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

France passed a law in December 2018 requiring online political campaigns to declare who paid for them, and how much was spent. Twitter is now using[1] the law to black out the government's campaign encouraging voters to register for the European elections ahead of the deadline. </p><p>The French government information service operated the campaign and planned to pay for sponsored tweets, according to news agency AFP. French officials, who have long threatened to censor[2] big tech companies, were shocked that Twitter would obey the letter of the new law instead of finding a way to deal with its vagaries.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) One MP, Nama Moutchou, thought it was an April Fool's joke. 'I believed in an April fool! \u2066\u2066\u2066\u2066@Twitter \u2069 blocks the public campaign for registration on the voters lists! For not having to adhere to the anti-transparency rules #FakeNews. Appalling and illegal,' she said on Twitter[3] Monday. France's Interior Minister Christophe Castanter also vented frustration. 'Twitter's priority should be to fight content that glorifies terrorism. Not campaigns to register on the electoral lists of a democratic republic,' he said in a tweet[4] Monday. The new French law is designed to make clear who is paying for advertisements. It requires online platforms to provide 'fair, clear and transparent' information about the company or person in an accessible database format. Big tech companies have been battered[5] around by European countries recently. European Union regulators fined Google a hefty $1.7 billion in March[6], for instance, on the basis that the Silicon Valley giant violated various anti-trust laws. European officials claimed Google engaged in illegal practices in a bid to monopolize advertising markets.(Article Continues Below Advertisement)Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Twitter chose the city's Mid-Market area for its HQ in 2012 after city officials proposed a tax break as an incentive to keep job opportunities created by the social media giant within city limits and to fortify a deteriorating Mid-Market district. Dorsey's comment regarding tech talent recruitment outside of the Bay comes as office space in San Francisco grows increasingly competitive and expensive and as a city measure proposes limiting the yearly amount of new office development. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. On an earnings call Thursday[2], Twitter cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey said the company was seeking to hire globally since the company's concentration in its hometown of San Francisco \"is not serving us any longer.\" The social media giant initially set up shop in San Francisco's SOMA district in 2006[3]before moving into its current Mid-Market headquarters location in 2012. San Francisco will continue serving as the nucleus of the company's workforce. \"San Francisco will be where the majority of our employees will be based for the foreseeable future,\" a Twitter spokesperson told Business Insider in an email. But now, Twitter will be building support to employ remote talent outside of the Bay as well. \"I don't fear any slowness as we work to distribute our workforce now, and I do think we have to build a company that's not entirely dependent on San Francisco,\" Dorsey said on the call last Thursday. The comment comes eight months after the expiration of the Twitter tax break[4], an incentive crafted by city officials in 2011 to keep Twitter and its job opportunities within city limits, specifically in San Francisco's Mid-Market district. But it didn't rejuvenate the area[5] as lawmakers had hoped it would. And the area's retail market even took a hit[6], due in part to employee cafeterias inside tech offices that kept would-be customers inside instead of patronizing local restaurants and businesses. The tax break saved Twitter, and other companies in Mid-Market[7], millions in the past decade, and some critics[8] see Dorsey's statement as typical of the transient tech industry's lack of integration into the San Francisco community. \"I'm not surprised that they essentially benefited from a very generous tax policy by city government, only to turn around and say San Francisco is not a priority for us,\" former San Francisco supervisor and tax break opponent David Campos told BuzzFeed News' Alex Kantrowitz.[9]  But San Francisco also has a series of notorious problems that make it increasingly difficult for companies to grow within city limits. One is the city's high rent and home prices, exacerbated over the years by stringent zoning and building regulations, limited housing stock, and a bloated workforce, among other factors. Katie Canales/Business InsiderThat presents a problem for companies when recruiting tech talent. Source: Business Insider[10]But San Francisco has one of the most crowded and expensive office markets in the US. Katie Canales/Business InsiderOffice space is limited and competitive, especially as fast-growing big tech companies have filed in within the last decade. Before Twitter moved its San Francisco headquarters to the city's Mid-Market district in 2012, tech companies were concentrated farther south in the heart of Silicon Valley. But in 2013, Square, where Dorsey is also CEO, moved into an office a block away from Twitter's headquarters. Square shares the same building with ride-sharing behemoth Uber, which moved in in 2014[11] and is also the city's most valuable startup. Many more followed suit in Mid-Market and other parts of the city center as well, like Salesforce, which is now San Francisco's largest private employer.[12] On top of that, a measure dubbed Proposition E[13] is currently in the works that aims to offset housing demand by making new office development contingent upon the amount of affordable housing produced each year. If the city fails to approve its yearly quota for affordable housing, then the amount of new office space will be capped at a similar level. Source: The San Francisco Chronicle[14]Dorsey also cited a need to accommodate tech talent that values remote work, a trend in the software industry overall. Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesThanks to faster internet connections, updated telecommunication capabilities, and cloud products, companies can hire outside of the Bay Area. \"There's incredible talent around the world and we have to be able to work in a way that supports them as employees regardless of where they live, especially when they want to build careers in their own communities,\" a Twitter spokesperson told Business Insider in an email. At the same time[15], the tech talent pool is established in the region and there are benefits to having a physical office location, like in-person interactions with coworkers and higher-ups.

Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!'  </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266231100780744704\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266231100780744704</url>  Hours later, the micro-messaging platform hid the tweet behind a message that said it 'violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today'.'As is standard with this notice, engagements with the Tweet will be limited. People will be able to Retweet with Comment, but will not be able to Like, Reply or Retweet it.' Users could still click through and view the full unedited tweet.Trump, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, lashed out at the platform on Thursday, signing an executive order[1] seeking to strip social media giants of legal immunity for content they carry. The order calls on government regulators to evaluate if they should be eligible for liability protection for content posted by their millions of users.The move, which was slammed by critics as a legally dubious act of political revenge, came after Twitter labelled[2] two earlier Trump tweets \u2014 on the increasingly contentious topic of mail-in voting \u2014 as misleading.If enforced, the action would upend decades of precedent and treat internet platforms as 'publishers' potentially liable for user-generated content.Trump told reporters at the White House he acted because big tech firms 'have had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences'.'We can't let this continue to happen,' Trump said. 'President's speech police' Critics said, however, that Trump has no authority to regulate private internet operators or change the law, known as Section 230, which backers say has allowed online platforms like Facebook and Twitter to flourish.The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order 'a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president'.Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order was 'more about political theatre than about changing the law'. The order 'is not legally supportable \u2014 it flies in the face of more than 900 court decisions,' Goldman said.The White House seeks to sidestep the provisions giving internet firms immunity by treating them as publishers operating in part of a 'public square'. 'Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see,' the executive order said.While the Trump order would not prevent platforms from moderating content, it could open them up to a flood of lawsuits from anyone who claims to be harmed by content posted online.Critics said the action represents a dangerous effort by the government to regulate online speech. 'Social media can be frustrating. But an Executive Order that would turn the FCC into the President's speech police is not the answer,' said Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic member of Federal Communications Commission, one of the agencies tasked with enforcing the executive order.Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp;#38; Communications Industry Association, a trade group, warned that 'retaliation against the private sector for fact-checking leadership is what we expect from foreign autocracies, not the United States.' Wading into quagmire Internet firms have denied Trump's claims of bias, and point to his massive social media following. But the president's move plays into his narrative ahead of his difficult November reelection battle that liberal forces are trying to censor Republicans.A wider debate has long been underway on the power that social media companies wield and what responsibility they bear for posts that are misleading or hurtful.Internet services like Twitter and Facebook have been struggling to root out misinformation, while at the same time keeping their platforms open to users.After long resisting calls to censure Trump over his frequent factually inaccurate posts, Twitter on Tuesday flagged the president for the first time for making false claims.Trump had tweeted \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that more mail-in voting would lead to what he called a 'Rigged Election' this November.

In a move bound to infuriate one of the platform's most followed users, Twitter said it was placing a \"public interest notice\" on a Trump message about protests in Minneapolis over the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of the police. In a late night tweet, Trump wrote: \"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. </p><p>Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\" Hours later, the micro-messaging platform hid the tweet behind a message that said it \"violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today.\" \"As is standard with this notice, engagements with the Tweet will be limited. People will be able to Retweet with Comment, but will not be able to Like, Reply or Retweet it.\" Users could still click through and view the full unedited tweet. Trump, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, lashed out at the platform on Thursday, signing an executive order seeking to strip social media giants of legal immunity for content they carry.  The order calls on government regulators to evaluate if they should be eligible for liability protection for content posted by their millions of users. The move, which was slammed by critics as a legally dubious act of political revenge, came after Twitter labelled two earlier Trump tweets -- on the increasingly contentious topic of mail-in voting -- as misleading. If enforced, the action would upend decades of precedent and treat internet platforms as \"publishers\" potentially liable for user-generated content. President Donald Trump is on the warpath against Twitter after the platform for the first time labelled two of his tweets, on the increasingly contentious topic of mail-in voting, with fact-check notices AFP / - Trump told reporters at the White House he acted because big tech firms \"have had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.\" \"We can't let this continue to happen,\" Trump said.Critics said however Trump has no authority to regulate private internet operators or change the law, known as Section 230, which backers say has allowed online platforms like Facebook and Twitter to flourish. US President Donald Trump, flanked by Attorney General William Barr, prepares to sign an executive order on social media companies in the Oval Office on May, 28, 2020 AFP / Brendan Smialowski The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order \"a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.\" Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order was \"more about political theater than about changing the law.\" The order \"is not legally supportable -- it flies in the face of more than 900 court decisions,\" Goldman said. The White House seeks to sidestep the provisions giving internet firms immunity by treating them as publishers operating in part of a \"public square.\" \"Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see,\" the executive order said. While the Trump order would not prevent platforms from moderating content, it could open them up to a flood of lawsuits from anyone who claims to be harmed by content posted online. Critics said the action represents a dangerous effort by the government to regulate online speech. \"Social media can be frustrating. But an Executive Order that would turn the FCC into the President's speech police is not the answer,\" said Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic member of Federal Communications Commission, one of the agencies tasked with enforcing the executive order. Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp;#38; Communications Industry Association, a trade group, warned that \"retaliation against the private sector for fact-checking leadership is what we expect from foreign autocracies, not the United States.\"Internet firms have denied Trump's claims of bias, and point to his massive social media following. But the president's move plays into his narrative ahead of his difficult November reelection battle that liberal forces are trying to censor Republicans. A wider debate has long been underway on the power that social media companies wield and what responsibility they bear for posts that are misleading or hurtful. Internet services like Twitter and Facebook have been struggling to root out misinformation, while at the same time keeping their platforms open to users. After long resisting calls to censure Trump over his frequent factually inaccurate posts, Twitter on Tuesday flagged the president for the first time for making false claims. Trump had tweeted -- without any evidence -- that more mail-in voting would lead to what he called a \"Rigged Election\" this November. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132857159075044235875776100064</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132857</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6014-1NF1-F03R-N0B3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><timeReceived>11:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times Australia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In a move bound to infuriate one of the platform's most followed users, Twitter said it was placing a \"public interest notice\" on a Trump tweet about violent protests in Minneapolis over the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of the police. In a late night tweet, Trump wrote: \"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. </p><p>Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\" Hours later, the micro-messaging platform hid the tweet behind a message that said it \"violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today.\" \"As is standard with this notice, engagements with the Tweet will be limited. People will be able to Retweet with Comment, but will not be able to Like, Reply or Retweet it.\" Users could still click through and view the full unedited tweet. Trump, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, lashed out at the platform on Thursday, signing an executive order seeking to strip social media giants of legal immunity for content on their platforms. The order calls on government regulators to evaluate if online platforms should be eligible for liability protection for content posted by their millions of users. The move, which was slammed by critics as a legally dubious act of political revenge, came after Twitter labelled two earlier Trump tweets -- on the increasingly contentious topic of mail-in voting -- as misleading. If enforced, the action would upend decades of precedent and treat internet platforms as \"publishers\" potentially liable for user-generated content. Trump told reporters at the White House he acted because big tech firms \"have had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.\" \"We can't let this continue to happen,\" Trump said. - 'President's speech police' - Critics said however Trump has no authority to regulate private internet operators or change the law, known as Section 230, which backers say has allowed online platforms like Facebook and Twitter to flourish. The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order \"a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.\" Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order was \"more about political theater than about changing the law.\" The order \"is not legally supportable -- it flies in the face of more than 900 court decisions,\" Goldman said. The White House seeks to sidestep the provisions giving internet firms immunity by treating them as publishers operating in part of a \"public square.\" \"Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see,\" the executive order said. While the Trump order would not prevent platforms from moderating content, it could open them up to a flood of lawsuits from anyone who claims to be harmed by content posted online. Critics said the action represents a dangerous effort by the government to regulate online speech. \"Social media can be frustrating. But an Executive Order that would turn the FCC into the President's speech police is not the answer,\" said Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic member of Federal Communications Commission, one of the agencies tasked with enforcing the executive order. Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a trade group, warned that \"retaliation against the private sector for fact-checking leadership is what we expect from foreign autocracies, not the United States.\" - Wading into quagmire - Internet firms have denied Trump's claims of bias, and point to his massive social media following. But the president's move plays into his narrative ahead of his difficult November reelection battle that liberal forces are trying to censor Republicans. A wider debate has long been underway on the power that social media companies wield and what responsibility they bear for posts that are misleading or hurtful. Internet services like Twitter and Facebook have been struggling to root out misinformation, while at the same time keeping their platforms open to users. After long resisting calls to censure Trump over his frequent factually inaccurate posts, Twitter on Tuesday flagged the president for the first time for making false claims. Trump had tweeted without any evidence that more mail-in voting would lead to what he called a \"Rigged Election\" this November.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYMNT-175655781</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYMNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-VJ21-F11P-X2P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417368</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"846\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nation Media Group Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Monitor</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35477\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The organization didn't provide enough evidence of an antitrust violation, and the companies aren't state entities that can violate free speech rights, a three-judge panel held in a decision only four pages long.</p><p>\"Freedom Watch's First Amendment claim fails because it does not adequately allege\" that the social media platforms \"can violate the First Amendment,\" the judges wrote. Quoting a previous decision, they found that \"in general, the First Amendment 'prohibits only governmental abridgment of speech.'\"</p><p>Larry Klayman, a lawyer for Freedom Watch and Loomer, said in an interview that he'd file a petition to have the case reheard by an enlarged \"en banc\" panel of the court's judges and take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary.

The district court judge who dismissed the case, Trevor McFadden, was appointed by Trump.</p><p>The case is one of several filed by conservatives linking social media bans to the market dominance of big tech companies. The suit blamed an illegal conspiracy by the companies for a \"complete halt\" of Freedom Watch's organizational growth and Loomer's 30-day ban from multiple social media platforms after she said Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) favors Sharia law and is \"anti-Jewish.\"</p><p>The D.C. Circuit's decision comes after two unlikely allies weighed in on behalf of Freedom Watch and Loomer, asking the court not to affirm the dismissal of the suit without a full proceeding. The District of Columbia's government and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law filed briefs challenging the trial judge's conclusion that the D.C. Human Rights Act doesn't ban discrimination online. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

He turned to his Twitter account - where else? - to tweet his threats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president can't unilaterally regulate or close the companies, and any effort would likely require action by Congress. His administration has shelved a proposed executive order empowering the Federal Communications Commission to regulate technology companies, citing concerns it wouldn't pass legal muster. But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing strong warnings.</p><p>Tech giants \"silence conservative voices,\" he claimed on Twitter early Wednesday. \"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\" Later, also on Twitter, he threatened, \"Big Action to follow.\" And in one more late-night tweet, he said \"Big Tech\" was \"going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!\"</p><p>Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Trump would sign an executive order relating to social media companies but provided no further details. White House strategic communications director Alyssa Farah said Trump would sign it Thursday.</p><p>In his tweet, he repeated his unsubstantiated claim - which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley - that expanding mail-in voting \"would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.\"</p><p>There was no immediate reaction from Twitter to the president's threats.</p><p>Twitter's decision to mark the president's tweets regarding mail-in balloting came as the president was sparking another social media firestorm, continuing to stoke a debunked conspiracy theory accusing MSNBC host Joe Scarborough of killing a former staffer. Prominent Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney, urged Trump to drop the attack - which has not been marked with a fact check by the social media company.</p><p>Trump and his campaign had lashed out at the company Tuesday after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots \"fraudulent\" and predicted that \"mail boxes will be robbed,\" among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading \"Get the facts about mail-in ballots\" that guides users to a Twitter \"moments\" page with fact checks and news stories about Trump's unsubstantiated claims.</p><p>Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of \"interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election\" and insisting that \"as president, I will not allow this to happen.\" His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter's \"clear political bias\" had led the campaign to pull \"all our advertising from Twitter months ago.\" Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.</p><p>Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.</p><p>Trump and his allies have long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives on social media by fact-checking them or removing their posts. The president's critics, meanwhile, have scolded the platforms for allowing him to put forth false or misleading information that could confuse voters.</p><p>Some Trump allies have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as \"platforms\" under federal law - or be treated more like publishers, which can face lawsuits over content.</p><p>The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.</p><p>\"Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. \"They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that's worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China?\"</p><p>Twitter's first-ever use of a label on Trump's tweets comes as platforms gear up to combat misinformation around the U.S. presidential election. Twitter and Facebook have begun rolling out dozens of new rules to avoid a repeat of the false postings about the candidates and the voting process that marred the 2016 election.</p><p>The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has further escalated the platforms' response, leading them to take actions against politicians - a move they've long resisted - who make misleading claims about the virus.</p><p>Last month, Twitter began a \"Get the Facts\" label to direct social media users to news articles from trusted outlets next to tweets containing misleading or disputed information about the virus. Company leaders said at the time that the new labels could be applied to anyone on Twitter, and that it was considering using them on other topics.</p><p>Twitter has said it will decide internally when to use a label, and on which tweets, and it will draw from information curated from news outlets.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg weighed in on the matter during a Fox News interview Wednesday. \"We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this,\" he said. \"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Republicans were turning their fire on one of the Twitter executives responsible for adding the fact checks: Yoel Roth, its head of site integrity. They are pointing to tweets he sent in 2016 and 2017 railing against the president and his allies.</p><p>\"From their bogus 'fact check' of @realDonaldTrump to their 'head of site integrity' displaying his clear hatred towards Republicans, Twitter's blatant bias has gone too far,\" tweeted Republican National Chairman Chair Ronna McDaniel.</p><p>Jack Balkin, a Yale University law professor and First Amendment expert, said any attempt to regulate social media companies for the content on their sites would likely need congressional input and approval - and probably face strong legal challenges.</p><p>\"The president can't do very much, but that's not the point,\" he said. \"This is an attempt by the president to, as we used to say in basketball, work the refs.\"</p><p>\"He's threatening and cajoling with the idea that these folks in their corporate board rooms will think twice about what they're doing, so they won't touch him.\"</p><p>--</p><p>AP writers Amanda Seitz and David Klepper contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STPLPP-3633147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STPAULPMNG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600M-YCD1-F0C5-X3SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313961</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1084\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 St. Paul Pioneer Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He turned to his Twitter account - where else? - to tweet his threats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president can't unilaterally regulate or close the companies, and any effort would likely require action by Congress. His administration has shelved a proposed executive order empowering the Federal Communications Commission to regulate technology companies, citing concerns it wouldn't pass legal muster. But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing strong warnings.</p><p>Tech giants \"silence conservative voices,\" he claimed on Twitter early Wednesday. \"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\" Later, also on Twitter, he threatened, \"Big Action to follow.\" And in one more late-night tweet, he said \"Big Tech\" was \"going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!\"</p><p>Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Trump would sign an executive order relating to social media companies but provided no further details. White House strategic communications director Alyssa Farah said Trump would sign it Thursday.</p><p>In his tweet, he repeated his unsubstantiated claim - which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley - that expanding mail-in voting \"would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.\"</p><p>There was no immediate reaction from Twitter to the president's threats.</p><p>Twitter's decision to mark the president's tweets regarding mail-in balloting came as the president was sparking another social media firestorm, continuing to stoke a debunked conspiracy theory accusing MSNBC host Joe Scarborough of killing a former staffer. Prominent Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney, urged Trump to drop the attack - which has not been marked with a fact check by the social media company.</p><p>Trump and his campaign had lashed out at the company Tuesday after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots \"fraudulent\" and predicted that \"mail boxes will be robbed,\" among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading \"Get the facts about mail-in ballots\" that guides users to a Twitter \"moments\" page with fact checks and news stories about Trump's unsubstantiated claims.</p><p>Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of \"interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election\" and insisting that \"as president, I will not allow this to happen.\" His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter's \"clear political bias\" had led the campaign to pull \"all our advertising from Twitter months ago.\" Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.</p><p>Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.</p><p>Trump and his allies have long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives on social media by fact-checking them or removing their posts. The president's critics, meanwhile, have scolded the platforms for allowing him to put forth false or misleading information that could confuse voters.</p><p>Some Trump allies have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as \"platforms\" under federal law - or be treated more like publishers, which can face lawsuits over content.</p><p>The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.</p><p>\"Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. \"They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that's worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China?\"</p><p>Twitter's first-ever use of a label on Trump's tweets comes as platforms gear up to combat misinformation around the U.S. presidential election. Twitter and Facebook have begun rolling out dozens of new rules to avoid a repeat of the false postings about the candidates and the voting process that marred the 2016 election.</p><p>The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has further escalated the platforms' response, leading them to take actions against politicians - a move they've long resisted - who make misleading claims about the virus.</p><p>Last month, Twitter began a \"Get the Facts\" label to direct social media users to news articles from trusted outlets next to tweets containing misleading or disputed information about the virus. Company leaders said at the time that the new labels could be applied to anyone on Twitter, and that it was considering using them on other topics.</p><p>Twitter has said it will decide internally when to use a label, and on which tweets, and it will draw from information curated from news outlets.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg weighed in on the matter during a Fox News interview Wednesday. \"We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this,\" he said. \"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Republicans were turning their fire on one of the Twitter executives responsible for adding the fact checks: Yoel Roth, its head of site integrity. They are pointing to tweets he sent in 2016 and 2017 railing against the president and his allies.</p><p>\"From their bogus 'fact check' of @realDonaldTrump to their 'head of site integrity' displaying his clear hatred towards Republicans, Twitter's blatant bias has gone too far,\" tweeted Republican National Chairman Chair Ronna McDaniel.</p><p>Jack Balkin, a Yale University law professor and First Amendment expert, said any attempt to regulate social media companies for the content on their sites would likely need congressional input and approval - and probably face strong legal challenges.</p><p>\"The president can't do very much, but that's not the point,\" he said. \"This is an attempt by the president to, as we used to say in basketball, work the refs.\"</p><p>\"He's threatening and cajoling with the idea that these folks in their corporate board rooms will think twice about what they're doing, so they won't touch him.\"</p><p>--</p><p>AP writers Amanda Seitz and David Klepper contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-c8898aad60175df06ebd160023285001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600T-CWY1-DYN6-W09J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1082\"/><timeReceived>2:40 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He turned to his Twitter account - where else? - to tweet his threats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president can't unilaterally regulate or close the companies, and any effort would likely require action by Congress. His administration has shelved a proposed executive order empowering the Federal Communications Commission to regulate technology companies, citing concerns it wouldn't pass legal muster. But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing strong warnings.</p><p>Tech giants \"silence conservative voices,\" he claimed on Twitter early Wednesday. \"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\" Later, also on Twitter, he threatened, \"Big Action to follow.\" And in one more late-night tweet, he said \"Big Tech\" was \"going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!\"</p><p>Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Trump would sign an executive order relating to social media companies but provided no further details. White House strategic communications director Alyssa Farah said Trump would sign it Thursday.</p><p>In his tweet, he repeated his unsubstantiated claim - which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley - that expanding mail-in voting \"would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.\"</p><p>There was no immediate reaction from Twitter to the president's threats.</p><p>Twitter's decision to mark the president's tweets regarding mail-in balloting came as the president was sparking another social media firestorm, continuing to stoke a debunked conspiracy theory accusing MSNBC host Joe Scarborough of killing a former staffer. Prominent Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney, urged Trump to drop the attack - which has not been marked with a fact check by the social media company.</p><p>Trump and his campaign had lashed out at the company Tuesday after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots \"fraudulent\" and predicted that \"mail boxes will be robbed,\" among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading \"Get the facts about mail-in ballots\" that guides users to a Twitter \"moments\" page with fact checks and news stories about Trump's unsubstantiated claims.</p><p>Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of \"interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election\" and insisting that \"as president, I will not allow this to happen.\" His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter's \"clear political bias\" had led the campaign to pull \"all our advertising from Twitter months ago.\" Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.</p><p>Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.</p><p>Trump and his allies have long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives on social media by fact-checking them or removing their posts. The president's critics, meanwhile, have scolded the platforms for allowing him to put forth false or misleading information that could confuse voters.</p><p>Some Trump allies have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as \"platforms\" under federal law - or be treated more like publishers, which can face lawsuits over content.</p><p>The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.</p><p>\"Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. \"They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that's worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China?\"</p><p>Twitter's first-ever use of a label on Trump's tweets comes as platforms gear up to combat misinformation around the U.S. presidential election. Twitter and Facebook have begun rolling out dozens of new rules to avoid a repeat of the false postings about the candidates and the voting process that marred the 2016 election.</p><p>The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has further escalated the platforms' response, leading them to take actions against politicians - a move they've long resisted - who make misleading claims about the virus.</p><p>Last month, Twitter began a \"Get the Facts\" label to direct social media users to news articles from trusted outlets next to tweets containing misleading or disputed information about the virus. Company leaders said at the time that the new labels could be applied to anyone on Twitter, and that it was considering using them on other topics.</p><p>Twitter has said it will decide internally when to use a label, and on which tweets, and it will draw from information curated from news outlets.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg weighed in on the matter during a Fox News interview Wednesday. \"We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this,\" he said. \"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Republicans were turning their fire on one of the Twitter executives responsible for adding the fact checks: Yoel Roth, its head of site integrity. They are pointing to tweets he sent in 2016 and 2017 railing against the president and his allies.</p><p>\"From their bogus 'fact check' of @realDonaldTrump to their 'head of site integrity' displaying his clear hatred towards Republicans, Twitter's blatant bias has gone too far,\" tweeted Republican National Chairman Chair Ronna McDaniel.</p><p>Jack Balkin, a Yale University law professor and First Amendment expert, said any attempt to regulate social media companies for the content on their sites would likely need congressional input and approval - and probably face strong legal challenges.</p><p>\"The president can't do very much, but that's not the point,\" he said. \"This is an attempt by the president to, as we used to say in basketball, work the refs.\"</p><p>\"He's threatening and cajoling with the idea that these folks in their corporate board rooms will think twice about what they're doing, so they won't touch him.\"</p><p>--</p><p>AP writers Amanda Seitz and David Klepper contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-c8898aad60175df06ebd160023285001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600T-CWS1-DYN6-W052-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1082\"/><timeReceived>2:40 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He turned to his Twitter account - where else? - to tweet his threats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president can't unilaterally regulate or close the companies, and any effort would likely require action by Congress. His administration has shelved a proposed executive order empowering the Federal Communications Commission to regulate technology companies, citing concerns it wouldn't pass legal muster. But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing strong warnings.</p><p>Tech giants \"silence conservative voices,\" he claimed on Twitter early Wednesday. \"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\" Later, also on Twitter, he threatened, \"Big Action to follow.\" And in one more late-night tweet, he said \"Big Tech\" was \"going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!\"</p><p>Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Trump would sign an executive order relating to social media companies but provided no further details. White House strategic communications director Alyssa Farah said Trump would sign it Thursday.</p><p>In his tweet, he repeated his unsubstantiated claim - which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley - that expanding mail-in voting \"would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.\"</p><p>There was no immediate reaction from Twitter to the president's threats.</p><p>Twitter's decision to mark the president's tweets regarding mail-in balloting came as the president was sparking another social media firestorm, continuing to stoke a debunked conspiracy theory accusing MSNBC host Joe Scarborough of killing a former staffer. Prominent Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney, urged Trump to drop the attack - which has not been marked with a fact check by the social media company.</p><p>Trump and his campaign had lashed out at the company Tuesday after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots \"fraudulent\" and predicted that \"mail boxes will be robbed,\" among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading \"Get the facts about mail-in ballots\" that guides users to a Twitter \"moments\" page with fact checks and news stories about Trump's unsubstantiated claims.</p><p>Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of \"interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election\" and insisting that \"as president, I will not allow this to happen.\" His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter's \"clear political bias\" had led the campaign to pull \"all our advertising from Twitter months ago.\" Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.</p><p>Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.</p><p>Trump and his allies have long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives on social media by fact-checking them or removing their posts. The president's critics, meanwhile, have scolded the platforms for allowing him to put forth false or misleading information that could confuse voters.</p><p>Some Trump allies have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as \"platforms\" under federal law - or be treated more like publishers, which can face lawsuits over content.</p><p>The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.</p><p>\"Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. \"They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that's worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China?\"</p><p>Twitter's first-ever use of a label on Trump's tweets comes as platforms gear up to combat misinformation around the U.S. presidential election. Twitter and Facebook have begun rolling out dozens of new rules to avoid a repeat of the false postings about the candidates and the voting process that marred the 2016 election.</p><p>The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has further escalated the platforms' response, leading them to take actions against politicians - a move they've long resisted - who make misleading claims about the virus.</p><p>Last month, Twitter began a \"Get the Facts\" label to direct social media users to news articles from trusted outlets next to tweets containing misleading or disputed information about the virus. Company leaders said at the time that the new labels could be applied to anyone on Twitter, and that it was considering using them on other topics.</p><p>Twitter has said it will decide internally when to use a label, and on which tweets, and it will draw from information curated from news outlets.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg weighed in on the matter during a Fox News interview Wednesday. \"We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this,\" he said. \"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Republicans were turning their fire on one of the Twitter executives responsible for adding the fact checks: Yoel Roth, its head of site integrity.

Joe Scarborough two decades ago is demanding that Twitter remove President Donald Trump's tweets suggesting Scarborough murdered her. </p><p>(AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump, the historically prolific tweeter of political barbs and blasts, threatened social media companies with new regulation or even shuttering on Wednesday after Twitter added fact checks to two of his tweets. He turned to his Twitter account - where else? -- to tweet his threats. The president can't unilaterally regulate or close the companies, and any effort would likely require action by Congress. His administration has shelved a proposed executive order empowering the Federal Communications Commission to regulate technology companies, citing concerns it wouldn't pass legal muster. But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing strong warnings. Tech giants 'silence conservative voices,\" he claimed on Twitter early Wednesday. 'We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.' Later, also on Twitter, he threatened, 'Big Action to follow.' Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters that Trump would sign an executive order relating to social media companies but provided no further details. White House strategic communications director Alyssa Farah said Trump would sign it Thursday. In his tweet, he repeated his unsubstantiated claim \u2014 which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley \u2014 that expanding mail-in voting 'would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.' There was no immediate reaction from Twitter or other social media companies to the president's threats. Twitter's decision to mark the president's tweets regarding mail-in balloting came as the president was sparking another social media firestorm, continuing to stoke a debunked conspiracy theory accusing MSNBC host Joe Scarborough of killing a former staffer. Prominent Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney, urged Trump to drop the attack \u2014 which has not been marked with a fact check by the social media company. (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.  Trump and his campaign had lashed out at the company Tuesday after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots 'fraudulent' and predicted that 'mail boxes will be robbed,' among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading 'Get the facts about mail-in ballots' that guides users to a Twitter 'moments' page with fact checks and news stories about Trump's unsubstantiated claims. Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of 'interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election' and insisting that 'as president, I will not allow this to happen.' His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter's 'clear political bias' had led the campaign to pull 'all our advertising from Twitter months ago.' Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November. Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.  Trump and his allies have long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives on social media by fact-checking them or removing their posts. The president's critics, meanwhile, have scolded the platforms for allowing him to put forth false or misleading information that could confuse voters.  Some Trump allies have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as 'platforms' under federal law \u2014 or be treated more like publishers, which can face lawsuits over content. The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny. 'Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. 'They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that's worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China.' Twitter's first-ever use of a label, on Trump's tweets comes as platforms gear up to combat misinformation around the U.S. presidential election. Twitter, as well as Facebook, have begun rolling out dozens of new rules to avoid a repeat of the false postings about the candidates and the voting process that marred the 2016 election. The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has further escalated the platforms' response, leading them to take actions against politicians - a move they've long resisted -- who make misleading claims about the virus.  Last month, Twitter began a 'Get the Facts' label to direct social media users to news articles from trusted outlets next to tweets containing misleading or disputed information about the virus. Company leaders said at the time that the new labels could be applied to anyone on Twitter, and that it was considering using them on other topics.  Twitter has said it will decide internally when to use a label, and on which tweets, and that it will draw from information curated from news outlets. Meanwhile, Republicans were turning their fire on one of the Twitter executives responsible for adding the fact checks, Yoel Roth, its head of site integrity. They are pointing to tweets he sent in 2016 and 2017 railing against the president and his allies.  'From their bogus 'fact check' of @realDonaldTrump to their 'head of site integrity' displaying his clear hatred towards Republicans, Twitter's blatant bias has gone too far,' tweeted Republican National Chairman Chair Ronna McDaniel. Former federal judge Michael McConnell, who now directs Stanford Law School's Constitutional Law Center, said Trump lacks the legal power to back up his threat. 'He has no such authority,' McConnell said in an email. 'He is just venting.' Jack Balkin, a Yale University law professor and First Amendment expert, said any attempt to regulate social media companies for the content on their sites would likely need congressional input and approval \u2014 and probably face strong legal challenges. 'The president can't do very much, but that's not the point,' he said. 'This is an attempt by the president to, as we used to say in basketball, work the refs.' 'He's threatening and cajoling with the idea that these folks in their corporate board rooms will think twice about what they're doing, so they won't touch him.' \u2014- AP writers Amanda Seitz and David Klepper contributedBest Growth Stocks - Best Stocks to Buy Now[1]The stock market has been growing since the New York Stock Exchange opened its doors in 1817.

Now that we are entering the ninth year of the current bull market, growth stocks have appreciated considerably and it's becoming far more challenging to find stocks with real opportunities for appreciation.Growth companies are still largely outperforming their value counterparts in the United States and the rest of the world largely because of low interest rates, improved corporate earnings and global economic growth. Over the last five years, the S&amp;#38;P 500 Growth Index has returned 14.22% per year. During the same time, the S&amp;#38;P 500 Value Index returned just 12.94%.Now that the bull market is now nearly a decade old, stocks have become very expensive. Value investors are largely sitting on the sidelines and growth investors are having a hard time figuring out where the remaining growth opportunities exist.If you are looking for growth stocks in an increasingly small field, we have identified the 10 best growth stocks to buy right now based on their expected earnings growth over the next several years. These companies are all growing rapidly and will likely see double-digit earnings growth next year.View the \"Best Growth Stocks - Best Stocks to Buy Now\"[2].

His administration has shelved a proposed executive order empowering the Federal Communications Commission to regulate technology companies, citing concerns it wouldn't pass legal muster. But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing strong warnings.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Tech giants silence conservative voices,\" he claimed on Twitter early Wednesday. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Later, also on Twitter, he threatened, Big Action to follow. And in one more late-night tweet, he said Big Tech was going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!<br/>\u00a0<br/>Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Trump would sign an executive order relating to social media companies but provided no further details.<br/>\u00a0<br/>White House strategic communications director Alyssa Farah said Trump would sign it on Thursday.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In his tweet, he repeated his unsubstantiated claim which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley that expanding mail-in voting would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots. There was no immediate reaction from Twitter to the president's threats.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Twitter's decision to mark the president's tweets regarding mail-in balloting came as the president was sparking another social media firestorm, continuing to stoke a debunked conspiracy theory accusing MSNBC host Joe Scarborough of killing a former staffer. Prominent Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney, urged Trump to drop the attack which has not been marked with a fact check by the social media company.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Trump and his campaign had lashed out at the company on Tuesday after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots fraudulent and predicted that mail boxes will be robbed, among other things.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Under the tweets, there is now a link reading Get the facts about mail-in ballots that guides users to a Twitter moments page with fact checks and news stories about Trump's unsubstantiated claims.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election and insisting that as president, I will not allow this to happen.<br/>\u00a0<br/>His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter's clear political bias had led the campaign to pull all our advertising from Twitter months ago.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Trump and his allies have long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives on social media by fact-checking them or removing their posts. The president's critics, meanwhile, have scolded the platforms for allowing him to put forth false or misleading information that could confuse voters.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Some Trump allies have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as platforms under federal law or be treated more like publishers, which can face lawsuits over content.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News.<br/>\u00a0<br/>They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that's worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China?<br/>\u00a0<br/>Twitter's first-ever use of a label on Trump's tweets comes as platforms gear up to combat misinformation around the US presidential election.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Twitter and Facebook have begun rolling out dozens of new rules to avoid a repeat of the false postings about the candidates and the voting process that marred the 2016 election.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has further escalated the platforms' response, leading them to take actions against politicians a move they've long resisted who make misleading claims about the virus.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg weighed in on the matter during a Fox News interview on Wednesday. We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this,\" he said. \"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Meanwhile, Republicans were turning their fire on one of the Twitter executives responsible for adding the fact checks: Yoel Roth, its head of site integrity.

He said: 'It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.' </p><p>The tweets are now marked 'Get the facts about COVID-19' and a link redirects users to a page which describes how the WHO had found in April that there was no evidence COVID-19 originated in a lab, instead they said it had come from animals in late last year. </p><p>On March 12, the deputy director of the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman tweeted a link to a spurious article from Global Research - well known for its conspiracy theories and spouting of Russian propaganda.</p><p>Zhao said: 'This article is very much important to each and every one of us.

Ireland\u2019s privacy watchdog was set to give out its first fine against the company, but challenges from other national data regulators have turned the case into a test of the European Union\u2019s ability to solve regional disputes, and of Ireland\u2019s lead regulatory role.   \u201cA number of objections were raised\u201d by other data protection authorities and the Irish watchdog \u201cengaged in a consultation process with them,\u201d the Irish Data Protection Commission said Thursday in a statement. \u201cHowever, following consultation, a number of objections were maintained and the DPC has now referred the matter to the European Data Protection Board.\u201d   Ireland\u2019s move to involve the EU board is the first time a data agency has needed to ask the umbrella organization in charge of the bloc\u2019s regulators to help find a solution.   The Twitter case comes from a breach in January 2019, when the company warned the Irish Data Protection Commission of a potentially disabled privacy setting for some Android users. Because the violation affected users throughout the continent, the Irish agency had to send the draft findings of its probe to other authorities.   The final ruling must address their concerns, and may help cement Ireland as the lead data protection regulator for major tech firms such as Facebook Inc., Google and Apple Inc., which use the country as a regional hub.   Twitter, WhatsApp Sanctions Loom in EU Privacy Crackdown   The latest developments in the Twitter probe could indicate a similar fate for Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, which faces an Irish probe into its transparency around data-sharing and was next in line to get a ruling.   Cases at the Irish data protection commission have been piling up since the bloc\u2019s tough General Data Protection Regulation took effect in May 2018 -- but with no final decisions to date. The slow pace has attracted criticism from privacy advocates and other EU regulators, which have no power to decide on cases concerning wider European violations by companies with an Irish EU base.   GDPR allows regulators to levy penalties of as much as 4% of a company\u2019s annual revenue for the most serious violations. The biggest fine to date was a 50 million-euro ($59 million) penalty for Google issued by France\u2019s watchdog CNIL.   Helen Dixon, Ireland\u2019s privacy commissioner, has opened at least 20 probes into big tech firms since the EU\u2019s new privacy rules took effect, including cases involving Apple, Facebook and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s LinkedIn.   While the watchdog has to ensure its decisions can withstand an appeal, it also has to grapple with procedures under GDPR. The obligation to send its draft decision around to 26 other EU regulators, which often have different views, reinforces EU-wide collaboration, but also brings delays.   \u00a92020 Bloomberg

Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!' the tweet read. </p><p>There's been chaos in the Minnesota city since a white police officer took the life of a black man, George Floyd, by kneeing him in the neck until he stopped breathing. </p><p>Trump initially posted it from his @realDonaldTrump account at 1 a.m. Friday. </p><p>The company attached a warning label to the tweet saying that it violated the rules. </p><p>When the president woke up Friday morning, he began angrily attacking Twitter. </p><p>'Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies &amp; propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States,' the president wrote. 'Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it will be regulated!' </p><p>He then had the official White House account repost the flagged tweet verbatim, daring the social media company to act. </p><p>                     What is Donald Trump's executive order targeting social media sites?                    </p><p>Donald Trump signed an order on Thursday seeking to make social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook liable for the content posted by their users. </p><p>If enforced, the order would overturn decades of precedent by treating the websites as 'publishers' which could be sued for user-generated content. </p><p>It could open them up to a flood of lawsuits from anyone who claims to be harmed by content posted online. </p><p>Currently, the sites are protected by a law known as Section 230 which shields them from liability. </p><p>Section 230 also allows social platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services' own standards, so long as they are acting in 'good faith.'</p><p>The author of a book about Section 230 said social media firms have 'based their business models on being large platforms for user content', saying they would not 'exist in their current forms' without the legislation. </p><p>However, critics argue that Section 230 gives internet companies a free pass on things like hate speech and content that supports terror organizations. </p><p>Trump signed the order after Twitter placed fact-check warnings on two of his tweets about mail-in voting on Tuesday. </p><p>Republican senator Josh Hawley said the 'censorship' was relevant to Trump's proposal, because websites which 'editorialize and censor' as Twitter allegedly did should be 'treated like traditional publishers' in law. </p><p>However, critics saw Trump's order as an act of political revenge against websites which he has long accused of political bias. </p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order 'a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.' </p><p>One ACLU official said the measure could actually harm Trump by encouraging a more cautious Twitter to limit the president's tweets. </p><p>Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order is 'not legally enforceable'. </p><p>Twitter said the order was a political move which attacked free speech, while Facebook said the measure would 'encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone'. </p><p>The @WhiteHouse's account continued to engage in the battle, by linking to a tweet sent out by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, last week that called for #jihad against Israel. </p><p>'This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it will allow terrorists, dictators, and foreign propagandists to abuse its platform,' a tweet from the official White House account read. </p><p>On the original offending Trump tweet, Twitter put a warning on it less than three hours later, saying it had 'taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts'. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was informed in advance. </p><p>The tweet can no longer be liked or replied to and will not be recommended by Twitter's algorithm, although retweets with comment are still possible - with Trump's message initially hidden. </p><p>It is still possible to override the warning message and view the tweet, under special rules for government officials which protect the public's right to know what their politicians have said. </p><p>Trump has feuded with the social media site in recent days for fact-checking his tweets.</p><p>Also on Friday morning, he quoted Fox News' Maria Bartiromo saying, 'he President has been targeted by Twitter.' </p><p>Trump then added, 'What about all of the lies and fraudulent statements made by Adam Schiff, and so many others, on the Russian Witch Hunt Plus, Plus, Plus? What about China's propaganda? WHO's mistakes? No flags?' he asked. </p><p>He then quoted Jeanine Pirro, a pro-Trump Fox News personality, who also called for regulating Twitter. </p><p>The president had signed an executive order Thursday seeking to strip social media giants of their legal protections, potentially exposing them to a flood of lawsuits- but backed Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg who distanced himself from Twitter.</p><p>Twitter had put a fact-checking label on two of Trump's tweets on Tuesday which claimed that mail-in voting in the 2020 election would be 'substantially fraudulent.' </p><p>And then attached the warning label to his 1 a.m. Friday tweet. </p><p>That message was a reply to an initial tweet - not red-flagged by Twitter - which took aim at the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis for his handling of the crisis. </p><p>Twitter announced the 'public interest notice' on the 'shooting' tweet around three hours after Trump had sent the message.</p><p>The social media giant said Trump's tweet 'violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today'. </p><p>'As is standard with this notice, engagements with the tweet will be limited. People will be able to retweet with comment, but will not be able to like, reply or retweet it,' a statement explained. </p><p>However, Twitter said it is 'in the public interest for the tweet to remain accessible' given its 'relevance to ongoing matters of public importance'. </p><p>Tweets from elected officials are exempt from the usual rules because there is a 'significant public interest in knowing and being able to discuss their actions and statements', the company's policies say. </p><p>'As a result, in rare instances, we may choose to leave up a Tweet from an elected or government official that would otherwise be taken down.' </p><p>These exemptions are only available to accounts with more than 100,000 followers. Trump has more than 80million. </p><p>The website told Axios that 'teams within Twitter' had decided to red-flag the president's tweet and that CEO Jack Dorsey was informed before it happened. </p><p>Trump has yet to respond to the warning message, which appeared at around 4am in Washington. </p><p>The president's threat to looters came after a third night of protests in Minneapolis accompanied by further rallies around the United States. </p><p>Hundreds of National Guard soldiers were deployed to the streets of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul and Mayor Frey declared a state of emergency as rioting escalated and cars and buildings were torched across the city. </p><p>'The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!' Trump tweeted mid-morning Friday. He misspelled scene. </p><p>Minneapolis's Third Precinct police station was set on fire and evacuated amid fears it could explode after gas lines were cut.</p><p>Frey called the looting 'unacceptable' but raged at Trump for 'refusing to take responsibility for your own actions,' saying the president 'knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis.' </p><p>CNN reporter Omar Jimenez, who is black, was arrested by police in Minneapolis while doing a live-shot, adding more fuel to the racial outrage. </p><p>In New York City, NYPD officers were seen brawling on the ground with protesters as at least 70 people were arrested in the city. </p><p>Protesters in Ohio smashed the windows of the statehouse in downtown Columbus and raided the building, while demonstrators damaged a police cruiser in downtown Los Angeles. </p><p>In Kentucky, seven people were shot in downtown Louisville during a protest demanding justice for black woman Breonna Taylor who was shot dead by cops in March - a case which has returned to the spotlight after Floyd's death. </p><p>Floyd, 46, died on Monday after a white police officer pinned him down with his knee despite Floyd pleading that he could not breathe. </p><p>The latest escalation in the president's row with Twitter comes just hours after he signed an order seeking to scrap legal protections for social media firms, which he accuses of political bias. </p><p>The order could open Twitter, Facebook and Google up to lawsuits by diluting the legal protection which stops them from being liable for posts on their platforms, and which also allows them to moderate content. </p><p>Trump's executive order said websites such as Twitter and Facebook 'wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events'. Twitter said the order was a political move which attacked free speech. </p><p>Trump also praised Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for his criticism of Twitter's decision to fact-check the tweets. 'CEO Mark Zuckerberg is today criticizing Twitter,' Trump wrote before sharing Zuckerberg's statement. </p><p>'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' Zuckerberg said in an interview with Fox News.</p><p>'I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,' he added.</p><p>'Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.' </p><p>Zuckerberg has been accused by Democrats of pandering to the President with his comments about censorship so that Facebook will not be targeted. </p><p>'Zuckerberg went on Fox News-a hate-for-profit machine that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracy theorists-to talk about how social media platforms should essentially allow politicians to lie without consequences. This is eroding our democracy,' said Senator Elizabeth Warren. </p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hit harder saying that Trump was using the feud as a distraction from the coronavirus outbreak. </p><p>'It's outrageous, but it's an outrageous situation,' Pelosi said at a Thursday press conference. 'While Twitter is putting up its fact-check under what the president says about voting, it still won't take off the misrepresentations the president's putting out there.'</p><p>'Facebook, all of them, they're all about making money,' she said. 'Their business model is to make money at the expense of the truth and the facts that they know. And they defend, they defend that.' </p><p>After highlighting Zuckerberg's statement, Trump asked: 'Did Twitter criticize Obama for his 'you can keep your Dr''?'</p><p>The president was referring to Obama's during assurance that 'if you like the doctor you have, you can keep your doctor' under the Affordable Care Act which he was struggling to steer through Congress at the time. </p><p>However, this promise was later abandoned and Obama conceded that some people 'might end up having to switch doctors'. </p><p>In a later tweet, Trump also renewed his dubious claims about mail-in voter fraud that had earned him the misinformation tag from Twitter in the first place. </p><p>Trump claimed that mail-in voting - which is high on the agenda because of the risks of voting in person during the pandemic - would lead to 'massive fraud and abuse' as well as the 'end of our great Republican Party'. </p><p>Twitter did not red-flag yesterday's comments as it had done for his Tuesday tweets, which now appear with a warning sign and a link to 'get the facts about mail-in ballots'. </p><p>Trump accused Twitter of becoming an 'editor with a point of view' and not a 'neutral platform' by fact-checking him. </p><p>The president also slammed one of its executives, Yoel Roth, its head of user integrity, accusing him of 'fraud' for the fact check. Twitter says he was not involved in it.</p><p>Asked if he wanted to get rid of Twitter he said: 'If it was legal, if it was able to be legally shut down, I would.' </p><p>Trump rolled out the tough language as Attorney General Bill Barr looked on and the president signed an order that could expose Twitter and other social media platforms to a barrage of lawsuits. </p><p>Barr said when firms 'curate' their collection and engage in 'censoring' content firms become 'publishers' and shouldn't be entitled to a legal 'shield.' </p><p>                     SECTION 230: THE LAW TRUMP IS TAKING AIM AT OVER CLAIMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA BIAS                    </p><p> Twenty-six words tucked into a 1996 law overhauling telecommunications have allowed companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google to grow into the giants they are today.</p><p>Those are the words President Donald Trump challenged in an executive order Thursday, one that would strip those protections if online platforms engaged in 'editorial decisions' - including, in the president's view, adding a fact-check warning to one of Trump's tweets.</p><p>Under the U.S. law, internet companies are generally exempt from liability for the material users post on their networks. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act - itself part of a broader telecom law - provides a legal 'safe harbor' for internet companies.</p><p>But Trump and other politicians argue that Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity - or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government.</p><p>Section 230 probably can't be easily dismantled. But if it was, the internet as we know it might cease to exist.</p><p>Just what is Section 230?</p><p>If a news site falsely calls you a swindler, you can sue the publisher for libel. But if someone posts that on Facebook, you can't sue the company - just the person who posted it.</p><p>That's thanks to Section 230, which states that 'no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.'</p><p>That legal phrase shields companies that can host trillions of messages from being sued into oblivion by anyone who feels wronged by something someone else has posted - whether their complaint is legitimate or not.</p><p>Section 230 also allows social platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services' own standards, so long as they are acting in 'good faith.'</p><p>Where did Section 230 come from?</p><p>The measure's history dates back to the 1950s, when bookstore owners were being held liable for selling books containing 'obscenity,' which is not protected by the First Amendment. One case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, which held that it created a 'chilling effect' to hold someone liable for someone else\u00b4s content.</p><p>That meant plaintiffs had to prove that bookstore owners knew they were selling obscene books, said Jeff Kosseff, the author of 'The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet,' a book about Section 230.</p><p>Fast-forward a few decades to when the commercial internet was taking off with services like CompuServe and Prodigy. Both offered online forums, but CompuServe chose not to moderate its, while Prodigy, seeking a family-friendly image, did.</p><p>CompuServe was sued over that, and the case was dismissed. Prodigy, however, got in trouble. The judge in their case ruled that 'they exercised editorial control - so you're more like a newspaper than a newsstand,' Kosseff said.</p><p>That didn't sit well with politicians, who worried that outcome would discourage newly forming internet companies from moderating at all. And Section 230 was born.</p><p>'Today it protects both from liability for user posts as well as liability for any clams for moderating content,' Kosseff said.</p><p>What happens if Section 230 is limited or goes away?</p><p>'I don\u00b4t think any of the social media companies would exist in their current forms without Section 230,' Kosseff said. 'They have based their business models on being large platforms for user content.'</p><p>There are two possible outcomes. Platforms might get more cautious, as Craigslist did following the 2018 passage of a sex-trafficking law that carved out an exception to Section 230 for material that 'promotes or facilitates prostitution.' Craigslist quickly removed its 'personals' section altogether, which wasn't intended to facilitate sex work. But the company didn\u00b4t want to take any chances.</p><p>This outcome could actually hurt none other than the president himself, who routinely attacks private figures, entertains conspiracy theories and accuses others of crimes.</p><p>'If platforms were not immune under the law, then they would not risk the legal liability that could come with hosting Donald Trump\u00b4s lies, defamation, and threats,' said Kate Ruane, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.</p><p>Another possibility: Facebook, Twitter and other platforms could abandon moderation altogether and let the lower common denominator prevail.</p><p>Such unmonitored services could easily end up dominated by trolls, like 8chan, which is infamous for graphic and extremist content, said Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman. Undoing Section 230 would be an 'an existential threat to the internet,' he said.</p><p>But Goldman doesn't see the White House order as that kind of threat to the internet, saying it's 'political theater' that will appeal to Trump supporters. 'The president can't override Congress,' he said. </p><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>'We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly, and you know what's going on as well as anybody. It's not good,' Trump said before inking the order, which came just days after Twitter for the first time provided what Trump's staff calls a fact-check on his own tweets.</p><p>Pressed on whether he would in fact seek to use the courts to shut down Twitter, Trump responded: 'I think this: if Twitter were not honorable, if you're going to have a guy like this be your judge and jury I think you shut it down as far as I'm concerned,' in reference to Twitter's 'head of integrity,' who has been revealed to have posted tweets highly critical of Trump and top Republicans. </p><p>Trump, a billionaire who amassed a branding and real estate empire before running for president, added: 'A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communication in the United States and we know what they are, we don't have to name them, we're going to give you a complete listing.'</p><p>He continued: 'They've had unchecked power to censure, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.'</p><p>Trump brought up the 2016 elections as he tore into Twitter - a fact lawyers might try to flag if companies try to claim in court the action is politically motivated.</p><p>'We can't allow that to happen especially when they go about doing what they're doing,' Trump said. 'Because they're doing things incorrectly. They have points of view. And if we go by that it's actually amazing that there was a success in 2016, but we can't let this continue to happen. It's very, very unfair.'</p><p>'What they're doing is tantamount to monopoly you can say,' Trump claimed. It's tantamount to taking over the airwaves. Can't let it happen. Otherwise we're not going to have a democracy. We're not going to have anything to do with a republic.'</p><p>Trump also tried to use the power of federal purse strings as pressure, saying we 'are not going in any social media company that repress[es] free speech.' </p><p>He said the government spends 'billions of dollars on giving them money' and called the firms 'rich enough,' although independent accounts put the total government ad spending far lower.</p><p>'We're going to be doing none of it or very little of it,' Trump said.</p><p>Asked if he would consider simply deleting his Twitter account given his concerns, Trump said he would 'do that in a heartbeat' if we had a 'fair press' in the U.S. </p><p>The language of the order Trump signed specifically singled out Twitter for its decision to flag two of the president's tweets. The platform provided additional information, although it did not take down the tweets. </p><p>It appeared to have been added since a draft order which was circulated widely in the run-up to the signing. </p><p>'Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias,' said the order. 'As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician's tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called 'Site Integrity' has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets.'</p><p>Schiff is the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a favorite Trump target. </p><p>Another section singled out four tech platforms - compared to a draft order which did not name Instagram and YouTube.</p><p> 'Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see,' it said. </p><p>Still another describes a new government 'working group' that will, among other things, evaluate media organizations with evidence of 'bias' being used to review content. '</p><p>'Complaints described in section 4(b) of this order will be shared with the working group, consistent with applicable law. The working group shall also collect publicly available information regarding the following: (iv) reliance on third-party entities, including contractors, organizations, and individuals, with indicia of bias to review content,' it says.</p><p>At least one section that did not appear in a draft form publicly available put new authority under Barr.</p><p>A section on government expenditures on online ads states: 'The Department of Justice shall review the viewpoint-based speech restrictions imposed by each online platform identified in the report described in subsection (b) of this section and assess whether any online platforms are problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, deception to consumers, or other bad practices.' </p><p> A section on the FCC considers a newly-added hedge. 'The FTC shall consider developing a report' on whether complaints alleging a violation of the law implicate its provisions. A draft said the agency would produce the report - effectively giving it an exit from actually producing one.</p><p>One section has the AG's working group probe an area with a financial angle, whether the platforms' policies act in ways 'that limit the ability of users with particular viewpoints to earn money on the platform compared with other users similarly situated.' </p><p>The crucial legal section is Trump's order to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to clarify how to enforce regulations under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p><p>That is the federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for users' posts.</p><p>But the order says that the protection should not apply if companies are 'engaged in editorial conduct' - meaning making a judgment for themselves about how people's points of view are presented.</p><p>That is what Trump accuses Twitter of doing by fact-checking him, and what conservatives claim happens to their posts which are promoted less than those with more liberal viewpoints. </p><p>Such a move could open up Twitter, Facebook and other platforms to an avalanche of lawsuits from people claiming their views have been unfairly censored. </p><p>It also requires the agency to look at whether social media platforms are using 'deceptive' policies to moderate content by not openly declaring how they decide how viewpoints are dealt with.</p><p>Trump also set up a mechanism allowing Americans to report alleged political censorship or bias by the social media giants which will be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>The White House tech bias reporting tool will collect complaints of online censorship and submit them to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). </p><p>The order was also rejected by civil liberties groups - and by the Chamber of Commerce, normally a reliable supporter of Republican policy. </p><p>                     Anti-conservative bias claims on social media                   </p><p>Facebook internal report admitted bias </p><p>Facebook last year opened itself to an independent investigation of anti-conservative bias after repeated criticism from Trump.</p><p>The audit, carried out by former Republican Senator Jon Kyl and others, found that the tech giant was still some way off eliminating its bias.</p><p>It concluded that Facebook's efforts to counter fake news had silenced conservative voices. One example, was that fact-checking sites used by the social media giant were inherently left-leaning.</p><p>In addition, it found that Facebook's ads policy could have restricted anti-abortion advocacy. </p><p>Kyl's report said: 'Facebook has recognized the importance of our assessment and has taken some steps to address the concerns we uncovered. But there is still significant work to be done to satisfy the concerns we heard from conservatives.'</p><p>Don Jr. claimed to be hit by 'Shadow banning'</p><p>A series of high-profile pro-Trump figures have claimed that Twitter and Instagram have made it harder to find their accounts or individual posts.</p><p>Among those making the claim have been Donald Trump Jr., and Mark Meadows, at the time a congressman and now Trump's White House chief of staff, and Jim Jordan, a prominent Trump defender.</p><p>Trump Jr. made the claim in his book, Triggered.</p><p>Twitter has denied that it was involved in such a practice but did update its algorithm when the controversy erupted in July 2016. Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - has said it does not alter the prominence of posts for political reasons.</p><p>James Woods is banned from Twitter</p><p>The conservative actor and prominent tweeter was locked out of his account in May 2019 for tweeting: ''If you try to kill the King, you best not miss'#HangThemAll.'</p><p>Candace Owens suspended by Twitter after criticizing lockdown</p><p>Conservative commentator Candace Owens tweeted earlier this month: 'Apparently @GovWhitmer believes she is a duly elected dictator of a socialist country. The people of Michigan need to stand up to her. Open your businesses. Go to work. The police think she's crazy too. They are not going to arrest 10,000,000 people for going to work.'</p><p>A Twitter spokesman confirmed that Owens' tweet violated its Covid-19 fake news policy. Twitter said the tweet would be deleted and Owens would serve a 'timeout' before being allowed to log back on. </p><p>Google accused of censorship of views on abortion, gun rights, Islam and terrorism on its YouTube platform</p><p>In February, Google persuaded a federal appeals court on Wednesday to reject claims that YouTube illegally censored Prager University, a conservative nonprofit run by radio talk show host Dennis Prager.</p><p>PragerU claimed that YouTube's opposition to its political views led it to tag dozens of videos on such topics as abortion, gun rights, Islam and terrorism for its 'Restricted Mode' setting, and block third parties from advertising on the videos.</p><p>Writing for the appeals court, however, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown said YouTube was a private forum despite its 'ubiquity' and public accessibility, and hosting videos did not make it a 'state actor' for purposes of the First Amendment.</p><p>Clinton scourge Tulsi Gabbard sues Google over violating free speech </p><p>Last year she announced she was suing Google for $50million after it suspended her advertising account in the hours after a Democratic debate because it was trying to silence her.</p><p>Although she's a Democrat, Gabbard's nationalist ideals have put her at odds with the Democratic party.</p><p>Hillary Clinton suggested the Iraq War veteran was a Russian asset. </p><p>Tulsi Now Inc. said in the lawsuit filed in July 2019 that Google violated her right to free speech and didn't provide 'a straight answer' for suspending her ads account.</p><p>Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify ban Infowars' Alex Jones</p><p>In 2018, Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify banned pages and content from Infowars and the show's host Alex Jones. </p><p>A Facebook spokesman referred to content which it said glorified violence and the use of dehumanizing language to describe Muslims and migrants. These violated their graphic violence and hate speech policies.</p><p>The spokesman noted conspiracy theories espoused by Jones on events like the 9/11 attacks and Sandy Hook school shooting, were not the reason for his ban. </p><p>YouTube followed suit a few hours later, as did Spotify, after Apple removed Jones from its podcast directory. </p><p>Laura Loomer banned from Twitter after she claimed Ilhan Omar was 'anti Jewish' and supported Shariah law </p><p>It comes as a federal appeals court this week upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit that accused Twitter, Facebook and other tech giants of conspiring to stifle the political views of far-right activist, Laura Loomer, and a conservative nonprofit, Freedom Watch. </p><p>In November 2018, Loomer handcuffed herself to the front doors of Twitter headquarters in New York after the company banned her. The company permanently suspended Loomer's account, which had more than 260,000 followers, after she tweeted that Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, is 'anti Jewish' and supports Sharia law.</p><p>Facebook also banned Loomer, who is running for a Florida congressional seat as a Republican.</p><p>In March 2019, U.S District Judge Trevor McFadden said their suit raises 'non-trivial concerns' but didn't tie these concerns to viable legal claims. </p><p>'We believe that free speech and the right to engage in commerce are foundational to the American free enterprise system,' a Chamber official said in a statement, the New York Times reported. </p><p>'Regardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States. An executive order cannot be properly used to change federal law.' </p><p>'This executive order, likely unconstitutional, is also intended to distract the public's attention away from the fact that there are now over 100,000 Covid-related deaths across the country and an economy that is sinking to Great Depression levels,' said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in a statement. </p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order 'a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.'</p><p>Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order was 'more about political theater than about changing the law.'</p><p>The order 'is not legally supportable - it flies in the face of more than 900 court decisions,' Goldman said.</p><p>Despite Trump's approving tweet about Zuckerberg, Facebook issued a statement saying limiting the section of communications law would have the opposite effect of protecting free speech.</p><p>'Facebook is a platform for diverse views. We believe in protecting freedom of expression on our services, while protecting our community from harmful content including content designed to stop voters from exercising their right to vote,' it said, NBC news reported on Twitter. </p><p>'Those rules apply to everybody. Repealing or limiting section 230 will have the opposite effect. It will restrict more speech online, not less. </p><p>'By exposing companies to potential liability for everything that billions of people around the world say, this would penalize companies that choose to allow controversial speech and encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone.'</p><p>The order says it received 16,000 responses of alleged bias and suggests that they will form part of the Federal Trade Commission's investigation. </p><p>The order also requires the attorney general to establish a working group including state attorneys general that will examine the enforcement of state laws that prohibit online platforms from engaging in unfair and deceptive acts. </p><p>And it says the AG's group should look into who carries out factchecks for social media platforms and whether they have 'indicia of bias.'</p><p>And federal agencies are to be told to review their advertising on social media platforms, which was worth $1.5 billion in the last decade. Trump described it as 'billions and billions of dollars.'</p><p>Section 230 of the 1996 law is a shield against social media networks being sued for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>It says: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.' </p><p>It also says that: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.' </p><p>A publisher or speaker can normally be sued for defamation for the contents of their speech but by not being categorized as those, any attempt to sue social media giants for what is written on them falls at the first hurdle.</p><p>The 1996 statute has allowed Silicon Valley to make billions of dollars from their users' posts, photos and videos, with minimal legal liability, while giving them freedom to remove anything they see as 'objectionable.' </p><p>When it was written social media did not exist.</p><p>Since its explosive growth, platforms including Twitter and Facebook have changed repeatedly.</p><p>Their algorithms decide the order in which users see new posts, and can be used to make particular content more or less visible.</p><p>That has led critics to say that they are behaving as publishers - deciding what people read or see - and not simply as forums.</p><p>The rest of the act gives forums powers to set standards for content, which social media platforms have used as a basis for moderating content and to justify the existence of algorithms. </p><p>Conservatives - and many others outside mainstream thought on matters like history, climate change and even the coronavirus - have criticized the use of Section 230 claiming big tech has censored content without being subject to scrutiny. </p><p>Republican senators Marco Rubio (FL) and Josh Hawley (MO) were among those who slammed Twitter for putting its fact-checking flag on the president's tweets.</p><p>Rubio said: 'The law still protects social media companies like @Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers. </p><p>'But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher then they should no longer be shielded from liability &amp; treated as publishers under the law.' </p><p>Hawley, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it 'raises serious questions about whether Twitter targeted the President for political reasons.' </p><p>There is however zero possibility of a Democratic House passing reforms to the law itself.</p><p>That leaves Trump trying to use the powers of the executive branch.</p><p>The order also puts a prohibition on federal tax dollars going to online platforms that 'violate free speech principles.' </p><p>But a report last February showed the feds spent just $8 million on social media ads in 2018. </p><p>The idea of broadening the platforms' legal exposure carried more weight. </p><p>Under the order, the Commerce Secretary would file a petition for new FCC rule-making. It would make platforms liable when actions are 'deceptive, pretextrual, or inconsistent with a provider's terms of service,' or when taken with 'inadequate notice' or by an 'unreasoned explanation.' </p><p>Trump himself has made ample use of lawsuits and legal threats over his career. USA found in 2016 Trump and his companies had been involved in 3,500 lawsuits over three decades.</p><p>Trump's moves brought immediate pushback. </p><p>'This is simply setting the wheels of law enforcement and regulation in motion against a private company for questioning the president,' said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, according to the Washington Post. </p><p>Added former FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, 'Social media can be frustrating. But an executive order that would turn the Federal Communications Commission into the president's speech police is not the answer.' </p><p>Jesse Blumenthal, head of the Koch-backed Stand Together group, said it was 'just nonsense' to try to rewrite a clear statute through an executive order. </p><p>The rule's first section contains language that is more political than technical, following reports the administration rushed to put it out.</p><p>It calls free speech 'the bedrock of American democracy' and says having a limited number of platforms 'hand-pick' speech is 'fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.' </p><p>Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro tweeted: 'Here's the inevitable effect ... all comments sections will be taken down. No website has the resources to actively edit all comments in order to shield themselves from liability, and no website is willing to leave comments entirely standards-free.'</p><p>Pachter said that fact-checking 'is a stupid idea on Twitter's part' and that instead they should just delete tweets which are reported, warn the offender or suspend them for breaking its rules. </p><p>Trump had claimed Wednesday in a Twitter thread that conservatives are being silenced and disproportionately regulated on social media websites like Twitter and Facebook as Twitter issued 'misleading' warning labels on two of his tweets about mail-in voting on Tuesday.</p><p>'Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,' the president posted to his Twitter Wednesday morning. 'We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that happen again.'</p><p>The warning was issued after Trump reacted with fury to having two of his tweets labelled as misleading, with links to news articles suggesting they were false attached. </p><p>Responding to the 'fact checking' Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale said: 'We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters.</p><p>'Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility. There are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them.' </p><p>In contrast, Twitter's Jack Dorsey refused to take down the president's tweets where he touted a debunked conspiracy theory that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of a staffer when he was a Republican U.S. congressman from Florida. </p><p>Twitter users, including some Republicans, did not react kindly to the president suggesting increased regulations on social media websites.</p><p>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg goes after Twitter for its fact-checking of Trump                    </p><p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg criticized competitor Twitter on Thursday after it 'fact-checked' tweets from Donald Trump.</p><p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey immediately fired back saying that the site would continue to call out 'incorrect or disputed information' about elections shared by users. </p><p>In his interview with Fox, Facebook's Zuckerberg said that it was not the place of the company to act as an 'arbiter of truth'.</p><p>'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' he said.</p><p>'I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,' he added.</p><p>'Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.'</p><p>Dorsey tweeted: 'Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me. Please leave our employees out of this. We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make,' he wrote. </p><p>'Per our Civic Integrity policy, the tweets yesterday may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot (only registered voters receive ballots),' he added. 'We're updating the link on @RealDonaldTrump's tweet to make this more clear.'</p><p>Michael Pachter, research analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told Fox Business: 'Twitter came up with a rule that applies to one person ...</p><p>'They're not treating (Trump) the way they treat everybody else. They came up with a separate set of rules just for him, which is fact-checking, because they're too afraid of his bullying to delete the tweet or suspend him.' </p><p>Prominent conservative Margot Cleveland, whose work has been featured in several right leaning news publications, weighed in claiming any private organization has the right to decide what speech can and cannot be featured on their platform.</p><p>'Pro Tip: Saying Twitter is violating your constitutional right to free speech or your First Amendment rights is wacko b/c Twitter ain't the government,' Cleveland wrote Wednesday morning. 'Saying Twitter is 'stifling free speech' isn't. Powerful private organizations can &amp; do stifle speech.' </p><p>Trump critic and Republican George Conway, who is married to White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway, reposted a message from the State Department spokeswoman that contradicted the president's tweet.</p><p>'The State Department's spokesperson, a couple of hours after the President of the United States suggested that the government may 'strongly regulate' social media platforms or 'close them down,'' Conway wrote as a lead up.</p><p>Morgan Ortagus tweeted from the official State Department spokesperson account: 'Governments that restrict internet access deprive their citizens of the information they need to stay safe. #FreedomOfExpression both online and offline is vital, especially during COVID-19. @StateDept is proud to be an active member of the @FO_Coalition.' </p><p>Kellyanne Conway criticized Twitter for flagging the tweets, lashing out at Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site Integrity, during an interview with Fox &amp; Friends Wednesday.</p><p>She even cited his Twitter handle on live television to make sure Republicans knew where to direct their complaints.</p><p>'This guy is constantly attacking Trump voters, Trump, Mitch McConnell, you name it. He's the head of integrity at Twitter,' Conway lamented.</p><p>'It's horrible the way he looks at people who should otherwise have a free and clear platform on Twitter.' </p><p>Trump also re-asserted his flagged tweets' theme in his Wednesday morning tweet: 'Just like we can't let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country.'</p><p>Trump views that mail-in ballots will increase the chances of voter fraud - and benefit Democrats in 2020.</p><p>'It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots,' Trump insisted. 'Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!' </p><p>On Tuesday, the president tweeted that California's mail-in balloting initiative would lead to substantial voter fraud in the November general election.</p><p>                     Biased head of Twitter's 'Site Integrity' has previously called the President 'a racist tangerine'                    </p><p> Yoel Roth, whose official title at Twitter is head of Site Integrity, faced backlash on Wednesday after his history of anti-Trump tweets emerged less than 24 hours after the social media giant put a fact-checking warning on two of the president's tweets. </p><p>In a January 2017 tweet, Roth referred to the Trump administration as 'actual Nazis in the White House' and tweeted in November 2016 that fly over states were racist.</p><p>He also compared Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway to Nazi Joseph Goebbels saying: ''Today on Meet The Press, we're speaking with Joseph Goebbels about the first 100 days...' - What I hear whenever Kellyanne is on a news show.'</p><p>The majority of Roth's tweets criticizing Trump and his administration were posted around 2017.</p><p>Roth started working at Twitter in 2015 as a product trust partner, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>He has been in his current role as head of site integrity for almost two years.</p><p>Conway, who is a counselor to Trump, lashed out at Roth in an interview with Fox &amp; Friends on Wednesday and went as far as giving out his Twitter handle on live television.</p><p>'This guy is constantly attacking Trump voters, Trump, Mitch McConnell, you name it. He's the head of integrity at Twitter,' Conway said.</p><p>'It's horrible the way he looks at people who should otherwise have a free and clear platform on Twitter.' </p><p>'There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed,' Trump wrote Tuesday morning.</p><p>He then insinuated that non-citizens would be able to obtain ballots.</p><p>'The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one,' he continued in the Twitter rant. 'That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote.'</p><p>Trump ended the two-tweet tirade by saying, 'This will be a Rigged Election.'</p><p>'No way!' said Trump, who votes in Florida absentee.</p><p>The president used a mail-in ballot to vote in the Florida primary last month - a move his administration has defended since he cannot show up for in-person voting while living in Washington, D.C.</p><p>By Tuesday afternoon, Twitter had flagged the tweets with a blue exclamation mark prompting users to 'get the facts about mail-in ballots.'</p><p>Another page on the social media site called Trump's tweets 'unsubstantiated,' according to fact-checkers from CNN, Washington Post and other news outlets.</p><p>'These tweets contain potentially misleading information about voting processes and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail-in ballots,' a statement from Twitter read. </p><p>Following the move from Twitter, Trump used the social media site he is attacking to decry its decision to label his tweets 'misleading' and accused them of 'stifling free speech.' </p><p>He threatened the tech giant, stating he wouldn't allow it to continue.</p><p>'@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post,' Trump wrote Tuesday night.</p><p>'Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!' he asserted.</p><p>Trump's 2020 campaign was quick to slam the move.</p><p>'We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters. Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility. There are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them,' campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. </p><p>For weeks Trump has said that states, not wanting to expose the voting public to COVID-19, shouldn't be implementing full-scale mail-in balloting plans. </p><p>The president has drawn a distinction between absentee ballots, which he said can be used for special purposes, and governors sending every American voter a ballot to send back in. </p><p>'I have to do an absentee because I'm voting in Florida and I happen to be president and I live in that beautiful house over there that's painted white,' he said in the Rose Garden Tuesday. </p><p>Trump's tweets came after the Republican National Committee and two other GOP groups filed a lawsuit Sunday against California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had signed an executive order to use mail-in ballots for the November election. </p><p>'In California the governor, I hear, is sending millions of ballots all over the state. Millions, to anybody. People that aren't citizens, illegals, anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot,' Trump said at the White House Tuesday.</p><p>'We are not going to destroy this county by allowing things like that to happen. We're not destroying our country,' he added. </p><p>Republicans long have been suspicious that making voting easier would elect more Democrats. Young people, for instance, tend to tilt more Democratic, but are also less likely to vote in-person. </p><p>California was the first state in the country to commit to sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters for the November election, a move responding to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>'Democrats continue to use this pandemic as a ploy to implement their partisan election agenda, and Governor Newsom's executive order is the latest direct assault on the integrity of our elections,' Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. </p><p>'No state that conducts all-mail elections automatically mails ballots to inactive voters because it invites fraud, coercion, theft, and otherwise illegitimate voting,' it added.</p><p>The lawsuit asks for Newsom's order to be barred as unlawful and was filed by the RNC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the California Republican Party.</p><p>Numerous studies have found little evidence of voter fraud connected to voting by mail. Democrats say it is necessary to counter health risks from the coronavirus by helping to prevent crowds at polling places.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-63257269</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-W2B1-JCJY-G18V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8556\"/><timeReceived>12:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Twitter has restricted his account from posting or retweeting for 12 hours.\u00a0</p><p>Donald Trump himself also shared the video, which was removed and replaced with a label from Twitter saying it was \u201cno longer available\u201d.\u00a0He did not face the same action as his son, Twitter said, because he retweeted the video rather than posting it himself. </p><p>The decisions follow similar takedowns of the video by Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube, just a day before their respective chief executives, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, will <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e26d31f-9cff-4b3b-a971-02e16996c190\"> testify before Congress</url>. </p><p>While the hearings are focused on antitrust issues, some Republicans have made clear they wish to discuss whether social media platforms have censored political voices, particularly conservative ones.\u00a0</p><p>Social media platforms face mounting pressure from activists to police their sites more effectively and clamp down on potentially dangerous coronavirus-related misinformation. </p><p>The controversial 45-minute video shared by the president\u2019s son shows a coalition of doctors called \u201cAmerica\u2019s Frontline Doctors\u201d arguing that hydroxychloroquine is a cure for coronavirus and that masks and shutdowns are not necessary.\u00a0</p><p>The group, whose website was created less than two weeks ago, appears to be affiliated with an arm of the conservative Tea Party called the Tea Party Patriots, which hosted and promoted the content.</p><p>Multiple clips of the video were posted by rightwing news network Breitbart on Facebook on Monday, garnering more than 14m views in a matter of hours before the social media platform removed them for \u201csharing false information about cures and treatments for COVID-19\u201d.</p><p>The videos were also removed from Google\u2019s YouTube for claiming a guaranteed cure for Covid, as well as \u201cexplicitly [disputing] the efficacy of local healthy authority recommended guidance on social distancing that may lead others to act against that guidance\u201d, the company said in a statement.\u00a0</p><p>Mr Trump has downplayed the severity of the pandemic, urging state governors to loosen lockdown restrictions and only occasionally donning a mask in public. However, as disapproval over his handling of the pandemic has grown, he has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb58a24a-c22f-44a4-89a7-61d5385c8728\"> changed his tone</url>, saying last week that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3d30bad-56cf-4aff-99ab-170bfe03d84f\"> pandemic</url> will \u201cget worse before it gets better\u201d.</p><p>But in another apparent U-turn, the president has returned to promoting antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the virus, despite having been flagged as risky by US drugs regulators. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5e2b974-b73d-4acf-83a4-def46b57b428\"> revoked</url> its emergency approval for the as-yet untested drug.\u00a0</p><p>The US president has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/700a5c43-64de-4ac6-a79e-b343ef7e2457\"> openly sparred</url> with internet platforms such as Twitter, crying censorship after they added warning labels to some of his posts for violating rules on misinformation and hateful speech.\u00a0</p><p>Commenting on the decision by Twitter to restrict the account of Mr Trump Jr, Andrew Surabian, a Republican strategist and adviser to the president\u2019s son, said: \u201cBig Tech is the biggest threat to free expression in America today &amp; they\u2019re continuing to engage in open election interference \u2014 full stop.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-d727206808b344b390f56cca2b6c096b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FX-JXY1-DXP9-91P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"600\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It represents his latest attempt to use the tools of the presidency to force private companies to change policies that he believes are not favourable to him.</p><p>\"In terms of presidential efforts to limit critical commentary about themselves, I think one would have to go back to the Sedition Act of 1798 - which made it illegal to say false things about the president and certain other public officials - to find an attack supposedly rooted in law by a president on any entity which comments or prints comments about public issues and public people,\" said First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams.</p><p>Jack Balkin, a Yale University constitutional law professor, said \"the president is trying to frighten, coerce, scare, cajole social media companies to leave him alone and not do what\u00a0Twitter\u00a0has just done to him.\"</p><p>Trump, who uses\u00a0Twitter\u00a0virtually every day to promote his policies and insult his opponents, has long claimed without evidence that the site is biased in favour of Democrats. He and his supporters have leveled the same unsubstantiated charges against Facebook, which Trump's presidential campaign uses heavily as an advertising vehicle.</p><p>On Thursday, Trump said there is nothing he would rather do than get rid of his\u00a0Twitter\u00a0account but he had to keep it in order to circumvent the press and get his version of events to millions of followers.</p><p>He took to\u00a0Twitter\u00a0again Thursday night to cast doubt around voting by mail, tweeting the practice would lead to \"MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE\" and \"THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY.\"</p><p>The protections of Section 230 have been under fire for different reasons from lawmakers including Big Tech critic Senator Josh Hawley. Critics argue that they give internet companies a free pass on things like hate speech and content that supports terror organisations.</p><p>Social media companies have been under pressure from many quarters, both in the United States and other countries, to better control misinformation and harmful content on their services.</p><p>Twitter\u00a0Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on the company's website late Wednesday that the president's tweets \"may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot.

The FTC is probing the company for using phone numbers uploaded for security purposes to target people with advertising \u2013 a potential violation of a 2011 consent decree in which Twitter agreed to better protect personal data, the company said Monday in a regulatory filing. The probe may lead to a \u201cprobable loss\u201d of US$150mil (RM632.62mil) to US$250mil (RM1.05bil), the San Francisco-based company said.    \u201cThe matter remains unresolved and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome,\u201d Twitter said.    Twitter\u2019s 2011 settlement with the FTC barred the company for 20 years from \u201cmisleading consumers about the extent to which it protects the security, privacy, and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information\u201d. The agreement sprang from a 2009 hack of the social media platform that allowed intruders to send out phony messages from any account, among other issues. Under the settlement, the company also had to honor users\u2019 privacy choices and faced fines of as much as US$16,000 (RM67,480) per violation of the order in the future, the FTC said at the time.    A spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment.    Twitter\u2019s shares fell about 1% in extended trading after closing at US$36.39 (RM153.47) in New York. The stock has gained 14% this year.    \u201cFollowing the announcement of our Q2 financial results, we received a draft complaint from the FTC alleging violations of our 2011 consent order,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said. \u201cFollowing standard accounting rules we included an estimated range for settlement.\u201d    The FTC has been fining big tech platforms in recent years for data lapses, including the recent record US$5bil (RM21.08bil) fine against Facebook Inc and a settlement with Google\u2019s YouTube over alleged collection of children\u2019s data that included a US$170mil (RM716.97mil) fine.    Twitter confirmed in 2019 that it was using phone numbers provided to the company for security purposes to target those users with advertising. At the time, Twitter said those numbers were used \u201cinadvertently\u201d, and added that it did not know how many people were affected. The current complaint alleges the company violated the terms of the agreement by misusing phone numbers or emails \u201cduring periods between 2013 and 2019\u201d, according to the filing.    It\u2019s unknown if Twitter will face a similar investigation for a high-profile incident last month in which hackers took control of the accounts of some of the service\u2019s most famous users as part of a Bitcoin scam. That attackers gained access to 130 Twitter accounts, including those of former US president Barack Obama, current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and Tesla Inc chief executive officer Elon Musk. Hackers accessed the direct messages linked to 36 of those accounts, and downloaded the personal data from seven of them, Twitter said.    Twitter said a hacker gained access to the accounts in part by tricking some employees over the phone. Three people were charged last week in the attack. \u2013 Bloomberg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

And the president was first accused of the platform of inciting violence and was subjected to fact-checking, while unrest spreads across the country. Citizens are organizing protests over the murder of George Floyd in police custody and are spreading information and opinions through social media, while hundreds of users were blocked from spreading false statements.</p><p><br/>Investors, however, largely ignored Trump's dispute with Twitter last week, considering it only noise. While major legislative changes are unlikely given the proximity of a presidential election, analysts say social media and big tech companies could be subject to more regulations next year, particularly if Joe Biden makes it to the White House.<br/>\"The policy is ready for change\" from companies like Twitter and Facebook Inc., Stefanie Miller, co-founder of Sandhill Strategy, said in a phone interview. \"Universally, people don't trust these companies\" and both Republicans and Democrats are increasingly upset by the broad reach of social media, privacy intrusions, and their role in enacting or deleting certain opinions, Miller said.<br/>He added that a Democratic government could bring significant changes, especially if hairless lawmakers on the tongue, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters, will set Biden's agenda. Warren has asked big tech companies to fight misinformation and last fall, she paid Facebook ads claiming Mark Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump as president to illustrate the dangers of not verifying political announcements. Waters said at a controversial Financial Services Committee hearing with Zuckerberg in October that \"Facebook has allowed election interference\" and that it \"violated civil rights laws.\"<br/>Sarah Bianchi, a policy analyst at Evercore ISI, said Trump's executive order last week aimed at weakening social media companies was \"an important warning.\" She considers that an amendment to Section 230, the part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 that states that Internet platforms are not responsible for user content, is \"the greatest risk to the technology industry\".<br/>Although the order came from Trump, some Democrats, including Biden, Warren and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, \"have their own complaints about Section 230,\" Bianchi said in a note, \"because it allows false information to be kept.\"<br/>He added that the situation is \"about to get worse,\" as social media companies will be forced to take on the role of referees in a heated election cycle.<br/>Michael Pachter, a technology analyst at Wedbush Securities, doubts that Congress will reverse Section 230, particularly before the election, and is unlikely to change Trump's behavior on Twitter.<br/>\"It's likely that he'll continue to tweet fake and deceptive things that violate Twitter rules,\" Pachter said by email. \"Twitter is (finally) doing its job and trying to maintain an appearance of integrity.\"<br/>(Disclaimer: Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, also sought the Democratic presidential nomination. He supported Joe Biden on the 4thMarch).<br/>Original Note:Twitter Faces a Bind, From Trump or Biden: Wall Street Votes<br/>\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-12552981</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6024-2FH1-JBJN-M4RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"564\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 2, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00023S9</classCode><className>MILLER CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Critics of US President Donald Trump have called for Twitter to ban him, but the social network has resisted. Offending tweets will now be put behind a special warning that states that they break the rules but are available because it is in the public interest. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. Twitter says it is going to put warnings on tweets by politicians and world leaders that violate its rules, amid ongoing calls for Donald Trump to be banned from the social network. </p><p>The US President is notorious for his prolific Twitter habit, and critics have long argued that some of his more incendiary tweets fall foul of Twitter's rules on threatening violence and bullying[3]. The San Francisco-headquartered tech firm has previously rejected the idea that Trump's comments were banworthy, arguing that the inherent newsworthiness of his tweets means that they should stay up, regardless of any official rules. On Thursday, Twitter offered a potential compromise[4]\u2014 a new feature that will flag tweets that are rule-violating, but deemed by the company to be in the public interest to remain available. An image of how the warning may look is below. Users will have to click through to actually see the content of the tweet.\"There are certain cases where it may be in the public's interest to have access to certain Tweets, even if they would otherwise be in violation of our rules. On the rare occasions when this happens, we'll place a notice \u2014 a screen you have to click or tap through before you see the Tweet \u2014 to provide additional context and clarity,\" the company wrote in a blog post.  \"We'll also take steps to make sure the Tweet is not algorithmically elevated on our service, to strike the right balance between enabling free expression, fostering accountability, and reducing the potential harm caused by these Tweets.\" Twitter did not mention Trump by name in the blog post announcing the new policy. The company said that to be eligible for the warning treatment, a tweet needs to come from a government official or someone running for public office, have more than 100,000 followers on Twitter, and be verified. The feature will not be retroactive, Twitter says, so don't expect to see controversial old tweets from Trump appended with this warning. Twitter said that a \"cross-functional\" team including representives from its legal, public policy and safety departments will determine which tweets meet the criteria for the warning treatment, based on a number of guidelines including: The immediacy and severity of potential harm from the rule violation, with an emphasis on ensuring physical safety Whether preserving a Tweet will allow others to hold the government official, candidate for public office, or appointee accountable for their statements While the policy aims to strike a middle ground, it's likely to draw criticism from right-wing commentators who claim that internet platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Google are trying to silence conservative voices. Numerous commentators, as well as President Trump[5], on the right have accused Twitter of \"shadown banning\" prominent conservatives, making it more difficult for users to see their content. Twitter has said it does not do shadow bans.

US President Donald Trump[2] has repeatedly called the 'New York Times' newspaper the enemy of the people, most recently on April 5th. The recommendation happens regardless of whether or not you're following the @NYTimes account, and requires the user to type \"People\" with a capital P. Some Twitter users noticed Wednesday that the social media platform automatically associates the phrase \"Enemy of the People\" with the official New York Times Twitter account, a seemingly strange phenomenon that's fanning the flames of speculation in the current overheated political climate. </p><p>In fact, Twitter is not just associating \"Enemy of the People\" with the 168-year-old newspaper. Typing \"Friend of the People\" will also trigger as a suggestion to tag the @NYTimes account. As will simply typing the word \"People\" - so long as the P is uppercase. So what's going on? It's not entirely clear yet and Twitter has not responded to comments from Business Insider seeking an explanation. But there are some potential explanations, most of which are more about the problems with algorithms than overt political bias. President Donald Trump has repeatedly used that phrase \"Enemy of the People\" to attack the Times and the media at large, prompting many other users to do the same when tagging news outlets like the New York Times and CNN in their tweets. It's possible that Twitter's algorithms have inferred a connection with the word \"people\" and the New York Times, prompting Twitter to auto-suggest the newspaper whenever the word is typed into a tweet. Remember, as it stands, any tweet that includes the word \"people\" will recommend the New York Times tag. The connection was first noticed by Washington Post editor Jacob Brogan[3], and other Twitter users noticed the broader association between the word People and the New York Times. It's also worth noting that the recommendation only seems to pop up when accessing Twitter on desktop browsers; the mobile app and desktop programs like TweetDeck do not appear to share the issue. For those using their browser, the recommendation will appear regardless of whether or not you follow The New York Times on Twitter.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1114221533461790721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw The press is doing everything within their power to fight the magnificence of the phrase, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! They can't stand the fact that this Administration has done more than virtually any other Administration in its first 2yrs. They are truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!;We'll update the story with more information as soon as we hear more from Twitter.NOW WATCH: Watch Google's Stadia video-game-platform event in 5 minutes[4]See

It is about getting re-elected - and there are few better ways to rally his base than to rail on California liberals in Silicon Valley. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president has little to lose by taking a shot at the San Francisco tech company and outfits such as Facebook because the Bay Area, as well as Silicon Valley and California in general, overwhelmingly supports Democrats, contributes to their campaigns and dislikes Trump. So Trump revs up his base by ripping on Big Tech - even though Big Tech helped get him elected. </p><p>Who said that? Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale. </p><p>Parscale said the Trump campaign raised much of its $250 million online haul in 2016 through a robust Facebook advertising push. He also said Trump had masterfully used Twitter to steer the media narrative during the campaign. The president is still using his 80 million-follower Twitter feed to shape the story - his feud with Jack Dorsey and company is competing this week for top billing with the nearly unfathomable milestone of 100,000 Americans killed by COVID-19.</p><p>\"Facebook and Twitter were the reason we won this thing,\" <url normalizedValue=\"http://Parscale told Wired\">Parscale told Wired</url>magazine in the days after Trump's 2016 election. \"Twitter for Mr. Trump. And Facebook for fundraising.\"</p><p>But that sort of nuance doesn't rile up Trump's GOP base. Railing on tech companies as biased against conservatives does.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"http://Morning Consult poll last year\">Morning Consult poll last year</url>of Republicans found that 48% felt Facebook was biased against conservatives and 36% felt Twitter was anti-conservative. And that was before       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://Twitter stuck &#34;fact checks&#34;\">Twitter stuck \"fact checks\"</url> debunking a pair of Trump's tweets this week making incorrect claims about California's plans to have a nearly all-mail election in November. That's what triggered Trump's order Thursday that would remove a provision of a 24-year-old federal law protecting tech companies from lawsuits over content on their platforms. </p><p>\"We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers,\" Trump said before signing the order, referring to the \"tech monopoly\" that has \"unchecked power.\" </p><p>To Trump, railing on Silicon Valley generates the same reaction as pounding other \"elites\" like the media and Democratic governors who don't want to open the their states for business quickly enough. It's a well-worn tactic that has kept his conservative base with him through three-plus years in office.</p><p>\"California is an easy target for conservatives because of the image that we're 'freaky San Francisco' and Hollywood people,\" said Donnie Fowler, a former Democratic operative who has worked to bridge the gap between Silicon Valley and Washington for two decades and is now the CEO at Tech4America. \"It reinforces their messages.\"</p><p>Trump's latest blast at Silicon Valley started with another shot at California. On Tuesday, Trump took on Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to mail ballots to all California voters for the November election, breaking at least temporarily from the detente the two had stuck to during the pandemic.</p><p>Trump tweeted that \"there is NO WAY ZERO! that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed.\"</p><p>Twitter pointed out, accurately in its fact check, that that is false. Evidence of voter fraud \"is very rare\" anywhere, including California, UC Irvine election law Professor Rick Hasen told The Chronicle's \"It's All Political\" podcast. </p><p>\"In the five states that use all-mail balloting - which include some heavily Republican states like Utah - the amount of election crime generally is very low,\" Hasen said. </p><p>That didn't matter to the president. Trump exploded after Twitter attached its fact check, tweeting that \"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom.\" </p><p>But Zack Graves, policy director at the libertarian-leaning Lincoln Network think tank that links Silicon Valley and Washington, said there's a disconnect between how many Republicans feel about bias at technology companies and how they feel about regulating them. </p><p>That <url normalizedValue=\"http://Morning Consult poll last year\">Morning Consult poll last year</url> of Republicans, which his group commissioned, found that 41% of respondents agreed that \"technology platforms should be free from government regulation regardless of political or ideological bias, because they are private companies.\" Forty percent said tech companies \"need to be regulated by the government to stop political or ideological bias.\"</p><p>\"My view is that conservatives are not upset by content moderation itself, they're distrustful of progressives in San Francisco having massive and opaque power over it,\" Graves said in an email Thursday.</p><p>Harvard government Professor Thomas Patterson doesn't think Trump \"is that fearful of Twitter. It's just a good excuse to go after them.\" </p><p>\"But he is very fearful, and rightfully so, of vote by mail,\" said Patterson, author of <url normalizedValue=\"http://the new book\">the new book</url> \"Is the Republican Party Destroying Itself? And Why It Needs to Reclaim Its Conservative Ideals.\" </p><p>Why? Patterson thinks it's because Trump believes it could hurt his re-election chances by making it easier for more people to vote. </p><p>\"If you ever agreed to it,\" Trump told Fox News in March, \"you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.\" </p><p>That, too, is untrue. Just ask California's newest member of Congress, Rep. Mike Garcia. The Republican businessman <url normalizedValue=\"http://easily won\">easily won</url> a nearly all-mail House election in Southern California this month, flipping a seat that had been held by a Democrat, just hours after Trump told reporters that mail-in ballots were       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://&#34;subject to tremendous corruption.\">\"subject to tremendous corruption.</url>Tremendous corruption, cheating.\" </p><p>\"And so,\" the president said, \"I'm against it.\"</p><p>\"  Conservatives are not upset by content moderation itself, they re distrustful of progressives in San Francisco having massive and opaque power over it.

That represents a pay rise, after Dorsey declined any compensation or benefits for three years running. Dorsey also declined equity compensation again in 2018. The company described this as \"testament to his commitment to and belief in\" Twitter as a product. </p><p>Dorsey isn't poor, since he holds half a billion dollars' worth of Twitter stock and sold shares in his other company, Square. Visit BusinessInsider.com for more stories[1]. Jack Dorsey earns next to nothing for his main day job. The Twitter CEO took home just $1.40 as his salary in 2018 to run the social network, according to a company filing published late on Monday. He declined all other compensation and benefits for the year. The paltry salary is in keeping with previous years, when Dorsey declined to take any payment at all. The $1.40 figure may be symbolic too, given Twitter's origins as a service for posting updates of 140 characters, now extended to 280 characters.

As a testament to his commitment to and belief in Twitter's long-term value creation potential, our CEO, Jack Dorsey, declined all compensation and benefits for 2015, 2016 and 2017, and in 2018 he declined all compensation and benefits other than a salary of $1.40.\"This doesn't mean Jack Dorsey is poor, however. He holds more than 16 million Twitter shares, according to a 2017 filing, worth $557 million at the current share price[3]. He also earns money from his second day job as CEO of payments firm Square. He offloaded Square stock through 2018, worth a total of $80 million according to Forbes[4]. He isn't the only Silicon Valley heavyweight to decline a salary. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg takes an annual salary of $1, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he won't accept a paycheck[5] until his firm hits a $100 billion market cap. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel also earns $1, although he takes stock compensation and other benefits[6]. The idea behind the low salary is to show these CEOs have faith in their company, and all four are major shareholders in their firms. Ev Williams, Twitter's cofounder and another major shareholder, did take home more from the company in 2018. According to the filing, he took $275,000 as his fee in 2018 and sold off Twitter stock through 2018. Twitter announced Williams was stepping off the board in February. Another board member, British entrepreneur Martha Lane Fox, took home $70,000 in fees and stock awards worth $225,000. A third, former Google CFO Patrick Pichette, earned $80,000 in fees and $225,000 in stock awards.

But what do you do when that misinformation is coming from the president? For weeks, President Trump has claimed without evidence that mail-in voting is full of fraud and that Democrats are trying to rig the election. For the first time, Twitter took action yesterday against the president, adding links to fact checks on two of the president's tweets. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This morning, President Trump - well, he took to Twitter again to say, quote, \"Republicans feel that social media platforms totally silence conservative voices. We will strongly regulate or close them down before we can ever allow this to happen,\" end quote. </p><p>NPR's Bobby Allyn has been covering this. We spoke earlier, and I asked Bobby to explain the tweets that prompted Twitter to act. </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN: So Trump promoted a conspiracy theory that voting by mail is just full of fraud. It's not the first time he's made that claim. But yesterday, it gained a lot of attention because Twitter took action. And again, this is a baseless claim. There's no evidence to back it up. And Twitter, for the first time, put a label on the tweet saying as much. It's a blue exclamation point, and it directs readers to find out the facts about mail-in voting. And it offers a link. You can click the link, and you're sent to reliable news coverage about the issue. </p><p>DAVID GREENE: Well, I guess the big question I have is, why now? I mean, this is not the first time the president has tweeted something that fact-checkers just jumped on and said was just not true. </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN: Yeah. So the action really illustrates a major shift at Twitter. You know, earlier this month, Twitter made a big announcement that it was going to start basically policing misinformation and disputed claims and unverified tweets about the coronavirus and that it would label some of those tweets regardless of the speaker. This is a major shift because for a long time, Twitter said if you're a world leader, like President Trump, Twitter would take a hands-off approach to tweets. And that garnered, you know, widespread criticism. </p><p>So this is basically Twitter making good on its promise that no matter who you are, if you say something on Twitter that is unproven, Twitter will take action by slapping a warning label on it. And that's exactly what happened with Trump yesterday. </p><p>I talked to David Kay. He is a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and he specializes in freedom of expression issues. </p><p>DAVID KAY: If they don't respond to either disinformation or extremism or whatever it might be, they know that they're going to face some very serious regulation that's going to influence their ability to - really to maintain their platforms the way that they want. </p><p>DAVID GREENE: But I mean, Bobby, how does a company like Twitter pick and choose? I mean, we should say this also comes at a time when the president has been sending out these false tweets about the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough that's gotten a lot of attention. </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN: Yeah. It's hard to talk about this move by Twitter without talking about that. So the backstory here is Scarborough, who is a former GOP congressman, has often sparred with the president. In a recent tweet, Trump falsely linked Scarborough to the 2001 death of a woman who once worked for Scarborough. The president's tweet was roundly criticized. The conservative-leaning editorial board of The Wall Street Journal was shocked by it. They wrote it shows Trump debasing his office. The widower of the woman who died pleaded with Twitter to remove the post, but Twitter has refused. </p><p>So the growing pressure for Twitter to do something about the Scarborough tweet came on the heels of Twitter placing a disclaimer on the mail-in voting tweet, perhaps as a way to relieve some of that pressure for deciding not to act on the Scarborough post. </p><p>DAVID GREENE: So Bobby, tell me about how the president is responding to all of this. </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN: The president, fittingly enough, took to Twitter and, you know, basically said that Twitter was interfering in the 2020 presidential election, which is quite the claim, and also said that Twitter was stifling his free speech. A campaign manager for Trump said the move shows Silicon Valley is trying to get in the way of Trump getting his message out to voters. </p><p>DAVID GREENE: All right. NPR's Bobby Allyn. Bobby, thanks so much. We appreciate it. </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN: Sure. Thanks, David. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-2020052704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C4-50F1-JBKP-Y2T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"754\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Trump's statement that 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts' is now hidden by a warning that it violated Twitter's rules - but the message can be bypassed and the tweet remains live. The president had used Twitter to intervene in the riots which erupted for a third night running following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who had gasped for breath as a police officer knelt on his head. Trump's 1am tweet described the looters as 'thugs' and warned that the federal government would 'assume control' with 'shooting' if necessary after protesters set fire to a police precinct. But Twitter put a warning on the tweet less than three hours later, saying it had 'taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts'. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was informed in advance about the move, which is the latest escalation in Trump's feud with the website after it issued a fact-check warning against him on Tuesday and the president issued an executive order yesterday which seeks to strip social media giants of their legal protections. </p><p>The tweet can no longer be liked or replied to and will not be recommended by Twitter's algorithm, although retweets with comment are still possible - with Trump's message initially hidden. It is still possible to override the warning message and view the tweet, under special rules for government officials which protect the public's right to know what their politicians have said. The president retorted today by accusing Twitter of bias against him and his party, and renewing his vow to regulate the site - after claiming yesterday that he would shut it down if he could. 'Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies and propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States,' Trump said. Twitter had put a fact-checking label on two of Trump's tweets on Tuesday which claimed that mail-in voting in the 2020 election would be 'substantially fraudulent'. Today's red-flag is more a more severe measure because it actually hides the content of the tweet. What is Donald Trump's executive order targeting social media sites? Donald Trump signed an order on Thursday seeking to make social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook liable for the content posted by their users. If enforced, the order would overturn decades of precedent by treating the websites as 'publishers' which could be sued for user-generated content. It could open them up to a flood of lawsuits from anyone who claims to be harmed by content posted online. Currently, the sites are protected by a law known as Section 230 which shields them from liability. Section 230 also allows social platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services' own standards, so long as they are acting in 'good faith.'The author of a book about Section 230 said social media firms have 'based their business models on being large platforms for user content', saying they would not 'exist in their current forms' without the legislation. However, critics argue that Section 230 gives internet companies a free pass on things like hate speech and content that supports terror organizations. Trump signed the order after Twitter placed fact-check warnings on two of his tweets about mail-in voting on Tuesday. Republican senator Josh Hawley said the 'censorship' was relevant to Trump's proposal, because websites which 'editorialize and censor' as Twitter allegedly did should be 'treated like traditional publishers' in law. However, critics saw Trump's order as an act of political revenge against websites which he has long accused of political bias. The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order 'a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.' One ACLU official said the measure could actually harm Trump by encouraging a more cautious Twitter to limit the president's tweets. Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order is 'not legally enforceable'. Twitter said the order was a political move which attacked free speech, while Facebook said the measure would 'encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone'. Trump's full tweet this morning read: 'These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.' The message was a reply to an initial tweet - not red-flagged by Twitter - which took aim at the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis for his handling of the crisis. Twitter announced the 'public interest notice' on the 'shooting' tweet around three hours after Trump had sent the message.The social media giant said Trump's tweet 'violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today'. 'As is standard with this notice, engagements with the tweet will be limited. People will be able to retweet with comment, but will not be able to like, reply or retweet it,' a statement explained. However, Twitter said it is 'in the public interest for the tweet to remain accessible' given its 'relevance to ongoing matters of public importance'. Tweets from elected officials are exempt from the usual rules because there is a 'significant public interest in knowing and being able to discuss their actions and statements', the company's policies say. 'As a result, in rare instances, we may choose to leave up a Tweet from an elected or government official that would otherwise be taken down.' These exemptions are only available to accounts with more than 100,000 followers. Trump has more than 80million. The website told Axios that 'teams within Twitter' had decided to red-flag the president's tweet and that CEO Jack Dorsey was informed before it happened. Twitter's statement about 'historical context' could be a reference to identical comments made by former Miami police chief Walter Headley, who was in charge during deadly riots in 1968. Headley had earlier been quoted as saying: 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts.'Later on Friday morning, the official White House account repeated Trump's original tweet word-for-word, drawing no immediate response from Twitter. The president's threat to looters came after a third night of protests in Minneapolis accompanied by further rallies around the United States. Hundreds of National Guard soldiers were deployed to the streets of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul and Mayor Jacob Frey declared a state of emergency as rioting escalated and cars and buildings were torched across the city. Minneapolis's Third Precinct police station was set on fire and evacuated amid fears it could explode after gas lines were cut.Frey called the looting 'unacceptable' but raged at Trump for 'refusing to take responsibility for your own actions', saying the president 'knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis'. In New York City, NYPD officers were seen brawling on the ground with protesters as at least 70 people were arrested in the city. Protesters in Ohio smashed the windows of the statehouse in downtown Columbus and raided the building, while demonstrators damaged a police cruiser in downtown Los Angeles. In Kentucky, seven people were shot in downtown Louisville during a protest demanding justice for black woman Breonna Taylor who was shot dead by cops in March - a case which has returned to the spotlight after Floyd's death. Floyd, 46, died on Monday after a white police officer pinned him down with his knee despite Floyd pleading that he could not breathe. The latest escalation in the president's row with Twitter comes just hours after he signed an order seeking to scrap legal protections for social media firms, which he accuses of political bias. The order could open Twitter, Facebook and Google up to lawsuits by diluting the legal protection which stops them from being liable for posts on their platforms, and which also allows them to moderate content. Trump's executive order said websites such as Twitter and Facebook 'wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events'. Twitter said the order was a political move which attacked free speech. Trump also praised Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for his criticism of Twitter's decision to fact-check the tweets. 'CEO Mark Zuckerberg is today criticizing Twitter,' Trump wrote before sharing Zuckerberg's statement. 'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' Zuckerberg said in an interview with Fox News.'I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,' he added.'Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.' Zuckerberg has been accused by Democrats of pandering to the President with his comments about censorship so that Facebook will not be targeted. 'Zuckerberg went on Fox News-a hate-for-profit machine that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracy theorists-to talk about how social media platforms should essentially allow politicians to lie without consequences. This is eroding our democracy,' said Senator Elizabeth Warren. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hit harder saying that Trump was using the feud as a distraction from the coronavirus outbreak. [related]'It's outrageous, but it's an outrageous situation,' Pelosi said at a Thursday press conference. 'While Twitter is putting up its fact-check under what the president says about voting, it still won't take off the misrepresentations the president's putting out there.''Facebook, all of them, they're all about making money,' she said. 'Their business model is to make money at the expense of the truth and the facts that they know. And they defend, they defend that.' After highlighting Zuckerberg's statement, Trump asked: 'Did Twitter criticize Obama for his 'you can keep your Dr''?'The president was referring to Obama's during assurance that 'if you like the doctor you have, you can keep your doctor' under the Affordable Care Act which he was struggling to steer through Congress at the time. However, this promise was later abandoned and Obama conceded that some people 'might end up having to switch doctors'. In a later tweet, Trump also renewed his dubious claims about mail-in voter fraud that had earned him the misinformation tag from Twitter in the first place. Trump claimed that mail-in voting - which is high on the agenda because of the risks of voting in person during the pandemic - would lead to 'massive fraud and abuse' as well as the 'end of our great Republican Party'. Twitter did not red-flag yesterday's comments as it had done for his Tuesday tweets, which now appear with a warning sign and a link to 'get the facts about mail-in ballots'. [item name=video id=4377404 style=2 /]Trump accused Twitter of becoming an 'editor with a point of view' and not a 'neutral platform' by fact-checking him. The president also slammed one of its executives, Yoel Roth, its head of user integrity, accusing him of 'fraud' for the fact check. Twitter says he was not involved in it.Asked if he wanted to get rid of Twitter he said: 'If it was legal, if it was able to be legally shut down, I would.' Trump rolled out the tough language as Attorney General Bill Barr looked on and the president signed an order that could expose Twitter and other social media platforms to a barrage of lawsuits. Barr said when firms 'curate' their collection and engage in 'censoring' content firms become 'publishers' and shouldn't be entitled to a legal 'shield.' SECTION 230: THE LAW TRUMP IS TAKING AIM AT OVER CLAIMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA BIAS    Twenty-six words tucked into a 1996 law overhauling telecommunications have allowed companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google to grow into the giants they are today.Those are the words President Donald Trump challenged in an executive order Thursday, one that would strip those protections if online platforms engaged in 'editorial decisions' - including, in the president's view, adding a fact-check warning to one of Trump's tweets.Under the U.S. law, internet companies are generally exempt from liability for the material users post on their networks. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act - itself part of a broader telecom law - provides a legal 'safe harbor' for internet companies.But Trump and other politicians argue that Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity - or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government.Section 230 probably can't be easily dismantled. But if it was, the internet as we know it might cease to exist.Just what is Section 230?If a news site falsely calls you a swindler, you can sue the publisher for libel. But if someone posts that on Facebook, you can't sue the company - just the person who posted it.That's thanks to Section 230, which states that 'no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.'That legal phrase shields companies that can host trillions of messages from being sued into oblivion by anyone who feels wronged by something someone else has posted - whether their complaint is legitimate or not.Section 230 also allows social platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services' own standards, so long as they are acting in 'good faith.'Where did Section 230 come from?The measure's history dates back to the 1950s, when bookstore owners were being held liable for selling books containing 'obscenity,' which is not protected by the First Amendment. One case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, which held that it created a 'chilling effect' to hold someone liable for someone else\u00b4s content.That meant plaintiffs had to prove that bookstore owners knew they were selling obscene books, said Jeff Kosseff, the author of 'The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet,' a book about Section 230.Fast-forward a few decades to when the commercial internet was taking off with services like CompuServe and Prodigy. Both offered online forums, but CompuServe chose not to moderate its, while Prodigy, seeking a family-friendly image, did.CompuServe was sued over that, and the case was dismissed. Prodigy, however, got in trouble. The judge in their case ruled that 'they exercised editorial control - so you're more like a newspaper than a newsstand,' Kosseff said.That didn't sit well with politicians, who worried that outcome would discourage newly forming internet companies from moderating at all. And Section 230 was born.'Today it protects both from liability for user posts as well as liability for any clams for moderating content,' Kosseff said.What happens if Section 230 is limited or goes away?'I don\u00b4t think any of the social media companies would exist in their current forms without Section 230,' Kosseff said. 'They have based their business models on being large platforms for user content.'There are two possible outcomes. Platforms might get more cautious, as Craigslist did following the 2018 passage of a sex-trafficking law that carved out an exception to Section 230 for material that 'promotes or facilitates prostitution.' Craigslist quickly removed its 'personals' section altogether, which wasn't intended to facilitate sex work. But the company didn\u00b4t want to take any chances.This outcome could actually hurt none other than the president himself, who routinely attacks private figures, entertains conspiracy theories and accuses others of crimes.'If platforms were not immune under the law, then they would not risk the legal liability that could come with hosting Donald Trump\u00b4s lies, defamation, and threats,' said Kate Ruane, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.Another possibility: Facebook, Twitter and other platforms could abandon moderation altogether and let the lower common denominator prevail.Such unmonitored services could easily end up dominated by trolls, like 8chan, which is infamous for graphic and extremist content, said Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman. Undoing Section 230 would be an 'an existential threat to the internet,' he said.But Goldman doesn't see the White House order as that kind of threat to the internet, saying it's 'political theater' that will appeal to Trump supporters. 'The president can't override Congress,' he said. ASSOCIATED PRESS 'We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly, and you know what's going on as well as anybody. It's not good,' Trump said before inking the order, which came just days after Twitter for the first time provided what Trump's staff calls a fact-check on his own tweets.Pressed on whether he would in fact seek to use the courts to shut down Twitter, Trump responded: 'I think this: if Twitter were not honorable, if you're going to have a guy like this be your judge and jury I think you shut it down as far as I'm concerned,' in reference to Twitter's 'head of integrity,' who has been revealed to have posted tweets highly critical of Trump and top Republicans. Trump, a billionaire who amassed a branding and real estate empire before running for president, added: 'A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communication in the United States and we know what they are, we don't have to name them, we're going to give you a complete listing.'He continued: 'They've had unchecked power to censure, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.'Trump brought up the 2016 elections as he tore into Twitter - a fact lawyers might try to flag if companies try to claim in court the action is politically motivated.'We can't allow that to happen especially when they go about doing what they're doing,' Trump said. 'Because they're doing things incorrectly. They have points of view. And if we go by that it's actually amazing that there was a success in 2016, but we can't let this continue to happen. It's very, very unfair.''What they're doing is tantamount to monopoly you can say,' Trump claimed. It's tantamount to taking over the airwaves. Can't let it happen. Otherwise we're not going to have a democracy. We're not going to have anything to do with a republic.'Trump also tried to use the power of federal purse strings as pressure, saying we 'are not going in any social media company that repress[es] free speech.' He said the government spends 'billions of dollars on giving them money' and called the firms 'rich enough,' although independent accounts put the total government ad spending far lower.'We're going to be doing none of it or very little of it,' Trump said.Asked if he would consider simply deleting his Twitter account given his concerns, Trump said he would 'do that in a heartbeat' if we had a 'fair press' in the U.S. The language of the order Trump signed specifically singled out Twitter for its decision to flag two of the president's tweets. The platform provided additional information, although it did not take down the tweets. It appeared to have been added since a draft order which was circulated widely in the run-up to the signing. 'Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias,' said the order. 'As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician's tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called 'Site Integrity' has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets.'Schiff is the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a favorite Trump target. Another section singled out four tech platforms - compared to a draft order which did not name Instagram and YouTube. 'Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see,' it said. Still another describes a new government 'working group' that will, among other things, evaluate media organizations with evidence of 'bias' being used to review content. ''Complaints described in section 4(b) of this order will be shared with the working group, consistent with applicable law. The working group shall also collect publicly available information regarding the following: (iv) reliance on third-party entities, including contractors, organizations, and individuals, with indicia of bias to review content,' it says.At least one section that did not appear in a draft form publicly available put new authority under Barr.A section on government expenditures on online ads states: 'The Department of Justice shall review the viewpoint-based speech restrictions imposed by each online platform identified in the report described in subsection (b) of this section and assess whether any online platforms are problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, deception to consumers, or other bad practices.'  A section on the FCC considers a newly-added hedge. 'The FTC shall consider developing a report' on whether complaints alleging a violation of the law implicate its provisions. A draft said the agency would produce the report - effectively giving it an exit from actually producing one.One section has the AG's working group probe an area with a financial angle, whether the platforms' policies act in ways 'that limit the ability of users with particular viewpoints to earn money on the platform compared with other users similarly situated.' The crucial legal section is Trump's order to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to clarify how to enforce regulations under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.That is the federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for users' posts.But the order says that the protection should not apply if companies are 'engaged in editorial conduct' - meaning making a judgment for themselves about how people's points of view are presented.That is what Trump accuses Twitter of doing by fact-checking him, and what conservatives claim happens to their posts which are promoted less than those with more liberal viewpoints. Such a move could open up Twitter, Facebook and other platforms to an avalanche of lawsuits from people claiming their views have been unfairly censored. It also requires the agency to look at whether social media platforms are using 'deceptive' policies to moderate content by not openly declaring how they decide how viewpoints are dealt with.Trump also set up a mechanism allowing Americans to report alleged political censorship or bias by the social media giants which will be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission.The White House tech bias reporting tool will collect complaints of online censorship and submit them to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The order was also rejected by civil liberties groups - and by the Chamber of Commerce, normally a reliable supporter of Republican policy. Anti-conservative bias claims on social media  Facebook internal report admitted bias Facebook last year opened itself to an independent investigation of anti-conservative bias after repeated criticism from Trump.The audit, carried out by former Republican Senator Jon Kyl and others, found that the tech giant was still some way off eliminating its bias.It concluded that Facebook's efforts to counter fake news had silenced conservative voices. One example, was that fact-checking sites used by the social media giant were inherently left-leaning.In addition, it found that Facebook's ads policy could have restricted anti-abortion advocacy. Kyl's report said: 'Facebook has recognized the importance of our assessment and has taken some steps to address the concerns we uncovered. But there is still significant work to be done to satisfy the concerns we heard from conservatives.'Don Jr. claimed to be hit by 'Shadow banning'A series of high-profile pro-Trump figures have claimed that Twitter and Instagram have made it harder to find their accounts or individual posts.Among those making the claim have been Donald Trump Jr., and Mark Meadows, at the time a congressman and now Trump's White House chief of staff, and Jim Jordan, a prominent Trump defender.Trump Jr. made the claim in his book, Triggered.Twitter has denied that it was involved in such a practice but did update its algorithm when the controversy erupted in July 2016. Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - has said it does not alter the prominence of posts for political reasons.James Woods is banned from Twitter The conservative actor and prominent tweeter was locked out of his account in May 2019 for tweeting: ''If you try to kill the King, you best not miss'#HangThemAll.'Candace Owens suspended by Twitter after criticizing lockdownConservative commentator Candace Owens tweeted earlier this month: 'Apparently @GovWhitmer believes she is a duly elected dictator of a socialist country. The people of Michigan need to stand up to her. Open your businesses. Go to work. The police think she's crazy too. They are not going to arrest 10,000,000 people for going to work.'A Twitter spokesman confirmed that Owens' tweet violated its Covid-19 fake news policy. Twitter said the tweet would be deleted and Owens would serve a 'timeout' before being allowed to log back on. Google accused of censorship of views on abortion, gun rights, Islam and terrorism on its YouTube platformIn February, Google persuaded a federal appeals court on Wednesday to reject claims that YouTube illegally censored Prager University, a conservative nonprofit run by radio talk show host Dennis Prager.PragerU claimed that YouTube's opposition to its political views led it to tag dozens of videos on such topics as abortion, gun rights, Islam and terrorism for its 'Restricted Mode' setting, and block third parties from advertising on the videos.Writing for the appeals court, however, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown said YouTube was a private forum despite its 'ubiquity' and public accessibility, and hosting videos did not make it a 'state actor' for purposes of the First Amendment.Clinton scourge Tulsi Gabbard sues Google over violating free speech Last year she announced she was suing Google for $50million after it suspended her advertising account in the hours after a Democratic debate because it was trying to silence her.Although she's a Democrat, Gabbard's nationalist ideals have put her at odds with the Democratic party.Hillary Clinton suggested the Iraq War veteran was a Russian asset. Tulsi Now Inc. said in the lawsuit filed in July 2019 that Google violated her right to free speech and didn't provide 'a straight answer' for suspending her ads account.Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify ban Infowars' Alex JonesIn 2018, Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify banned pages and content from Infowars and the show's host Alex Jones. A Facebook spokesman referred to content which it said glorified violence and the use of dehumanizing language to describe Muslims and migrants. These violated their graphic violence and hate speech policies.The spokesman noted conspiracy theories espoused by Jones on events like the 9/11 attacks and Sandy Hook school shooting, were not the reason for his ban. YouTube followed suit a few hours later, as did Spotify, after Apple removed Jones from its podcast directory. Laura Loomer banned from Twitter after she claimed Ilhan Omar was 'anti Jewish' and supported Shariah law It comes as a federal appeals court this week upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit that accused Twitter, Facebook and other tech giants of conspiring to stifle the political views of far-right activist, Laura Loomer, and a conservative nonprofit, Freedom Watch. In November 2018, Loomer handcuffed herself to the front doors of Twitter headquarters in New York after the company banned her. The company permanently suspended Loomer's account, which had more than 260,000 followers, after she tweeted that Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, is 'anti Jewish' and supports Sharia law.Facebook also banned Loomer, who is running for a Florida congressional seat as a Republican.In March 2019, U.S District Judge Trevor McFadden said their suit raises 'non-trivial concerns' but didn't tie these concerns to viable legal claims. 'We believe that free speech and the right to engage in commerce are foundational to the American free enterprise system,' a Chamber official said in a statement, the New York Times reported. 'Regardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States. An executive order cannot be properly used to change federal law.' 'This executive order, likely unconstitutional, is also intended to distract the public's attention away from the fact that there are now over 100,000 Covid-related deaths across the country and an economy that is sinking to Great Depression levels,' said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in a statement. The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's order 'a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.'Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order was 'more about political theater than about changing the law.'The order 'is not legally supportable - it flies in the face of more than 900 court decisions,' Goldman said.Despite Trump's approving tweet about Zuckerberg, Facebook issued a statement saying limiting the section of communications law would have the opposite effect of protecting free speech.'Facebook is a platform for diverse views. We believe in protecting freedom of expression on our services, while protecting our community from harmful content including content designed to stop voters from exercising their right to vote,' it said, NBC news reported on Twitter. 'Those rules apply to everybody. Repealing or limiting section 230 will have the opposite effect. It will restrict more speech online, not less. 'By exposing companies to potential liability for everything that billions of people around the world say, this would penalize companies that choose to allow controversial speech and encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone.'The order says it received 16,000 responses of alleged bias and suggests that they will form part of the Federal Trade Commission's investigation. The order also requires the attorney general to establish a working group including state attorneys general that will examine the enforcement of state laws that prohibit online platforms from engaging in unfair and deceptive acts. And it says the AG's group should look into who carries out factchecks for social media platforms and whether they have 'indicia of bias.'And federal agencies are to be told to review their advertising on social media platforms, which was worth $1.5 billion in the last decade. Trump described it as 'billions and billions of dollars.'Section 230 of the 1996 law is a shield against social media networks being sued for what people post on their platforms.It says: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.' It also says that: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.' A publisher or speaker can normally be sued for defamation for the contents of their speech but by not being categorized as those, any attempt to sue social media giants for what is written on them falls at the first hurdle.The 1996 statute has allowed Silicon Valley to make billions of dollars from their users' posts, photos and videos, with minimal legal liability, while giving them freedom to remove anything they see as 'objectionable.' When it was written social media did not exist.Since its explosive growth, platforms including Twitter and Facebook have changed repeatedly.Their algorithms decide the order in which users see new posts, and can be used to make particular content more or less visible.That has led critics to say that they are behaving as publishers - deciding what people read or see - and not simply as forums.The rest of the act gives forums powers to set standards for content, which social media platforms have used as a basis for moderating content and to justify the existence of algorithms. Conservatives - and many others outside mainstream thought on matters like history, climate change and even the coronavirus - have criticized the use of Section 230 claiming big tech has censored content without being subject to scrutiny. Republican senators Marco Rubio (FL) and Josh Hawley (MO) were among those who slammed Twitter for putting its fact-checking flag on the president's tweets.Rubio said: 'The law still protects social media companies like @Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers. 'But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher then they should no longer be shielded from liability &amp; treated as publishers under the law.' Hawley, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it 'raises serious questions about whether Twitter targeted the President for political reasons.' There is however zero possibility of a Democratic House passing reforms to the law itself.That leaves Trump trying to use the powers of the executive branch.The order also puts a prohibition on federal tax dollars going to online platforms that 'violate free speech principles.' But a report last February showed the feds spent just $8 million on social media ads in 2018. The idea of broadening the platforms' legal exposure carried more weight. Under the order, the Commerce Secretary would file a petition for new FCC rule-making. It would make platforms liable when actions are 'deceptive, pretextrual, or inconsistent with a provider's terms of service,' or when taken with 'inadequate notice' or by an 'unreasoned explanation.' Trump himself has made ample use of lawsuits and legal threats over his career. USA found in 2016 Trump and his companies had been involved in 3,500 lawsuits over three decades.Trump's moves brought immediate pushback. 'This is simply setting the wheels of law enforcement and regulation in motion against a private company for questioning the president,' said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, according to the Washington Post. Added former FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, 'Social media can be frustrating. But an executive order that would turn the Federal Communications Commission into the president's speech police is not the answer.' Jesse Blumenthal, head of the Koch-backed Stand Together group, said it was 'just nonsense' to try to rewrite a clear statute through an executive order. The rule's first section contains language that is more political than technical, following reports the administration rushed to put it out.It calls free speech 'the bedrock of American democracy' and says having a limited number of platforms 'hand-pick' speech is 'fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.' Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro tweeted: 'Here's the inevitable effect ... all comments sections will be taken down. No website has the resources to actively edit all comments in order to shield themselves from liability, and no website is willing to leave comments entirely standards-free.'Pachter said that fact-checking 'is a stupid idea on Twitter's part' and that instead they should just delete tweets which are reported, warn the offender or suspend them for breaking its rules. Trump had claimed Wednesday in a Twitter thread that conservatives are being silenced and disproportionately regulated on social media websites like Twitter and Facebook as Twitter issued 'misleading' warning labels on two of his tweets about mail-in voting on Tuesday.'Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,' the president posted to his Twitter Wednesday morning. 'We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that happen again.'The warning was issued after Trump reacted with fury to having two of his tweets labelled as misleading, with links to news articles suggesting they were false attached. Responding to the 'fact checking' Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale said: 'We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters.'Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility. There are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them.' In contrast, Twitter's Jack Dorsey refused to take down the president's tweets where he touted a debunked conspiracy theory that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of a staffer when he was a Republican U.S. congressman from Florida. Twitter users, including some Republicans, did not react kindly to the president suggesting increased regulations on social media websites.Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg goes after Twitter for its fact-checking of Trump  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg criticized competitor Twitter on Thursday after it 'fact-checked' tweets from Donald Trump.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey immediately fired back saying that the site would continue to call out 'incorrect or disputed information' about elections shared by users. In his interview with Fox, Facebook's Zuckerberg said that it was not the place of the company to act as an 'arbiter of truth'.'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' he said.'I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,' he added.'Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.'Dorsey tweeted: 'Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me. Please leave our employees out of this. We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make,' he wrote. 'Per our Civic Integrity policy, the tweets yesterday may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot (only registered voters receive ballots),' he added. 'We're updating the link on @RealDonaldTrump's tweet to make this more clear.'Michael Pachter, research analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told Fox Business: 'Twitter came up with a rule that applies to one person ...'They're not treating (Trump) the way they treat everybody else. They came up with a separate set of rules just for him, which is fact-checking, because they're too afraid of his bullying to delete the tweet or suspend him.' Prominent conservative Margot Cleveland, whose work has been featured in several right leaning news publications, weighed in claiming any private organization has the right to decide what speech can and cannot be featured on their platform.'Pro Tip: Saying Twitter is violating your constitutional right to free speech or your First Amendment rights is wacko b/c Twitter ain't the government,' Cleveland wrote Wednesday morning. 'Saying Twitter is 'stifling free speech' isn't. Powerful private organizations can &amp; do stifle speech.' Trump critic and Republican George Conway, who is married to White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway, reposted a message from the State Department spokeswoman that contradicted the president's tweet.'The State Department's spokesperson, a couple of hours after the President of the United States suggested that the government may 'strongly regulate' social media platforms or 'close them down,'' Conway wrote as a lead up.Morgan Ortagus tweeted from the official State Department spokesperson account: 'Governments that restrict internet access deprive their citizens of the information they need to stay safe. #FreedomOfExpression both online and offline is vital, especially during COVID-19. @StateDept is proud to be an active member of the @FO_Coalition.' Kellyanne Conway criticized Twitter for flagging the tweets, lashing out at Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site Integrity, during an interview with Fox &amp; Friends Wednesday.She even cited his Twitter handle on live television to make sure Republicans knew where to direct their complaints.'This guy is constantly attacking Trump voters, Trump, Mitch McConnell, you name it. He's the head of integrity at Twitter,' Conway lamented.'It's horrible the way he looks at people who should otherwise have a free and clear platform on Twitter.' Trump also re-asserted his flagged tweets' theme in his Wednesday morning tweet: 'Just like we can't let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country.'Trump views that mail-in ballots will increase the chances of voter fraud - and benefit Democrats in 2020.'It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots,' Trump insisted. 'Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!' On Tuesday, the president tweeted that California's mail-in balloting initiative would lead to substantial voter fraud in the November general election.Biased head of Twitter's 'Site Integrity' has previously called the President 'a racist tangerine'   Yoel Roth, whose official title at Twitter is head of Site Integrity, faced backlash on Wednesday after his history of anti-Trump tweets emerged less than 24 hours after the social media giant put a fact-checking warning on two of the president's tweets. In a January 2017 tweet, Roth referred to the Trump administration as 'actual Nazis in the White House' and tweeted in November 2016 that fly over states were racist.He also compared Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway to Nazi Joseph Goebbels saying: ''Today on Meet The Press, we're speaking with Joseph Goebbels about the first 100 days...' - What I hear whenever Kellyanne is on a news show.'The majority of Roth's tweets criticizing Trump and his administration were posted around 2017.Roth started working at Twitter in 2015 as a product trust partner, according to his LinkedIn profile.He has been in his current role as head of site integrity for almost two years.Conway, who is a counselor to Trump, lashed out at Roth in an interview with Fox &amp; Friends on Wednesday and went as far as giving out his Twitter handle on live television.'This guy is constantly attacking Trump voters, Trump, Mitch McConnell, you name it. He's the head of integrity at Twitter,' Conway said.'It's horrible the way he looks at people who should otherwise have a free and clear platform on Twitter.' 'There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed,' Trump wrote Tuesday morning.He then insinuated that non-citizens would be able to obtain ballots.'The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one,' he continued in the Twitter rant. 'That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote.'Trump ended the two-tweet tirade by saying, 'This will be a Rigged Election.''No way!' said Trump, who votes in Florida absentee.The president used a mail-in ballot to vote in the Florida primary last month - a move his administration has defended since he cannot show up for in-person voting while living in Washington, D.C. By Tuesday afternoon, Twitter had flagged the tweets with a blue exclamation mark prompting users to 'get the facts about mail-in ballots.'Another page on the social media site called Trump's tweets 'unsubstantiated,' according to fact-checkers from CNN, Washington Post and other news outlets.'These tweets contain potentially misleading information about voting processes and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail-in ballots,' a statement from Twitter read. Following the move from Twitter, Trump used the social media site he is attacking to decry its decision to label his tweets 'misleading' and accused them of 'stifling free speech.' He threatened the tech giant, stating he wouldn't allow it to continue.'@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post,' Trump wrote Tuesday night.'Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!' he asserted.Trump's 2020 campaign was quick to slam the move.'We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters. Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility. There are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them,' campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. For weeks Trump has said that states, not wanting to expose the voting public to COVID-19, shouldn't be implementing full-scale mail-in balloting plans. The president has drawn a distinction between absentee ballots, which he said can be used for special purposes, and governors sending every American voter a ballot to send back in. 'I have to do an absentee because I'm voting in Florida and I happen to be president and I live in that beautiful house over there that's painted white,' he said in the Rose Garden Tuesday. Trump's tweets came after the Republican National Committee and two other GOP groups filed a lawsuit Sunday against California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had signed an executive order to use mail-in ballots for the November election. 'In California the governor, I hear, is sending millions of ballots all over the state. Millions, to anybody. People that aren't citizens, illegals, anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot,' Trump said at the White House Tuesday.'We are not going to destroy this county by allowing things like that to happen. We're not destroying our country,' he added. Republicans long have been suspicious that making voting easier would elect more Democrats. Young people, for instance, tend to tilt more Democratic, but are also less likely to vote in-person. California was the first state in the country to commit to sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters for the November election, a move responding to the coronavirus pandemic.'Democrats continue to use this pandemic as a ploy to implement their partisan election agenda, and Governor Newsom's executive order is the latest direct assault on the integrity of our elections,' Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. 'No state that conducts all-mail elections automatically mails ballots to inactive voters because it invites fraud, coercion, theft, and otherwise illegitimate voting,' it added.The lawsuit asks for Newsom's order to be barred as unlawful and was filed by the RNC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the California Republican Party.Numerous studies have found little evidence of voter fraud connected to voting by mail. Democrats say it is necessary to counter health risks from the coronavirus by helping to prevent crowds at polling places.What is the truth about Trump's fact-checked Tweet? Twitter's fails to answer American politics' most bitterly disputed question: Could fraud swing a presidential election? Twitter ignited a war with Donald Trump by attaching a fact-check to his tweets about mail-in ballots Tuesday, labeling them misleading and calling some of his claims 'false.' Its move puts the social media platform immediately at odds with Trump and his Republican Party.Twitter has not said why it chose these tweets particularly, or how it assembled its own factcheck. Additionally, its head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, has been plunged into the center of the row with his history of anti-Trump tweets surfacing. Here we analyze the controversy over the dueling claims about fraud.What Donald Trump said  What Twitter said Breaking down each side's claims What Trump said: There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. This is the heart of Trump's - and Republicans' - anti-mail-in ballot push. But it is impossible to either entirely prove or disprove because it is a prediction.There is however substantial evidence that mail-in ballots are not 'substantially' fraudulent: they are used universally in five states - Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah. Oregon was the first to go all mail-in, in 2000.That means every voter is sent a ballot in advance, which they can either return completed during early voting by mail or in person at a polling place, or take uncompleted to a polling center on election day. None of these states has been hit by increased claims of electoral fraud which would render their elections 'substantially fraudulent.' In Oregon, for example, the Secretary of State's office referred 57 cases of possible fraud to prosecutors, resulting in 10 prosecutions after the 2016 presidential elections. Among them were a student who voted in Colorado as well as Oregon when her parents sent her a ballot from home, and a woman who voted for herself and her daughter.[item name=video id=4377408 style=2 /]As for how those 10 cases would have changed the election, four were Democrats, one Republican, one Libertarian and four unaffiliated; Oregon voted for Hillary Clinton by 1,002,106 to 782,403 for Donald Trump. The tiny scale of prosecuted cases is a pattern across the country: the White House highlighted a report from the conservative Heritage Foundation which runs a database of fraud cases, but it managed to come up with just over 1,000 cases of all types of fraud going back as far as 1994, covering elections at every level. Similarly, in 2012, a large-scale investigation commissioned by the Knight Foundation found 491 instances of absentee ballot fraud in the previous 12 years. It said that level appeared to be higher than in voting in person; in the same period it found only 10 cases of people impersonating other voters at a polling place.However in that same period, the total number of votes cast by Americans runs far into the billions and there have been no cases where an entire state's elections have been declared to be 'substantially fraudulent' or anything equivalent to that. In fact, levels of fraud uncovered by investigation after investigation are consistently extremely low. For example, the U.S. Attorney in North Carolina ordered an audit of the 2016 election, where more than 4.5 million ballots were cast in a state which voted for Trump but is seen now as a possible swing state.It uncovered the following - effectively about 500 votes which were ineligible:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>400 suspected felons and 41 non-citizens had voted illegally</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>34 citizens were wrongly refused the right to vote because they were mistakenly declared ineligible</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>two suspected cases of voter impersonation - it was not specified whether this was in person or by mail</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>24 people who voted twice, mostly in other states.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The exercise suggests that the numbers were far too small to move the results of the election. If translated to states with closer margins - such as Michigan - such a scale of fraud would still do nothing to change the outcome. </p><p>Analysis: It is impossible to disprove Trump's claim that voting will be 'substantially fraudulent,' but he has no evidence to back it up. Mail-in voting has happened for many years with a very low level of fraud but it appears to be at a higher level than fraud for voting in person. Trump's use of the word 'substantially' flies in the face of past experience</p><p>Trump: Mail boxes will be robbed</p><p>Mail theft is a constant problem for the Postal Service but there do not appear to be prosecuted cases where the intention was to steal ballots.</p><p>Ballots have however been stolen along with other items; in Anchorage, Alaska in 2018 KTUU reported that 46 ballots and other sodden mail were found in a snowbank after being reported missing from a set of mailboxes. </p><p>They were returned, voided and new ballots issued to the voters affected. Barcodes on ballot forms means they can be traced. </p><p>The highest risk is simply that people lose out on voting when mail is stolen. </p><p>Analysis: Unlikely - at best - to be tied to voting fraud </p><p>Trump: Ballots will be forged</p><p>Trump attaches no number to this claim or specifies what he means but he seems to be suggesting that fake ballots will be made. </p><p>This is highly difficult to pull off - each state uses different security methods but all have methods to prevent forgery. There do not appear to be cases of entirely forged ballot papers.</p><p>Analysis: Highly unlikely to happen </p><p>Trump: Ballots will be 'illegally printed out'</p><p>It is unclear exactly what Trump means with this, making it difficult to analyze. </p><p>He may mean that ballots are issued in excess numbers or to illegal immigrants. </p><p>The number of mail-in ballots applications or ballots issued has been a long-running point of contention between Republicans and Democrats.</p><p>Republican groups including Judicial Watch have sued a number of states - among them California - claiming they issue voting papers to defunct voters, who may have died or moved.</p><p>Republicans broadly have been active in 'purging' voter rolls and introducing use-it-or-lose-it voting laws, which the Supreme Court upheld as constitutional. </p><p>California settled a case with the group in 2017, agreeing to contact 1.5 million people who were possibly inactive voters and removing them from the voter roll if they did not respond.</p><p>However in Ohio, the Republican secretary of state released a list of 'inactive voters' to be purged, only for tens of thousands of names on the list to be discovered to be errors who were still active voters.</p><p>Analysis: Confused at best </p><p>Trump: Ballots will be fraudulently signed</p><p>Forging signatures to impersonate another voter appears to be the most common form of fraud - but is still vanishingly rare.</p><p>The most prominent case to help Trump's claim is, ironically, one involving Republicans in North Carolina.</p><p>There the 2018 election for the 9th District was voided because of suspicions that a Republican contractor for Mark Harris had 'harvested' ballots and then had them filled in by members of his staff.</p><p>Mail-in ballots went Republican by 60% but just 16% of those who used them were registered to the party; Harris 'won' by a wafer-thin margin of 905 votes.</p><p>The contractor, Leslie Dowless, got his staff to go door-to-door in Bladen County and offer 'assistance' to people to request then fill in ballots; his stepdaughter admitted she simply signed them herself. Most of the targets were African-American. </p><p>They had done the same for the primary and Harris had beaten the incumbent, with 437 mail-in ballots for Harris, the challenger, to just 17 for the incumbent.</p><p>The fraud was the largest in modern history, and there had been warnings about Dowless' suspicious conduct before, but he had not been investigated. </p><p>The true scale of Dowless' crimes - and the number of ballots 'fraudulently signed' remains unclear. A total of 437 were submitted int he primary, and he was charged with specimen cases in the general election prosecution.</p><p>The last time a congressional election was voided was in 1974, and the re-run was the first ever ordered because of fraud.</p><p>Dowless' motive was financial, having billed $5 Republicans per absentee vote he 'helped.' </p><p>However, the scale of fraud which would be needed to sway a presidential election is far greater than Dowless was operating on, and there is no evidence that anything on that scale has happened.</p><p>Apart from anything else, at $5 a vote, the cost would be huge. </p><p>Election officials say that they have two levels of checks in place for preventing fraudulent signatures - first, inspecting for envelope tampering, and secondly signature verification.</p><p>That is itself fraught with challenges, including that people's signatures may change over time, but has been held up by officials of both parties as a robust system that prevents fraud. </p><p>Analysis: Such fraud undoubtedly happens but the scale involved is tiny compared to the scale of voting. Ironically the best proof for Trump's case involves his own party</p><p>Trump: The governor of California is sending ballots to... anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one</p><p>Gavin Newsom's executive order states that the ballots will go to registered voters. </p><p>Trump suggests they will go to illegal immigrants, who cannot register to vote.</p><p>Put simply, as long as the register of voters is accurate, then there is no prospect that they will got to illegal immigrants. </p><p>There have been cases of non-citizens who have been mistakenly registered, including 1,500 who were mistakenly sent ballots in June 2018 after an error at the DMV in California. </p><p>However it is unknown how many of those were illegal immigrants rather than legal immigrants, or under-18s, and it is also unknown how many - if any - voted. If they had voted, they would have been criminally liable.</p><p>In contrast to a potential 1,500 illegal votes, more than 6.6 million ballots were cast in that primary in California. </p><p>Analysis: Trump is wrong - as long as California's list of electors is up to date </p><p>Trump: Professionals telling all of those people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote</p><p>Trump is referring to the practice known by Republicans as 'ballot harvesting,' where politically-aligned groups collect mail-in ballots and return them for counting.</p><p>Ballot harvesting is among the most complicated areas of election law, and whether and how it is allowed varies state by state. </p><p>Some states - including Texas - have explicitly outlawed anybody returning an absentee ballot, or allowing only a family member to do so.</p><p>But others have no such restrictions, and there is no federal law on it. In Arizona, an attempt to ban it was deemed to fall foul of the Voting Rights Act.</p><p>Broadly, 27 states allow third-parties to collect and return ballots, but with a patchwork of restrictions; for example in Colorado, one person can return no more than 10 ballots. </p><p>California changed the law so that in the 2018 cycle, third-party groups could encourage people to fill in mail-in ballots and collect them. The main restriction is that collectors cannot be paid per ballot. </p><p>Republicans say this contributed to a blue wave which overwhelmed their members of Congress in the state - although the blue wave was repeated across the country.</p><p>There is nothing wrong in any state with asking people who have not voted to consider voting - in fact it is the basis of much campaigning, such as volunteers of both parties driving the elderly to vote on election day - or for that matter lobbying them about who they should vote for. </p><p>What is definitely true is that where legal, ballot-harvesting can juice turn-out - and it's not just Democrats who think that.</p><p>Devin Nunes, one of Trump's most reliably loyal Congressional defenders and a California Republican told Fox News this month that a 'robust ballot-harvesting operation' was vital to the party in November.</p><p>'I hate saying that because it's illegal in 49 states,' he said, mis-stating the complexities of the law over it.</p><p>Fraud associated with ballot harvesting does not appear to have been formally reported in California but some Republicans have offered anecdotal suggestions that it took pace in 2018.</p><p>Where ballot harvest fraud definitely happened as in North Carolina's 9th district in 2018, when Republican operative Leslie Dowless illegally persuaded voters to either complete a mail-in application and ballot for his party, or had his staff fill them in himself. </p><p>The state bans any handling of a ballot by a third party, but Dowless did so on a scale which was enough to void a congressional election for the first time since 1974. </p><p>Analysis: What Trump says will happen is not necessarily illegal in any form, but can be depending on the state. It has been practiced illegally on a large scale in one well-known case - to benefit Republicans</p><p>Twitter: Trump falsely claimed that mail-in ballots would lead to 'a Rigged Election.' However, fact-checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud.</p><p>There is evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to fraud - cases of it have been prosecuted after every election cycle. </p><p>The issue which is political divisive is the scale on which it happens.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly made claims it involves 'millions' of votes but there has never been any proof that he is correct.</p><p>His own commission on electoral fraud was disbanded without reporting, and no large-scale findings to back up his claims of vast fraud have been made.</p><p>But there have repeatedly been prosecutions of fraud linked to mail-in ballots - even if the numbers are vanishingly low in comparison </p><p>Analysis: Twitter are wrong to state categorically that there is no fraud. The dispute is not over its existence: the dispute is over whether it is widespread and enough to change the outcome of a presidential election</p><p>Twitter: Trump falsely claimed that California will send mail-in ballots to 'anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there.' In fact, only registered voters will receive ballots.</p><p>Gavin Newsom's executive order states that the ballots will go to registered voters.</p><p>That depends on the register being correct and nobody having been registered who is illegal. </p><p>Analysis: Twitter is correct as long as the rules are followed </p><p>Twitter: Five states already vote entirely by mail and all states offer some form of mail-in absentee voting, according to NBC News.</p><p>There are five states which mail ballots to every voter, although all of those voters can choose to vote in person if they wish.</p><p>All states do offer absentee voting in some form; each state's laws are different.</p><p>Analysis: Twitter is imprecise </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-63248721</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-W3N1-F021-64DB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"10824\"/><timeReceived>5:15 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

They and the Trump administration are racing to have a vaccine ready by the end of the year.</p><p>Twitter announced early Tuesday, \"Tweets with the video are in violation of our COVID-19 misinformation policy.\"</p><p>Trump also retweeted tweets defending the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine, including one that accused Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, of misleading the public by dismissing the drug.</p><p>\"I have not been misleading the public under any circumstances,\" Fauci responded Tuesday morning on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" when asked for his reaction to Trump's retweets.</p><p>Fauci reiterated that the \"overwhelming prevailing clinical trials\" that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it's \"not effective\" in treating the coronavirus.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was temporarily locked out of his Twitter account on Tuesday after posting the same controversial video shared by Trump promoting hydroxychloroquine and saying people don't need to wear masks, said Andy Surabian, an adviser to the president's son.

They were being fans of hydroxychloroquine, and I thought she was very impressive in the sense that \u2014 from where she came, I don't know which county she comes from \u2014 but she said that she's had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients, and I thought her voice was an important voice.

'To support social distancing and working from home, we need to work differently and rely more on automated systems to help enforce our rules,' Twitter wrote[1] in a tweet addressing how the company is preparing to address life in a world where panic over coronavirus[2]. Twitter went on to list what it believes are some of the issues users should expect when the reigns are given over to automation. 'We're working to improve our tech,' the company noted, so 'this might result in some mistakes.'(Article Continues Below Advertisement)As the world faces an unprecedented public health emergency, we want to be open about the steps we're taking to keep people safe. </p><p>To support social distancing and working from home, we need to work differently and rely more on automated systems to help enforce our rules. \u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) March 17, 2020[3] The big tech giant often blames[4] its AI-system for mistakenly nixing or impacting user content that does not in anyway violate Twitter's policies. Twitter suggested in April 2019 that the auto system was partially to blame for the suspension of a pro-life group.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Sponsored Content  'When an account violates the Twitter Rules, the system looks for linked accounts to mitigate things like ban evasion,' a company spokeswoman told The Daily Caller News Foundation in April. 'In this case, the account was mistakenly caught in our automated systems for ban evasion.' The spokeswoman was referring to an account called 'Unplanned,' which promoted a movie about a former abortion clinic director who became pro-life. The system is designed to suspend so-called sock-puppet accounts connected to a profile that violated company policies, according to the spokeswoman. Twitter, meanwhile, is refusing to remove a Chinese official's tweets suggesting the U.S. Army is responsible for injecting coronavirus into Wuhan, China. A spokesman told the Daily Caller News Foundation on March 13 that[5] the official's tweets do not violate company policies. A tweet from Chinese politician Lijian Zhao suggesting[6] the United States is trying to keep secret a plan to inject the virus into China does not violate Twitter rules, the spokesman said. Twitter revised some of its policies to 'protect the public conversation around COVID-19,' according to a March 4 blog post[7] from the company. The update also bans advertisements that 'opportunistically use the COVID-19 outbreak to target inappropriate ads.' Twitter has not replied to the DCNF's request for comment.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
