It says Russia must be banned from international athletics. We have full coverage.</p><p>The president of the world's largest airline tells CNN there are many airports where security is weak.</p><p>And MTN's chief executive resigns on accusations it didn't do enough to prevent terrorists using its network.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest. We start a new week together. And I mean business.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: Good evening. Tonight: it's a deeply rooted culture of cheating at all levels. Those are the words from the World Athletic Corporation, which faces a corruption scandal that threatens to overshadow the one at FIFA in terms of seriousness and scale.</p><p>The world's antidoping agency says it's uncovered what amounts to, in their words, \"state-sponsored doping\" in Russia. And it has called for Russia to be suspended from the 2016 Olympics.</p><p>It is an extraordinary story tonight. It says that the -- Russia should be -- faces a ban, that the 2012 Olympics sabotaged by failure to crack down on doping cheat -- that was the London Olympics in 2012 -- and it says there is evidence of corruption and bribery, which has now been sent to Interpol.</p><p>So Russia facing a ban; London Olympics sabotaged; Interpol is now investigating.</p><p>Dick Pound, who led the investigation, has called the findings \"very damaging.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DICK POUND, CHAIRMAN, WORLD ANTI-DOPING AGENCY: It is worse than we thought. It has the effect, unlike other forms of corruption, of actually affecting the results on the field of play. And athletes, both in Russia and abroad, are suffering as a result of that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Joining me now, Matthew Chance, who is in Moscow for us tonight, and \"WORLD SPORT's\" Don Riddell, who is at the CNN Center.</p><p>We'll begin with you, Don, if we may.</p><p>I read large parts of the long report today. It is breathtaking in its detail and mind-boggling in its level of corruption and miscreant behavior.</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And for all that those, what, 300 pages in all this detail, they're saying that this could well be just the tip of the iceberg. It could be more than Russia, it could be more than athletics. But they were given a very narrow brief with regard to the investigation they could do.</p><p>And what they've come up with incredibly damaging to Russia and for the sport of athletics, for which the stakes just couldn't be any higher, Richard. If you were to ask people, you know, your ordinary man on the street, which sport have athletes who cheat, they would say maybe cycling but probably athletics.</p><p>So this is a problem that goes way back. But if the sport is going to tackle it, it has to be tackled now. And you're talking about in Russia, not just athletes but coaches, trainers, doctors -- the entire institution, it stinks.</p><p>QUEST: Don, as I -- so we have the coaches and the trainers providing the doping, the enhanced performance doping. We have the laboratories falsifying results when they know, in their words, the specimen is dirty and they're falsifying it.</p><p>And we have the state conniving in all of this. But I get the impression that everybody has known this for some time.</p><p>What are people like Seb Coe and International Athletics now saying?</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, there's an awful lot of pressure on the IAAF and Seb Coe in particular. He's the new president. He's only been in charge for a few months. People are now asking what he knew. He was the vice president of the IAAF for seven years. Now he's in charge.</p><p>And he's got to try and get this thing sorted out right now. He has said he will stop at nothing to make sure that they get to the bottom of this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN COE, IAAF PRESIDENT: Look, I realize I've been criticized for that, those remarks I made within moments of winning a campaign. And it also presupposes --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>COE: -- I had a list of allegations sitting in front of me. I did not.</p><p>ALEX THOMAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You've said you'll do anything to sort out what needs to be done.</p><p>Does that include thinking outside the box, maybe bringing in outside help, using the money you pledged from your election campaign to federations maybe, to instead go to the fight against doping?</p><p>Is there anything off limits in -- ?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COE: The day after I got elected, I started a root and branch review of the organization. Clearly in the light of the allegations today and the criminal allegations made at the beginning of the week, I've advanced that review. And I will do anything it takes to create and return our sport to being a responsible, transparent, accountable sport that is responsive.</p><p>And that is what I'm pledged to do. And we have to do this absolutely on the behalf of the clean athletes.</p><p>THOMAS: You have been backed by the IOC and Dick Pound as the right man for the IAAF to lead in going forward. You faced the Olympic finals in 1980 and 1984. You put on a terrific London Olympic Games, Seb Coe.</p><p>Is this the toughest challenge of your career?</p><p>COE: I will do anything it needs to fix this.</p><p>THOMAS: Thanks for your time.</p><p>COE: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RIDDELL: Richard, that was Alex Thomas asking those questions a couple of hours ago here on CNN. He actually began that interview by defending the remarks he had made about the outgoing IAAF president, who himself has now been implicated in this whole mess. He's been questioned by criminal authorities.</p><p>And Seb Coe, having to begin that interview by saying, you know, when I was complimentary of him, I didn't have the full facts at my disposal.</p><p>QUEST: Don Riddell, who is in the CNN Center, Don, just stay there, I'm looking at Matthew Chance, who is in Moscow.</p><p>Matthew, I want you to hear Don's answer to my question.</p><p>Don, is it likely that Russia would be banned from the next Olympic Games?</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, we'll have to wait and see how things play out. I mean, that, I think, is the nuclear option that remains on the table for the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency.</p><p>What they're saying is that if Russia plays ball, if they effectively 'fess up to what they've gone -- what has gone on and promise that they can fix things going forward, then maybe there is a chance that they can be rehabilitated and brought back into the international forum.</p><p>If they don't, then I think there is a chance that they could be banned from the next Olympics. And when you consider what a --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RIDDELL: -- superpower globally Russia is, that would be huge.</p><p>QUEST: Matthew is chomping at the bit because he has got the story from Russia and how Moscow -- thanks, Don.</p><p>How is Moscow going to justify?</p><p>Because this report has chapter and verse against the Russian athletes and the systemic doping.</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I mean, Richard, I just can't see that the Russians are going to take a step back and say, look, you know what, hands up, we did it, we're guilty.</p><p>And in fact every comment we've had so far since this report was issued a few hours ago has been completely defensive, completely denial -- complete denial that there's anything wrong in Russia. The head of the Russian doping agency said this is an unprofessional report and it's illogical, it doesn't make sense.</p><p>The Russian sports minister has said that the problem of doping has been sorted out already in Russia and the labs to test athletes are the best in the world.</p><p>This is about much more than sport in Russia. The country has spent billions of dollars, billions of dollars promoting this image that it is a leading sporting superpower. It had the Winter Olympics in 2014, it had the swimming championships this year, it's got the World Cup in 2018. Billions of dollars has been spent.</p><p>It's about promoting Russia's image for the Kremlin. There's no way, there's no way, in my opinion, they're going to say, yes, you know what, we've been cheating all along.</p><p>QUEST: Matthew Chance in Moscow, Don Riddell at \"WORLD SPORT,\" gentlemen, we'll follow it closely, thank you.</p><p>As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, the chief executive, Sir Tim Clark, Emirates Airline, the largest in the world, he says that there are many airports, not perhaps just Sharm el-Sheikh, where there are safety and security concerns. You'll hear him -- next.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[16:10:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: The president of Emirates Airlines says there are many airports around the world that could be vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Uncertainty over what brought down a Metrojet plane over a week ago is now weighing heavily on the airline industry. Sir Tim Clark of Emirates spoke to John Defterios, who is attending the Dubai Air Show.</p><p>And Sir Tim told him the company is reviewing its security procedures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIR TIM CLARK, PRESIDENT, EMIRATES AIRLINES: If you put the incident in the context of what happened -- and we understand what happened -- we can get a fix on what happened. We understand that.</p><p>And if it was as a result of the alleged device put on the airplane, then we must assess, both as an airline, Emirates itself, all its security protocols at all the airports it flies to. And we are doing that, as it happens. We do it on an ongoing basis. And I would expect the industry and other carriers that have a global reach such as ours would do the same. And I'm sure they will do.</p><p>In addition, the International Civil Aviation Organization and other regulators within their own countries are probably going to come along and say, look, we need to see what you're doing, we need to talk to the airport authorities. We need to talk to the stakeholders on the airports with regard to who does security, how they do it, how they screen employees, what processes are going on.</p><p>All this will happen, in my view, as a result of what happened at Sharm el-Sheikh.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: I've flown into Sharm el-Sheikh a number of different times for conferences and also on holiday. It's a soft target. I mean, the reality is, if you're a terrorist organization and you want to infiltrate an airport, the smaller tourist destinations seem to be vulnerable.</p><p>This is a reality, is it not?</p><p>CLARK: Yes, look, unfortunately for the Egyptians, this airport was, in the view, I believe, of the Egyptian government, was a secure airport, because they knew there was a clear and present threat. So they had security in the place. Maybe it was slightly lax in certain areas. I don't want to criticize them.</p><p>But as you rightly say, there are many airports in the world, and not just in Egypt or Africa, all over the place. There are potential targets that -- airports that are vulnerable. And those are the ones that must look at their procedures to ensure that kind of thing can't happen.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Aren't you very concerned that maybe staff was compromised here and they're cooperating with the very seedy elements that got into the airport?</p><p>CLARK: I made mention of the human resource. It is the human resource that applies the processes, the procedures, the protocols. If you have a weak human resource, then there are going to be issues.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Sir Tim Clark of Emirates talking to John Defterios.</p><p>Safety protocols at Sharm el-Sheikh airport are now under intense scrutiny. CNN's Erin McLaughlin now reports on the allegations of security breaches.</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>ERIC MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Wheels down at Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport, the latest point in a wave of evacuations ordered by British and Russian governments to bring their citizens safely home, this as questions swirl around the airport's security.</p><p>Allegations key scanners are sometimes not functioning and employees accept bribes, allegations the Egyptians deny.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: For now, this is as close as our cameras can get to the airport, after the military took over and kicked the media out.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over): But it wasn't always this way. Six days after the plane crash, Egyptian officials were eager to show us around. They took us on a tour to see the airport's inner workings. They showed us the luggage screening process, a process the British government says may have been manipulated, leading to the possible bombing of Metrojet Flight 9268.</p><p>BBC reports British intelligence believed a bomb was placed in the lower half of the plane's fuselage, the place where luggage is stored during the flight.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: All bags are first X-rayed and if they see something they think is suspicious, that's when they send it to this machine for more (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over): It's called a CTX machine, and it's used to test for explosives. When we were there, everything seemed to run smoothly. But the Associated Press reports that's not always the case.</p><p>An unnamed airport official says the machine often breaks down and the breakdowns have more to do with, quote, \"human stupidity\" rather than technical faults.</p><p>Another official told AP the police men at the scanning machines are poorly paid and sometimes take bribes to allow drugs and weapons through.</p><p>One police man told CNN, unlike other airport employees, he and his colleagues are not searched before entering the airport; instead, they're vetted and managed by Egypt's top security agencies. He said their work is watched through the airport's camera system.</p><p>We were shown one of the rooms used to monitor that system. We're told they have footage of Flight 9268. They say it's part of the ongoing investigation.</p><p>During our tour, we weren't allowed to see everything we wanted. Didn't say why. We asked to get on the tarmac. This was as close as we were allowed to go. We filmed through an open door and we were denied access to the main room used to monitor the airport.</p><p>Egyptian authorities are hitting back at allegations of security lapses. The civil aviation ministry spokesman told CNN, \"I am not saying we are 100 percent mistake free. It is possible but not in the way it was portrayed. These allegations are generalizations. They are baseless and false.\"</p><p>They insist the airport is safe.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: International civil aviation authority and we are complying with all the standard and regulations of this authority which means it's completely safe to fly and fly from and to Sharm el-Sheikh airport.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over): The British and Russian officials are skeptical. They've sent their own teams to evaluate the airport and shepherd their citizens home. Whether or not ISIS brought down Metrojet 9268, security at this and other airports in the region will remain under scrutiny -- Erin McLaughlin, CNN, Sharm el-Sheikh.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, the rate hike fears are up. The markets are down. U.S. stocks fell from the open and they never recovered. They were off the worst of the day but still I think the word is ugly for how the day progressed.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[16:20:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: So the market started lower and it remained unhappy for the session. A last-minute surge wasn't enough. The stocks began falling right from the beginning and frankly never really recovered. It was off 200 points at one stage.</p><p>Is it only the prospect of higher interest rates from the Fed which is starting towards, in the words of Janet Yellen, as a live possibility for December?</p><p>Paul La Monica is with me.</p><p>When you get a day like today, Paul, down at the beginning, start of a new week, down at the beginning, never really looks back, what's going on?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: The Fed rate hike concerns are part of it. But I think what's more worrisome was you had some pretty poor economic data coming from China, exports and imports both down. And remember, it was China that really sparked all that market volatility this summer.</p><p>I think it has more to do with that than whether or not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: -- it's all percent, I'm sorry, but it's -- there's a grunt feeling about that. The market was down and it never recovered.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes. You never like to see a day like this. But we had a solid week last week. We've had an amazing few weeks now, a huge run-up in October. So I don't think you need to be too concerned about one day like this within the context of that big rally we've had from the lows of August.</p><p>QUEST: Let's look at the European markets. European stocks also closed the week lower. You could see the FTSE was down, very sharp losses in Frankfurt with the DAX.</p><p>In the French market, Renault was down 3.5 percent after the government said it opposes a merger with Nissan. And Intercontinental down 5 percent as it says it's not considering a sale or a merger. So European markets are still -- they are particularly unhappy at the moment.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, obviously the European markets are even more concerned, I think, about China than the U.S. It's a huge trading partner of China. But the DAX in Germany has actually done even better than the S&amp;P 500 and a lot of U.S. stocks. So it doesn't shock me that Chinese weak data would send European stocks even further down than we had in the U.S.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. See you tomorrow.</p><p>Now when it comes to the telecommunications companies, these two, one of them brings you the Internet on your phone and at home and now they're doing it together.</p><p>It's Cisco, which is the world's top router company, depending on how you like to pronounce that word, and Ericsson of Sweden is the world's biggest wireless equipment maker.</p><p>Take Ericsson and Cisco, and you put them together, not in a merger, the two of them plan to build networks and collaborate on development, a partnership, a strategic arrangement, not a merger.</p><p>The chief execs of both companies join me. And Cisco's chief exec, Chuck Robbins, told me what his customers will get out of this deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHUCK ROBBINS, CEO, CISCO: It really is the combination of Ericsson that is just a market leader and the areas that they play and in Cisco, in the market areas that we play. And we believe in coming together we can help the service providers, first in our first phase, the service providers really transform their networks and move to this next generation of architecture that allows them to deliver services more quickly to their customers, actually allows them to drive their own growth in addition to what we see between Ericsson and Cisco.</p><p>And then we also see an opportunity to really create a seamless mobile experience in the enterprise and also work together on really unleashing the value of IOT --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>ROBBINS: -- for our customers in the future.</p><p>QUEST: Hans, most consumers -- I'm not being disrespectful here -- but they won't really care about Cisco and Ericsson; they just care that the whole thing works, don't they?</p><p>HANS VESTBERG, CEO, ERICSSON: Yes, they do. And that's what this is all about. What Cisco and Ericsson will do, they will see that the video stream, the data streams that consumers are using all around the world will come much more effectively to the screens. If it's a small screen or a large screen, that's what we're doing together with the service providers all around the world.</p><p>So they should care that we're coming together, because we should give their experience to be much better.</p><p>QUEST: So Hans, why not just do it very simply and do a merger?</p><p>Strategic partnerships are all fine and good.</p><p>But if it's really broad-based and deep-delving into the infrastructure of each company, aren't you better off just merging?</p><p>VESTBERG: I think that we have both our options, what we wanted to do. (INAUDIBLE) companies or we could actually double down on I.P., which scenario, which we're all in the fringes in our strategy (ph).</p><p>But to be honest, this is the most agile way of working in the new world, where you need to find partners in the areas where you're not equally good.</p><p>I think this is actually the next generation where you'll do strategic partnerships instead of doing big, bulky mergers. And I've said it before, I'm not a big believer in big tech mergers; it's very complicated, have different platforms.</p><p>Here we actually are finding the best way for us to continuing investing in areas where we are number one, Cisco in theirs, they are number one. And together we want to a bridge in between us in order to get the consumer experience and the customer experience that is far more better.</p><p>QUEST: One of the hottest issues at the moment is that of national security and the number of governments that are seeking the ability and the right to either eavesdrop or to get hold of information.</p><p>ROBBINS: We have never provided any special access to our equipment nor will we do so. And I think it's important on two fronts, number one, to work with each government to understand the data privacy requirements and concerns and then work to architect the networks in a way that actually accommodates that.</p><p>And I think that's one of the benefits of what we can do with Ericsson.</p><p>And the last thing is that security is so important for our customers. And we believe that the combination of Hans' technology, our technology coming together, from the mobile device all the way through the infrastructure, we believe that we can help our customers not only deal with data privacy and the issues that they would like to deal with but also just provide a much greater degree of security across the board.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Two chief execs, Ericsson and Cisco, talking to me earlier.</p><p>A massive fine for Africa's largest mobile operator first obliterated the company's stock price and now it has cost the chief executive his job. We'll break down the numbers and we will be in Johannesburg after the break. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[16:31:25] QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There is more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment when the chief executive of Norwegian Cruise Lines will be with us and shows me his brand new ship and talks about Cuba and China.</p><p>And Sierra Leone is declared Ebola free. I'll ask the ask the head of a local company where the economy now heads. But before all of that, this is CNN and on this network the news always comes first.</p><p>The World Anti-Doping Agency says Russian athletes should be suspended from international athletics after finding evidence of widespread state- sponsored doping.</p><p>Interpol says it will investigate after the WADA report said it found corruption at the highest levels of athletics. The lead investigator said the doping scandal was likely to grow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DICK POUND, P RESIDENT, WADA INDEPENDENT COMMISSION: Tip of the iceberg? I'm afraid you're probably right.</p><p>As I say, we certainly do not think that Russia is the only country with a doping problem and we don't think that athletics is the only sport with a doping problem.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: A veteran democracy campaigner Aung Suu Kyi is on track to win a landslide victory in Myanmar.

It was Mr. Netanyahu's first visit in more than a year and the first time the men had met since Washington agreed a nuclear deal with Iran.</p><p>The President reiterated his support for Israel in the light of recent violence between Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT: I'd like to be very clear that we condemn in the strongest terms Palestinian violence against innocent Israeli citizens and I want to repeat once again it is my strong belief that Israeli has not just the right but the obligation to protect itself.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The chief executive of Africa's biggest mobile phone operator MTN has resigned. Now, the firm has been hit with a massive fine in Nigeria for failing to cut off unregistered SIM cards.</p><p>Nigeria says that by having those unregistered SIM cards, millions of anonymous customers creating a risk that terrorists and criminals can communicate and plot with immunity.</p><p>As MTN tries to negotiate a lower penalty, Sifiso Dabengwa said he was resigning as CEO in the interest of the companies and its shareholders.</p><p>Now, look at what's happening -- a $5.2 billion fine. That's roughly half of MTN's annual revenues. The firm is huge, it has some 60 million subscribers in Nigeria, each paying roughly $86 per subscriber - gives you an idea.</p><p>So and of course it is pancontinent, MTN, in many different countries.</p><p>[16:35:03] But look at how the share price has fallen recently since October. At that very sharp fall, that's when the fine is announced, it becomes clear, but it's down some 15 percent over the last year.</p><p>Eleni Giokos joins us now from Johannesburg to put this into perspective. The fine is huge but why has the chief executive gone?</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well this is the interesting question. We all thought that Sifiso Dabengwa was going to see this through and that he was going to be the man that would try and negotiate a better deal.</p><p>I mean, how do you negotiate $5.2 billion? But that's what the market was expecting. The reality is, Richard, that MTN failed to announce - make the announcement - to when they found out about the $5.2 billion penalty.</p><p>So the Nigerian regulators had announced very early on a Monday morning 26th of October and then failed to announce it before the market opened in Johannesburg.</p><p>And in fact only did this when the market already had shown that it was working against MTN share price. MTN share price had really plunged by 6 percent and then 2:30 in the afternoon we saw MTN's cautionary announcement coming through.</p><p>So there's a massive gray area. Why didn't MTN shareholders know about this sign (ph) in time so that they could act responsibly?</p><p>Over and above that we saw MTN share price also coming under pressure, losing about 25 percent of 1 point over the last couple of weeks and then the Johannesburg Stock Exchange decided to suspend the company for a few hours of trade last week.</p><p>So all of these things working against Sifiso Dabengwa at this time.</p><p>QUEST: Right, now - the fine itself -- $5.2 billion is, I mean, in South Africa and in Africa and in Nigeria, are people saying this is a fine that's commensurate with what they did or out of all proportion to what they did?</p><p>GIOKOS: Well I think we have to look at the fine per user, and it basically comes down to around $1,000 per user because we're talking about over 5 million subscribers.</p><p>So is $1,000 per user a fine that is justified for a terrorist potentially using an unregistered SIM card? Some are arguing yes it is. Some are saying that it's just not in proportion. And we're talking about $5.2 billion which basically equates to over 22 percent of Nigeria's entire 2014 budget.</p><p>So we're talking about a really big fine. The Nigerian Communications Commission has also been working very closely with the telecoms companies since 2008 trying to get unregistered users either disconnected or making sure that they're in the system somehow so they can be traced.</p><p>So deadlines have been coming through since 2013, but unregistered SIM cards have been slipping through the system. And, Richard, it's not only unregistered SIM cards. MTN and other big operators -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>GIOKOS: -- in the country have been selling pre-registered SIM cards. So in other words, people were buying SIM cards that were registered already for a premium.</p><p>QUEST: Ultimately does this jeopardize MTN - the future of the company? Because it is a large company. Nigeria is merely one country albeit the largest where it operates. So is the survival of MTN in any way put at risk by this fine?</p><p>GIOKOS: Well, I mean in terms of survival, many of the analysts say MTN is going to survive this but liquidity is going to be an issue. Payment terms are going to come and, you know, under the spotlight as well.</p><p>How much are they going to pay? Is it going to be halved? Is it going to come down to around $ 1 billion which some people are expecting?</p><p>And remember, Richard, actually in 2008/2009, we had Bharti Airtel snooping around wanting to acquire MTN and look for a potential deal.</p><p>So is this a good time for other potential suitors to come along? MTN has 233 million subscribers across the continent.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Welcome onboard and hope to have you many more times with us -</p><p>GIOKOS: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: -- on \"Quest Means Business.\" Our new South Africa - or Southern Africa - business correspondent Eleni joining us from Johannesburg.</p><p>It's anything but business as usual. The chief executive of a mining company in Sierra Leone tells us how his organization got through the devastating Ebola epidemic.</p><p>It's \"Quest Means Business,\" the start of a new week.</p><p>[16:42:21] QUEST: E.U. industry ministers met earlier to discuss a sector in crisis - steel of course. The upshotter (ph) promised to hold more talks, this time with other producers including China. The position is pretty dreadful.</p><p>The U.K. steel companies are accusing China of dumping their product on the European market and driving local manufacturers out of business.</p><p>They were calling for stronger action from the E.U. to defend jobs and not just a promise of further talks.</p><p>I asked the European Commission Vice President what the E.U. could do when people are calling for action.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JYRKI KATAINEN, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: There are already now, if I remember right, 37 cases in which E.U. has taken action. If there is state subsidy case or anti-dumping investigations going on, it will take a few months and then we decide whether this is the case or not.</p><p>So we have trade defense instruments at our disposal and we are actively using them.</p><p>QUEST: I can hear industry saying - and I'm sure you hear it, I'm sure they say it in fairly blunt terms to your face - but I can hear them saying it's not enough, they need more from you.</p><p>KATAINEN: Well actually we cannot launch sanctions to anybody without complaints and every time when industries are doing official complaining, the Commission start investigating the issues or the case.</p><p>And this is - this - there is something what has happened so far and this will continue also in the future. But actually what we need is the solution to overcapacity problem.</p><p>Because always it's not the question of dumping or subsidy but the over-capacity starts creates difficulties and problems to the market.</p><p>So I just visited Beijing at the end of September and we had very fruitful discussion with Chinese authorities that E.U. and China will start developing negotiation formats for reducing overcapacity.</p><p>So we need international multilateral but also bilateral tools to - in order to - reduce over production. One significant issue which may have impacted the overcapacity issue is the climate negotiations which takes place in Paris at the end of this month.</p><p>And there I guess the leaders will agree to reduce overcapacity issues.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:45:03] QUEST: That's Jyrki Katainen, the European Commissioner talking to me earlier.</p><p>The World Health Organization has declared Sierra Leone free from Ebola. The country has not had a case of Ebola in more than 42 days. That's two incubation cycles of the virus.</p><p>The disease has killed more than 3,500 people in Sierra Leone. The World Bank estimates the epidemic wiped out 3 percent of GDP in 2014.</p><p>Sierra Rutile operates mines in the southwest of country. John Sisay is the chief executive. Good evening, sir, you join me tonight from London.</p><p>JOHN SISAY, CEO, SIERRA RUTILE: Good evening.</p><p>QUEST: When we were talking to government officials and the president of the country, we were talking about a system months ago - it was all about the way in which the country has to be rebuilt, the difficulty of a country that was already devastated economically now having to go back to square one if not further back.</p><p>So from your point of view, what's the priority for rebuilding the economy?</p><p>SISAY: Let's not forget, Richard, that prior to Ebola Sierra Leone was actually doing fairly well. The GDP growth was in double digits.</p><p>So the first thing we have to do is go back to where we were. Now, accepted is the challenge given that Sierra Leone economy is a commodity- driven economy, and as we know commodities are very sluggish at the moment.</p><p>But we have to try and go back to that. And then we also have to try and look at how we can diversify the economy for the future, focusing on things like infrastructure, tourism and agriculture.</p><p>I know that the government tried to preempt some of this in terms of Ebola recovery by talking to people like the E.U. for an Ebola recovery fund to focus on infrastructure developments like water and more roads.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but a company like yourself, I mean, you kept trading, you managed to stay and keep doing business throughout, but you had huge logistical challenges in terms of getting product in and getting product out.</p><p>But you did survive - your company survived.</p><p>SISAY: Absolutely. We had some advantages, Richard, because the first case of Ebola happened away from our area. So we were able to put protocols in place, we were able to look at our supply chain and look at, you know, (AUDIO GAP) time point of view what other supplies we needed in country and we were able to stock up in advance of the shutdowns that the country had to go through.</p><p>So it was really a question of running a business planning for an event for the worst-case scenarios. We were able to do that, we were able to mount serious awareness campaign around our area.</p><p>Luckily our communities understood the seriousness of the disease and adhered to the protocol that we put in place.</p><p>QUEST: Do you feel that the right policies are in place now to sort of take advantage? Because obviously, you know, commodities are down, China is buying less, countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and the likes are commodity driven are going to suffer as a result.</p><p>And so I'm wondering is this a double hit for you?</p><p>SISAY: It was a double hit. But like I mentioned earlier, even more important now to look at how the economy would diversify going forward. So that, you know, we would not suffer so much from these shocks in the global cycle.</p><p>Like I mentioned, for example, an area that requires more investment which shows huge potential is agriculture, -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>SISAY: -- another area is tourism. And I don't know if you know, Richard, but Sierra Leone has the deepest natural hot port in Africa. So we have an advantage there to develop a real transshipment port that can be a gateway to West Africa.</p><p>So there are plenty other opportunities -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>SISAY: -- away from mining and commodities that I think the government will be focusing on as we go forward.</p><p>QUEST: John, thank you for joining us this evening. Much appreciate you coming in and talking to us. Very much appreciate it.</p><p>SISAY: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: And as we finish our discussion, now just to make it clear because obviously thousands of people died and in no way does a discussion on economics in any sense lessen the seriousness and the gravity of what took place with Ebola.</p><p>But longer term of course, there is a question of how you rebuild the economy and then once you're talking about that, then you are looking at people like John Sisay and how they are going to develop their businesses.</p><p>As we continue tonight on \"Quest Means Business,\" Norwegian chief executive - that's Norwegian Cruise Line chief executive - he's got a brand new ship, carries 4,000 passengers. Where is he going to put it and what sort of passengers are going to go on it?</p><p>We'll talk about that after you've had a moment to relax, enjoy and think about \"Make, Create, Innovate.\"</p><p>(SOUND OF SHIP'S FOG HORN)</p><p>[16:52:34] QUEST: Ooh, I'm feeling a bit sea sick to start with. Haven't got me sea legs. It's a \"Vacation Machine.\" That's how the chief of Norwegian Cruise Line is describing his newest vessel and that is it.</p><p>It's called the \"Norwegian Escape,\" and while it was christened on Monday in Miami, the chief executive Frank Del Rio has his set - sights - some 200 miles further south. He told me that one day he hopes to see \"Escape\" dock in Cuba.</p><p>Del Rio is of course a native Cuban himself. I spoke to Frank Del Rio onboard the Escape - well he was on the Escape, I was here in New York -- and I asked Frank how the new liner fits into the Norwegian portfolio.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>FRANK DEL RIO, COE, NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINES: This is by far our largest vessel - 4,200 passengers, 165,000 tons and she's loaded with all the features you'd ever want to go on vacation with, Richard.</p><p>Truly a - literally a - vacation machine.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: And as I was reading about it, I think it's the zip lines and the walking around over the sea - I think that's the bit that sort of terrifies me and excites me at the same time.</p><p>Have you tried them yet?</p><p>DEL RIO: I have not, but -</p><p>QUEST: Oh!</p><p>DEL RIO: -- Andy Stuart our president has and he loved it. I instead tried the fastest and largest aqua park yesterday with my seven-year-old granddaughter and she gave me the thumbs up. And if Mariana (ph) liked it, then I know it's going to be a big hit.</p><p>QUEST: You're well advanced in your plans, aren't you? I remember asking you about the plans in the bottom of your drawer.</p><p>It seems to me like you've found the key to the bottom of your drawer or the bottom drawer, you've opened it up and Escape is part of a plan for Cuba.</p><p>DEL RIO: Well, someday Escape will go to Cuba. I think once we receive Cuban government clearance, I'm confident that there's huge pent up demand from the American public to go to Cuba.</p><p>It's been over 50 years. The cruise industry didn't even really exist the last time Cuba was open to American visitors.</p><p>So I think it's going to be a wonderful experience.</p><p>QUEST: These 4,000, 3 to 4 to 5,000 passenger vessels, I'm not being disrespectful when I say this though that they've commoditized the cruise industry. It is passengers on a truly industrial scale, isn't it?</p><p>[16:55:15] DEL RIO: Well, we're trying to break that mold, but I know what you mean. And one of the things that we do differently than the rest of the cruise industry is, you know, we market to fill the vessels. We don't want to discount price.</p><p>So we've changed the conversation with the consumer from that of low prices to that of high value. And in doing so, we're able to offer the consumer - I wish you could be here to see this ship, Richard. She is not a mainstream-looking vessel.</p><p>If you take venue to venue and you compare what we have here onboard Escape to what we have on some of our more upscale lines like Oceania and Regent, she stacks up very well.</p><p>This is not your grandfather's cruise line.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: It may not be your grandfather's, what about your mother's? \"Profitable Moment\" after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\" On this show, you heard Sir Tim Clark of Emirates saying that there are many airports in the world where there could be security and safety issues.</p><p>That's an extremely disturbing thought. But it really raises the question - whose responsibility is it to sort it out? Perhaps only once the airlines say they won't fly there will anything get done.</p><p>And that's \"Quest Means Business\" for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, (RINGS BELL) I hope it's profitable.</p><p>Let's get together tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2015110901cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HBN-4FT1-JB20-G2Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 9, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0001P56</classCode><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS334210 TELEPHONE APPARATUS MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC3661 TELEPHONE &amp;

House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and other Republicans argued that the 1992 Cable Act is too outdated to still be effectual given the rapid growth of virtual MVPDs and over-the-top providers. House Communications ranking member Mike Doyle, D-Pa., and other Democrats trained their fire on how FCC actions under current Chairman Ajit Pai could negatively affect people who primarily rely on over-the-air broadcasting for content. The hearing included a focus on Scalise's Next Generation Television Marketplace Act (HR-6465) and the upcoming 2019 debate on Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act (STELA) reauthorization, as expected (see 1809260054).</p><p>Scalise framed HR-6465 as a \"good starting point\" for discussions about STELA recertification, saying the 1992 Cable Act has reached the \"end of the road\" as an effective statute. HR-6465 would repeal compulsory copyright licenses and retransmission provisions included in the 1992 law and end Communications Act mandates on carriage and purchase of certain broadcast signals by MVPDs (see 1807230044). He filed versions of the bill in the 112th and 113th Congresses (see 1207240073 and 1312130065). \"We should be trying\" to move to a regulatory structure in which broadcasters, vMVPDs, OTT providers and others must follow \"the same set of rules,\" Scalise said.</p><p>House Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., concentrated on how YouTube and other \"big tech\" players in the marketplace are influencing market trends, noting that Google pre-installs the YouTube app on all Android-powered smartphones. MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said recent combinations like AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner are a direct response to the \"market power\" of Google and Facebook, labeling such transactions as an often \"defensive\" measure aimed at keeping traditional providers competitive. Scalise questioned why traditional MVPDs are \"fighting\" against making substantial changes to the 1992 Cable Act given the significant changes in the marketplace, comparing them to the near-complete demise of Blockbuster. The company \"died for a reason,\" because it \"fought\" against market trends instead of adapting, Scalise said.</p><p>Doyle opened the hearing saying he hoped it would be \"just a beginning\" to a broader discussion within House Commerce about the state of the marketplace given upcoming work on STELA, saying he believed the Thursday panel would present only present a picture painted with a \"very broad brush.\" Congress \"should be examining how these markets have been affected\" by FCC actions under Pai that have created a \"regulatory vacuum in the marketplace, including rescission of the commission's 2015 net neutrality rules and a raft of changes to media ownership rules. Those changes appeared to benefit Sinclair's now-doomed bid to purchase Tribune and despite that deal's demise the altered rules will \"affect the market for years to come,\" Doyle said.</p><p>Doyle and House Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone, D-N.J., both took aim at the FCC's kidvid NPRM (see 1807120050), noting concerns about proposals to eliminate requirements on length and frequency of children's educational programming and language that would allow broadcasters to fulfill kidvid rules by streaming programming online. The FCC should \"rethink its bizarre [kidvid] proposal,\" Pallone said. Pai and FCC Commissioner Mike O'Rielly think the current programming requirement is \"too much to ask,\" but for low-income households and people without access to cable, \"I don't think so.\"</p><p>ABC's Ocean Treks Executive Producer Jeff Corwin defended the existing kidvid rules, arguing that allowing broadcasters to use streaming and multicasting to fulfill requirements would severely affect content providers' ability to fund production, including via ad revenue. The loss of easy access to children's programming would be harmful for children in low-income households in part because it would isolate them by \"not giving them resources that ought to be a stepping stone\" to interest in topics in science, technology and world cultures, Corwin said.</p><p>Lawmakers' discussions during the hearing show there will likely be significant interest in the STELA debate next year, American Cable Association Senior Vice President-Government Affairs Ross Lieberman told us. ACA, the Center for Individual Freedom, Consumers Union and MPAA were among the entities that submitted letters to House Communications ahead of the panel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC2-70T1-DYRJ-052V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"767\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 28, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Sci-fi stuff? Maybe when this law was written, but certainly no longer.</p><p>Last week, the state's highest court gave the green light to a lawsuit against Six Flags Entertainment Corp. over the use of a child's digitized thumbprint at the Great America amusement park in Gurnee. The ruling is a setback to Facebook and other big tech players who want to weaken such laws because they see more uses for biometrics.</p><p>We see good reasons to set strict parameters for the ways businesses grab data. With a new outrage over privacy in the news nearly every day, tech companies better become more responsible quickly -- or they'll have to contend with further legal restrictions.</p><p>In Illinois, people must give consent for biometric scans. They must receive a written explanation of how the data will be used and how long it will be kept. People can sue over violations of the act even if they can't prove they were harmed by misuse of these unique identifiers, which are in demand by everyone from workplaces to amusement parks. In the Six Flags case, a parent sued after her 14-year-old son had his thumb scanned into the park's biometric data capture system, the Tribune's Ally Marotti reported. Neither parent nor child was informed in writing why the thumbprint had been collected or how long it would be stored.</p><p>Safe to say that tech giants don't always have the public's best interests in mind when it comes to protecting personal data. Let's look at what they've been up to lately:</p><p>* Apple was forced to disable Group FaceTime after an uproar over a bug that made Macs and iPhones vulnerable to eavesdropping.</p><p>* Amazon is marketing facial-analysis system Rekognition for use in law enforcement, despite an alarming error rate, especially among women of color.</p><p>* Facebook angered Apple over the creative interpretation of consent. Apple decided enough was enough and temporarily booted the social network off its developer platform over a research app that vacuumed up personal information from users, including young teenagers. Apple later kicked off Google off briefly, too.</p><p>Occasional acts of self-policing aren't enough. If tech companies can't be trusted to handle data responsibly -- which we would prefer -- government enforcement is needed. The stakes are even higher with biometric data, which is why Illinois' law is sound. Consumers can always get a new credit card after a breach. Fingerprints can't be reissued.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: People in Illinois must give permission for biometric scans.

Big corporate names, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and his counterpart at Tesla, Elon Musk, have lashed out at the Menlo Park, California-headquartered company, with Musk tweeting, \"Just don't like Facebook. Gives me the willies.\"As Mark Zuckerberg, cofounder and CEO of Facebook, steels himself for a protracted face-off with governments and regulators over questionable use of its user data, critics are already circling the industry's core business model - centred around targeted advertising, which accounted for 98% of its revenues in 2017 - and wondering if other social media and consumer-focused tech firms, too, will get dragged into the muck. On the face of it, the big guns seem to be safe, for now.But as citizens, governments and regulators get tougher on them, the best they can hope for is that it's a temporary blip and the worst a protracted siege, with their revenue model coming under serious threat.In India, a key market for social media and consumer tech giants, these companies will hope their existing business models can hold up to far greater regulatory scrutiny. Already Union Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has signalled the government's hardened stance on unauthorised use of Indians' private data and many of these behemoths will want to fall in line, rather than risk a bruising fight with regulators - remember Facebook's futile campaign against net neutrality in 2015-16.Sceptics, however, point out that Indian consumers, millions of whom are first-time internet users and social media novices may be easily gulled into parting with their data. </p><p>Demanding greater caution from them may be difficult, and until now, social media companies, led by Facebook, have shied away from more probity around their affairs.Questions sent by ET Magazine to Facebook, Google and Microsoft went unanswered. An Amazon spokesperson told ET Magazine: \"Customer trust is one of our top priorities. We never sell our customers' personal information. We only share our customers' personal information as described in our privacy policy.\"\"Commercial Surveillance Network\" On May 24, new regulations from the EU may pose the most serious challenge yet to the dominance of internet companies. \"It's not social media but really all of digital media,\" says Jeffery Chester, executive director, Center for Digital Democracy, a non-governmental outfit in Washington, DC, which has battled tech companies over how they use and manage consumer data.\"The new EU data protection law creates an unprecedented opportunity to restore the balance between the giants that are gathering data, like Google and Facebook, and the individual.\" He believes companies will increasingly be held accountable and forced to change how they do data-driven digital marketing. \"The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal is emblematic of what goes on all over the world when people go online.They become part of a seamless commercial surveillance network.\" Facebook has said it was doing away with a product that enabled data providers help advertisers target Facebook users.Other critics of Facebook and tech companies' intrusive collection of personal information are quick to latch onto these worsening problems for the industry. \"This (harvesting of user data) is not a necessary evil and is not acceptable.Facebook has gone too far in capturing our data and marketing these data to unscrupulous players. Facebook has weaponised social media,\" says Vivek Wadhwa, distinguished fellow, Carnegie Mellon University Engineering. \"It has been the Wild Wild West, with no rules and regulations. It is time to fix this. They need to be urgently regulated.They are damaging the fabric of society.\" Alessandro Acquisti, professor of information technology and public policy at the Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, thinks this kind of intrusiveness is starting to have an adverse effect on consumers and to the detriment of social media and technology giants.\"There seems to be, at least in the US, at the moment, a change in the collective stance over privacy,\" he says. \"The recent scandals seem to have provided a definite answer to the question: does privacy matter?\" It may, however, be too early to judge if the current stance towards privacy will be lasting or fleeting - whether our privacy behaviours will change, or whether we will be back to droning on about the latest app.While there is a growing clamour over the direction internet companies are headed in, few people see a viable, alternative business model emerging. If you are not interested in an advertising-supported social network or search engine, the most obvious alternative is paying a one-time or periodic fee to have an ad-free experience. The implication is that since you are paying, the company does not have to share your data with advertisers.Vidya Narayanan, research director for Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project, believes that after a buccaneering ride for the past decade, these companies may need to take a more introspective route now. Led by Facebook's reassessing its privacy policies and procedures, these behemoths may be in for a long slog. Facebook has vowed to make privacy settings easier to access. \"There's also a need to raise awareness among people about the ways in which data can be accessed by third-party apps using Facebook APIs and how the data collected by the tech biggies is being shared with advertisers and campaign managers who use that for micro-targeting,\" she says. (API or application program interface is the software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.)As these companies evolve, stricter regulation is inevitable. \"These companies need to be regulated...(they) have evolved from being simply search engines or platforms for social interaction, to becoming arbiters of our world view,\" adds Narayanan. If EU's data protection law is a step in that direction - the US and India are, among others, mulling tougher legislation - consumers could benefit in several ways.These include not getting manipulated, gaining some understanding of how individual news feed is determined and how search results are sorted and recommendations generated. Users then need not view the world through a prism that's designed by big tech companies based solely on user preferences. Regulators could also prevent hate speech and misinformation campaigns influencing elections.While this may be one way to look at things, some new social media ventures like Vero are toying with alternative business models like subscription. However, subscription-based social media platforms have not worked or remain very niche. Vero is also trying out another way to monetise its user network, by letting merchants sell their wares to users and charging them a transaction fee. But this means users could be shown products based on their posts.Vero has been around since 2015 but saw its iOS user base quadruple to 2,00,000 after the Facebook scandal. (Vero is also available on Android). Vero is not charging its first million users - it had yet to decide a fee for the rest.The company is led by billionaire Ayman Hariri, son of slain former Lebanese PM Rafic Hariri. Minds, a privacy-focused open-source and crowdfunded social networking service, is not very popular. There are bound to be more attempts to create \"more responsible\" competitors to Facebook - a few days back, industrialist Anand Mahindra tweeted that he would financially back Indian startups in the social media space, if there were any.Some industry watchers, however, think these initiatives may be half-baked. Balaji Venkateshwar, a cybersecurity expert, says subscription is not a viable business model for social media and messaging platforms. He refers to WhatsApp's decision to withdraw its token $1 a year subscription fee in 2016, citing difficulty in making online payments in many countries. (WhatsApp is owned by Facebook.) \"These companies can't scale up with subscription, and users will have to realise there is no free lunch. They get to use social media for free because their data is being sold to advertisers,\" he says. \"More important than subscription is localisation of data. For instance, Indians' data should be stored in India. Otherwise, the Indian government cannot do much in case of a breach.\"Social media maven Karthik Srinivasan believes these giants are too big to fail, even if they are compelled to tweak their tech backbone and privacy policies to better protect their users. He says the current angst is isolated and if there were to be a serious wave of disenchantment, large number of users would log out. \"(Platforms like) Facebook and Google are too big to fail, and people have gotten thoroughly used to their networks and conveniences on these platforms,\" he adds. \"So, forgetting them will not be easy like what happened to Myspace or Orkut, which had lost their utility value long before they shut shop.\" Social media, then, may be here to stay, even if an agreeable business model is a work in progress. \"Social media has become an essential part of our lives and in its best form enables public engagement with socio-political causes and supports freedom of speech,\" says Narayanan of Oxford University. \"As many Indians come online for the first time, social media can be a powerful force for empowerment and freedom from traditional hierarchies.\"Nailing down this business model may be harder than it appears. Just paying to access a website or an app does not necessarily mean the company is not going to use your data. Take, for instance, video-streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hotstar. They charge a subscription fee to allow access to their whole library, but they accumulate data on what you watch, based on which they recommend films and series.It is accentuated in the case of a platform like Google-owned YouTube, which has a wildly popular free version with ads before and in the middle of videos, but also has an ad-free subscription option. YouTube has millions of user generated videos and if you have searched for clips skewed towards a particular ideology, chances are you will be shown a lot of similar videos. In several cases, not revealing details like your ISP address and location - by not logging in or by using a virtual private network - means you are giving up on convenience. For instance, you may not be able to auto-complete web addresses and searches.Narayanan says the business models of most of these companies may be rooted in access to public information and their long-term success may be dependent on educating consumers about protecting their privacy and ensuring that they read the fine print in all data consent forms.\"Meanwhile the onus is on policymakers and researchers to apply suitable pressure on big tech companies to follow an ethical data gathering, harvesting and sharing policy,\" she adds. \"There's also an urgent need for these companies to be transparent about the external companies and political parties that they might be sharing their data with.

Michael Beckerman, TikTok's head of US public policy, said the firm \"didn't have the opportunity to grow up in the golden years of the internet, when tech companies could do no wrong.\" Instead, TikTok entered the US market in 2018, during a time when skepticism of tech platforms, content moderation, data privacy, and other factors proliferated public perception of the industry. </p><p>TikTok's future remains unclear as President Donald Trump's Sept. 15 deadline approaches for its parent company \u2014 the China-based Bytedance \u2014 to divest the firm. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1].TikTok's fate continues to hang in the balance as its China-based parent company remains under pressure to divest its US business.Multiple factors have long been at play[2] in the TikTok-US-China debacle, such as the question of how accessible American data is to the Chinese government.But TikTok's vice president Michael Beckerman, who oversees US public policy for the company, said during a Wednesday press call that another reason for the criticism could be because of the ever-increasing distrust of big tech, according to an Axios[3] report.\"We didn't have the opportunity to grow up in the golden years of the internet, when tech companies could do no wrong,\" Beckerman said Wednesday according to Axios. \"We grew up in the techlash age, where there's a lot of skepticism of platforms, how they moderate content and how their algorithms work.\"Beckerman was referring to the shift in perception of the tech industry that has occurred in recent years, which has been dubbed the \"techlash.\"[4] The public has stopped looking at Silicon Valley through rose-colored glasses as the potential dangers of technology have entered the arena, like user data privacy, election interference, and censorship practices. Now, many are calling for the powerful industry to be regulated.Beckerman also said the two-year-old firm is \"operating with the expectations of a 10-year-old company,\" according to Axios. TikTok entered the US market in 2018, the same year that Facebook's mishandling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal[5] came to light.TikTok executives on the Wednesday call said they were pulling back the curtain on TikTok's algorithm, which powers the ultra-popular video sharing app and is somewhat of the secret sauce to a would-be acquisition. China recently tweaked its export rules[6] to include certain types of technology, including artificial intelligence, which could strip a deal of TikTok's coveted algorithm.President Trump set a Sept. 15 deadline for Bytedance, the China-based parent company, to divest its US TikTok business before it would be banned nationwide. If a US firm acquired TikTok, it could skirt the president's US ban on the app. It would also ease the US government's concerns surrounding national security.But the possibility of any such deal remains unclear. Officials were reportedly mulling over the decision[7] to extend the deadline for an acquisition past Sept. 15. President Trump refuted that move and told reporters on Thursday[8] that an extension would not be happening.

For weeks, White House officials \u2013 including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and President Donald Trump \u2013 have raised the prospect of a ban of ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s TikTok app in the U.S., citing national security concerns. But now it seems the government could be amenable to a middle ground. On Friday,  Bloomberg News reported Trump plans to order ByteDance Ltd. to divest its ownership of TikTok. Then later in the afternoon, several media outlets reported Microsoft Corp. is in talks to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.   To be clear, if ByteDance is forced to sell TikTok under the administration\u2019s pressure, the story won\u2019t be over. TikTok is only one front in a wider campaign of rising political and economic tensions between the U.S. and China. China may retaliate by targeting American business interests on its soil or taking other measures that further inflame the situation. But putting all that aside and in the meantime, let\u2019s consider the merits of a TikTok sale.    There seem to be two active bidders for the app. One is Microsoft. As for the other, Reuters reported earlier this week that some of Bytedance\u2019s U.S investors have proposed a bid for a majority stake of TikTok, valuing the company\u2019s non-China operations at $50 billion. The offer would be about 50 times TikTok\u2019s forecast sales of $1 billion this year, Reuters reported.   On a personal level, an independent TikTok owned by American venture capital firms is the preferable option. By staying separate, the social media app can hire and retain the best engineers with tantalizing pre-IPO stock compensation. Top-tier technical talent is needed to keep the company on the bleeding edge. And history is littered with examples of upstarts that were acquired by larger companies and subsequently lost their ability to nimbly react to competitors. Examples of  M&amp;A debacles include Yahoo\u2019s acquisition of Tumblr and News Corp.\u2019s Myspace purchase.   In this instance, though, Microsoft may be the best suitor. On the surface, it may seem strange to contemplate such a large deal in an environment of greater regulator scrutiny over the technology industry\u2019s acquisitions. In fact, we are just days removed from CEOs of four other Big Tech companies getting grilled over their anticompetitive practices before a House subcommittee. However, counter-intuitively this merger can make sense in terms of antitrust principles. A Microsoft-TikTok combination would create a much more competitive U.S. digital advertising market by establishing a powerful third player against the two dominant internet ad goliaths, Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. And let\u2019s face it, the administration may prefer a sale of TikTok \u2014 even to a giant like Microsoft \u2014  over banning an app that\u2019s wildly popular with millions of Americans.    Microsoft\u2019s businesses would benefit as well by adding scale to its burgeoning digital advertising operation, anchored by its Bing search engine. The company could also cross-promote TikTok\u2019s social media video features across its Xbox gaming console and cloud services. And finally, ByteDance may appreciate a deal with Microsoft for a purely expedient purpose. The software giant valued at roughly $1.6 trillion can quickly and easily pay the Chinese company the tens of billions TikTok is worth without the complications of dealing with multiple smaller investment firms.   So at the end if the day, a Microsoft-TikTok combination may be the best and most elegant solution for all parties involved. The happiest may actually be the apps users, celebrating their favorite service\u2019s survival.

To date, OneTrust has raised $410 million in funding and surpassed 5,000 customers.</p><p>\"It's really exciting to see how OneTrust has grown in just the past year,\" Kabir Barday, CEO of OneTrust, told Atlanta Inno about the round. \"The [California Consumer Privacy Act,] [General Data Protection Regulation] and other privacy laws across the globe like Brazil's LGPD and Thailand's PDPA have created a huge demand for our technology. Consumers are demanding privacy-centric approaches to data use, and businesses are responding. Already in 2020 we've seen the CCPA become law, privacy legislative activity in the U.S. and globally and moves from big tech companies to adopt more privacy-centric practices.\"</p><p>Coatue was joined OneTrust's round after recognizing the company's vision and opportunity in the market, Barday said.</p><p>\"We're lucky to have the trust and support from our investors to fuel our growth, drive our product innovation and build our customer and partner success,\" he said. \"Insight Partners led our Series A and were a natural fit to continue to invest in the OneTrust platform. While the majority of the funds from our Series A are still available, we see significant opportunities for growth and want to move fast on any organic and inorganic growth opportunities we may see in the market and Coatue and Insight Partners are the right investors for us to continue on our trajectory.\"</p><p>OneTrust, which Barday believes to be the only billion-dollar valued privacy technology company, has doubled their valuation because of their expertise in the privacy field, Barday said.</p><p>\"We host some of the biggest events in the world dedicated to privacy technology here in Atlanta, namely our PrivacyTech global user conference, and have made Atlanta the No. 2 ranked city in the U.S. for IAPP CIPP holders, the International Association of Privacy Professionals Certified Information Privacy Professional,\" he said.</p><p>OneTrust works with companies' privacy departments to be sure they are complying with privacy regulations and laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the EU's GDPR and Brazil's LGPD. In an age where privacy is a growing concern for customers, OneTrust serves as a source to let companies know what data they're collecting, how much, what they need to disclose to their customers and more.</p><p>\"Our customers are asking us to build technology that goes beyond privacy and into data ethics and trust as a competitive differentiator,\" Barday said. \"We've responded by building out our product to address more use cases on top of privacy.\"</p><p>Much of the OneTrust leadership and employee base worked together previously at Manhattan Associates and AirWatch, Barday said. Because of their commonality in culture, the team has been able to scale in a way no other company can without the chaos seen in typical high-growth companies, he said.</p><p>\"We know not just how to build a technology platform that scales, but an employee and customer base that's well resourced to grow in tandem,\" he said.</p><p>OneTrust currently employs 1,500 people across 10 offices around the world. Barday said the company plans to grow and scale the team to meet their customers' demands.</p><p>\"We moved into a new space in both our Atlanta and London co-headquarters, and expanded or moved into new space in nearly every other office that we operate,\" he said.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

And yet, as we note this week[1], calm has descended on the euro-dollar exchange rate. The volatility implied by the cost of currency options recently fell below the levels of the serene pre-crisis days of 2007. Monetary policy provides one explanation: worries about low growth have caused both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to cut interest rates, which markets expect to stay low. </p><p>And fears about the euro zone's break-up have long dissipated. So, still waters. For now.In its election manifesto[2], published this week, Britain's Labour Party promises, besides higher taxes for the rich and vastly increased public spending, to nationalise parts of BT[3], formerly a state-owned telecoms monopoly, and to provide free fibre-optic broadband for all. Britain is a laggard in fibre, which allows much higher speeds than copper wires. But its broadband is far from awful. Ultra-fast connections are rare but so are truly sluggish ones. Talk of nationalisation may anyway be moot: our reporting[4] suggests Labour may lose traditional strongholds to the governing Conservatives in next month's poll.Banks have long been under assault from eager 'fintech' upstarts. Now the adversaries that both sides fear more than the other, big technology companies, at last look serious about getting into finance[5]. So far they have made only limited inroads, at least in most Western countries. But each of the GAFA quartet (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple) is making moves. Most recently, Google has said it will start offering current (checking) accounts in America next year. Why do freewheeling techies want to get into such a heavily regulated industry? They probably don't want to be banks, but they surely do want your data.On November 18th Mike Pompeo, America's secretary of state, said that Israeli settlements in the West Bank were in line with international law[6]. That is consistent with other gestures by President Donald Trump's administration favouring Israel, but not with the international consensus that the settlements, in territories Israel captured in a war with Arab states in 1967, are illegal. Some 428,000 Israeli settlers are estimated to live in the West Bank, alongside 2.6m Palestinians. Our leader[7] this week argues that America's decision makes peace less likely, and that Mr Trump has hemmed in whoever leads Israel next. Who that will be remains unclear. Israeli politics remains gridlocked, after two inconclusive elections. The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has been charged with bribery and fraud[8].The illegal drugs industry is booming again. Having fallen during the global financial crisis, production of hard drugs is as high as ever[9]. Colombia's coca crop has increased since the FARC, a Marxist insurgency, disbanded, as traffickers have moved into its territory. Opium has flourished in Afghanistan since most NATO forces pulled out in 2014. Africa is probably suffering most, as a conduit for drugs from both Latin America and Central Asia. Several countries in the continent are afflicted, but Guinea-Bissau[10], on the Atlantic, perhaps worst of all. In one recent haul police found enough cocaine to cut 100m lines.

And yet, as we note this week, calm has descended on the euro-dollar exchange rate. The volatility implied by the cost of currency options recently fell below the levels of the serene pre-crisis days of 2007. Monetary policy provides one explanation: worries about low growth have caused both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to cut interest rates, which markets expect to stay low. And fears about the euro zone's break-up have long dissipated. So, still waters. For now.</p><p>In its election manifesto, published this week, Britain's Labour Party promises, besides higher taxes for the rich and vastly increased public spending, to nationalise parts of BT, formerly a state-owned telecoms monopoly, and to provide free fibre-optic broadband for all. Britain is a laggard in fibre, which allows much higher speeds than copper wires. But its broadband is far from awful. Ultra-fast connections are rare but so are truly sluggish ones. Talk of nationalisation may anyway be moot: our reporting suggests Labour may lose traditional strongholds to the governing Conservatives in next month's poll.</p><p>Banks have long been under assault from eager \"fintech\" upstarts. Now the adversaries that both sides fear more than the other, big technology companies, at last look serious about getting into finance. So far they have made only limited inroads, at least in most Western countries. But each of the GAFA quartet (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple) is making moves. Most recently, Google has said it will start offering current (checking) accounts in America next year. Why do freewheeling techies want to get into such a heavily regulated industry? They probably don't want to be banks, but they surely do want your data.</p><p>On November 18th Mike Pompeo, America's secretary of state, said that Israeli settlements in the West Bank were in line with international law. That is consistent with other gestures by President Donald Trump's administration favouring Israel, but not with the international consensus that the settlements, in territories Israel captured in a war with Arab states in 1967, are illegal. Some 428,000 Israeli settlers are estimated to live in the West Bank, alongside 2.6m Palestinians. Our leader this week argues that America's decision makes peace less likely, and that Mr Trump has hemmed in whoever leads Israel next. Who that will be remains unclear. Israeli politics remains gridlocked, after two inconclusive elections. The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has been charged with bribery and fraud.</p><p>The illegal drugs industry is booming again. Having fallen during the global financial crisis, production of hard drugs is as high as ever. Colombia's coca crop has increased since the FARC, a Marxist insurgency, disbanded, as traffickers have moved into its territory. Opium has flourished in Afghanistan since most NATO forces pulled out in 2014. Africa is probably suffering most, as a conduit for drugs from both Latin America and Central Asia. Several countries in the continent are afflicted, but Guinea-Bissau, on the Atlantic, perhaps worst of all. In one recent haul police found enough cocaine to cut 100m lines.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XK1-MKP1-F03B-T4F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">251202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Economist Newspapers, NA, Incorporated All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economist.Com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37727\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ahead this hour, powerful earthquake rocks Indonesia.  Buildings have collapsed.  And people are believed to be still trapped under the rubble. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Donald Trump Victory Tour hits its next city.  The president-elect claiming strong America military might -- will actually keep the peace. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Europe's most powerful leader wants Germany to become the latest nation to ban the burqa. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, everybody.  Thank you for being with us.  I'm John Vause.  This is NEWSROOM L.A.</p><p>A powerful earthquake has killed at least 26 people in Northwest Indonesia.  The Red Cross says many homes and buildings have been damaged in Aceh province.  And residents were sent running into the streets.  It's the same province hit by the devastating tsunami in 2004, which killed tens of thousands.  Right now, there are no tsunami warnings.   </p><p>CNN's Kathy Quiano joins us on the phone from Jakarta with the very latest.  What do you know about the rescue efforts right now and the extent of the damage, Kathy? </p><p>KATHY QUIANO, CNN REPORTER:  Well, John, rescue teams are working very hard to search and pull out any victims who'll be trapped under the rubble.  Scores of homes, shop houses, buildings and mosques were totally or partially damaged by the quake.  Some roads have also been cut off.  The quake hit the streets of Pidie and (INAUDIBLE) in Aceh which is about past 5:00 a.m. this morning.  Residents were preparing for early morning prayers when the quake struck and as you said they panicked and ran out to the streets.  Many of them chose to stay there as aftershock continued to hit the area.   </p><p>The tremor was very shallow, with only a depth of 10 kilometers.  And it's happened inland, so that's why we're seeing a lot of damage to infrastructure.  The areas hit are not highly urbanized.  Most of the structures are low-rise homes and shop houses, and buildings are only a few stories high.  The local and national government agencies are working hard together to provide immediate medical assistance, food, and shelter.  But the priority right now is to find and rescue any more survivors, John? </p><p>VAUSE:  Kathy, do we know if the rescue crews have access to heavy machinery and other equipment which they'll need to get to those people who are trapped beneath the rubble? </p><p>QUIANO:  Well, we're hearing reports that heavy equipment have been able to reach areas.  As I said, some roads are cut off, were damaged as well.  But we're -- we know that rescue efforts are going on, and that they are able now to use heavy equipment.  So, the national government has sent more from nearby provinces.  President Joko Widodo has ordered immediate assistance to be sent there.  Anything that needs to help, any teams there to try to save more lives, John? </p><p>VAUSE:  OK, Kathy.  Thank you, Kathy Quiano on the line there from Jakarta with the very latest on that deadly earthquake. </p><p>Donald Trump's Thank You Tour rolled into North Carolina on Tuesday, one of the swing states crucial in his election win.  Trump talked about the greatness of his political movement, claiming it's unlike anything ever.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDEN-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We do not know what the page tomorrow will read.  But for the first time in a long time, what we do know is that the pages will be authored by each and everyone in this room and in our country, by you.  It's going to be authored by you. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VAUSE:  Back with us now, CNN's Senior Political Analyst Ron Brownstein.  You know, we've heard from Trump's aides saying that he loves these rallies.  That's where he gets recharged, he gets his energy from.  And it looks like these will be some of the permanent fixture of his administration.  Is there a problem, though, if he continues to go to the rallies with people cheering then he gets sort of a false impression of the broader opinion of the rest of the country? </p><p>RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure.  I mean, you know, it's fascinating.  Clearly, he draws strength from this.  And it is not unusual for presidents to, you know, campaign and go out and speak to followers and supporters.  Well, I think one thing we've seen that's already unusual is that tonight being an exception, Trump has been pretty unscripted.  You know, much more unscripted than we typically see a president or even a president-elect be  If he continues in that mode as president, that would be a real departure. But the reality is that Donald Trump won the election fair and square. He won the Electoral College, he won the states and they both contested the most heavily Iowa -- I'm sorry.  Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina.  But he lost the popular vote by more than anyone who will ever become president.   </p><p>Hillary Clinton has an outside chance of coming very close to George W. Bush's margin in the popular vote in 2004, an election that republicans portrayed as a decisive win.  Democrats gained seats in the senate, although not enough to take it over, and in the house. So, Trump, I mean, you know, he is looking for validation.  He finds validation in these audiences.  But the reality is he still has a big portion of the country that is skeptical of him as he takes office. </p><p>[01:05:13] VAUSE:  Right.  Well, I guess if we're looking for a headline from this rally, Trump's pick for Defense Secretary and he also laid out what appears to be a noninterventionist military policy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  We build up our military not as an act of aggression, but as an act of prevention.  We pursue and build up arms not in order to seek conflict, but in order to avoid conflict.  We want to be strong. In short, we seek peace through strength. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BROWNSTEIN:  You know, the way he's describing the military there, you can almost envision it as a kind of wall between the U.S. and the world.  And in fact, if you think about military engagement and alliance and intervention in other countries, immigration, trade, it's a very consistent theme.  I mean, President-elect Trump portrays the world as kind of a dark, dangerous, duplicitous place that is out to kind of get the best of America.  And we need to show strength and be tough.  But largely take a big step back behind these walls.  I mean, the China example is kind of fascinating here.  I mean, obviously he's talking tough on China or tweeting tough on China and talking with the Taiwanese President.  But he is also stepping back from Asia by abandoning the transpacific partnership, the trade deal that President Obama saw as the principle way of counterbalancing Chinese economic power in the region.  So, there's a pretty consistent pattern emerging in the way he talks and acts. </p><p>VAUSE:  You mentioned, you know, the diplomatic dust-up with China over Taiwan.  We are now learning through a number of reports that Bob Dole, Senator Bob Dole, former presidential nominee for the Republican Party was actually paid by lobbyists for Taiwan $140,000 to set that phone call up.  I mean, this does seem to be, you know, one of the problems within the Trump team.  This sort of if not conflicts of interest, but the appearance of conflict of interest.  </p><p>BROWNSTEIN:  Yeah.  And not only that, but kind of like a lack of a sense of structure that would kind of insulate a president-elect from something like that, who may not have wanted to be insulated.  This may have been the direction that he wanted to go.  It's an extraordinary story.  First of all, it's important to recognize, Bob Dole was the only living republican presidential nominee to actively support Donald Trump.  Now, he did so before this contract apparently began in May in The New York Times reporting.  In January, he said that Donald Trump would have been a better bet than Ted Cruz.  But still, the idea that this was facilitated by a lobbying contract is going to add -- is going to add a lot of questions in the days ahead. </p><p>VAUSE:  And the other problem within the Trump campaign is Michael Flynn, Jr., son of General Michael Flynn who is the pick for National Security Advisor.  Flynn has been -- Flynn, Jr. has been fired because he's retweeting all these fake news stories.  And there is this question of whether he actually had security clearance to be part of the White House administration?  Jake Tapper pressed the Vice President-Elect Mike Pence about that.  And this was the response he got from Mr. Pence.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I said this morning that his son had no involvement in the transition.  But I've talked to General Flynn, and his son was helping him a bit with scheduling and administrative items.  But that's no longer the case. Mike Flynn, Jr. is no longer associated with General Flynn's efforts or with the transition team.  And we're focused eyes forward. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VAUSE:  Again -- </p><p>BROWNSTEIN:  They were -- they were trying to -- you know, Jake had to ask him eight times before he got kind of a full answer.  And they were trying to minimize it by basically saying, well, he was helping his scheduling on the -- on the transition.  There is some indications that they were moving toward having him as a position on the National Security Council itself.  But the issue with the son does not end with the son, because many of these same kind of conspiracy theories have been advanced by the father as well on his own Twitter account.  And you're having, I think, growing questions and growing challenges to that.  He's kept a very low profile during the transition itself.  But you can bet there will be more of a bulls-eye on General Flynn in the days ahead by democrats. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>VAUSE:  (INAUDIBLE) some calls for Trump to dump him, but Trump is very loyal to a point.  </p><p>BROWNSTEIN:  Maybe bulls-eye is the wrong word.  If he have, I'd call it ping-pong.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Fair enough. </p><p>BROWNSTEIN:  Yeah. </p><p>VAUSE:  Interesting that Trump -- he seems to be out there campaigning making what seems to be a lot of promises. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to do a great job.  We're going to create a safe country.  We're going to create a prosperous country.  We're going to have jobs again, great jobs.  Not bad jobs, real jobs.  Together we will raise incomes and create millions and millions of new jobs. That's going to happen.  It's already happening.  You see what happened today?  We will re-establish the rule of law and defend the constitution of the United States.  We will protect the right of every American to live in safety and peace.  We will restore and respect, and we will respect people's rights, we will respect constitutional rights. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VAUSE:  I mean, there is a lot of stuff which he promised tonight. </p><p>BROWNSTEIN:  Yes. </p><p>[01:10:02] VAUSE:  And can you make promises as president?  I mean, like he is doing as a candidate?  Because, you know, surely these now have to be delivered. </p><p>BROWNSTEIN:  He is pushing against big tides.  He won this election primarily because of overwhelming almost unprecedented levels of support among non-college and non-urban white Americans, many of whom have been losing ground economically since the 1970s, from the twin forces of globalization and even more technological change.  The ability of a president through policy levers to reverse those kinds of structural forces is limited.  And the question will be whether -- how much rope those voters are willing to give him, if he can't ultimately reverse what has been decades of both job loss and in particular income stagnation through the policies that he pursues over four years. </p><p>VAUSE:  Although, he did take credit for the creation of 50,000 jobs because of the massive billions dollar investment from a Japanese telecom company.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  And one of the wealthiest men in the world, you saw it today, maybe, did anybody see it?  Masa, right?  Masa, great guy of Japan. He's pledged that he's going to put $50 billion into the United States because of our victory. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VAUSE:  Let's bring Andrew Stevens in now.  He is CNN Money Asia Pacific Editor.  So, Andrew, what more do we know about this deal which seems to be in the works long before Trump was elected? </p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN MONEY ASIA PACIFIC EDITOR:  Well, what was in the works long before Trump was elected, and it wasn't that long, I mean, it was in October, John, was Masayoshi Son who is the boss of SoftBank in Japan was setting up a $100 billion fund to invest in tech ventures.  And the main partner was the Saudi Arabian government, or is the Saudi Arabian government.  Now, there's no -- no money has physically gone in yet, but it looks as if the reports -- if the reports are correct that Masayoshi is going to put in $25 billion and the Saudis another $45 billion.  And other shareholders will make up the rest.  So, Masayoshi Son goes to the Trump Towers, meets with Donald Trump for a private meeting for 45 minutes and comes out with this statement, which we heard from Donald Trump.   </p><p>So, that's a $50 billion investment to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S. and what looks like in tech companies and mainly start-up companies, John.  And creating 50,000 jobs in a start-up companies in the timeframe seems to be four years, that's what he told The Wall Street Journal, that sounds like that's an ambitious target.  And Donald Trump was saying that if it wasn't for my election victory or my election victory spurred Masayoshi decision to spend this money, that's Donald Trump's word, and we've got nothing to back that out with. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  It seems to be the case on many things with the president-elect.  Andrew, thank you.  Andrew Stevens live (INAUDIBLE) some perspective there from Hong Kong. </p><p>You know, Ron, you know, this is just all sort of smoke and mirrors in some ways.  It's like look, I've got these 50,000 jobs where, you know, it's kind of very dubious if he actually created these jobs. </p><p>BROWNSTEIN:  Look, we've had a lot of job growth over the last eight years.  I think the final numbers may be 9 or 10 to 1 under President Obama's term compared to George W. Bush's two terms.  But in big parts of the country, they have -- they're feeling as though the job growth has either left them behind or has produced kind of employment that was less -- that offered less of a middleclass lifestyle than they remember from their parents growing up.  It's going to be difficult for Donald Trump, as I said, to reverse some of those trends.  The question is how far can he get with these big symbolic victories if by no other means -- if I know -- if nothing else, these show that he is concerned about those problems.  I feel your pain, as another president said once.  That was Bill Clinton. </p><p>VAUSE:  Yeah. </p><p>BROWNSTEIN:  And, you know, how far can that take him in maintaining the allegiance of these voters who were so important in putting him where he is today, even if he can't structurally change what has been decades of decline in places like Youngstown and Gary and Flint. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  So, we've had a very substantive discussion over the last couple of hours about military intervention, about jobs, about the economy.  We've talked about Trump (INAUDIBLE) then, you know, we all woke up this morning to Trump saying he was going to scrap the deal with Boeing to replace, you know, two presidential planes.  This is the reason why Trump gave reporters outside Trump Tower. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  The plane is totally out of control.  It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program.  And I think it's ridiculous.  I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number.  We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VAUSE:  You know, this comes out of nowhere.  Like the (INAUDIBLE) should be, you know, thrown in jail. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) BROWNSTEIN:  Right.  Well, look, we're seeing -- what we're seeing is a willingness on the part of Trump to go after individual companies in a variety of means, usually around their investment decisions.  What we saw in Carrier and others, that he is criticized for wanting to move jobs or build plants in Mexico.   </p><p>[01:15:01] If this was coming from Barack Obama or democrats in congress, you would hear Paul Ryan and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the business round table with their heads exploding.  I think they don't know quite what to do with this from Donald Trump, because on the one hand, he is promising them big cuts in their taxes, big cuts in regulations, a move toward many of the things that they most want in terms of rolling back Washington.   </p><p>On the other hand, he has shown a willingness to kind of call out individual companies by name in an extraordinary way that we really haven't seen from a president in this detail possibly since John F. Kennedy's confrontation with the steel industry in the early 1960s. So, I think there are a lot of CEOs, C-suites and the equivalents of trade association in Washington that are really wondering how they -- how they're going to calibrate their reaction to this president and this kind of mix of things that they have long wanted that he wants to give them, and yet this other confrontational and unpredictable side. </p><p>VAUSE:  Unpredictable -- that will be the word for some time to come. Ron, thanks so much.  </p><p>BROWNSTEIN:  Thank you, John.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Well, the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says he will not let Donald Trump rip up the nuclear deal with the United States.  And during his campaign, Trump called the deal one of the worst ever, vowed to renegotiate the terms.  But on Tuesday, Rouhani had his own warning for the President-elect. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator):  The U.S., as part of the five plus one, is one of our enemies and wants to pressure us.  There is no doubt about that.  We have to resist, be steadfast, and find a way to counter it.  They may break the nuclear agreement. They have already done so by extending the D'Amato Law.  If this measure is actually implemented, then it would be a clear breach of the nuclear agreement, and will cause us to react very harshly and severely. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VAUSE:  Let's bring in CNN Intelligence and Security Analyst, former CIA Operative Bob Baer, joining us via Skype from Telluride, Colorado. Bob, Rouhani called America the enemy.  According to New York Times, the crowds are chanting \"death to America.\"  Rouhani is meant to be the moderate.  Is this all in response to the incoming Trump administration? </p><p>BOB BAER, CNN INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY ANALYST AND FORMER CIA OPERATIVE:  Well, John, I think that they really don't know what's going to happen next, if you look at the Presidents-elect's national security team, they're all strongly anti-Iranian.  In fact, a lot of them believe that we should use force against Iran.  The Iranians at this point have to be very wary what we're going to do next.  They frankly don't understand this administration and they would react very negatively if we withdrew that agreement, the five plus one.  It's, you know, we're uncharted waters right here.  It could turn very ugly, very fast.  </p><p>VAUSE:  You know, in contrast to Donald Trump, President Obama on Tuesday, he was out talking about the power of diplomacy.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>OBAMA:  Terrorists would love to see us walk away from the type of work that builds international coalitions and ends conflicts and stops the spread of deadly weapons.  It would make life easier for them, it would be a tragic mistake for us.  Just think about what we've done these last eight years without firing a shot. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  He went on to give the example of the Iran nuclear deal as, you know, one of those efforts in diplomacy being successful.  Is he right? </p><p>BAER:  It was a good agreement.  The Iranians stopped building a nuclear bomb.  They were very close and we rescind -- we take back that agreement, I think they will go ahead and try to make one, and they could do it very quickly.  You tightening a couple of screws here and there, and then if they'll test a bomb, and what that will cause is a nuclear arms race.  And -- but more than that, diplomacy has essentially kept a, you know, a confrontation in the gulf from happening.  It's so easy for an escalation to occur and there have been a lot of close calls over the last few months.  If we would turn hostile to Iran, and impose new sanctions, I think this could very easily turn into some sort of armed conflict in the gulf. </p><p>VAUSE:  Well, the State Department Spokesman Mark Toner, he was talking in glowing terms about that nuclear deal with Iran.  This is what he said. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MARK TONER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN:  Thus far, all sides, all parties have lived up to their commitments under the JCPOA.  And it's working.  So, you know, we think it's a good deal. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  You know, the critics point out that's debatable.  They say the Iranians, for example, have twice exceeded their limit for heavy water, which is used in some nuclear reactors.  It could be used for building nuclear bombs, they've cheated on other U.N. sanctions, not necessarily this deal, and they say, essentially the Iranians aren't living up to their part of the deal.  How do you see it? </p><p>[01:19:45] BAER:  Those are small infractions.  There's no, you know, violations to the agreement that could call it into question.  You know, this was expected, but by and large, we have brought the Iranian nuclear program under control and under inspection.  It's something that was unthinkable 10 years ago, and it was very difficult for the Iranians to give up what they believe is their right to produce nuclear, you know, reactors and the rest of it.  They don't understand, for instance, why Israel can have a nuclear bomb or their own reactors that don't come under inspection and they can't.  You know, we have a good argument for that.  But the point is, this agreement was hard fought, and it's a good agreement, and if it's taken back now, like I said, it's going to turn ugly. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK, Bob.  Appreciate your perspective.  Thanks so much.  Bob Baer, former CIA Operative in Telluride. </p><p>Next on NEWSROOM L.A., how four major tech companies are teaming up to get terrorist videos off the internet. </p><p>Millions of people are sharing fake news stories before a hard fought election.  Does that sound familiar?  Ahead the real world effects of Italy's false news machines. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>[01:24:53] VAUSE:  Four of the world's biggest tech companies are working together to fight the spread of terrorism online.  Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and YouTube will share a database to flag and remove what they call violent terrorist imagery, or terrorist recruitment videos like these ISIS propaganda videos.  The database will have digital fingerprints of the images and video, which will help the companies identify other terrorist content.  Joining me now is tech expert and co-founder of StoryTech, Lori Schwartz.  Lori, thank you for being with us.  </p><p>LORI SCHWARTZ, CO-FOUNDER OF STORYTECH:  It is great to be here. </p><p>VAUSE:  I want to play some sound from President Obama earlier on Tuesday.  He specifically mentioned social media as a tool of choice by Jihadi groups. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>OBAMA:  For all of our necessary focus on fighting terrorists overseas, the most deadly attacks on the homeland over the last eight years have not been carried out by operatives with sophisticated networks or equipment directed from abroad.  They've been carried out by home-grown and largely isolated individualist who were radicalized online. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VAUSE:  So, how big is this problem right now? </p><p>SCHWARTZ:  Oh, it's huge.  It's tremendous.  I mean, there are so many different social media platforms and so many people creating fake account, and so much activity, and it's so hard to track what's going on and where it's coming from.  It's decentralized, right?  And there are new social media platforms being born all the time, and, you know, messenger platforms and it's just an explosion of tech right now.  So, it's very scary.  </p><p>VAUSE:  It's like whack-a-mole in a way.  </p><p>SCHWARTZ:  Yes, it really is. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  So, technically, how would this work?  Will these big tech companies are proposing, how does this actually, you know, work from a just a technical point of view? </p><p>SCHWARTZ:  So, basically there's an algorithm, just some software, and that software can basically sort through all of these images and videos, because each of them will have a little digital fingerprint. And they're actually calling it a \"hash\" but it's just a digital fingerprint.  And so, when something gets uploaded, the algorithm goes through it, and finds it, and identifies it.  Now, the thing that's interesting about all of this is that Facebook and Twitter and Microsoft and YouTube, aren't going to automatically remove something just because it's on the database.  They're each going to sort through against their own rules and judge it by what their platform has decided and it should be removed.  </p><p>VAUSE:  So, you're saying this is where the human intervention comes into play? </p><p>SCHWARTZ:  Yeah. </p><p>VAUSE:  Is this where you have to make that decision, is this terrorist propaganda or this is just free speech? </p><p>SCHWARTZ:  Yeah, exactly, and I -- and I think that there's always going to be pushback from, you know, civil liberties on whether this is the first amendment issue.  But the thing about the first amendment is the first amendment is a government issue.  You know, Facebook is allowed to say, this is OK to be on my platform or this isn't.  You're still dealing with corporations that are determining what's right and what's wrong.  And they're businesses who are set up to make money. So, they're going to want to do whatever they can to keep their businesses running, too.  </p><p>VAUSE:  So, Twitter, you know, you don't have the first amendment rights on Twitter.  It's like when going into somebody -- someone's home, the person who owns the home decides what can be said and what cannot be.  </p><p>SCHWARTZ:  Right, right, yeah.  Often, I say get out. </p><p>VAUSE:  Right. </p><p>SCHWARTZ:  To my relatives. </p><p>VAUSE:  Really?  Come over to my place.  OK.  The tech companies said, in a joint statement, \"There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services.  When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies.\"  But European officials have actually been quite critical of tech giants, basically saying, they're not moving fast enough.  </p><p>SCHWARTZ:  You know, that's absolutely right.  I mean, Europe has the most -- the most violence, has had the most violence in the last two years around terrorist activity.  And they're watching all of these companies move through this slowly while violence is happening.  So, they actually had a meeting of the European commission, which is part of the E.U., and they came out with a code of contact.  And that code of contact basically said, you know, you have 24 hours to remove hateful language.  And again, it's a civil liberties issue, right? Because you can't just say, \"This is hateful language.\" and there's other rules at play.  So, it's going to be a real battle, I think, between what these media companies say, what the government says, and what people say. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  The companies have used similar databases in the past. For example, they used it to take down the child pornography industry.  </p><p>SCHWARTZ:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Could this technology, this database be used, I don't know, to take down those fake news sites? </p><p>SCHWARTZ:  I think that that is probably going to be looked at.  But that's going to have to be looked at very carefully, because, again, who's to say what fake is. </p><p>VAUSE:  It's pretty obvious.  I'd say.  Lori, thank you so much. </p><p>SCHWARTZ:  It's great to be here.  Thanks for having me. </p><p>VAUSE:  Appreciate it. </p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back here on NEWSROOM L.A., burqas in Germany.  We'll tell you why the country's leader wants them banned. </p><p>Plus, sifting through the politics news online, what voters in Italy found, and how much of it was fake. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[01:33:18] JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: You're watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles.  I'm John Vause. </p><p>With the headlines this hour, at least 26 people have been killed in an earthquake in Indonesia's Aceh province.  The 6.5 magnitude tremor struck on Wednesday morning.  The Red Cross says it damaged many homes and buildings and residents.  Through out in the streets are lined temporary shelters.  There are no tsunami warnings as of now. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took his thank you tour in North Carolina on Tuesday.  Keep as battleground state in his election win. At the rally Trump formally announced his pick to run the Pentagon, General James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis. </p><p>In the coming hours, the U.S. will commemorate the 75th anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.  The sneak attack killed more than 2,000 Americans, devastated half the fleet of U.S. aircraft, and damaged or destroyed eight U.S. battle ships and led to the U.S. entry into the Second World War. </p><p>Some Muslim women in Germany may have to give up their burqas. Chancellor Angela Merkel wants them banned wherever legally possible. She told her party's conference on Tuesday the full-face veils do not belong in Germany. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR:  We have to show our face during personal communication, which is important.  And that is why the full veil is not appropriate here.  It should be forbidden wherever that is legally possible.  It does not belong to us. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  Edina Lekovic is the communications director for the Muslim Public Affairs Council.  She joins us once again. </p><p>Edina, it seems unlikely the German Constitution would actually allow for a full ban of the face veil.  So it seems a lot of this is about sort of election politics for Angela Merkel.  So what's happened? </p><p>[01:35:00] EDINA LEKOVIC, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, MUSLIM PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL:  It's only seems that way to me too.  In the sense that a year ago, Chancellor Merkel was allowing for refugees to come into the country and accepted more than any other western country and set a positive tone and leadership about yeah, about our humanity. </p><p>And now, we see, as you said, I think it is a political gesture meant to take a more pragmatic role and signal to German voters that she's with them.  But I think that fundamentally that this proposal is off the mark because it's targeting just a few hundred women.  And by banning something, we generally make things more popular. </p><p>VAUSE:  Right. </p><p>LEKOVIC:  Rather than having the opposite effect. And so if the intended outcome is to promote integration of immigrants into Germany, providing language classes, providing job skills, providing education. These are the tools that allow people to integrate and to value the society that they are choosing to adapt. </p><p>VAUSE:  But this is a going trend around the world.  There are many countries now which have either banned or are proposing banning burqas in public or in some parts of public life.  Given that so many saw Chancellor Merkel as a defender of liberal values, is there a message that is now being sent a political -- not with this burqa ban?  It seems to have an undertone when dealing with I guess a, you know a Muslim immigrant population. </p><p>LEKOVIC:  I think that fundamentally it sends the message that somehow Muslims are other.  When the truth is that they -- that Muslims have been in Europe and been in the United States for centuries, that we are part and parcel of the fabric of our countries.  And that -- sure, there always need to be more steps towards integration and coexistence and bridge building.  And Europe has the opportunity to do that.  I hope that Chancellor Merkel and Germany hold clear on their path towards creating a Germany that has room for everyone, and where the German national identity is bigger than your accent. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK, well, here in the United States, almost 300 Muslim leaders have written an open letter to President-elect Donald Trump.  It happens with this line, \"As American-Muslims committed to the values of our faith and the principles that underpin our country's democracy, we write to express serious concerns about policies proposed during your campaign as well as announcements regarding appointments to your upcoming administration.\" </p><p>Do, I guess specific here is that, is there are one or two appointments which is most concerning to Muslims here in this country to the Trump administration? </p><p>LEKOVIC:  Quite frankly, most of the appointments today are troubling. Individuals like Steve Bannon, like General Mike Flynn have clear track records of making bigoted, hateful comments about multiple groups of people who are protected under our constitution.  And appointing those kinds of people to this new administration sends a really troubling tone not just to American-Muslims, but to all Americans who value the constitution and see that all people should be equal before the law. </p><p>VAUSE:  Have you had a response yet from the Trump transition team? </p><p>LEKOVIC:  No, we have not.  And that's why we have made it a public letter, an open letter, in addition to sending it through to the transition team.  I mean clearly people are being paraded through for job interviews.  And so the transition team's attention is elsewhere at the moment.  But we certainly hope that that President-elect Trump takes a new look at the American-Muslim community because he clearly doesn't know who we are and what we contribute to our country, and that our values and rights are just as important as everyone else's. </p><p>VAUSE:  Maybe you could all get together a whole great big rally and he'll turn up as thousands of cheering Muslims at a stadium for him. </p><p>LEKOVIC:  You never know. </p><p>VAUSE: You never know.  Edina, thank you so much. </p><p>LEKOVIC: Thanks, John. </p><p>VAUSE:  Plus up for this is the major issue when critics talk about Donald Trump's choice for national security adviser.  As Jim Sciutto reports they want the U.S. president-elect to cut Mike Flynn loose. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHAEL FLYNN, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: Donald J. Trump to be the next president of the United States. </p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  He's got to be President-elect Trump's closest adviser on the most sensitive threats facing the nation.  And tonight there is growing criticism that his inflammatory views make him unfit for the job.  More than 50 progressive non-profits ranging from religious to social justice organizations signed a letter asking Trump to dump Flynn. </p><p>FLYNN:  Islam is a political ideology.  It is a political ideology. It definitely hides behind this notion of it being a religion. </p><p>SCIUTTO:  Citing the former defense intelligence chief's numerous Islamophobic remarks, including tweeting in February that fear of Muslims is rational. </p><p>Today Vice President-elect Mike Pence praised Flynn on CNN. </p><p>MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT:  We are so grateful and honored to have General Flynn as our nominee for national security adviser. He brings an extraordinary wealth of experience. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Michael Flynn. </p><p>SCIUTTO:  But the groups also raised more substantive allegations.  On one occasion while overseeing intelligence in Afghanistan, former government officials tell CNN that Flynn shared classified information from another agency with Pakistan.  Flynn told CNN the allegation, \"Is not true.  Not even close.\" </p><p>[01:40:02] But the incident led to an informal reprimand, though no charges, officials tell CNN.  And as Flynn received classified intelligence briefings during the campaign he was lobbying on behalf of foreign clients, among them Turkey.  And Flynn is uncritically backed as it has cracked down on domestic dissent. </p><p>Trump's transition team told CNN last month that Flynn's dealings with Turkey were within his rights as a private citizen, and that Flynn would sever ties to his consulting firm when he is part of the administration. </p><p>FLYNN:  I have people in media, mainstream media that say \"Oh, that's all a conspiracy.  It's a lie.\" </p><p>SCIUTTO:  In his public statements, Flynn has repeatedly dabbled in conspiracy theories.  Just one week before the election, he tweeted, \"You decide, NYPD blows whistle on new Hillary e-mails, money laundering, sex crimes with children et cetera, must read.\" Allegations that remain entirely unsubstantiated. </p><p>Flynn's son Michael Flynn Jr. who served as his aide has been a leading proponent of a bizarre fake news story alleging that a D.C. pizzeria was home to a child sex rape, visited by Clinton campaign staff.  The story led an armed man to enter the restaurant this weekend he claimed to investigate the allegations.  He was arrested only after firing several shots. </p><p>And yet on Sunday, Flynn Jr. was still defending the conspiracy theory, tweeting, \"Until pizza gate, proven to be false, it will remain a story.  The left seems to forget Podesta e-mails and the many coincidences tied to it.\" </p><p>Today, Flynn Jr. was dismissed from the transition.  The decision sources tell CNN coming directly from the President-elect. </p><p>I have spoken to Democratic and GOP lawmakers who see General James Mattis' selection as defense secretary as balancing General Flynn. Mattis, enormously respected by both parties, and many I have spoken to note that he outranked Flynn four stars to three when they were in the military.  And that kind of stuff matters. </p><p>Jim Sciutto, CNN, Washington. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  U.S. Vice President Joe Biden ran for the top job eight years ago.  But will he do it again in 2020?  He told, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, he is a solid who knows. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JOE BIDEN, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  I can't see the circumstance in which I would run.  But what I've learned a long, long time ago, Stephen, is to never say never.  You don't know what's going to happen.  I mean hell, Donald Trump is going to be 74.  I'll be 77 in better shape.  I mean what the hell? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  Coming up later on CNN, Van Jones looks back at what happened during the U.S. election in his new CNN special \"The Messy Truth.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAN JONES, HOST OF \"THE MESSY TRUTH\":  So here we are in Ohio.  As you know, Ohio went for Trump.  We're going go to one of the bluest county, Trumbull County which since 1976 has always voted for the Democrat until this year.  And they voted for Trump.  I'm baffled. I'm bewildered.  We got to figure it out. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  And you can see \"The Messy Truth\" with Van Jones at 6:00 Wednesday night in Hong Kong.  Catch it also at 9:00 p.m. in London. And we'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[01:46:30] JOHN VAUSE CNN ANCHOR:  Political turmoil continues in Italy after voters overwhelmingly rejected constitutional changes.  In the run-up to the referendum, millions shared fake news stories online, a familiar problem which just seems to be getting worse. </p><p>Nina dos Santos has details. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN MONEY EUROPE EDITOR:  Twenty-seven-year-old Giovanni has only ever voted for one party, Beppe Grillo Five Star Movement. </p><p>GIOVANNI PIETRANTONIO, MILAN RESIDENT:  So this is the page of Five Star Movement and they will put like. </p><p>SANTOS:  For millennials like these, swirling the ranks of Italian populism, the party's vast online presence is a big draw.  And to capture their attention, its media machine must deliver.  What makes you click on a story? </p><p>PIETRANTONIO:  The title and the image.  And I will click to read the news. </p><p>SANTOS:  The trouble is, some of the five-star links have little or no link to the truth.  Like these allegations that Ukraine is running concentration camps made by a five-star lawmaker in parliament and broadcast on the movement's YouTube channel. </p><p>And this claims that the U.S. is funding the trafficking of migrants to Italy made by the popular pro Five Star blog TzeTze.  There is no proof of either of these stories being true, but both were widely shared. </p><p>Grillo's blog, with more than 2 million followers is managed is managed by this man, Daddy di Casaleggio (ph). </p><p>SANTOS:  And it's from these offices in Milan's exclusive fashion district that Casaleggio runs that blog, as well as the network of anti-establishment and click bait websites whose content is then spread via social media. </p><p>Also at the same address, a link to organizations set up to source party funds, which runs the official Five Star Movement blog, a site which has also run false articles.  Casaleggio declined CNN's request for an interview or comment, referring as to the party and one of its elected officials told CNN. </p><p>LUIGI DI MAIO, FIVE STAR MOVEMENT, POLITICIAN, (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): When it comes to social media, we are leaders there.  We know how to manage this.  If there have been errors, we apologize.  But absolutely it's not intended and not part of our policy. </p><p>SANTOS:  And Italy's fake news scourge doesn't end there.  Fact checkers at this online journal examined the 10 most shared social media posts in the lead up to Italy's referendum, and found half of them to be inaccurate or misleading. DAVIDE DE LUCA, JOURNALIST, PAGELLA POLITICA:  I think it's a problem. In Italy like many other countries, in Italy trusting traditional media is quite low even lower than other countries. </p><p>SANTOS:  Giovanni knows there's fake news out there and says he tries to be vigilant.  But the temptation to share a politician's post before reading it in full is always there. </p><p>PIETRANTONIO:  Put the like is for example in this image and share. </p><p>SANTOS:  But you haven't read that yet.  You just like the image. </p><p>PIETRANTONIO:  Yeah of course. </p><p>SANTOS:  There's about four paragraphs before it.  But you haven't read it. </p><p>PIETRANTONIO:  Yes, sometimes I read it. </p><p>SANTOS:  And thus the cycle continues. </p><p>Nina dos Santos, CNN, Milan. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[01:49:33] VAUSE:  Well, next on NEWSROOM L.A.  Why a popular T.V. host is gagging about Madonna latest dance moves. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>VAUSE:  Beyonce leads the way at this year's Grammy Awards.  The pop superstar picked up nine nominations Tuesday, becoming the first artist to earn nods in the pop, rock, r&amp;b and rap categories in the same year. </p><p>Adele is also up for three of the top awards, including record, song, and album of the year.  Grammies are in February. </p><p>Obviously, Madonna has never been afraid of pushing the envelope, and she is doing it again new twerk-filled performance on late night television.  Here is Jeanne Moos. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  James Corden takes Madonna for a spin. </p><p>JAMES CORDEN, ENGLISH ACTOR, USA:  Do you mind if we listen to some music? </p><p>MADONNA, SINGER, USA:  Please. </p><p>CORDEN:  Is that be, OK? </p><p>MADONNA:  I don't really like riding around in a car unless there's music. MOOS:  But Madonna didn't just ride shotgun.  She twerked it.  It's a wonder she didn't set off the air bag.  Well, actually, she did set off an air bag of sorts. </p><p>SUSANNA REID, ANCHOR, GOOD MORNING BRITAIN:  I love Madonna. </p><p>PIERS MORGAN, ANCHOR, GOOD MORNING BRITAIN:  Oh, she makes my skin crawl. </p><p>MOOS:  On Good Morning Britain, former CNN Piers Morgan called 58- year-old Madonna's twerking utterly embarrassing, a train wreck. </p><p>[01:54:59] MORGAN:  Oh, God, sorry, I feel suddenly nausea.  Sorry, does someone have a bucket?  Hang on. </p><p>MOOS:  But Madonna fans are sick of Piers.  Madonna is an icon.  He is grumpy old man, commented one. </p><p>Tweeted another, people don't disappear after a certain age.  Look at you, meaning Piers </p><p>MORGAN:  Put it away, seriously. </p><p>MOOS:  Responded another Madonna supporter, I didn't know older women weren't allowed to have fun, make fun of themselves, poke around and have a gay old time. </p><p>Madonna's rear came to the forefront recently when she twerked with Ariana Grande. </p><p>Thank you for showing me your freshly purchased and installed buttocks, Madonna, wrote one commenter. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE:  Big booty but you got a big booty, shake that. </p><p>MOOS:  From J. Lo to Adele, carpool karaoke has featured everyone from Justin Bieber to Stevenie Wonder. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE:  Ooh, baby, here I am, signed sealed, delivered.  I'm yours. </p><p>MOOS:  But no one delivered quite like Madonna. </p><p>Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  It's really unfortunate.  You're watching NEWSROOM L.A.

Ahead this hour, powerful earthquake rocks Indonesia. Buildings have collapsed. And people are believed to be still trapped under the rubble.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>Victory Tour hits its next city. The president-elect claiming strong America military might -- will actually keep the peace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Europe's most powerful leader wants Germany to become the latest nation to ban the burqa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, everybody. Thank you for being with us. I'm John Vause. This is NEWSROOM L.A.</p><p>A powerful earthquake has killed at least 26 people in Northwest Indonesia. The Red Cross says many homes and buildings have been damaged in Aceh province. And residents were sent running into the streets. It's the same province hit by the devastating tsunami in 2004, which killed tens of thousands. Right now, there are no tsunami warnings.</p><p>CNN's Kathy Quiano joins us on the phone from Jakarta with the very latest. What do you know about the rescue efforts right now and the extent of the damage, Kathy?</p><p>KATHY QUIANO, CNN REPORTER: Well, John, rescue teams are working very hard to search and pull out any victims who'll be trapped under the rubble. Scores of homes, shop houses, buildings and mosques were totally or partially damaged by the quake. Some roads have also been cut off. The quake hit the streets of Pidie and (INAUDIBLE) in Aceh which is about past 5:00 a.m. this morning. Residents were preparing for early morning prayers when the quake struck and as you said they panicked and ran out to the streets. Many of them chose to stay there as aftershock continued to hit the area.</p><p>The tremor was very shallow, with only a depth of 10 kilometers. And it's happened inland, so that's why we're seeing a lot of damage to infrastructure. The areas hit are not highly urbanized. Most of the structures are low-rise homes and shop houses, and buildings are only a few stories high. The local and national government agencies are working hard together to provide immediate medical assistance, food, and shelter. But the priority right now is to find and rescue any more survivors, John?</p><p>VAUSE: Kathy, do we know if the rescue crews have access to heavy machinery and other equipment which they'll need to get to those people who are trapped beneath the rubble?</p><p>QUIANO: Well, we're hearing reports that heavy equipment have been able to reach areas. As I said, some roads are cut off, were damaged as well. But we're -- we know that rescue efforts are going on, and that they are able now to use heavy equipment. So, the national government has sent more from nearby provinces. President Joko Widodo has ordered immediate assistance to be sent there. Anything that needs to help, any teams there to try to save more lives, John?</p><p>VAUSE: OK, Kathy. Thank you, Kathy Quiano on the line there from Jakarta with the very latest on that deadly earthquake.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>Thank You Tour rolled into North Carolina on Tuesday, one of the swing states crucial in his election win. Trump talked about the greatness of his political movement, claiming it's unlike anything ever.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDEN-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: We do not know what the page tomorrow will read. But for the first time in a long time, what we do know is that the pages will be authored by each and everyone in this room and in our country, by you. It's going to be authored by you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Back with us now, CNN's Senior Political Analyst Ron Brownstein. You know, we've heard from Trump's aides saying that he loves these rallies. That's where he gets recharged, he gets his energy from. And it looks like these will be some of the permanent fixture of his administration. Is there a problem, though, if he continues to go to the rallies with people cheering then he gets sort of a false impression of the broader opinion of the rest of the country?</p><p>RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Sure. I mean, you know, it's fascinating. Clearly, he draws strength from this. And it is not unusual for presidents to, you know, campaign and go out and speak to followers and supporters. Well, I think one thing we've seen that's already unusual is that tonight being an exception, Trump has been pretty unscripted. You know, much more unscripted than we typically see a president or even a president-elect be If he continues in that mode as president, that would be a real departure. But the reality is that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>won the election fair and square. He won the Electoral College, he won the states and they both contested the most heavily Iowa -- I'm sorry. Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. But he lost the popular vote by more than anyone who will ever become president.</p><p>Hillary Clinton has an outside chance of coming very close to George W. Bush's margin in the popular vote in 2004, an election that republicans portrayed as a decisive win. Democrats gained seats in the senate, although not enough to take it over, and in the house. So, Trump, I mean, you know, he is looking for validation. He finds validation in these audiences. But the reality is he still has a big portion of the country that is skeptical of him as he takes office.</p><p>[01:05:13] VAUSE: Right. Well, I guess if we're looking for a headline from this rally, Trump's pick for Defense Secretary and he also laid out what appears to be a noninterventionist military policy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We build up our military not as an act of aggression, but as an act of prevention. We pursue and build up arms not in order to seek conflict, but in order to avoid conflict. We want to be strong. In short, we seek peace through strength.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: You know, the way he's describing the military there, you can almost envision it as a kind of wall between the U.S. and the world. And in fact, if you think about military engagement and alliance and intervention in other countries, immigration, trade, it's a very consistent theme. I mean, President-elect Trump portrays the world as kind of a dark, dangerous, duplicitous place that is out to kind of get the best of America. And we need to show strength and be tough. But largely take a big step back behind these walls. I mean, the China example is kind of fascinating here. I mean, obviously he's talking tough on China or tweeting tough on China and talking with the Taiwanese President. But he is also stepping back from Asia by abandoning the transpacific partnership, the trade deal that President Obama saw as the principle way of counterbalancing Chinese economic power in the region. So, there's a pretty consistent pattern emerging in the way he talks and acts.</p><p>VAUSE: You mentioned, you know, the diplomatic dust-up with China over Taiwan. We are now learning through a number of reports that Bob Dole, Senator Bob Dole, former presidential nominee for the Republican Party was actually paid by lobbyists for Taiwan $140,000 to set that phone call up. I mean, this does seem to be, you know, one of the problems within the Trump team. This sort of if not conflicts of interest, but the appearance of conflict of interest.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Yeah. And not only that, but kind of like a lack of a sense of structure that would kind of insulate a president-elect from something like that, who may not have wanted to be insulated. This may have been the direction that he wanted to go. It's an extraordinary story. First of all, it's important to recognize, Bob Dole was the only living republican presidential nominee to actively support <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Now, he did so before this contract apparently began in May in The New York Times reporting. In January, he said that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>would have been a better bet than Ted Cruz. But still, the idea that this was facilitated by a lobbying contract is going to add -- is going to add a lot of questions in the days ahead.</p><p>VAUSE: And the other problem within the Trump campaign is Michael Flynn, Jr., son of General Michael Flynn who is the pick for National Security Advisor. Flynn has been -- Flynn, Jr. has been fired because he's retweeting all these fake news stories. And there is this question of whether he actually had security clearance to be part of the White House administration? Jake Tapper pressed the <person><nameText>Vice President</nameText></person>-Elect <person><nameText>Mike Pence </nameText></person>about that. And this was the response he got from Mr. Pence.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MIKE PENCE, </nameText></person><person><nameText>VICE PRESIDENT</nameText></person>-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: I said this morning that his son had no involvement in the transition. But I've talked to General Flynn, and his son was helping him a bit with scheduling and administrative items. But that's no longer the case. Mike Flynn, Jr. is no longer associated with General Flynn's efforts or with the transition team. And we're focused eyes forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Again --</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: They were -- they were trying to -- you know, Jake had to ask him eight times before he got kind of a full answer. And they were trying to minimize it by basically saying, well, he was helping his scheduling on the -- on the transition. There is some indications that they were moving toward having him as a position on the National Security Council itself. But the issue with the son does not end with the son, because many of these same kind of conspiracy theories have been advanced by the father as well on his own Twitter account. And you're having, I think, growing questions and growing challenges to that. He's kept a very low profile during the transition itself. But you can bet there will be more of a bulls-eye on General Flynn in the days ahead by democrats.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: (INAUDIBLE) some calls for Trump to dump him, but Trump is very loyal to a point.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Maybe bulls-eye is the wrong word. If he have, I'd call it ping-pong.</p><p>VAUSE: Fair enough.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Yeah.</p><p>VAUSE: Interesting that Trump -- he seems to be out there campaigning making what seems to be a lot of promises.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're going to do a great job. We're going to create a safe country. We're going to create a prosperous country. We're going to have jobs again, great jobs. Not bad jobs, real jobs. Together we will raise incomes and create millions and millions of new jobs. That's going to happen. It's already happening. You see what happened today? We will re-establish the rule of law and defend the constitution of the United States. We will protect the right of every American to live in safety and peace. We will restore and respect, and we will respect people's rights, we will respect constitutional rights.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: I mean, there is a lot of stuff which he promised tonight.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>[01:10:02] VAUSE: And can you make promises as president? I mean, like he is doing as a candidate? Because, you know, surely these now have to be delivered.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: He is pushing against big tides. He won this election primarily because of overwhelming almost unprecedented levels of support among non-college and non-urban white Americans, many of whom have been losing ground economically since the 1970s, from the twin forces of globalization and even more technological change. The ability of a president through policy levers to reverse those kinds of structural forces is limited. And the question will be whether -- how much rope those voters are willing to give him, if he can't ultimately reverse what has been decades of both job loss and in particular income stagnation through the policies that he pursues over four years.</p><p>VAUSE: Although, he did take credit for the creation of 50,000 jobs because of the massive billions dollar investment from a Japanese telecom company. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: And one of the wealthiest men in the world, you saw it today, maybe, did anybody see it? Masa, right? Masa, great guy of Japan. He's pledged that he's going to put $50 billion into the United States because of our victory.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Let's bring Andrew Stevens in now. He is CNN Money Asia Pacific Editor. So, Andrew, what more do we know about this deal which seems to be in the works long before Trump was elected?</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN MONEY ASIA PACIFIC EDITOR: Well, what was in the works long before Trump was elected, and it wasn't that long, I mean, it was in October, John, was Masayoshi Son who is the boss of <person><nameText>SoftBank </nameText></person>in Japan was setting up a $100 billion fund to invest in tech ventures. And the main partner was the Saudi Arabian government, or is the Saudi Arabian government. Now, there's no -- no money has physically gone in yet, but it looks as if the reports -- if the reports are correct that Masayoshi is going to put in $25 billion and the Saudis another $45 billion. And other shareholders will make up the rest. So, Masayoshi Son goes to the Trump Towers, meets with <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>for a private meeting for 45 minutes and comes out with this statement, which we heard from <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>So, that's a $50 billion investment to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S. and what looks like in tech companies and mainly start-up companies, John. And creating 50,000 jobs in a start-up companies in the timeframe seems to be four years, that's what he told The Wall Street Journal, that sounds like that's an ambitious target. And <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was saying that if it wasn't for my election victory or my election victory spurred Masayoshi decision to spend this money, that's <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>word, and we've got nothing to back that out with.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. It seems to be the case on many things with the president-elect. Andrew, thank you. Andrew Stevens live (INAUDIBLE) some perspective there from Hong Kong.</p><p>You know, Ron, you know, this is just all sort of smoke and mirrors in some ways. It's like look, I've got these 50,000 jobs where, you know, it's kind of very dubious if he actually created these jobs.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Look, we've had a lot of job growth over the last eight years. I think the final numbers may be 9 or 10 to 1 under President Obama's term compared to George W. Bush's two terms. But in big parts of the country, they have -- they're feeling as though the job growth has either left them behind or has produced kind of employment that was less -- that offered less of a middleclass lifestyle than they remember from their parents growing up. It's going to be difficult for <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>as I said, to reverse some of those trends. The question is how far can he get with these big symbolic victories if by no other means -- if I know -- if nothing else, these show that he is concerned about those problems. I feel your pain, as another president said once. That was Bill Clinton.</p><p>VAUSE: Yeah.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: And, you know, how far can that take him in maintaining the allegiance of these voters who were so important in putting him where he is today, even if he can't structurally change what has been decades of decline in places like Youngstown and Gary and Flint.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. So, we've had a very substantive discussion over the last couple of hours about military intervention, about jobs, about the economy. We've talked about Trump (INAUDIBLE) then, you know, we all woke up this morning to Trump saying he was going to scrap the deal with Boeing to replace, you know, two presidential planes. This is the reason why Trump gave reporters outside Trump Tower.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program. And I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: You know, this comes out of nowhere. Like the (INAUDIBLE) should be, you know, thrown in jail.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) BROWNSTEIN: Right. Well, look, we're seeing -- what we're seeing is a willingness on the part of Trump to go after individual companies in a variety of means, usually around their investment decisions. What we saw in Carrier and others, that he is criticized for wanting to move jobs or build plants in Mexico.</p><p>[01:15:01] If this was coming from Barack Obama or democrats in congress, you would hear Paul Ryan and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the business round table with their heads exploding. I think they don't know quite what to do with this from <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>because on the one hand, he is promising them big cuts in their taxes, big cuts in regulations, a move toward many of the things that they most want in terms of rolling back Washington.</p><p>On the other hand, he has shown a willingness to kind of call out individual companies by name in an extraordinary way that we really haven't seen from a president in this detail possibly since John F. Kennedy's confrontation with the steel industry in the early 1960s. So, I think there are a lot of CEOs, C-suites and the equivalents of trade association in Washington that are really wondering how they -- how they're going to calibrate their reaction to this president and this kind of mix of things that they have long wanted that he wants to give them, and yet this other confrontational and unpredictable side.</p><p>VAUSE: Unpredictable -- that will be the word for some time to come. Ron, thanks so much.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Thank you, John.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, the Iranian President <person><nameText>Hassan Rouhani </nameText></person>says he will not let <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>rip up the nuclear deal with the United States. And during his campaign, Trump called the deal one of the worst ever, vowed to renegotiate the terms. But on Tuesday, Rouhani had his own warning for the President-elect.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>HASSAN ROUHANI, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator): The U.S., as part of the five plus one, is one of our enemies and wants to pressure us. There is no doubt about that. We have to resist, be steadfast, and find a way to counter it. They may break the nuclear agreement. They have already done so by extending the D'Amato Law. If this measure is actually implemented, then it would be a clear breach of the nuclear agreement, and will cause us to react very harshly and severely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Let's bring in CNN Intelligence and Security Analyst, former CIA Operative Bob Baer, joining us via Skype from Telluride, Colorado. Bob, Rouhani called America the enemy. According to New York Times, the crowds are chanting \"death to America.\" Rouhani is meant to be the moderate. Is this all in response to the incoming Trump administration?</p><p>BOB BAER, CNN INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY ANALYST AND FORMER CIA OPERATIVE: Well, John, I think that they really don't know what's going to happen next, if you look at the Presidents-elect's national security team, they're all strongly anti-Iranian. In fact, a lot of them believe that we should use force against Iran. The Iranians at this point have to be very wary what we're going to do next. They frankly don't understand this administration and they would react very negatively if we withdrew that agreement, the five plus one. It's, you know, we're uncharted waters right here. It could turn very ugly, very fast.</p><p>VAUSE: You know, in contrast to <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>President Obama on Tuesday, he was out talking about the power of diplomacy. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: Terrorists would love to see us walk away from the type of work that builds international coalitions and ends conflicts and stops the spread of deadly weapons. It would make life easier for them, it would be a tragic mistake for us. Just think about what we've done these last eight years without firing a shot.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: He went on to give the example of the Iran nuclear deal as, you know, one of those efforts in diplomacy being successful. Is he right?</p><p>BAER: It was a good agreement. The Iranians stopped building a nuclear bomb. They were very close and we rescind -- we take back that agreement, I think they will go ahead and try to make one, and they could do it very quickly. You tightening a couple of screws here and there, and then if they'll test a bomb, and what that will cause is a nuclear arms race. And -- but more than that, diplomacy has essentially kept a, you know, a confrontation in the gulf from happening. It's so easy for an escalation to occur and there have been a lot of close calls over the last few months. If we would turn hostile to Iran, and impose new sanctions, I think this could very easily turn into some sort of armed conflict in the gulf.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, the State Department Spokesman Mark Toner, he was talking in glowing terms about that nuclear deal with Iran. This is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK TONER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: Thus far, all sides, all parties have lived up to their commitments under the JCPOA. And it's working. So, you know, we think it's a good deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: You know, the critics point out that's debatable. They say the Iranians, for example, have twice exceeded their limit for heavy water, which is used in some nuclear reactors. It could be used for building nuclear bombs, they've cheated on other U.N. sanctions, not necessarily this deal, and they say, essentially the Iranians aren't living up to their part of the deal. How do you see it?</p><p>[01:19:45] BAER: Those are small infractions. There's no, you know, violations to the agreement that could call it into question. You know, this was expected, but by and large, we have brought the Iranian nuclear program under control and under inspection. It's something that was unthinkable 10 years ago, and it was very difficult for the Iranians to give up what they believe is their right to produce nuclear, you know, reactors and the rest of it. They don't understand, for instance, why Israel can have a nuclear bomb or their own reactors that don't come under inspection and they can't. You know, we have a good argument for that. But the point is, this agreement was hard fought, and it's a good agreement, and if it's taken back now, like I said, it's going to turn ugly.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, Bob. Appreciate your perspective. Thanks so much. Bob Baer, former CIA Operative in Telluride.</p><p>Next on NEWSROOM L.A., how four major tech companies are teaming up to get terrorist videos off the internet.</p><p>Millions of people are sharing fake news stories before a hard fought election. Does that sound familiar? Ahead the real world effects of Italy's false news machines.</p><p>[01:24:53] VAUSE: Four of the world's biggest tech companies are working together to fight the spread of terrorism online. Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and YouTube will share a database to flag and remove what they call violent terrorist imagery, or terrorist recruitment videos like these ISIS propaganda videos. The database will have digital fingerprints of the images and video, which will help the companies identify other terrorist content. Joining me now is tech expert and co-founder of StoryTech, Lori Schwartz. Lori, thank you for being with us.</p><p>LORI SCHWARTZ, CO-FOUNDER OF STORYTECH: It is great to be here.</p><p>VAUSE: I want to play some sound from President Obama earlier on Tuesday. He specifically mentioned social media as a tool of choice by Jihadi groups.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: For all of our necessary focus on fighting terrorists overseas, the most deadly attacks on the homeland over the last eight years have not been carried out by operatives with sophisticated networks or equipment directed from abroad. They've been carried out by home-grown and largely isolated individualist who were radicalized online.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: So, how big is this problem right now?</p><p>SCHWARTZ: Oh, it's huge. It's tremendous. I mean, there are so many different social media platforms and so many people creating fake account, and so much activity, and it's so hard to track what's going on and where it's coming from. It's decentralized, right? And there are new social media platforms being born all the time, and, you know, messenger platforms and it's just an explosion of tech right now. So, it's very scary.</p><p>VAUSE: It's like whack-a-mole in a way.</p><p>SCHWARTZ: Yes, it really is.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. So, technically, how would this work? Will these big tech companies are proposing, how does this actually, you know, work from a just a technical point of view?</p><p>SCHWARTZ: So, basically there's an algorithm, just some software, and that software can basically sort through all of these images and videos, because each of them will have a little digital fingerprint. And they're actually calling it a \"hash\" but it's just a digital fingerprint. And so, when something gets uploaded, the algorithm goes through it, and finds it, and identifies it. Now, the thing that's interesting about all of this is that Facebook and Twitter and Microsoft and YouTube, aren't going to automatically remove something just because it's on the database. They're each going to sort through against their own rules and judge it by what their platform has decided and it should be removed.</p><p>VAUSE: So, you're saying this is where the human intervention comes into play?</p><p>SCHWARTZ: Yeah.</p><p>VAUSE: Is this where you have to make that decision, is this terrorist propaganda or this is just free speech?</p><p>SCHWARTZ: Yeah, exactly, and I -- and I think that there's always going to be pushback from, you know, civil liberties on whether this is the first amendment issue. But the thing about the first amendment is the first amendment is a government issue. You know, Facebook is allowed to say, this is OK to be on my platform or this isn't. You're still dealing with corporations that are determining what's right and what's wrong. And they're businesses who are set up to make money. So, they're going to want to do whatever they can to keep their businesses running, too.</p><p>VAUSE: So, Twitter, you know, you don't have the first amendment rights on Twitter. It's like when going into somebody -- someone's home, the person who owns the home decides what can be said and what cannot be.</p><p>SCHWARTZ: Right, right, yeah. Often, I say get out.</p><p>VAUSE: Right.</p><p>SCHWARTZ: To my relatives.</p><p>VAUSE: Really? Come over to my place. OK. The tech companies said, in a joint statement, \"There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies.\" But European officials have actually been quite critical of tech giants, basically saying, they're not moving fast enough.</p><p>SCHWARTZ: You know, that's absolutely right. I mean, Europe has the most -- the most violence, has had the most violence in the last two years around terrorist activity. And they're watching all of these companies move through this slowly while violence is happening. So, they actually had a meeting of the European commission, which is part of the E.U., and they came out with a code of contact. And that code of contact basically said, you know, you have 24 hours to remove hateful language. And again, it's a civil liberties issue, right? Because you can't just say, \"This is hateful language.\" and there's other rules at play. So, it's going to be a real battle, I think, between what these media companies say, what the government says, and what people say.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. The companies have used similar databases in the past. For example, they used it to take down the child pornography industry.</p><p>SCHWARTZ: Yes, yes.</p><p>VAUSE: Could this technology, this database be used, I don't know, to take down those fake news sites?</p><p>SCHWARTZ: I think that that is probably going to be looked at. But that's going to have to be looked at very carefully, because, again, who's to say what fake is.</p><p>VAUSE: It's pretty obvious. I'd say. Lori, thank you so much.</p><p>SCHWARTZ: It's great to be here. Thanks for having me.</p><p>VAUSE: Appreciate it.</p><p>We'll take a short break. When we come back here on NEWSROOM L.A., burqas in Germany. We'll tell you why the country's leader wants them banned.</p><p>Plus, sifting through the politics news online, what voters in Italy found, and how much of it was fake.</p><p>[01:33:18] JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: You're watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause.</p><p>With the headlines this hour, at least 26 people have been killed in an earthquake in Indonesia's Aceh province. The 6.5 magnitude tremor struck on Wednesday morning. The Red Cross says it damaged many homes and buildings and residents. Through out in the streets are lined temporary shelters. There are no tsunami warnings as of now. U.S. President-elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>took his thank you tour in North Carolina on Tuesday. Keep as battleground state in his election win. At the rally Trump formally announced his pick to run the Pentagon, General James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis.</p><p>In the coming hours, the U.S. will commemorate the 75th anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The sneak attack killed more than 2,000 Americans, devastated half the fleet of U.S. aircraft, and damaged or destroyed eight U.S. battle ships and led to the U.S. entry into the Second World War.</p><p>Some Muslim women in Germany may have to give up their burqas. Chancellor Angela Merkel wants them banned wherever legally possible. She told her party's conference on Tuesday the full-face veils do not belong in Germany.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR: We have to show our face during personal communication, which is important. And that is why the full veil is not appropriate here. It should be forbidden wherever that is legally possible. It does not belong to us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Edina Lekovic is the communications director for the Muslim Public Affairs Council. She joins us once again.</p><p>Edina, it seems unlikely the German Constitution would actually allow for a full ban of the face veil. So it seems a lot of this is about sort of election politics for Angela Merkel. So what's happened?</p><p>[01:35:00] EDINA LEKOVIC, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, MUSLIM PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL: It's only seems that way to me too. In the sense that a year ago, Chancellor Merkel was allowing for refugees to come into the country and accepted more than any other western country and set a positive tone and leadership about yeah, about our humanity.</p><p>And now, we see, as you said, I think it is a political gesture meant to take a more pragmatic role and signal to German voters that she's with them. But I think that fundamentally that this proposal is off the mark because it's targeting just a few hundred women. And by banning something, we generally make things more popular.</p><p>VAUSE: Right.</p><p>LEKOVIC: Rather than having the opposite effect. And so if the intended outcome is to promote integration of immigrants into Germany, providing language classes, providing job skills, providing education. These are the tools that allow people to integrate and to value the society that they are choosing to adapt.</p><p>VAUSE: But this is a going trend around the world. There are many countries now which have either banned or are proposing banning burqas in public or in some parts of public life. Given that so many saw Chancellor Merkel as a defender of liberal values, is there a message that is now being sent a political -- not with this burqa ban? It seems to have an undertone when dealing with I guess a, you know a Muslim immigrant population.</p><p>LEKOVIC: I think that fundamentally it sends the message that somehow Muslims are other. When the truth is that they -- that Muslims have been in Europe and been in the United States for centuries, that we are part and parcel of the fabric of our countries. And that -- sure, there always need to be more steps towards integration and coexistence and bridge building. And Europe has the opportunity to do that. I hope that Chancellor Merkel and Germany hold clear on their path towards creating a Germany that has room for everyone, and where the German national identity is bigger than your accent.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, well, here in the United States, almost 300 Muslim leaders have written an open letter to President-elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>It happens with this line, \"As American-Muslims committed to the values of our faith and the principles that underpin our country's democracy, we write to express serious concerns about policies proposed during your campaign as well as announcements regarding appointments to your upcoming administration.\"</p><p>Do, I guess specific here is that, is there are one or two appointments which is most concerning to Muslims here in this country to the Trump administration?</p><p>LEKOVIC: Quite frankly, most of the appointments today are troubling. Individuals like Steve Bannon, like General Mike Flynn have clear track records of making bigoted, hateful comments about multiple groups of people who are protected under our constitution. And appointing those kinds of people to this new administration sends a really troubling tone not just to American-Muslims, but to all Americans who value the constitution and see that all people should be equal before the law.</p><p>VAUSE: Have you had a response yet from the Trump transition team?</p><p>LEKOVIC: No, we have not. And that's why we have made it a public letter, an open letter, in addition to sending it through to the transition team. I mean clearly people are being paraded through for job interviews. And so the transition team's attention is elsewhere at the moment. But we certainly hope that that President-elect Trump takes a new look at the American-Muslim community because he clearly doesn't know who we are and what we contribute to our country, and that our values and rights are just as important as everyone else's.</p><p>VAUSE: Maybe you could all get together a whole great big rally and he'll turn up as thousands of cheering Muslims at a stadium for him.</p><p>LEKOVIC: You never know.</p><p>VAUSE: You never know. Edina, thank you so much.</p><p>LEKOVIC: Thanks, John.</p><p>VAUSE: Plus up for this is the major issue when critics talk about <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>choice for national security adviser. As Jim Sciutto reports they want the U.S. president-elect to cut Mike Flynn loose.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL FLYNN, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: Donald J. Trump to be the next president of the United States.</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: He's got to be President-elect Trump's closest adviser on the most sensitive threats facing the nation. And tonight there is growing criticism that his inflammatory views make him unfit for the job. More than 50 progressive non-profits ranging from religious to social justice organizations signed a letter asking Trump to dump Flynn.</p><p>FLYNN: Islam is a political ideology. It is a political ideology. It definitely hides behind this notion of it being a religion.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Citing the former defense intelligence chief's numerous Islamophobic remarks, including tweeting in February that fear of Muslims is rational.</p><p>Today <person><nameText>Vice President</nameText></person>-elect <person><nameText>Mike Pence </nameText></person>praised Flynn on CNN.</p><p><person><nameText>MIKE PENCE, </nameText></person>U.S. <person><nameText>VICE PRESIDENT</nameText></person>-ELECT: We are so grateful and honored to have General Flynn as our nominee for national security adviser. He brings an extraordinary wealth of experience.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michael Flynn.</p><p>SCIUTTO: But the groups also raised more substantive allegations. On one occasion while overseeing intelligence in Afghanistan, former government officials tell CNN that Flynn shared classified information from another agency with Pakistan. Flynn told CNN the allegation, \"Is not true. Not even close.\"</p><p>[01:40:02] But the incident led to an informal reprimand, though no charges, officials tell CNN. And as Flynn received classified intelligence briefings during the campaign he was lobbying on behalf of foreign clients, among them Turkey. And Flynn is uncritically backed as it has cracked down on domestic dissent.</p><p>Trump's transition team told CNN last month that Flynn's dealings with Turkey were within his rights as a private citizen, and that Flynn would sever ties to his consulting firm when he is part of the administration.</p><p>FLYNN: I have people in media, mainstream media that say \"Oh, that's all a conspiracy. It's a lie.\"</p><p>SCIUTTO: In his public statements, Flynn has repeatedly dabbled in conspiracy theories. Just one week before the election, he tweeted, \"You decide, NYPD blows whistle on new Hillary e-mails, money laundering, sex crimes with children et cetera, must read.\" Allegations that remain entirely unsubstantiated.</p><p>Flynn's son Michael Flynn Jr. who served as his aide has been a leading proponent of a bizarre fake news story alleging that a D.C. pizzeria was home to a child sex rape, visited by Clinton campaign staff. The story led an armed man to enter the restaurant this weekend he claimed to investigate the allegations. He was arrested only after firing several shots.</p><p>And yet on Sunday, Flynn Jr. was still defending the conspiracy theory, tweeting, \"Until pizza gate, proven to be false, it will remain a story. The left seems to forget Podesta e-mails and the many coincidences tied to it.\"</p><p>Today, Flynn Jr. was dismissed from the transition. The decision sources tell CNN coming directly from the President-elect.</p><p>I have spoken to Democratic and GOP lawmakers who see General James Mattis' selection as defense secretary as balancing General Flynn. Mattis, enormously respected by both parties, and many I have spoken to note that he outranked Flynn four stars to three when they were in the military. And that kind of stuff matters.</p><p>Jim Sciutto, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: U.S. <person><nameText>Vice President </nameText></person>Joe Biden ran for the top job eight years ago.

But what I've learned a long, long time ago, Stephen, is to never say never. You don't know what's going to happen. I mean hell, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is going to be 74.

I mean what the hell?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Coming up later on CNN, Van Jones looks back at what happened during the U.S. election in his new CNN special \"The Messy Truth.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAN JONES, HOST OF \"THE MESSY TRUTH\": So here we are in Ohio. As you know, Ohio went for Trump. We're going go to one of the bluest county, Trumbull County which since 1976 has always voted for the Democrat until this year. And they voted for Trump. I'm baffled. I'm bewildered. We got to figure it out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: And you can see \"The Messy Truth\" with Van Jones at 6:00 Wednesday night in Hong Kong. Catch it also at 9:00 p.m. in London. And we'll be right back.</p><p>[01:46:30] JOHN VAUSE CNN ANCHOR: Political turmoil continues in Italy after voters overwhelmingly rejected constitutional changes. In the run-up to the referendum, millions shared fake news stories online, a familiar problem which just seems to be getting worse.</p><p>Nina dos Santos has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN MONEY EUROPE EDITOR: Twenty-seven-year-old Giovanni has only ever voted for one party, Beppe Grillo Five Star Movement.</p><p>GIOVANNI PIETRANTONIO, MILAN RESIDENT: So this is the page of Five Star Movement and they will put like.</p><p>SANTOS: For millennials like these, swirling the ranks of Italian populism, the party's vast online presence is a big draw. And to capture their attention, its media machine must deliver. What makes you click on a story?</p><p>PIETRANTONIO: The title and the image. And I will click to read the news.</p><p>SANTOS: The trouble is, some of the five-star links have little or no link to the truth. Like these allegations that Ukraine is running concentration camps made by a five-star lawmaker in parliament and broadcast on the movement's YouTube channel.</p><p>And this claims that the U.S. is funding the trafficking of migrants to Italy made by the popular pro Five Star blog TzeTze. There is no proof of either of these stories being true, but both were widely shared.</p><p>Grillo's blog, with more than 2 million followers is managed is managed by this man, Daddy di Casaleggio (ph).</p><p>SANTOS: And it's from these offices in Milan's exclusive fashion district that Casaleggio runs that blog, as well as the network of anti-establishment and click bait websites whose content is then spread via social media.</p><p>Also at the same address, a link to organizations set up to source party funds, which runs the official Five Star Movement blog, a site which has also run false articles. Casaleggio declined CNN's request for an interview or comment, referring as to the party and one of its elected officials told CNN.</p><p>LUIGI DI MAIO, FIVE STAR MOVEMENT, POLITICIAN, (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): When it comes to social media, we are leaders there. We know how to manage this. If there have been errors, we apologize. But absolutely it's not intended and not part of our policy.</p><p>SANTOS: And Italy's fake news scourge doesn't end there. Fact checkers at this online journal examined the 10 most shared social media posts in the lead up to Italy's referendum, and found half of them to be inaccurate or misleading. DAVIDE DE LUCA, JOURNALIST, PAGELLA POLITICA: I think it's a problem. In Italy like many other countries, in Italy trusting traditional media is quite low even lower than other countries.</p><p>SANTOS: Giovanni knows there's fake news out there and says he tries to be vigilant. But the temptation to share a politician's post before reading it in full is always there.</p><p>PIETRANTONIO: Put the like is for example in this image and share.</p><p>SANTOS: But you haven't read that yet. You just like the image.</p><p>PIETRANTONIO: Yeah of course.</p><p>SANTOS: There's about four paragraphs before it. But you haven't read it.</p><p>PIETRANTONIO: Yes, sometimes I read it.</p><p>SANTOS: And thus the cycle continues.</p><p>Nina dos Santos, CNN, Milan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[01:49:33] VAUSE: Well, next on NEWSROOM L.A.

Grammies are in February.</p><p>Obviously, Madonna has never been afraid of pushing the envelope, and she is doing it again new twerk-filled performance on late night television. Here is Jeanne Moos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: James Corden takes Madonna for a spin.</p><p>JAMES CORDEN, ENGLISH ACTOR, USA: Do you mind if we listen to some music?</p><p>MADONNA, SINGER, USA: Please.</p><p>CORDEN: Is that be, OK?</p><p>MADONNA: I don't really like riding around in a car unless there's music. MOOS: But Madonna didn't just ride shotgun. She twerked it. It's a wonder she didn't set off the air bag. Well, actually, she did set off an air bag of sorts.</p><p>SUSANNA REID, ANCHOR, GOOD MORNING BRITAIN: I love Madonna.</p><p>PIERS MORGAN, ANCHOR, GOOD MORNING BRITAIN: Oh, she makes my skin crawl.</p><p>MOOS: On Good Morning Britain, former CNN Piers Morgan called 58- year-old Madonna's twerking utterly embarrassing, a train wreck.</p><p>[01:54:59] MORGAN: Oh, God, sorry, I feel suddenly nausea. Sorry, does someone have a bucket? Hang on.</p><p>MOOS: But Madonna fans are sick of Piers. Madonna is an icon. He is grumpy old man, commented one.</p><p>Tweeted another, people don't disappear after a certain age. Look at you, meaning Piers</p><p>MORGAN: Put it away, seriously.</p><p>MOOS: Responded another Madonna supporter, I didn't know older women weren't allowed to have fun, make fun of themselves, poke around and have a gay old time.</p><p>Madonna's rear came to the forefront recently when she twerked with Ariana Grande.</p><p>Thank you for showing me your freshly purchased and installed buttocks, Madonna, wrote one commenter.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE: Big booty but you got a big booty, shake that.</p><p>MOOS: From J. Lo to Adele, carpool karaoke has featured everyone from Justin Bieber to Stevenie Wonder.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE: Ooh, baby, here I am, signed sealed, delivered. I'm yours.</p><p>MOOS: But no one delivered quite like Madonna.</p><p>Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: It's really unfortunate. You're watching NEWSROOM L.A.

Toronto police service has mobilized all available resources and I can assure the public all available resources have been brought into address this tragic situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ELIZABETH MACDONALD, HOST, FOX NEWS: Breaking news to the developing situation in Toronto, a driver now in custody after plowing a van into a crowd among Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, nine dead, 16 injured 17 critically.</p><p>I am Elizabeth MacDonald. This is Risk &amp; Reward.</p><p>The mayor of Toronto authorities just now holding a press conference, the mayor saying it will likely be several days of disruption to the area during the investigation.</p><p>Here with more let's get to Kristina Partsinevelos in the newsroom. Kristina?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Yes, this event only happened a few hours ago at 1.30 p.m. Eastern Time. A white van from the company Ryder, it's a rental van company plowed on to the sidewalk, what you're seeing right now, started to hit a few pedestrians. According to eye witnesses the pedestrians asked the van to stop, the driver continued going hitting more pedestrians.</p><p>And as you mentioned there are nine dead, 16 injured. There's still no word yet about the motivation behind this van attack. You had the mayor just speak very recently, the Mayor of Toronto that's John Tory, and he said we are admired the around the world for being inclusive doesn't want anybody to jump to conclusions just yet as to the motive behind this attack.</p><p>Very importantly to note as well, this is the remaining a Toronto investigation not a national investigation with the RCMP, the Royal Canadian Mountain Police, again, this is a Toronto investigation they are not releasing the name of the driver of the van but they were able to bring him into custody.</p><p>He seemed uninjured based off of several eye witness videos that I've seen when they caught him, he happened to have something in his hand. There's still no confirmation what he was carrying but he was pointing it at a police officer. There were no shots fired.</p><p>Again, this man is in custody. We do not have any details just yet on who he is, what his motivation is, are the Toronto police are being very careful right now with the information, making sure going through to see if he had any cell phones looking through his records to see most importantly if he is somebody that they recognize, that they know and could be affiliated with other people, but right now this is a Toronto investigation.</p><p>You have several, 16 people still injured and businesses that have been damaged along the road because this white van went up on to the sidewalk, hit pedestrians, even rammed into a bus station. There was one eye witness that said he saw his family they're looking for their grandfather and they're very worried and I was just listening to this live through Canadian media that they found the grandfather's glasses on the ground and so they're still waiting confirmation.</p><p>Several of the patients or victims have been brought to Sunny Brook Hospital in Toronto, again Sunny Brook Hospital, so again we have nine dead, 16 injured in this tragic event that's happening in Toronto as we speak.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you, Kristina. We'll be staying on top of that story and much more.</p><p>Let's get to your money. A widely held stock making lots of 401k plans going up. Google parent company Alphabet reporting solid earnings and revenues better than expected after the bell.</p><p>Let's get to Deirdre Bolton on the latest with that. Deirdre?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Hey, Liz. So after-hours, you are going to see this stock kind of see sawing back and forth. So it had a big reaction as you mentioned, Alphabet, Google exceeding both on the top and bottom line and you had a jump of around 4 percent initially, so you can see still higher.</p><p>But just coming off those posted session highs, there are still some really big questions out there, Liz, for the long term of this company. You know, Google has between eight to 10 times more data on you and on me than Facebook so a lot of Facebook investors were saying hey, how come Mark Zuckerberg got dragged before Congress?</p><p>Google has about eight gigabytes of data per person, that equals about 2,000 hours if we just listen straight through of music. If you want a comparison point Facebook has about 650 megabytes which are smaller than gigabytes and that equals about 160 hours of music. So just an interesting kind of data point and it just shows you where this data power is.</p><p>A lot of people are saying Google is one of a kind so if you are an investor you like to hear that. The flip side is, will it make regulators consider one of a kind akin to monopoly which is not too far of a stretch.</p><p>We do know that the European regulators are putting in new privacy laws as of May 25th of this year so tech companies, ones that are based here but have customers in Europe, need to be compliant. If these companies are not compliant this is not a small slap on the wrist, Liz, it is between $30 million or 4 percent of annual revenue whichever is higher, so there's a lot of people saying OK, Google has a lot of work ahead. AlphabetGoogle, excuse me. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD: Good to see you, Deirdre. Thank you so much.</p><p>We have a jam packed busy hour ahead. We are moments away from President Trump and the first lady welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife at the White House for the administration's first official state dinner.</p><p>Let's get to Blake Burman with the latest. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: At the hour the French president has a busy couple of days here in Washington, Liz. I think you can see behind me that they are expecting Emmanuel Macron here at the White House within the next few minutes or so.</p><p>The itinerary is as follows. The Macron family, him and his wife, rather, and the president and first lady will head to dinner tonight to George Washington's home followed by talks tomorrow, a state dinner and then he addresses Congress on Wednesday.</p><p>The White House says these two have a great rapport, and part of the reason why he's receiving the first state visit. However, it is also clear that there are stark differences on a policy level, for example, there are trade issues at hand, as well as different views on the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord all will be discussed in the up upcoming days.</p><p>As we await Macron here at the White House, the White House as well also has its eyes on the goings up on Capitol Hill as it relates to the Senate foreign relations committee as the secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo is set to get the thumbs down from the Senate foreign relations committee it appears within the next few minutes or so.</p><p>All 10 Democrats plus the Republican Rand Paul expected to vote against Pompeo to become the next secretary of state; however, Pompeo still expected to get a vote on the Senate floor and there it appears as though as if he will have the numbers to become the next secretary of state.</p><p>Today, two more Democrats came to his side saying that they would support him, Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly, add to that Heidi Heitkamp to that group as well.</p><p>The White House is trying to make the argument to the United States Senate that if you voted for John Kerry and if you voted for Hillary Clinton, then you should vote for Mike Pompeo as well. The White House press secretary Sarah Sanders saying what's going on, on Capitol Hill sends this message to the rest of the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: What it says to the world is what we've been saying for a long time, the Senate has got some real problems, namely to figure out how to actually show up and do their job a little bit better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Now if Pompeo is voted down by the Senate foreign relations committee, Liz, that would be the first time that would ever happen to a secretary of state nominee if they eventually go on to become in that position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow, historic times, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: And by the way both Democrats and Republicans voted for Pompeo as CIA director.</p><p>BURMAN: Yes, CIA director.</p><p>MACDONALD: Good to see you, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN: You as well.</p><p>MACDONALD: Senate foreign relations committee, as Blake Burman just noted is about -- they are about to vote on Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. Rand Paul tweeting out he will support the nomination he was against it.</p><p>Last month President Trump announced the departure of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and as nomination of Pompeo as the replacement. Now the thinking is if it gets to the full chamber Pompeo will become the secretary of state. Just going through this process right now, we're monitoring the vote for you in the beginning.</p><p>Let's get to what's going on with the French visit. The media says this is going to be a bad relationship. Got off to a rocky start but now, French President Macron even taking a line from President Trump ahead of today's state visit to the White House. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE We have this very special relationship because both of us are probably the maverick of the system, on both sides I think President Trump's election was unexpected in your country, and probably my election wasn't expected in my country, and we are not part of the political system. I'm here to serve my people and my country and make it great again, somebody I know very well could say, but that's it, that's the whole story.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Joining me now, Weekly Standard executive editor, Fred Barnes. Fred, make France great again, did you hear that?</p><p>FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes, look, Macron, this is, he is so sure, so smart, so likable, and Trump is just basking in and he's getting everything he wants and Macron fought a big war and he wants to make sure that Trump doesn't get out of the Iran nuclear deal and that he gets back in the Paris accord, I think not much chance for that.</p><p>But he is smart. He is the big European leader who has stepped forward to embrace Trump, not endorse him but give Trump somebody big to deal with. It isn't going to be England, it isn't going to be what's the name, Angela Merkel in Germany comes in I think on Friday and that's just a bit of a sour puss and doesn't get along with Trump. But Macron has made an effort here and it's very wise on his part.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, here is the thing. We've got that May 12 deadline for the Iran deal.</p><p>BARNES: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: The president is expected to yank it saying he already said this is the worst deal ever. So, and you're right, we've got Angela Merkel coming in. You know, Fred, these state visits are coming at a time when economic growth is up, optimism is up, the media reporting how the Democrats may take back control of the House.</p><p>The president seems to be dominating the message, when people go to vote they say, what are you going to do for me?</p><p>BARNES: Yes, look, I wouldn't buy this line from the Democrats and from a lot of people in the media that there's a blue wave coming and Democrats are just going to sweep through and win the House and maybe the Senate in November.</p><p>They do very well that would be what happens historically in the first mid- term election for a new president, but Trump is the dominant figure here and he has got some very optimistic things to talk about, not just the economy but in foreign policy as well.</p><p>Look, Macron was one of those who joined in the attack on the plants in Syria where they mix and made the poisonous product that were used to kill so many Syrians, so look, they worked together before and I think they'll work together again, particularly here.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Macron has pointed out that they're both maverick outsiders.</p><p>BARNES: They are.</p><p>MACDONALD: They're both businessmen, they're not part of the classical political system. Both were elected on the first try. It seems like these two men have a lot in common. So we've got the D.C. media up in arms saying, you know, this is again it's going to be problems here with the state visit, certainly with Angela Merkel, they're raising the red flags about it. What do you see?</p><p>BARNES: Well, look, I'll tell you what the media really wants and they're going to hound poor Macron while he's here. They want him to dump on Trump and he is refusing to do it, wouldn't be smart to do it.</p><p>MACDONALD: How are they going -- how are they going to get the French president to dump on President Trump?</p><p>BARNES: Well, he's going to have a press conference among other things, they'll yell questions at him, and look, they have ways to get that question asked, but Macron is I think not going to do it. What purpose of his would it serve? He says he's here to deal with the president of the United States. He doesn't have to and doesn't have to comment personally on Trump.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know what, to your point, Fred, and it's an important one. The media again, is misreading the situation.</p><p>BARNES: I think so.</p><p>MACDONALD: Macron likes his relationship with Trump because it improves his own basically rookie standing with the E.U. He's now being called the Trump whisperer. Macron is not going to damage that. He's not going to damage how important he is now to the E.U. given his relationship with Trump.</p><p>BARNES: I think you're absolutely right. It serves his purpose very well. Now, will Macron be able to talk Trump into not getting out of the Iran deal, will he be able to talk him to getting into Paris climate accord? I don't think so on either one of those things, but he'll get credit for trying.</p><p>MACDONALD: Good to see you, Fred Barnes. Great stuff. Come back soon.</p><p>BARNES: OK.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now let's get to this fast moving stock as Google parent Alphabet reporting strong earnings and revenue after the bell. It's been doing that every quarter since 2010. The stock is moving after-hours. another great quarter for Google. But now, this. A new report Google does get more personal information about you than even Facebook, as Deirdre Bolton just said 8 to 10 times of Facebook. We're going to show you the details.</p><p>We're also monitoring that Senate foreign relationships vote of Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Rand Paul breaking news here, just putting out he will vote for Michael Pompeo, when the vote comes we're going to bring it to you. Liberal newspapers now supporting Pompeo. We're going to show who.</p><p>But first, we're also watching President Trump and the first lady welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife at the White House for the administration's first official state dinner. We're going to bring that to you live as well, jam-packed hour, really busy hour ahead, don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: Back to this breaking news. We are monitoring French President Emmanuel Macron he's about to appear at the White House any second, but the first lady and the president will greet the French president and Mrs. Macron at the White House.</p><p>Let's bring in Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor Katrina Pierson. It's a historic visit, Katrina, now even President Macron effectively saying you know what? President is the president to the American people, he's giving that message the American people will deal with it. He's the president.</p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISOR: Absolutely. This truly is a refreshing display of leadership. You have two leaders who don't agree 100 percent on all of the policy positions but who have become friends and respect each other as leaders and now we're here having a great visit. I fully expect President Macron to make his case, with regards to trade and Syria and Iraq. But here, I mean, Iran.</p><p>So here is the thing. President Trump is going to consider the president of France as counsel absolutely as a courtesy, Liz. But let's make no mistake. The president of the United States will be making policy for the United States so I think this is a great opportunity for many in our own country to see how elected leaders should act.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, to your point, it's well taken. Because the thinking in the E.U. as President Macron is the leading edge of that wedge to get the president to step back on the Iran deal, dial back on, you know, the tariffs, and the potential trade wars, and also climate change. But your point is President Trump is not going to do that, right?</p><p>PIERSON: No, I don't think so because these are things that the president has hold very dear and we've seen it throughout the campaign. You can go all the way back to the 80s on some of these positions. But I do think he would consider the counsel, but at the same time the president has made a commitment to the United States and that is to put America and its people first. That is not going to change. And I think the president of France respects the president's opinion as well.</p><p>And when we look at the things like Iran, for example, the president was very adamant on making some significant changes, things that a lot of people agree with, regardless of how we entered this deal. We have a new leader of the United States and he wants to have input.</p><p>MACDONALD: So again, we're monitoring this situation unfolding right now at the White House. You're looking at a live action shot of the White House, the president of France with the first lady of France expected to appear momentarily to greet the president and first lady Melania Trump.</p><p>President Macron to your point, Katrina, is expected to press President Trump on trade. Here is what he said over the weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACRON: You cannot make it through the wall with the allies, it's too complicated. If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade war against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against them, come on, it doesn't work. You need ally. We are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, so here is the messaging problem right for the president? Katrina, he's got to say listen we're not talking about trade war. We're talking about fair trade and the E.U. needs to get that message China has not been fair. Go ahead.</p><p>PIERSON: Well, absolutely, and we keep hearing that the president is doing this to everyone else when in fact, everyone else has done this to the United States and the president is simply saying look, we need fair and reciprocal trade.</p><p>At the end of the day that's what going to matter. Many people in our own country have doubted his ability to make these deals and to get things done, but if you look at ISIS and tax reform he's even been bringing North Korea to the table. So the president is actually doing things right. It might be different, but we're actually getting things done.</p><p>And I think President Macron is going to get to hear President Trump's position on these things as well.</p><p>MACDONALD: Here is an unfolding breaking news situation and it's happening right now with Russia and Iran as it pertains to the E.U. Katrina, to your point, record amounts of U.S. oil is now flooding into E.U. markets, that deal with Iran that Obama struck, there's a May 12 deadline that is looming the president could yank what he says is the worst deal ever and impose sanctions.</p><p>Again, Iran is backed by Russia, Russia supplies a lot of oil and Nat gas to the E.U. We are just hearing the breaking news that the U.S. is now becoming the number one oil exporter into the E.U changing geopolitical landscape in the favor of the U.S. right here, Katrina.</p><p>PIERSON: Well, and that's exactly what we call making America great again, and President Trump knows one thing and that is leverage. He wrote about it. And he knows and the world knows that if the president was to pull out of the Iran deal, perhaps go back to the sanctions on the Iran central bank or oil exports it's going to be a problem.</p><p>But these are things like, you know, looking at including the long range missiles and you know, eliminating the sunset provision on things like I don't know, you're reaching -- enriching uranium which is a huge problem for Iran.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>PIERSON: And the president of France they need to understand is we don't see the dust to France chance coming out of Iran like we see coming from Iran to America.</p><p>MACDONALD: To you--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PIERSON: And President Trump takes that very seriously.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, they are now as you can see at the White House raising the welcoming flags 15 months into his presidency, the president is finally rolling out the red carpet for the president of France and what will happen after Macron appears they will go for a sunset dinner on the terrace of George Washington's home in Mount Vernon overlooking the Potomac.</p><p>Katrina, Macron is expected to, to your point, really prep the president on the Iran deal. He is the leader, he's seen by the E.U. as the Trump whisper that he can basically coax the president into staying in the Iran deal. Macron, though, watch this, Katrina, admitting though that that deal as the president has said has flaws. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACRON: It this as if agreement perfect and this JCPOA a perfect thing for our relationship with Iran, no. But for nuclear, what do you have as a better option? I don't see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: The car is now rolling up with the leader of France so Macron says that they would finish the war against ISIS. If we leave, we leave it open to Iran and Syria, they are going to fuel a new terrorist war. What are your thoughts?</p><p>PIERSON: Well, I think President Trump is also coming at this from a different perspective. You know, we've had this, that we've been doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results and President Trump doesn't want to do that anymore and he's not saying end it altogether, he wants to make revisions.</p><p>And now that we see that they're cracking down on anti-government protesters that's a problem particularly if we're just going to sit back and allow this to happen not really knowing what's going on.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Let me break in here. The president is just stepping outside the White House with the first lady ready to greet the president of France, and Mrs. Macron as well. Tomorrow night there will be a state dinner and a break with tradition, President Trump has invited no Democrat members of Congress or journalists. About 150 guests will take their seats in the state ding room tomorrow night.</p><p>It's going to be a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack Obama. Obama's guest list went into the hundreds and the president really wants to keep this close relationship. And here he is, the president of France greeting and a hug with the president of the United States. Let's watch this and let this moment sink in.</p><p>OK, Katrina, what we're watching now is a warm embrace between the leader of France and his wife is with the leader of the United States. It looks really quite collegial; they are now turning for the official photograph.</p><p>Katrina, Trump seems, the president seems to be going all out on pomp and circumstance. That's how much he had in Paris last July when the president of France invited him to watch the annual Bastille Day. What's your reaction to rolling out the red carpet for the president of France?</p><p>PIERSON: Well, it is Donald Trump, Liz, so I think we can fully expect the best with the president and Melania who, you know, is a class act in and of her own. I mean, it's just an amazing opportunity for us to all see what we're seeing right now and that is, you know, refreshing leadership, bringing two countries together, even though they have their differences, willing to work together for what they do agree upon.</p><p>MACDONALD: Our allies, Katrina, for 50 years. Katrina Pierson, thank you so much for weighing in there. I really appreciate it.</p><p>PIERSON: Great to be here. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. We're also monitoring this breaking developing situation, we're moments away from the Senate foreign relations vote on the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Not the final confirmation the full chamber is expected to vote for Pompeo. A rebuke tough, Senate foreign relations don't want him. We're going to bring you that breaking news as it comes in. Don't go away, stay with us, more after the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: At some point, Democrats have to decide whether they love this country more than they hate this president, and they have to decide that they want to put the safety and the security and the diplomacy of our country ahead of their own political games, and we're very hopeful that they will.</p><p>Mike Pompeo is a highly qualified individual. He's been one of the leading people when it comes to the negotiations and the conversations with North Korea, and to stop that would be a incredibly dangerous and damaging for our country and for the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. We're staying in breaking news mode. We've got more developments, look at this. Republican Senator Jeff Flake now a yes on the nomination. He will vote yes that Pompeo should be secretary of state with Rand Paul. That means the Senate foreign relations panel is doing a 180.</p><p>Instead of rebuking this nomination it looks like the Senate foreign relations panel will confirm Mike Pompeo as secretary of state.</p><p>Let's bring in the Daily Caller editorial director, Vince Coglianese. What a turn around, Vince?</p><p>VINCE COGLIANESE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, DAILY CALLER: That's quite a change of events. Rand Paul, of course the big hold out, you mentioned Jeff Flake as well, but Rand Paul, the president saying in public that he wanted to see Rand come with him, and that is happening, that's a huge deal.</p><p>And it's important that the Senate foreign relations committee do this, give him a stamp of approval given the unheard-of nature of sending out somebody with disapproval to be voted on by the full Senate approve.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, that's right. Let's get to the viewer, he comes out of Senate foreign relations, it looks like the Senate foreign relations panel does vote yes saying, yes, Pompeo should be the next secretary of state. Then it goes to the full Senate where Pompeo is expected to be confirmed as secretary of state.</p><p>You know, here's the thing, initially, Vince, the storyline was that, you know, they didn't like Pompeo's position on Iran.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: They thought he was too much of a hawk. He was supposed to be the easy confirmation.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Yes</p><p>MACDONALD: He was supposed to be the no-brainer, and all of a sudden he was a problem that even Democrats and Republicans who voted for him as CIA director were saying, no, we don't want him as secretary of state in the middle of the North Korea breakthroughs.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: I mean, it is a stunning, you know, revelation of what's going on in D.C. when you have historic developments going on with North Korea. And they're saying no to Pompeo when he's trying to strike these deals. Go ahead.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Yes. And it was a temper tantrum that lead them to that conclusion, and I say that because this was a referendum on Trump. And all of the assessments that we've heard from Democrats it was about -- it was about Mike Pompeo's insufficient because he's not going to rein in Trump's worth instincts.</p><p>There's no evidence for that. As the head of the CIA, he's had an unblemished career there, he's had a good career prior to that as well. He was, as you said, confirmed by the Senate to run the CIA before including with Democratic support, and now he's got the opportunity to be secretary of state.</p><p>And there's such an important resume item there for Mike Pompeo, and you mentioned it. It's the fact that he's leading negotiations with North Korea. This is an historic moment in terms of just having a U.S. official leading such a high-level negotiation with North Korea.</p><p>To throw him out, to get rid of him as secretary of state would be a preposterous exercise in politics--</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>COGLIANESE: -- and one the Democrats should not suffer right now because if they do, they will suffer politically in the future politically for making such a horrendous decision.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, historians and analysts have already said if the president gets that North Korea deal, it will be on the level of Reagan/Gorbachev.</p><p>We have three liberal newspapers saying, you know what? Obstructionist Democrats, stop. You have to put Pompeo in as secretary of state. The president needs be a secretary of state. They are, USA Today, a writer at the Washington Post, and the New York Daily News. Your final reaction, Vince.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Well, only that Barack Obama was given a Nobel Peace prize the moment he came into office for doing nothing. If this is accomplished, as you were mentioning, a peaceful North Korea of any kind, a meaningful peace and one that draws down nuclear weapons, then I expect that Donald Trump will receive a nomination for it, not that the Nobel Prize committee will ever seriously consider him.</p><p>He's not exactly beloved by the globalist communist, but Mike Pompeo should be right up there on that stage accepting the same thing. We have a long way to go before we get there, but this is a big deal, and Mike Pompeo should clear the bar at the United States Senate.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Great to see you, Vince.</p><p>Let's take you back to the White House. A truly lovely event is about to be, take place right now. The two couples will plant a tree. It's a gift from the president and president of France and Mrs. Macron they are going to plant a tree, a sapling, a European oak on the South Lawn of the White House about four and a half feet tall.</p><p>We're going to bring that to you live as it happens. Interesting note here, First lady Melania Trump is really taking the lead here in organizing this historic visit.</p><p>Quick, we're going to have more after the break. Also we're staying on the situation in Toronto, that van plowing down pedestrians. Nine dead, 17 injured, seven critically. We're going to bring you the latest on that. A suspect has been arrested. No motive yet. We will bring that to you live.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The nightmare, I've got to Yonge, and I've seen a lady with her leg -- man, it was a gruesome scene. It's really bad out there. I couldn't believe what I've seen, man. It was, man. Everybody, all these people on the streets getting hit one by one. Post office boxes getting crumpled up on people. And one person got dragged on and their blood is all over Yonge. It's really bad out there, man.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. We are basically are watching the president with the first lady and the leader of France and the first lady of France now stepping out of the portico, the White House. They're now going to enter the South Lawn.</p><p>There's first lady Melania right there. She's been organizing this historic state visit. It is the White House's first state visit 15 months into the Trump presidency.</p><p>They're going to plant a tree on the South Lawn. It is a gift from France to the United States. It is a European oak sapling, four and a half feet tall.</p><p>We have lieutenant general Thomas McInerney here. Sir, this is a developing situation as well. General, the E.U. is look to the president of France to coax President Donald Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. Your reaction.</p><p>THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE: Well, it's natural, and they send President Macron over here to use him because he probably has the best relationship of any of the European leaders right now, so I'm not surprise. I do not think the president is going to change. He knows what he wants to do.</p><p>The Europeans on the Iranian deal, it's purely a cash cow. They're ignoring the nuclear threat per se. It's cash. They've got a huge trade surplus going, and they're working it to their advantage. But that's not good enough.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, it seems when you read, study what the president of France, general, has been saying about ISIS leaving Syria and Iran's growing presence with military bases in Syria, on the one hand the president of France is saying as soon as -- if we leave, if we, the United States, leave Syria, Iran will step in and cause terrorist activities to go on the increase.</p><p>But at the same time, he wants the president to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. Can you square this for the viewer, can you explain that and sort that out?</p><p>MCINERNEY: Yes, I'll make it very simple. We should stay with the limited number of people in Syria with 24/7 air power, so if they try to take over any of the Kurdish places or the Syrian allies, then we can use that air power to beat them down and to defeat them.</p><p>Now, as far as the nuclear deal goes, that was such a bad deal that no agreement should ever have been made, the JCPOA, Liz. And we should back out of that from both a military and a political point of view. Again, remember, the European Union's interest is primarily in trade.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let me just give you some background information about the tree that was just planted. There is historic information about the reason that France gave the United States and the White House this tree.</p><p>Over 9,000 American marines died in World War I in what's called the Belleau Wood, this tree is from the area of that battle in June 1918 where 9,000 American marines died in World War I. That as far is a memorial site. It's an important symbol of the sacrifice the United States made to insure peace and stability in Europe.</p><p>General, your reaction to the president of France giving this oak tree to the United States in commemoration of World War I marines dying there.</p><p>MCINERNEY: Liz, it's very, very symbolic. The Battle of Belleau Wood was a horrendous battle. We lost, as you said, 9,000 marines. And to make this tree come from that region really touches on our relationship. And I think it is a very symbolic gesture by President Macron and symbolic of the relationship between the president and President Trump.</p><p>MACDONALD: What does this do for the psyche of the Trump administration, to have these memorable events come up and in the ensuing days? This will be a three-day visit, the president of Germany -- Germany, rather, Angela Merkel will be coming on Friday. How does this set the scene for the presidency of Donald Trump?</p><p>MCINERNEY: Well, I think it establishes it on a high note. People are seeing the way the Trumps handle their visitors and the relationships developing. The left has always wanted to deny that President Trump had that capability. He's absolutely brilliant at it. You're seeing it today and you'll see it at dinner tonight at Mount Vernon and the state dinner they have.</p><p>The whole three days that the Macrons are here and how they're honored is going to show the world and the American people what a great leader President Trump and Mrs. Trump are.</p><p>MACDONALD: We will be covering the Chancellor of Germany's visit, Angela Merkel as well, coming later this week. Good to see you, general. Thanks for coming in. I really appreciate it.</p><p>MCINERNEY: Thank, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: We are moments away from that Senate foreign relations vote on the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Breaking news, it looks like that Senate panel will vote for Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state.</p><p>Jeff Flake and Rand Paul now saying they will vote for Michael Pompeo as secretary of state.</p><p>We're going to take you back to Toronto, van mowed down nine people, and injuring 16, killing nine in Toronto. We're going to bring you the latest on that after the break. Don't go away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Being confirm for you tonight, right now, we have nine people that are dead. Sixteen that are injured. Toronto police service has mobilized all available resources, and I can assure the public all our available resources have been brought in to address this tragic situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Take you to the developments in Toronto. Driver now in custody after plowing a van into a crowd leaving nine people dead, sixteen injured, seven critically. Toronto authorities held the press conference just moments ago. We still do not know the driver's identity and his motive, we will bring that to you as soon as it comes in.</p><p>General, listen, we have seen numerous van attacks like this and vehicular attacks, a dozen since 2006, general. We've seen them in England, we've seen them in Germany and Spain. And, of course, in Canada, as well as the U.S. Your reaction, sir.</p><p>MCINERNEY: Well, it looks like a cookie cutter, Liz. By the rental van, the number of people -- nine dead and 16 injured -- all the makings of radical Islam. All I need to know is the driver's name and a little more background, but I would say there's a 90 percent chance that this is radical Islam. It wasn't an old man that had a heart attack or a stroke.</p><p>MACDONALD: Again, we don't know the motive just yet. But we do know the facts about prior vehicular attacks. Let's talk about that. Again, we don't know the motive in Toronto.</p><p>General, you know, the terror capability has shifted. It is very difficult for terrorists -- we're not saying this is terrorism -- it's difficult for them to get bombs and explosives. It is easy for them to do vehicular attacks. Your reaction to that.</p><p>MCINERNEY: Well, that's exactly what ISIS is telling their warriors across the world, use vehicular attacks. And you can see all the ones that they've done in the last year rather than explosives or even weapons, although London are getting a lot of knives over there. But the fact is that is now their modus operandi, and it's something that we should be cognizant of, and it's very, very difficult to stop, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, and to your point, the days of the terror cell are over. Now I think, to your point, terrorists -- and, again, we don't know the motives of this attack. It has the hallmark of a terrorist attack. Again, we'll bring you the motive as soon as it breaks.</p><p>To your point, general, you have said this before, ISIS and radical terrorist leaders are saying stay in place and do your own terrorism. This is a form of micro terrorism, right?</p><p>MCINERNEY: Exactly. And it's the patterns of behavior that I look at, that's my business, patterns of behavior. And this is what you're seeing now spread across all the cities in Europe as well as the United States in New York City, for instance, where you are. And so this is what we must expect, and it's extremely difficult to counter this.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, it's a senseless act of violence. What do you say to the viewer out there, you know, these are just pedestrians walking on one of Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, it's just near downtown Toronto. Are we supposed to be having security barricades on every major block in every urban area, every city?</p><p>MCINERNEY: They would like that, but we're not going to do that.</p><p>MACDONALD: Why would they like that?</p><p>MCINERNEY: Because that means the western world is being influenced by the radical Islamists, to their way of thinking. They are putting control on what we do just like when we go to an airport and all the checks we go through. They like that.</p><p>But the fact is we've got to defeat this Islamic terrorism where the ideology comes from, Mecca and Medina from the Middle East, and that's the Muslims themselves. They must do that. And I'm hopeful that the new crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be the leader against the radical Islamists in his region so that they are no longer holy warriors and will go to paradise for killing infidels. No, we must destroy that ideology.</p><p>MACDONALD: It should be noted too that in Toronto a group of seven security international meeting was occurring just up -- a few blocks away from that terror attack. If we think -- let me back up, we don't know if it's a terror attack, it has the hallmarks of that. Sir, you know, what are the authorities asking this suspect right now?</p><p>MCINERNEY: Well, first of all, they want to get his name, and then you want to get where he goes to church, what his basic beliefs are, what is the reason he did this. If one person was killed, fine, that happens. But not nine people. Not nine people.</p><p>MACDONALD: General, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in and handling two stories. I really appreciate it.</p><p>MCINERNEY: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Again, we're going to take you back to the White House. This is -- we're in breaking news mode. The president and first lady welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and the first lady of France, they're about to leave for Mount Vernon for a dinner overlooking at the Potomac. We will bring it to you live. That is the home of George Washington.</p><p>And we're also moments away from that vote out of the Senate panel on the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. It looks like that panel will vote for Mike Pompeo. Jeff Flake and Rand Paul saying yes to Mike Pompeo as secretary of state.</p><p>But first, after Facebook's data breach scandal, other big tech companies like Google could be next to face scrutiny over its data privacy practices. We're on that story for you coming up.</p><p>MACDONALD: After Facebook's data breach and data mining scandal, other big tech companies like Google they are now in the hot seat over their data privacy practices. A new report shows Google is way worse than Facebook at collecting and keeping your personal information. They've been cyberstalking you all over the internet even if you're not on Google's web site for something else.</p><p>Let's take a look at how the stock of -- the stock of Google's parent company Alphabet did after their company reporting slide to the downside, and falling to less than 1 percent after hours.</p><p>Let's get to the panel on this. I want to bring in Danielle McLaughlin and Kelsey Harkness. First to you, Kelsey, you know what's the creepiest part of the story? It's that this Silicon Valley stalks you all over the internet even though you're not on their web sites. That's the worse part of the story. I don't think people realize that, Kelsey.</p><p>KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR REPORTER, DAILY SIGNAL: Well, the level of outrage directed at Google and Facebook is certainly understandable, but it's really not surprising because Google and Facebook are billion dollar companies--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, but isn't it creepy that Silicon Valley has all of the information about what we're doing on the internet?</p><p>HARKNESS: It's certainly creepy which is why Americans are upset about this, but it's not surprising because they're not providing these services for free. But I think what's important about these stories is that we don't direct our anger towards the government and ask the government to regulate the tech industry because the government, too, is collecting our personal data.</p><p>Look at the CFBP, look at OPM, both of them had big, massive breaches. So we need to let the free market solve this, we need to demand that tech companies take it upon themselves to solve this and not get the government involved in an area it really doesn't belong.</p><p>MACDONALD: I used to be kind of OK with it, Danielle, and say, OK, you know. But now I'm thinking, wait, this isn't good. To Kelsey's point, the IRS has also had data breaches. The IRS knows a lot about our income. And now Silicon Valley, Danielle knows too much about what we're doing on the internet. I think it's kind of weird.</p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST: It is weird, and it is a little bit creepy, to your point. I think we have to make a decision societally about who is going to regulate this. I take Kelsey's point about the notion of the free market solving for this, but the free market hasn't solved for this, and that's why we're in this position in the first place.</p><p>I actually do think that more like Europe -- which has very robust privacy laws -- we should ask your government who are elected representative to step in and make sure that these billion, trillion dollar companies in Silicon Valley aren't just data mining.</p><p>MACDONALD: Guys, I'm so sorry, we've got to break away because that Senate vote on Mike Pompeo coming in, Rand Paul just now explaining why he changed his vote. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAND PAUL, (R) UNITED STATES SENATOR: I decided to go ahead and vote for Director Pompeo because he's assured me that he's learned the lesson. Now, time will tell if those assurances are true or not. And I won't say that -- I can say with absolute certainty I know what his opinions will be and how they will come out over time, but I do take him at his word.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: So they're about to vote, Kelsey, what's your reaction to this 180 out of Senate foreign relations now after that. Now the breaking news it will, that panel will approve Mike Pompeo as secretary of state? What's your reaction to the 180 here?</p><p>HARKNESS: I think it's very good news. I think that it maybe appears normal to a lot of Americans to hear that all Democrats are opposing Pompeo's nomination, but this is not normal. Under the Obama administration 94 senators approved both Hillary Clinton and John Kerry for the same position and, clearly, those are very divisive figures.</p><p>Mike Pompeo is very qualified to do this job and at a time when we are about to enter into serious negotiations with North Korea, President Trump needs a secretary of state by his side.</p><p>MACDONALD: What do you think, Danielle?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: I do agree that we need a secretary of state at this very crucial time in North Korea relations. What Rand Paul asked of Mike Pompeo was two things, do you agree that war in the Middle East, more war in the Middle East is destabilizing, number one, and number two, do you agree that Iraq was a mistake? He got those reassurances from Mike Pompeo, and that's what changed his vote.</p><p>MACDONALD: Interesting. The vote is now underway. We're staying on top of the vote. Final thought, Kelsey.</p><p>HARKNESS: I think that this is good news for all Americans.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Kelsey and Danielle, thank you so much. We're up against a hard break. The president and the president of France about to arrive at Mount Vernon. We're going to stay on that story for you as well. Jam-packed hour, don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: Breaking news. The Senate foreign relations committee now voting for Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. Jeff Flake is yes, so as Rand Paul. It goes to the full chamber for a vote where he is expected to be confirmed as secretary of state.</p><p>We're also are waiting for President Trump and the first lady, the French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife. They're headed to Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington to have dinner overlooking the Potomac.</p><p>That does it for us. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2018042301cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5N-HR81-JB20-G1F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>RISK &amp;

Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources and I can assure the public all available  resources have been brought into address this tragic situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ELIZABETH MACDONALD, HOST, FOX NEWS:  Breaking news to the developing  situation in Toronto, a driver now in custody after plowing a van into a  crowd among Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, nine dead, 16 injured 17  critically. </p><p>I am Elizabeth MacDonald. This is Risk &amp; Reward. </p><p>The mayor of Toronto authorities just now holding a press conference, the  mayor saying it will likely be several days of disruption to the area  during the investigation. </p><p>Here with more let's get to Kristina Partsinevelos in the newsroom.  Kristina? </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Yes, this event only  happened a few hours ago at 1.30 p.m. Eastern Time. A white van from the  company Ryder, it's a rental van company plowed on to the sidewalk, what  you're seeing right now, started to hit a few pedestrians. According to eye  witnesses the pedestrians asked the van to stop, the driver continued going  hitting more pedestrians. </p><p>And as you mentioned there are nine dead, 16 injured. There's still no word  yet about the motivation behind this van attack. You had the mayor just  speak very recently, the Mayor of Toronto that's John Tory, and he said we  are admired the around the world for being inclusive doesn't want anybody  to jump to conclusions just yet as to the motive behind this attack. </p><p>Very importantly to note as well, this is the remaining a Toronto  investigation not a national investigation with the RCMP, the Royal  Canadian Mountain Police, again, this is a Toronto investigation they are  not releasing the name of the driver of the van but they were able to bring  him into custody. </p><p>He seemed uninjured based off of several eye witness videos that I've seen  when they caught him, he happened to have something in his hand. There's  still no confirmation what he was carrying but he was pointing it at a  police officer. There were no shots fired. </p><p>Again, this man is in custody. We do not have any details just yet on who  he is, what his motivation is, are the Toronto police are being very  careful right now with the information, making sure going through to see if  he had any cell phones looking through his records to see most importantly  if he is somebody that they recognize, that they know and could be  affiliated with other people, but right now this is a Toronto  investigation. </p><p>You have several, 16 people still injured and businesses that have been  damaged along the road because this white van went up on to the sidewalk,  hit pedestrians, even rammed into a bus station. There was one eye witness  that said he saw his family they're looking for their grandfather and  they're very worried and I was just listening to this live through Canadian  media that they found the grandfather's glasses on the ground and so  they're still waiting confirmation. </p><p>Several of the patients or victims have been brought to Sunny Brook  Hospital in Toronto, again Sunny Brook Hospital, so again we have nine  dead, 16 injured in this tragic event that's happening in Toronto as we  speak. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Kristina. We'll be staying on top of that story and  much more. </p><p>Let's get to your money. A widely held stock making lots of 401k plans  going up. Google parent company Alphabet reporting solid earnings and  revenues better than expected after the bell. </p><p>Let's get to Deirdre Bolton on the latest with that. Deirdre? </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Hey, Liz. So after-hours, you are  going to see this stock kind of see sawing back and forth. So it had a big  reaction as you mentioned, Alphabet, Google exceeding both on the top and  bottom line and you had a jump of around 4 percent initially, so you can  see still higher. </p><p>But just coming off those posted session highs, there are still some really  big questions out there, Liz, for the long term of this company. You know,  Google has between eight to 10 times more data on you and on me than  Facebook so a lot of Facebook investors were saying hey, how come Mark  Zuckerberg got dragged before Congress? </p><p>Google has about eight gigabytes of data per person, that equals about  2,000 hours if we just listen straight through of music. If you want a  comparison point Facebook has about 650 megabytes which are smaller than  gigabytes and that equals about 160 hours of music. So just an interesting  kind of data point and it just shows you where this data power is. </p><p>A lot of people are saying Google is one of a kind so if you are an  investor you like to hear that. The flip side is, will it make regulators  consider one of a kind akin to monopoly which is not too far of a stretch.</p><p>We do know that the European regulators are putting in new privacy laws as  of May 25th of this year so tech companies, ones that are based here but  have customers in Europe, need to be compliant. If these companies are not  compliant this is not a small slap on the wrist, Liz, it is between $30  million or 4 percent of annual revenue whichever is higher, so there's a  lot of people saying OK, Google has a lot of work ahead. AlphabetGoogle,  excuse me. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Deirdre. Thank you so much.</p><p>We have a jam packed busy hour ahead. We are moments away from President  Trump and the first lady welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and his  wife at the White House for the administration's first official state  dinner.</p><p>Let's get to Blake Burman with the latest. Blake? </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  At the hour the French president  has a busy couple of days here in Washington, Liz. I think you can see  behind me that they are expecting Emmanuel Macron here at the White House  within the next few minutes or so. </p><p>The itinerary is as follows. The Macron family, him and his wife, rather,  and the president and first lady will head to dinner tonight to George  Washington's home followed by talks tomorrow, a state dinner and then he  addresses Congress on Wednesday. </p><p>The White House says these two have a great rapport, and part of the reason  why he's receiving the first state visit. However, it is also clear that  there are stark differences on a policy level, for example, there are trade  issues at hand, as well as different views on the Iran nuclear deal and the  Paris climate accord all will be discussed in the up upcoming days. </p><p>As we await Macron here at the White House, the White House as well also  has its eyes on the goings up on Capitol Hill as it relates to the Senate  foreign relations committee as the secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo  is set to get the thumbs down from the Senate foreign relations committee  it appears within the next few minutes or so.</p><p>All 10 Democrats plus the Republican Rand Paul expected to vote against  Pompeo to become the next secretary of state; however, Pompeo still  expected to get a vote on the Senate floor and there it appears as though  as if he will have the numbers to become the next secretary of state. </p><p>Today, two more Democrats came to his side saying that they would support  him, Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly, add to that Heidi Heitkamp to that group  as well. </p><p>The White House is trying to make the argument to the United States Senate  that if you voted for John Kerry and if you voted for Hillary Clinton, then  you should vote for Mike Pompeo as well. The White House press secretary  Sarah Sanders saying what's going on, on Capitol Hill sends this message to  the rest of the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What it says to the  world is what we've been saying for a long time, the Senate has got some  real problems, namely to figure out how to actually show up and do their  job a little bit better. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now if Pompeo is voted down by the Senate foreign relations  committee, Liz, that would be the first time that would ever happen to a  secretary of state nominee if they eventually go on to become in that  position. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow, historic times, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And by the way both Democrats and Republicans voted for Pompeo  as CIA director. </p><p>BURMAN:  Yes, CIA director.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  You as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senate foreign relations committee, as Blake Burman just noted  is about -- they are about to vote on Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state.  Rand Paul tweeting out he will support the nomination he was against it. </p><p>Last month President Trump announced the departure of Rex Tillerson as  secretary of state and as nomination of Pompeo as the replacement. Now the  thinking is if it gets to the full chamber Pompeo will become the secretary  of state. Just going through this process right now, we're monitoring the  vote for you in the beginning.</p><p>Let's get to what's going on with the French visit. The media says this is  going to be a bad relationship. Got off to a rocky start but now, French  President Macron even taking a line from President Trump ahead of today's  state visit to the White House. Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE We have this very special relationship  because both of us are probably the maverick of the system, on both sides I  think President Trump's election was unexpected in your country, and  probably my election wasn't expected in my country, and we are not part of  the political system. I'm here to serve my people and my country and make  it great again, somebody I know very well could say, but that's it, that's  the whole story. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joining me now, Weekly Standard executive editor, Fred Barnes.  Fred, make France great again, did you hear that? </p><p>FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes, look, Macron, this  is, he is so sure, so smart, so likable, and Trump is just basking in and  he's getting everything he wants and Macron fought a big war and he wants  to make sure that Trump doesn't get out of the Iran nuclear deal and that  he gets back in the Paris accord, I think not much chance for that. </p><p>But he is smart. He is the big European leader who has stepped forward to  embrace Trump, not endorse him but give Trump somebody big to deal with. It  isn't going to be England, it isn't going to be what's the name, Angela  Merkel in Germany comes in I think on Friday and that's just a bit of a  sour puss and doesn't get along with Trump. But Macron has made an effort  here and it's very wise on his part. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, here is the thing. We've got that May 12 deadline for  the Iran deal. </p><p>BARNES:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  The president is expected to yank it saying he already said  this is the worst deal ever. So, and you're right, we've got Angela Merkel  coming in. You know, Fred, these state visits are coming at a time when  economic growth is up, optimism is up, the media reporting how the  Democrats may take back control of the House. </p><p>The president seems to be dominating the message, when people go to vote  they say, what are you going to do for me? </p><p>BARNES:  Yes, look, I wouldn't buy this line from the Democrats and from a  lot of people in the media that there's a blue wave coming and Democrats  are just going to sweep through and win the House and maybe the Senate in  November. </p><p>They do very well that would be what happens historically in the first mid- term election for a new president, but Trump is the dominant figure here  and he has got some very optimistic things to talk about, not just the  economy but in foreign policy as well. </p><p>Look, Macron was one of those who joined in the attack on the plants in  Syria where they mix and made the poisonous product that were used to kill  so many Syrians, so look, they worked together before and I think they'll  work together again, particularly here. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Macron has pointed out that they're both maverick  outsiders. </p><p>BARNES:  They are. </p><p>MACDONALD:  They're both businessmen, they're not part of the classical  political system. Both were elected on the first try. It seems like these  two men have a lot in common. So we've got the D.C. media up in arms  saying, you know, this is again it's going to be problems here with the  state visit, certainly with Angela Merkel, they're raising the red flags  about it. What do you see? </p><p>BARNES:  Well, look, I'll tell you what the media really wants and they're  going to hound poor Macron while he's here. They want him to dump on Trump  and he is refusing to do it, wouldn't be smart to do it. </p><p>MACDONALD:  How are they going -- how are they going to get the French  president to dump on President Trump? </p><p>BARNES:  Well, he's going to have a press conference among other things,  they'll yell questions at him, and look, they have ways to get that  question asked, but Macron is I think not going to do it. What purpose of  his would it serve? He says he's here to deal with the president of the  United States. He doesn't have to and doesn't have to comment personally on  Trump. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what, to your point, Fred, and it's an important one.  The media again, is misreading the situation.</p><p>BARNES:  I think so.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Macron likes his relationship with Trump because it improves  his own basically rookie standing with the E.U. He's now being called the  Trump whisperer. Macron is not going to damage that. He's not going to  damage how important he is now to the E.U. given his relationship with  Trump. </p><p>BARNES:  I think you're absolutely right. It serves his purpose very well.  Now, will Macron be able to talk Trump into not getting out of the Iran  deal, will he be able to talk him to getting into Paris climate accord? I  don't think so on either one of those things, but he'll get credit for  trying. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Fred Barnes. Great stuff. Come back soon. </p><p>BARNES:  OK.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now let's get to this fast moving stock as Google parent  Alphabet reporting strong earnings and revenue after the bell. It's been  doing that every quarter since 2010. The stock is moving after-hours.  another great quarter for Google. But now, this. A new report Google does  get more personal information about you than even Facebook, as Deirdre  Bolton just said 8 to 10 times of Facebook. We're going to show you the  details.</p><p>We're also monitoring that Senate foreign relationships vote of Mike Pompeo  as secretary of state. Rand Paul breaking news here, just putting out he  will vote for Michael Pompeo, when the vote comes we're going to bring it  to you. Liberal newspapers now supporting Pompeo. We're going to show who.</p><p>But first, we're also watching President Trump and the first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife at the White House for the  administration's first official state dinner. We're going to bring that to  you live as well, jam-packed hour, really busy hour ahead, don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Back to this breaking news. We are monitoring French President  Emmanuel Macron he's about to appear at the White House any second, but the  first lady and the president will greet the French president and Mrs.  Macron at the White House.</p><p>Let's bring in Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor Katrina Pierson. It's a  historic visit, Katrina, now even President Macron effectively saying you  know what? President is the president to the American people, he's giving  that message the American people will deal with it. He's the president. </p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISOR:  Absolutely. This truly is a  refreshing display of leadership. You have two leaders who don't agree 100  percent on all of the policy positions but who have become friends and  respect each other as leaders and now we're here having a great visit. I  fully expect President Macron to make his case, with regards to trade and  Syria and Iraq. But here, I mean, Iran.</p><p>So here is the thing. President Trump is going to consider the president of  France as counsel absolutely as a courtesy, Liz. But let's make no mistake.  The president of the United States will be making policy for the United  States so I think this is a great opportunity for many in our own country  to see how elected leaders should act.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, to your point, it's well taken. Because the thinking  in the E.U. as President Macron is the leading edge of that wedge to get  the president to step back on the Iran deal, dial back on, you know, the  tariffs, and the potential trade wars, and also climate change. But your  point is President Trump is not going to do that, right? </p><p>PIERSON:  No, I don't think so because these are things that the president  has hold very dear and we've seen it throughout the campaign. You can go  all the way back to the 80s on some of these positions. But I do think he  would consider the counsel, but at the same time the president has made a  commitment to the United States and that is to put America and its people  first. That is not going to change. And I think the president of France  respects the president's opinion as well.</p><p>And when we look at the things like Iran, for example, the president was  very adamant on making some significant changes, things that a lot of  people agree with, regardless of how we entered this deal. We have a new  leader of the United States and he wants to have input. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So again, we're monitoring this situation unfolding right now  at the White House. You're looking at a live action shot of the White  House, the president of France with the first lady of France expected to  appear momentarily to greet the president and first lady Melania Trump. </p><p>President Macron to your point, Katrina, is expected to press President  Trump on trade. Here is what he said over the weekend. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACRON:  You cannot make it through the wall with the allies, it's too  complicated. If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade war  against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against them,  come on, it doesn't work. You need ally. We are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, so here is the messaging problem right for the president?  Katrina, he's got to say listen we're not talking about trade war. We're  talking about fair trade and the E.U. needs to get that message China has  not been fair. Go ahead. </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, absolutely, and we keep hearing that the president is doing  this to everyone else when in fact, everyone else has done this to the  United States and the president is simply saying look, we need fair and  reciprocal trade. </p><p>At the end of the day that's what going to matter. Many people in our own  country have doubted his ability to make these deals and to get things  done, but if you look at ISIS and tax reform he's even been bringing North  Korea to the table. So the president is actually doing things right. It  might be different, but we're actually getting things done. </p><p>And I think President Macron is going to get to hear President Trump's  position on these things as well. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Here is an unfolding breaking news situation and it's happening  right now with Russia and Iran as it pertains to the E.U. Katrina, to your  point, record amounts of U.S. oil is now flooding into E.U. markets, that  deal with Iran that Obama struck, there's a May 12 deadline that is looming  the president could yank what he says is the worst deal ever and impose  sanctions.</p><p>Again, Iran is backed by Russia, Russia supplies a lot of oil and Nat gas  to the E.U. We are just hearing the breaking news that the U.S. is now  becoming the number one oil exporter into the E.U changing geopolitical  landscape in the favor of the U.S. right here, Katrina. </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, and that's exactly what we call making America great again,  and President Trump knows one thing and that is leverage. He wrote about  it. And he knows and the world knows that if the president was to pull out  of the Iran deal, perhaps go back to the sanctions on the Iran central bank  or oil exports it's going to be a problem. </p><p>But these are things like, you know, looking at including the long range  missiles and you know, eliminating the sunset provision on things like I  don't know, you're reaching -- enriching uranium which is a huge problem  for Iran.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>PIERSON:  And the president of France they need to understand is we don't  see the dust to France chance coming out of Iran like we see coming from  Iran to America.</p><p>MACDONALD:  To you--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PIERSON:  And President Trump takes that very seriously.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, they are now as you can see at the White House raising  the welcoming flags 15 months into his presidency, the president is finally  rolling out the red carpet for the president of France and what will happen  after Macron appears they will go for a sunset dinner on the terrace of  George Washington's home in Mount Vernon overlooking the Potomac. </p><p>Katrina, Macron is expected to, to your point, really prep the president on  the Iran deal. He is the leader, he's seen by the E.U. as the Trump whisper  that he can basically coax the president into staying in the Iran deal.  Macron, though, watch this, Katrina, admitting though that that deal as the  president has said has flaws. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACRON:  It this as if agreement perfect and this JCPOA a perfect thing for  our relationship with Iran, no. But for nuclear, what do you have as a  better option? I don't see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  The car is now rolling up with the leader of France so Macron  says that they would finish the war against ISIS. If we leave, we leave it  open to Iran and Syria, they are going to fuel a new terrorist war. What  are your thoughts? </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, I think President Trump is also coming at this from a  different perspective. You know, we've had this, that we've been doing the  same thing over and over again expecting different results and President  Trump doesn't want to do that anymore and he's not saying end it  altogether, he wants to make revisions. </p><p>And now that we see that they're cracking down on anti-government  protesters that's a problem particularly if we're just going to sit back  and allow this to happen not really knowing what's going on. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Let me break in here. The president is just stepping  outside the White House with the first lady ready to greet the president of  France, and Mrs. Macron as well. Tomorrow night there will be a state  dinner and a break with tradition, President Trump has invited no Democrat  members of Congress or journalists. About 150 guests will take their seats  in the state ding room tomorrow night. </p><p>It's going to be a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack  Obama. Obama's guest list went into the hundreds and the president really  wants to keep this close relationship. And here he is, the president of  France greeting and a hug with the president of the United States. Let's  watch this and let this moment sink in. </p><p>OK, Katrina, what we're watching now is a warm embrace between the leader  of France and his wife is with the leader of the United States. It looks  really quite collegial; they are now turning for the official photograph. </p><p>Katrina, Trump seems, the president seems to be going all out on pomp and  circumstance. That's how much he had in Paris last July when the president  of France invited him to watch the annual Bastille Day. What's your  reaction to rolling out the red carpet for the president of France? </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, it is Donald Trump, Liz, so I think we can fully expect the  best with the president and Melania who, you know, is a class act in and of  her own. I mean, it's just an amazing opportunity for us to all see what  we're seeing right now and that is, you know, refreshing leadership,  bringing two countries together, even though they have their differences,  willing to work together for what they do agree upon. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Our allies, Katrina, for 50 years. Katrina Pierson, thank you  so much for weighing in there. I really appreciate it.</p><p>PIERSON:  Great to be here. Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We're also monitoring this breaking developing situation,  we're moments away from the Senate foreign relations vote on the nomination  of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Not the final  confirmation the full chamber is expected to vote for Pompeo. A rebuke  tough, Senate foreign relations don't want him. We're going to bring you  that breaking news as it comes in. Don't go away, stay with us, more after  the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS:  At some point, Democrats have to decide whether they love this  country more than they hate this president, and they have to decide that  they want to put the safety and the security and the diplomacy of our  country ahead of their own political games, and we're very hopeful that  they will. </p><p>Mike Pompeo is a highly qualified individual. He's been one of the leading  people when it comes to the negotiations and the conversations with North  Korea, and to stop that would be a incredibly dangerous and damaging for  our country and for the world. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We're staying in breaking news mode. We've got more  developments, look at this. Republican Senator Jeff Flake now a yes on the  nomination. He will vote yes that Pompeo should be secretary of state with  Rand Paul. That means the Senate foreign relations panel is doing a 180. </p><p>Instead of rebuking this nomination it looks like the Senate foreign  relations panel will confirm Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p>Let's bring in the Daily Caller editorial director, Vince Coglianese. What  a turn around, Vince? </p><p>VINCE COGLIANESE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, DAILY CALLER:  That's quite a change of  events. Rand Paul, of course the big hold out, you mentioned Jeff Flake as  well, but Rand Paul, the president saying in public that he wanted to see  Rand come with him, and that is happening, that's a huge deal. </p><p>And it's important that the Senate foreign relations committee do this,  give him a stamp of approval given the unheard-of nature of sending out  somebody with disapproval to be voted on by the full Senate approve. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's right. Let's get to the viewer, he comes out of  Senate foreign relations, it looks like the Senate foreign relations panel  does vote yes saying, yes, Pompeo should be the next secretary of state.  Then it goes to the full Senate where Pompeo is expected to be confirmed as  secretary of state. </p><p>You know, here's the thing, initially, Vince, the storyline was that, you  know, they didn't like Pompeo's position on Iran.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  They thought he was too much of a hawk. He was supposed to be  the easy confirmation. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes</p><p>MACDONALD:  He was supposed to be the no-brainer, and all of a sudden he  was a problem that even Democrats and Republicans who voted for him as CIA  director were saying, no, we don't want him as secretary of state in the  middle of the North Korea breakthroughs. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Right. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I mean, it is a stunning, you know, revelation of what's going  on in D.C. when you have historic developments going on with North Korea.  And they're saying no to Pompeo when he's trying to strike these deals. Go  ahead.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes. And it was a temper tantrum that lead them to that  conclusion, and I say that because this was a referendum on Trump. And all  of the assessments that we've heard from Democrats it was about -- it was  about Mike Pompeo's insufficient because he's not going to rein in Trump's  worth instincts. </p><p>There's no evidence for that. As the head of the CIA, he's had an  unblemished career there, he's had a good career prior to that as well. He  was, as you said, confirmed by the Senate to run the CIA before including  with Democratic support, and now he's got the opportunity to be secretary  of state. </p><p>And there's such an important resume item there for Mike Pompeo, and you  mentioned it. It's the fact that he's leading negotiations with North  Korea. This is an historic moment in terms of just having a U.S. official  leading such a high-level negotiation with North Korea. </p><p>To throw him out, to get rid of him as secretary of state would be a  preposterous exercise in politics--</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  -- and one the Democrats should not suffer right now because  if they do, they will suffer politically in the future politically for  making such a horrendous decision. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, historians and analysts have already said if the  president gets that North Korea deal, it will be on the level of  Reagan/Gorbachev. </p><p>We have three liberal newspapers saying, you know what? Obstructionist  Democrats, stop. You have to put Pompeo in as secretary of state. The  president needs be a secretary of state. They are, USA Today, a writer at  the Washington Post, and the New York Daily News. Your final reaction,  Vince. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Well, only that Barack Obama was given a Nobel Peace prize the  moment he came into office for doing nothing. If this is accomplished, as  you were mentioning, a peaceful North Korea of any kind, a meaningful peace  and one that draws down nuclear weapons, then I expect that Donald Trump  will receive a nomination for it, not that the Nobel Prize committee will  ever seriously consider him. </p><p>He's not exactly beloved by the globalist communist, but Mike Pompeo should  be right up there on that stage accepting the same thing. We have a long  way to go before we get there, but this is a big deal, and Mike Pompeo  should clear the bar at the United States Senate. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Great to see you, Vince. </p><p>Let's take you back to the White House. A truly lovely event is about to  be, take place right now. The two couples will plant a tree. It's a gift  from the president and president of France and Mrs. Macron they are going  to plant a tree, a sapling, a European oak on the South Lawn of the White  House about four and a half feet tall. </p><p>We're going to bring that to you live as it happens. Interesting note here,  First lady Melania Trump is really taking the lead here in organizing this  historic visit. </p><p>Quick, we're going to have more after the break. Also we're staying on the  situation in Toronto, that van plowing down pedestrians. Nine dead, 17  injured, seven critically. We're going to bring you the latest on that. A  suspect has been arrested. No motive yet. We will bring that to you live.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The nightmare, I've got to Yonge, and I've seen a lady  with her leg -- man, it was a gruesome scene. It's really bad out there. I  couldn't believe what I've seen, man. It was, man. Everybody, all these  people on the streets getting hit one by one. Post office boxes getting  crumpled up on people. And one person got dragged on and their blood is all  over Yonge. It's really bad out there, man. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We are basically are watching the president with the first  lady and the leader of France and the first lady of France now stepping out  of the portico, the White House. They're now going to enter the South Lawn. </p><p>There's first lady Melania right there. She's been organizing this historic  state visit. It is the White House's first state visit 15 months into the  Trump presidency. </p><p>They're going to plant a tree on the South Lawn. It is a gift from France  to the United States. It is a European oak sapling, four and a half feet  tall. </p><p>We have lieutenant general Thomas McInerney here. Sir, this is a developing  situation as well. General, the E.U. is look to the president of France to  coax President Donald Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. Your  reaction. </p><p>THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE:  Well, it's natural, and  they send President Macron over here to use him because he probably has the  best relationship of any of the European leaders right now, so I'm not  surprise. I do not think the president is going to change. He knows what he  wants to do. </p><p>The Europeans on the Iranian deal, it's purely a cash cow. They're ignoring  the nuclear threat per se. It's cash. They've got a huge trade surplus  going, and they're working it to their advantage. But that's not good  enough. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, it seems when you read, study what the president of  France, general, has been saying about ISIS leaving Syria and Iran's  growing presence with military bases in Syria, on the one hand the  president of France is saying as soon as -- if we leave, if we, the United  States, leave Syria, Iran will step in and cause terrorist activities to go  on the increase. </p><p>But at the same time, he wants the president to stay in the Iran nuclear  deal. Can you square this for the viewer, can you explain that and sort  that out? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Yes, I'll make it very simple. We should stay with the limited  number of people in Syria with 24/7 air power, so if they try to take over  any of the Kurdish places or the Syrian allies, then we can use that air  power to beat them down and to defeat them. </p><p>Now, as far as the nuclear deal goes, that was such a bad deal that no  agreement should ever have been made, the JCPOA, Liz. And we should back  out of that from both a military and a political point of view. Again,  remember, the European Union's interest is primarily in trade. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Let me just give you some background information about the tree  that was just planted. There is historic information about the reason that  France gave the United States and the White House this tree. </p><p>Over 9,000 American marines died in World War I in what's called the  Belleau Wood, this tree is from the area of that battle in June 1918 where  9,000 American marines died in World War I. That as far is a memorial site.  It's an important symbol of the sacrifice the United States made to insure  peace and stability in Europe.</p><p>General, your reaction to the president of France giving this oak tree to  the United States in commemoration of World War I marines dying there. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Liz, it's very, very symbolic. The Battle of Belleau Wood was a  horrendous battle. We lost, as you said, 9,000 marines. And to make this  tree come from that region really touches on our relationship. And I think  it is a very symbolic gesture by President Macron and symbolic of the  relationship between the president and President Trump. </p><p>MACDONALD:  What does this do for the psyche of the Trump administration,  to have these memorable events come up and in the ensuing days? This will  be a three-day visit, the president of Germany -- Germany, rather, Angela  Merkel will be coming on Friday. How does this set the scene for the  presidency of Donald Trump? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, I think it establishes it on a high note. People are  seeing the way the Trumps handle their visitors and the relationships  developing. The left has always wanted to deny that President Trump had  that capability. He's absolutely brilliant at it. You're seeing it today  and you'll see it at dinner tonight at Mount Vernon and the state dinner  they have. </p><p>The whole three days that the Macrons are here and how they're honored is  going to show the world and the American people what a great leader  President Trump and Mrs. Trump are. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We will be covering the Chancellor of Germany's visit, Angela  Merkel as well, coming later this week. Good to see you, general. Thanks  for coming in. I really appreciate it. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Thank, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We are moments away from that Senate foreign relations vote on  the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Breaking  news, it looks like that Senate panel will vote for Mike Pompeo to be  secretary of state. </p><p>Jeff Flake and Rand Paul now saying they will vote for Michael Pompeo as  secretary of state. </p><p>We're going to take you back to Toronto, van mowed down nine people, and  injuring 16, killing nine in Toronto. We're going to bring you the latest  on that after the break. Don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Being confirm for you tonight, right now, we have nine  people that are dead. Sixteen that are injured. Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources, and I can assure the public all our  available resources have been brought in to address this tragic situation. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Take you to the developments in Toronto. Driver now in custody  after plowing a van into a crowd leaving nine people dead, sixteen injured,  seven critically. Toronto authorities held the press conference just  moments ago. We still do not know the driver's identity and his motive, we  will bring that to you as soon as it comes in. </p><p>General, listen, we have seen numerous van attacks like this and vehicular  attacks, a dozen since 2006, general. We've seen them in England, we've  seen them in Germany and Spain. And, of course, in Canada, as well as the  U.S. Your reaction, sir. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, it looks like a cookie cutter, Liz. By the rental van,  the number of people -- nine dead and 16 injured -- all the makings of  radical Islam. All I need to know is the driver's name and a little more  background, but I would say there's a 90 percent chance that this is  radical Islam. It wasn't an old man that had a heart attack or a stroke. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Again, we don't know the motive just yet. But we do know the  facts about prior vehicular attacks. Let's talk about that. Again, we don't  know the motive in Toronto. </p><p>General, you know, the terror capability has shifted. It is very difficult  for terrorists -- we're not saying this is terrorism -- it's difficult for  them to get bombs and explosives. It is easy for them to do vehicular  attacks. Your reaction to that. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, that's exactly what ISIS is telling their warriors across  the world, use vehicular attacks. And you can see all the ones that they've  done in the last year rather than explosives or even weapons, although  London are getting a lot of knives over there. But the fact is that is now  their modus operandi, and it's something that we should be cognizant of,  and it's very, very difficult to stop, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, and to your point, the days of the terror cell are  over. Now I think, to your point, terrorists -- and, again, we don't know  the motives of this attack. It has the hallmark of a terrorist attack.  Again, we'll bring you the motive as soon as it breaks. </p><p>To your point, general, you have said this before, ISIS and radical  terrorist leaders are saying stay in place and do your own terrorism. This  is a form of micro terrorism, right? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Exactly. And it's the patterns of behavior that I look at,  that's my business, patterns of behavior. And this is what you're seeing  now spread across all the cities in Europe as well as the United States in  New York City, for instance, where you are. And so this is what we must  expect, and it's extremely difficult to counter this. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, it's a senseless act of violence. What do you say to  the viewer out there, you know, these are just pedestrians walking on one  of Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, it's just near downtown Toronto. Are we  supposed to be having security barricades on every major block in every  urban area, every city? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  They would like that, but we're not going to do that. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Why would they like that? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Because that means the western world is being influenced by the  radical Islamists, to their way of thinking. They are putting control on  what we do just like when we go to an airport and all the checks we go  through. They like that. </p><p>But the fact is we've got to defeat this Islamic terrorism where the  ideology comes from, Mecca and Medina from the Middle East, and that's the  Muslims themselves. They must do that. And I'm hopeful that the new crown  prince of Saudi Arabia will be the leader against the radical Islamists in  his region so that they are no longer holy warriors and will go to paradise  for killing infidels. No, we must destroy that ideology. </p><p>MACDONALD:  It should be noted too that in Toronto a group of seven  security international meeting was occurring just up -- a few blocks away  from that terror attack. If we think -- let me back up, we don't know if  it's a terror attack, it has the hallmarks of that. Sir, you know, what are  the authorities asking this suspect right now? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, first of all, they want to get his name, and then you  want to get where he goes to church, what his basic beliefs are, what is  the reason he did this. If one person was killed, fine, that happens. But  not nine people. Not nine people. </p><p>MACDONALD:  General, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in  and handling two stories. I really appreciate it. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Again, we're going to take you back to the White House. This is  -- we're in breaking news mode. The president and first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and the first lady of France, they're  about to leave for Mount Vernon for a dinner overlooking at the Potomac. We  will bring it to you live. That is the home of George Washington.</p><p>And we're also moments away from that vote out of the Senate panel on the  nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. It looks like  that panel will vote for Mike Pompeo. Jeff Flake and Rand Paul saying yes  to Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p>But first, after Facebook's data breach scandal, other big tech companies  like Google could be next to face scrutiny over its data privacy practices.  We're on that story for you coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  After Facebook's data breach and data mining scandal, other big  tech companies like Google they are now in the hot seat over their data  privacy practices. A new report shows Google is way worse than Facebook at  collecting and keeping your personal information. They've been  cyberstalking you all over the internet even if you're not on Google's web  site for something else. </p><p>Let's take a look at how the stock of -- the stock of Google's parent  company Alphabet did after their company reporting slide to the downside,  and falling to less than 1 percent after hours. </p><p>Let's get to the panel on this. I want to bring in Danielle McLaughlin and  Kelsey Harkness. First to you, Kelsey, you know what's the creepiest part  of the story? It's that this Silicon Valley stalks you all over the  internet even though you're not on their web sites. That's the worse part  of the story. I don't think people realize that, Kelsey. </p><p>KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR REPORTER, DAILY SIGNAL:  Well, the level of outrage  directed at Google and Facebook is certainly understandable, but it's  really not surprising because Google and Facebook are billion dollar  companies--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, but isn't it creepy that Silicon Valley has all of the  information about what we're doing on the internet? </p><p>HARKNESS:  It's certainly creepy which is why Americans are upset about  this, but it's not surprising because they're not providing these services  for free. But I think what's important about these stories is that we don't  direct our anger towards the government and ask the government to regulate  the tech industry because the government, too, is collecting our personal  data. </p><p>Look at the CFBP, look at OPM, both of them had big, massive breaches. So  we need to let the free market solve this, we need to demand that tech  companies take it upon themselves to solve this and not get the government  involved in an area it really doesn't belong. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I used to be kind of OK with it, Danielle, and say, OK, you  know. But now I'm thinking, wait, this isn't good. To Kelsey's point, the  IRS has also had data breaches. The IRS knows a lot about our income. And  now Silicon Valley, Danielle knows too much about what we're doing on the  internet. I think it's kind of weird. </p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST:  It is weird, and it is a little  bit creepy, to your point. I think we have to make a decision societally  about who is going to regulate this. I take Kelsey's point about the notion  of the free market solving for this, but the free market hasn't solved for  this, and that's why we're in this position in the first place. </p><p>I actually do think that more like Europe -- which has very robust privacy  laws -- we should ask your government who are elected representative to  step in and make sure that these billion, trillion dollar companies in  Silicon Valley aren't just data mining. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Guys, I'm so sorry, we've got to break away because that Senate  vote on Mike Pompeo coming in, Rand Paul just now explaining why he changed  his vote. Let's listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAND PAUL, (R) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  I decided to go ahead and vote for  Director Pompeo because he's assured me that he's learned the lesson. Now,  time will tell if those assurances are true or not. And I won't say that --  I can say with absolute certainty I know what his opinions will be and how  they will come out over time, but I do take him at his word. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So they're about to vote, Kelsey, what's your reaction to this  180 out of Senate foreign relations now after that. Now the breaking news  it will, that panel will approve Mike Pompeo as secretary of state? What's  your reaction to the 180 here? </p><p>HARKNESS:  I think it's very good news. I think that it maybe appears  normal to a lot of Americans to hear that all Democrats are opposing  Pompeo's nomination, but this is not normal. Under the Obama administration  94 senators approved both Hillary Clinton and John Kerry for the same  position and, clearly, those are very divisive figures. </p><p>Mike Pompeo is very qualified to do this job and at a time when we are  about to enter into serious negotiations with North Korea, President Trump  needs a secretary of state by his side. </p><p>MACDONALD:  What do you think, Danielle? </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I do agree that we need a secretary of state at this very  crucial time in North Korea relations. What Rand Paul asked of Mike Pompeo  was two things, do you agree that war in the Middle East, more war in the  Middle East is destabilizing, number one, and number two, do you agree that  Iraq was a mistake? He got those reassurances from Mike Pompeo, and that's  what changed his vote. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Interesting. The vote is now underway. We're staying on top of  the vote. Final thought, Kelsey. </p><p>HARKNESS:  I think that this is good news for all Americans. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Kelsey and Danielle, thank you so much. We're up against a  hard break. The president and the president of France about to arrive at  Mount Vernon. We're going to stay on that story for you as well. Jam-packed  hour, don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. The Senate foreign relations committee now  voting for Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. Jeff Flake is yes, so as  Rand Paul. It goes to the full chamber for a vote where he is expected to  be confirmed as secretary of state. </p><p>We're also are waiting for President Trump and the first lady, the French  President Emmanuel Macron and his wife. They're headed to Mount Vernon, the  home of George Washington to have dinner overlooking the Potomac.</p><p>That does it for us. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources and I can assure the public all available  resources have been brought into address this tragic situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ELIZABETH MACDONALD, HOST, FOX NEWS:  Breaking news to the developing  situation in Toronto, a driver now in custody after plowing a van into a  crowd among Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, nine dead, 16 injured 17  critically. </p><p> I am Elizabeth MacDonald. This is Risk &amp; Reward. </p><p> The mayor of Toronto authorities just now holding a press conference, the  mayor saying it will likely be several days of disruption to the area  during the investigation. </p><p> Here with more let's get to Kristina Partsinevelos in the newsroom.  Kristina? </p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Yes, this event only  happened a few hours ago at 1.30 p.m. Eastern Time. A white van from the  company Ryder, it's a rental van company plowed on to the sidewalk, what  you're seeing right now, started to hit a few pedestrians. According to eye  witnesses the pedestrians asked the van to stop, the driver continued going  hitting more pedestrians. </p><p> And as you mentioned there are nine dead, 16 injured. There's still no word  yet about the motivation behind this van attack. You had the mayor just  speak very recently, the Mayor of Toronto that's John Tory, and he said we  are admired the around the world for being inclusive doesn't want anybody  to jump to conclusions just yet as to the motive behind this attack. </p><p> Very importantly to note as well, this is the remaining a Toronto  investigation not a national investigation with the RCMP, the Royal  Canadian Mountain Police, again, this is a Toronto investigation they are  not releasing the name of the driver of the van but they were able to bring  him into custody. </p><p> He seemed uninjured based off of several eye witness videos that I've seen  when they caught him, he happened to have something in his hand. There's  still no confirmation what he was carrying but he was pointing it at a  police officer. There were no shots fired. </p><p> Again, this man is in custody. We do not have any details just yet on who  he is, what his motivation is, are the Toronto police are being very  careful right now with the information, making sure going through to see if  he had any cell phones looking through his records to see most importantly  if he is somebody that they recognize, that they know and could be  affiliated with other people, but right now this is a Toronto  investigation. </p><p> You have several, 16 people still injured and businesses that have been  damaged along the road because this white van went up on to the sidewalk,  hit pedestrians, even rammed into a bus station. There was one eye witness  that said he saw his family they're looking for their grandfather and  they're very worried and I was just listening to this live through Canadian  media that they found the grandfather's glasses on the ground and so  they're still waiting confirmation. </p><p> Several of the patients or victims have been brought to Sunny Brook  Hospital in Toronto, again Sunny Brook Hospital, so again we have nine  dead, 16 injured in this tragic event that's happening in Toronto as we  speak. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Thank you, Kristina. We'll be staying on top of that story and  much more. </p><p> Let's get to your money. A widely held stock making lots of 401k plans  going up. Google parent company Alphabet reporting solid earnings and  revenues better than expected after the bell. </p><p> Let's get to Deirdre Bolton on the latest with that. Deirdre? </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Hey, Liz. So after-hours, you are  going to see this stock kind of see sawing back and forth. So it had a big  reaction as you mentioned, Alphabet, Google exceeding both on the top and  bottom line and you had a jump of around 4 percent initially, so you can  see still higher. </p><p> But just coming off those posted session highs, there are still some really  big questions out there, Liz, for the long term of this company. You know,  Google has between eight to 10 times more data on you and on me than  Facebook so a lot of Facebook investors were saying hey, how come Mark  Zuckerberg got dragged before Congress? </p><p> Google has about eight gigabytes of data per person, that equals about  2,000 hours if we just listen straight through of music. If you want a  comparison point Facebook has about 650 megabytes which are smaller than  gigabytes and that equals about 160 hours of music. So just an interesting  kind of data point and it just shows you where this data power is. </p><p> A lot of people are saying Google is one of a kind so if you are an  investor you like to hear that. The flip side is, will it make regulators  consider one of a kind akin to monopoly which is not too far of a stretch.</p><p> We do know that the European regulators are putting in new privacy laws as  of May 25th of this year so tech companies, ones that are based here but  have customers in Europe, need to be compliant. If these companies are not  compliant this is not a small slap on the wrist, Liz, it is between $30  million or 4 percent of annual revenue whichever is higher, so there's a  lot of people saying OK, Google has a lot of work ahead. Alphabet Google,  excuse me. Liz?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Deirdre. Thank you so much.</p><p> We have a jam packed busy hour ahead. We are moments away from President  Trump and the first lady welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and his  wife at the White House for the administration's first official state  dinner.</p><p> Let's get to Blake Burman with the latest. Blake? </p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  At the hour the French president  has a busy couple of days here in Washington, Liz. I think you can see  behind me that they are expecting Emmanuel Macron here at the White House  within the next few minutes or so. </p><p> The itinerary is as follows. The Macron family, him and his wife, rather,  and the president and first lady will head to dinner tonight to George  Washington's home followed by talks tomorrow, a state dinner and then he  addresses Congress on Wednesday. </p><p> The White House says these two have a great rapport, and part of the reason  why he's receiving the first state visit. However, it is also clear that  there are stark differences on a policy level, for example, there are trade  issues at hand, as well as different views on the Iran nuclear deal and the  Paris climate accord all will be discussed in the up upcoming days. </p><p> As we await Macron here at the White House, the White House as well also  has its eyes on the goings up on Capitol Hill as it relates to the Senate  foreign relations committee as the secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo  is set to get the thumbs down from the Senate foreign relations committee  it appears within the next few minutes or so.</p><p> All 10 Democrats plus the Republican Rand Paul expected to vote against  Pompeo to become the next secretary of state; however, Pompeo still  expected to get a vote on the Senate floor and there it appears as though  as if he will have the numbers to become the next secretary of state. </p><p> Today, two more Democrats came to his side saying that they would support  him, Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly, add to that Heidi Heitkamp to that group  as well. </p><p> The White House is trying to make the argument to the United States Senate  that if you voted for John Kerry and if you voted for Hillary Clinton, then  you should vote for Mike Pompeo as well. The White House press secretary  Sarah Sanders saying what's going on, on Capitol Hill sends this message to  the rest of the world.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What it says to the  world is what we've been saying for a long time, the Senate has got some  real problems, namely to figure out how to actually show up and do their  job a little bit better. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Now if Pompeo is voted down by the Senate foreign relations  committee, Liz, that would be the first time that would ever happen to a  secretary of state nominee if they eventually go on to become in that  position. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Wow, historic times, Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And by the way both Democrats and Republicans voted for Pompeo  as CIA director. </p><p> BURMAN:  Yes, CIA director.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  You as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senate foreign relations committee, as Blake Burman just noted  is about -- they are about to vote on Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state.  Rand Paul tweeting out he will support the nomination he was against it. </p><p> Last month President Trump announced the departure of Rex Tillerson as  secretary of state and as nomination of Pompeo as the replacement. Now the  thinking is if it gets to the full chamber Pompeo will become the secretary  of state. Just going through this process right now, we're monitoring the  vote for you in the beginning.</p><p> Let's get to what's going on with the French visit. The media says this is  going to be a bad relationship. Got off to a rocky start but now, French  President Macron even taking a line from President Trump ahead of today's  state visit to the White House. Watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE We have this very special relationship  because both of us are probably the maverick of the system, on both sides I  think President Trump's election was unexpected in your country, and  probably my election wasn't expected in my country, and we are not part of  the political system. I'm here to serve my people and my country and make  it great again, somebody I know very well could say, but that's it, that's  the whole story. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Joining me now, Weekly Standard executive editor, Fred Barnes.  Fred, make France great again, did you hear that? </p><p> FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes, look, Macron, this  is, he is so sure, so smart, so likable, and Trump is just basking in and  he's getting everything he wants and Macron fought a big war and he wants  to make sure that Trump doesn't get out of the Iran nuclear deal and that  he gets back in the Paris accord, I think not much chance for that. </p><p> But he is smart. He is the big European leader who has stepped forward to  embrace Trump, not endorse him but give Trump somebody big to deal with. It  isn't going to be England, it isn't going to be what's the name, Angela  Merkel in Germany comes in I think on Friday and that's just a bit of a  sour puss and doesn't get along with Trump. But Macron has made an effort  here and it's very wise on his part. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, here is the thing. We've got that May 12 deadline for  the Iran deal. </p><p> BARNES:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  The president is expected to yank it saying he already said  this is the worst deal ever. So, and you're right, we've got Angela Merkel  coming in. You know, Fred, these state visits are coming at a time when  economic growth is up, optimism is up, the media reporting how the  Democrats may take back control of the House. </p><p> The president seems to be dominating the message, when people go to vote  they say, what are you going to do for me? </p><p> BARNES:  Yes, look, I wouldn't buy this line from the Democrats and from a  lot of people in the media that there's a blue wave coming and Democrats  are just going to sweep through and win the House and maybe the Senate in  November. </p><p> They do very well that would be what happens historically in the first mid- term election for a new president, but Trump is the dominant figure here  and he has got some very optimistic things to talk about, not just the  economy but in foreign policy as well. </p><p> Look, Macron was one of those who joined in the attack on the plants in  Syria where they mix and made the poisonous product that were used to kill  so many Syrians, so look, they worked together before and I think they'll  work together again, particularly here. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Macron has pointed out that they're both maverick  outsiders. </p><p> BARNES:  They are. </p><p> MACDONALD:  They're both businessmen, they're not part of the classical  political system. Both were elected on the first try. It seems like these  two men have a lot in common. So we've got the D.C. media up in arms  saying, you know, this is again it's going to be problems here with the  state visit, certainly with Angela Merkel, they're raising the red flags  about it. What do you see? </p><p> BARNES:  Well, look, I'll tell you what the media really wants and they're  going to hound poor Macron while he's here. They want him to dump on Trump  and he is refusing to do it, wouldn't be smart to do it. </p><p> MACDONALD:  How are they going -- how are they going to get the French  president to dump on President Trump? </p><p> BARNES:  Well, he's going to have a press conference among other things,  they'll yell questions at him, and look, they have ways to get that  question asked, but Macron is I think not going to do it. What purpose of  his would it serve? He says he's here to deal with the president of the  United States. He doesn't have to and doesn't have to comment personally on  Trump. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know what, to your point, Fred, and it's an important one.  The media again, is misreading the situation.</p><p> BARNES:  I think so.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Macron likes his relationship with Trump because it improves  his own basically rookie standing with the E.U. He's now being called the  Trump whisperer. Macron is not going to damage that. He's not going to  damage how important he is now to the E.U. given his relationship with  Trump. </p><p> BARNES:  I think you're absolutely right. It serves his purpose very well.  Now, will Macron be able to talk Trump into not getting out of the Iran  deal, will he be able to talk him to getting into Paris climate accord? I  don't think so on either one of those things, but he'll get credit for  trying. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Fred Barnes. Great stuff. Come back soon. </p><p> BARNES:  OK.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now let's get to this fast moving stock as Google parent  Alphabet reporting strong earnings and revenue after the bell. It's been  doing that every quarter since 2010. The stock is moving after-hours.  another great quarter for Google. But now, this. A new report Google does  get more personal information about you than even Facebook, as Deirdre  Bolton just said 8 to 10 times of Facebook. We're going to show you the  details.</p><p> We're also monitoring that Senate foreign relationships vote of Mike Pompeo  as secretary of state. Rand Paul breaking news here, just putting out he  will vote for Michael Pompeo, when the vote comes we're going to bring it  to you. Liberal newspapers now supporting Pompeo. We're going to show who.</p><p> But first, we're also watching President Trump and the first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife at the White House for the  administration's first official state dinner. We're going to bring that to  you live as well, jam-packed hour, really busy hour ahead, don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Back to this breaking news. We are monitoring French President  Emmanuel Macron he's about to appear at the White House any second, but the  first lady and the president will greet the French president and Mrs.  Macron at the White House.</p><p> Let's bring in Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor Katrina Pierson. It's a  historic visit, Katrina, now even President Macron effectively saying you  know what? President is the president to the American people, he's giving  that message the American people will deal with it. He's the president. </p><p> KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISOR:  Absolutely. This truly is a  refreshing display of leadership. You have two leaders who don't agree 100  percent on all of the policy positions but who have become friends and  respect each other as leaders and now we're here having a great visit. I  fully expect President Macron to make his case, with regards to trade and  Syria and Iraq. But here, I mean, Iran.</p><p> So here is the thing. President Trump is going to consider the president of  France as counsel absolutely as a courtesy, Liz. But let's make no mistake.  The president of the United States will be making policy for the United  States so I think this is a great opportunity for many in our own country  to see how elected leaders should act.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, to your point, it's well taken. Because the thinking  in the E.U. as President Macron is the leading edge of that wedge to get  the president to step back on the Iran deal, dial back on, you know, the  tariffs, and the potential trade wars, and also climate change. But your  point is President Trump is not going to do that, right? </p><p> PIERSON:  No, I don't think so because these are things that the president  has hold very dear and we've seen it throughout the campaign. You can go  all the way back to the 80s on some of these positions. But I do think he  would consider the counsel, but at the same time the president has made a  commitment to the United States and that is to put America and its people  first. That is not going to change. And I think the president of France  respects the president's opinion as well.</p><p> And when we look at the things like Iran, for example, the president was  very adamant on making some significant changes, things that a lot of  people agree with, regardless of how we entered this deal. We have a new  leader of the United States and he wants to have input. </p><p> MACDONALD:  So again, we're monitoring this situation unfolding right now  at the White House. You're looking at a live action shot of the White  House, the president of France with the first lady of France expected to  appear momentarily to greet the president and first lady Melania Trump. </p><p> President Macron to your point, Katrina, is expected to press President  Trump on trade. Here is what he said over the weekend. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACRON:  You cannot make it through the wall with the allies, it's too  complicated. If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade war  against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against them,  come on, it doesn't work. You need ally. We are the ally.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, so here is the messaging problem right for the president?  Katrina, he's got to say listen we're not talking about trade war. We're  talking about fair trade and the E.U. needs to get that message China has  not been fair. Go ahead. </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, absolutely, and we keep hearing that the president is doing  this to everyone else when in fact, everyone else has done this to the  United States and the president is simply saying look, we need fair and  reciprocal trade. </p><p> At the end of the day that's what going to matter. Many people in our own  country have doubted his ability to make these deals and to get things  done, but if you look at ISIS and tax reform he's even been bringing North  Korea to the table. So the president is actually doing things right. It  might be different, but we're actually getting things done. </p><p> And I think President Macron is going to get to hear President Trump's  position on these things as well. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Here is an unfolding breaking news situation and it's happening  right now with Russia and Iran as it pertains to the E.U. Katrina, to your  point, record amounts of U.S. oil is now flooding into E.U. markets, that  deal with Iran that Obama struck, there's a May 12 deadline that is looming  the president could yank what he says is the worst deal ever and impose  sanctions.</p><p> Again, Iran is backed by Russia, Russia supplies a lot of oil and Nat gas  to the E.U. We are just hearing the breaking news that the U.S. is now  becoming the number one oil exporter into the E.U changing geopolitical  landscape in the favor of the U.S. right here, Katrina. </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, and that's exactly what we call making America great again,  and President Trump knows one thing and that is leverage. He wrote about  it. And he knows and the world knows that if the president was to pull out  of the Iran deal, perhaps go back to the sanctions on the Iran central bank  or oil exports it's going to be a problem. </p><p> But these are things like, you know, looking at including the long range  missiles and you know, eliminating the sunset provision on things like I  don't know, you're reaching -- enriching uranium which is a huge problem  for Iran.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> PIERSON:  And the president of France they need to understand is we don't  see the dust to France chance coming out of Iran like we see coming from  Iran to America.</p><p> MACDONALD:  To you--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PIERSON:  And President Trump takes that very seriously.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, they are now as you can see at the White House raising  the welcoming flags 15 months into his presidency, the president is finally  rolling out the red carpet for the president of France and what will happen  after Macron appears they will go for a sunset dinner on the terrace of  George Washington's home in Mount Vernon overlooking the Potomac. </p><p> Katrina, Macron is expected to, to your point, really prep the president on  the Iran deal. He is the leader, he's seen by the E.U. as the Trump whisper  that he can basically coax the president into staying in the Iran deal.  Macron, though, watch this, Katrina, admitting though that that deal as the  president has said has flaws. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MACRON:  It this as if agreement perfect and this JCPOA a perfect thing for  our relationship with Iran, no. But for nuclear, what do you have as a  better option? I don't see it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  The car is now rolling up with the leader of France so Macron  says that they would finish the war against ISIS. If we leave, we leave it  open to Iran and Syria, they are going to fuel a new terrorist war. What  are your thoughts? </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, I think President Trump is also coming at this from a  different perspective. You know, we've had this, that we've been doing the  same thing over and over again expecting different results and President  Trump doesn't want to do that anymore and he's not saying end it  altogether, he wants to make revisions. </p><p> And now that we see that they're cracking down on anti-government  protesters that's a problem particularly if we're just going to sit back  and allow this to happen not really knowing what's going on. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Let me break in here. The president is just stepping  outside the White House with the first lady ready to greet the president of  France, and Mrs. Macron as well. Tomorrow night there will be a state  dinner and a break with tradition, President Trump has invited no Democrat  members of Congress or journalists. About 150 guests will take their seats  in the state ding room tomorrow night. </p><p> It's going to be a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack  Obama. Obama's guest list went into the hundreds and the president really  wants to keep this close relationship. And here he is, the president of  France greeting and a hug with the president of the United States. Let's  watch this and let this moment sink in. </p><p> OK, Katrina, what we're watching now is a warm embrace between the leader  of France and his wife is with the leader of the United States. It looks  really quite collegial; they are now turning for the official photograph. </p><p> Katrina, Trump seems, the president seems to be going all out on pomp and  circumstance. That's how much he had in Paris last July when the president  of France invited him to watch the annual Bastille Day. What's your  reaction to rolling out the red carpet for the president of France? </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, it is Donald Trump, Liz, so I think we can fully expect the  best with the president and Melania who, you know, is a class act in and of  her own. I mean, it's just an amazing opportunity for us to all see what  we're seeing right now and that is, you know, refreshing leadership,  bringing two countries together, even though they have their differences,  willing to work together for what they do agree upon. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Our allies, Katrina, for 50 years. Katrina Pierson, thank you  so much for weighing in there. I really appreciate it.</p><p> PIERSON:  Great to be here. Thank you. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We're also monitoring this breaking developing situation,  we're moments away from the Senate foreign relations vote on the nomination  of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Not the final  confirmation the full chamber is expected to vote for Pompeo. A rebuke  tough, Senate foreign relations don't want him. We're going to bring you  that breaking news as it comes in. Don't go away, stay with us, more after  the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SANDERS:  At some point, Democrats have to decide whether they love this  country more than they hate this president, and they have to decide that  they want to put the safety and the security and the diplomacy of our  country ahead of their own political games, and we're very hopeful that  they will. </p><p> Mike Pompeo is a highly qualified individual. He's been one of the leading  people when it comes to the negotiations and the conversations with North  Korea, and to stop that would be a incredibly dangerous and damaging for  our country and for the world. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We're staying in breaking news mode. We've got more  developments, look at this. Republican Senator Jeff Flake now a yes on the  nomination. He will vote yes that Pompeo should be secretary of state with  Rand Paul. That means the Senate foreign relations panel is doing a 180. </p><p> Instead of rebuking this nomination it looks like the Senate foreign  relations panel will confirm Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p> Let's bring in the Daily Caller editorial director, Vince Coglianese. What  a turn around, Vince? </p><p> VINCE COGLIANESE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, DAILY CALLER:  That's quite a change of  events. Rand Paul, of course the big hold out, you mentioned Jeff Flake as  well, but Rand Paul, the president saying in public that he wanted to see  Rand come with him, and that is happening, that's a huge deal. </p><p> And it's important that the Senate foreign relations committee do this,  give him a stamp of approval given the unheard-of nature of sending out  somebody with disapproval to be voted on by the full Senate approve. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, that's right. Let's get to the viewer, he comes out of  Senate foreign relations, it looks like the Senate foreign relations panel  does vote yes saying, yes, Pompeo should be the next secretary of state.  Then it goes to the full Senate where Pompeo is expected to be confirmed as  secretary of state. </p><p> You know, here's the thing, initially, Vince, the storyline was that, you  know, they didn't like Pompeo's position on Iran.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  They thought he was too much of a hawk. He was supposed to be  the easy confirmation. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes</p><p> MACDONALD:  He was supposed to be the no-brainer, and all of a sudden he  was a problem that even Democrats and Republicans who voted for him as CIA  director were saying, no, we don't want him as secretary of state in the  middle of the North Korea breakthroughs. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Right. </p><p> MACDONALD:  I mean, it is a stunning, you know, revelation of what's going  on in D.C. when you have historic developments going on with North Korea.  And they're saying no to Pompeo when he's trying to strike these deals. Go  ahead.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes. And it was a temper tantrum that lead them to that  conclusion, and I say that because this was a referendum on Trump. And all  of the assessments that we've heard from Democrats it was about -- it was  about Mike Pompeo's insufficient because he's not going to rein in Trump's  worth instincts. </p><p> There's no evidence for that. As the head of the CIA, he's had an  unblemished career there, he's had a good career prior to that as well. He  was, as you said, confirmed by the Senate to run the CIA before including  with Democratic support, and now he's got the opportunity to be secretary  of state. </p><p> And there's such an important resume item there for Mike Pompeo, and you  mentioned it. It's the fact that he's leading negotiations with North  Korea. This is an historic moment in terms of just having a U.S. official  leading such a high-level negotiation with North Korea. </p><p> To throw him out, to get rid of him as secretary of state would be a  preposterous exercise in politics--</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  -- and one the Democrats should not suffer right now because  if they do, they will suffer politically in the future politically for  making such a horrendous decision. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, historians and analysts have already said if the  president gets that North Korea deal, it will be on the level of  Reagan/Gorbachev. </p><p> We have three liberal newspapers saying, you know what? Obstructionist  Democrats, stop. You have to put Pompeo in as secretary of state. The  president needs be a secretary of state. They are, USA Today, a writer at  the Washington Post, and the New York Daily News. Your final reaction,  Vince. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Well, only that Barack Obama was given a Nobel Peace prize the  moment he came into office for doing nothing. If this is accomplished, as  you were mentioning, a peaceful North Korea of any kind, a meaningful peace  and one that draws down nuclear weapons, then I expect that Donald Trump  will receive a nomination for it, not that the Nobel Prize committee will  ever seriously consider him. </p><p> He's not exactly beloved by the globalist communist, but Mike Pompeo should  be right up there on that stage accepting the same thing. We have a long  way to go before we get there, but this is a big deal, and Mike Pompeo  should clear the bar at the United States Senate. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Great to see you, Vince. </p><p> Let's take you back to the White House. A truly lovely event is about to  be, take place right now. The two couples will plant a tree. It's a gift  from the president and president of France and Mrs. Macron they are going  to plant a tree, a sapling, a European oak on the South Lawn of the White  House about four and a half feet tall. </p><p> We're going to bring that to you live as it happens. Interesting note here,  First lady Melania Trump is really taking the lead here in organizing this  historic visit. </p><p> Quick, we're going to have more after the break. Also we're staying on the  situation in Toronto, that van plowing down pedestrians. Nine dead, 17  injured, seven critically. We're going to bring you the latest on that. A  suspect has been arrested. No motive yet. We will bring that to you live.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The nightmare, I've got to Yonge, and I've seen a lady  with her leg -- man, it was a gruesome scene. It's really bad out there. I  couldn't believe what I've seen, man. It was, man. Everybody, all these  people on the streets getting hit one by one. Post office boxes getting  crumpled up on people. And one person got dragged on and their blood is all  over Yonge. It's really bad out there, man. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We are basically are watching the president with the first  lady and the leader of France and the first lady of France now stepping out  of the portico, the White House. They're now going to enter the South Lawn. </p><p> There's first lady Melania right there. She's been organizing this historic  state visit. It is the White House's first state visit 15 months into the  Trump presidency. </p><p> They're going to plant a tree on the South Lawn. It is a gift from France  to the United States. It is a European oak sapling, four and a half feet  tall. </p><p> We have lieutenant general Thomas McInerney here. Sir, this is a developing  situation as well. General, the E.U. is look to the president of France to  coax President Donald Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. Your  reaction. </p><p> THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE:  Well, it's natural, and  they send President Macron over here to use him because he probably has the  best relationship of any of the European leaders right now, so I'm not  surprise. I do not think the president is going to change. He knows what he  wants to do. </p><p> The Europeans on the Iranian deal, it's purely a cash cow. They're ignoring  the nuclear threat per se. It's cash. They've got a huge trade surplus  going, and they're working it to their advantage. But that's not good  enough. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, it seems when you read, study what the president of  France, general, has been saying about ISIS leaving Syria and Iran's  growing presence with military bases in Syria, on the one hand the  president of France is saying as soon as -- if we leave, if we, the United  States, leave Syria, Iran will step in and cause terrorist activities to go  on the increase. </p><p> But at the same time, he wants the president to stay in the Iran nuclear  deal. Can you square this for the viewer, can you explain that and sort  that out? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Yes, I'll make it very simple. We should stay with the limited  number of people in Syria with 24/7 air power, so if they try to take over  any of the Kurdish places or the Syrian allies, then we can use that air  power to beat them down and to defeat them. </p><p> Now, as far as the nuclear deal goes, that was such a bad deal that no  agreement should ever have been made, the JCPOA, Liz. And we should back  out of that from both a military and a political point of view. Again,  remember, the European Union's interest is primarily in trade. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Let me just give you some background information about the tree  that was just planted. There is historic information about the reason that  France gave the United States and the White House this tree. </p><p> Over 9,000 American marines died in World War I in what's called the  Belleau Wood, this tree is from the area of that battle in June 1918 where  9,000 American marines died in World War I. That as far is a memorial site.  It's an important symbol of the sacrifice the United States made to insure  peace and stability in Europe.</p><p> General, your reaction to the president of France giving this oak tree to  the United States in commemoration of World War I marines dying there. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Liz, it's very, very symbolic. The Battle of Belleau Wood was a  horrendous battle. We lost, as you said, 9,000 marines. And to make this  tree come from that region really touches on our relationship. And I think  it is a very symbolic gesture by President Macron and symbolic of the  relationship between the president and President Trump. </p><p> MACDONALD:  What does this do for the psyche of the Trump administration,  to have these memorable events come up and in the ensuing days? This will  be a three-day visit, the president of Germany -- Germany, rather, Angela  Merkel will be coming on Friday. How does this set the scene for the  presidency of Donald Trump? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, I think it establishes it on a high note. People are  seeing the way the Trumps handle their visitors and the relationships  developing. The left has always wanted to deny that President Trump had  that capability. He's absolutely brilliant at it. You're seeing it today  and you'll see it at dinner tonight at Mount Vernon and the state dinner  they have. </p><p> The whole three days that the Macrons are here and how they're honored is  going to show the world and the American people what a great leader  President Trump and Mrs. Trump are. </p><p> MACDONALD:  We will be covering the Chancellor of Germany's visit, Angela  Merkel as well, coming later this week. Good to see you, general. Thanks  for coming in. I really appreciate it. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Thank, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  We are moments away from that Senate foreign relations vote on  the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Breaking  news, it looks like that Senate panel will vote for Mike Pompeo to be  secretary of state. </p><p> Jeff Flake and Rand Paul now saying they will vote for Michael Pompeo as  secretary of state. </p><p> We're going to take you back to Toronto, van mowed down nine people, and  injuring 16, killing nine in Toronto. We're going to bring you the latest  on that after the break. Don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Being confirm for you tonight, right now, we have nine  people that are dead. Sixteen that are injured. Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources, and I can assure the public all our  available resources have been brought in to address this tragic situation. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Take you to the developments in Toronto. Driver now in custody  after plowing a van into a crowd leaving nine people dead, sixteen injured,  seven critically. Toronto authorities held the press conference just  moments ago. We still do not know the driver's identity and his motive, we  will bring that to you as soon as it comes in. </p><p> General, listen, we have seen numerous van attacks like this and vehicular  attacks, a dozen since 2006, general. We've seen them in England, we've  seen them in Germany and Spain. And, of course, in Canada, as well as the  U.S. Your reaction, sir. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, it looks like a cookie cutter, Liz. By the rental van,  the number of people -- nine dead and 16 injured -- all the makings of  radical Islam. All I need to know is the driver's name and a little more  background, but I would say there's a 90 percent chance that this is  radical Islam. It wasn't an old man that had a heart attack or a stroke. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Again, we don't know the motive just yet. But we do know the  facts about prior vehicular attacks. Let's talk about that. Again, we don't  know the motive in Toronto. </p><p> General, you know, the terror capability has shifted. It is very difficult  for terrorists -- we're not saying this is terrorism -- it's difficult for  them to get bombs and explosives. It is easy for them to do vehicular  attacks. Your reaction to that. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, that's exactly what ISIS is telling their warriors across  the world, use vehicular attacks. And you can see all the ones that they've  done in the last year rather than explosives or even weapons, although  London are getting a lot of knives over there. But the fact is that is now  their modus operandi, and it's something that we should be cognizant of,  and it's very, very difficult to stop, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, and to your point, the days of the terror cell are  over. Now I think, to your point, terrorists -- and, again, we don't know  the motives of this attack. It has the hallmark of a terrorist attack.  Again, we'll bring you the motive as soon as it breaks. </p><p> To your point, general, you have said this before, ISIS and radical  terrorist leaders are saying stay in place and do your own terrorism. This  is a form of micro terrorism, right? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Exactly. And it's the patterns of behavior that I look at,  that's my business, patterns of behavior. And this is what you're seeing  now spread across all the cities in Europe as well as the United States in  New York City, for instance, where you are. And so this is what we must  expect, and it's extremely difficult to counter this. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, it's a senseless act of violence. What do you say to  the viewer out there, you know, these are just pedestrians walking on one  of Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, it's just near downtown Toronto. Are we  supposed to be having security barricades on every major block in every  urban area, every city? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  They would like that, but we're not going to do that. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Why would they like that? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Because that means the western world is being influenced by the  radical Islamists, to their way of thinking. They are putting control on  what we do just like when we go to an airport and all the checks we go  through. They like that. </p><p> But the fact is we've got to defeat this Islamic terrorism where the  ideology comes from, Mecca and Medina from the Middle East, and that's the  Muslims themselves. They must do that. And I'm hopeful that the new crown  prince of Saudi Arabia will be the leader against the radical Islamists in  his region so that they are no longer holy warriors and will go to paradise  for killing infidels. No, we must destroy that ideology. </p><p> MACDONALD:  It should be noted too that in Toronto a group of seven  security international meeting was occurring just up -- a few blocks away  from that terror attack. If we think -- let me back up, we don't know if  it's a terror attack, it has the hallmarks of that. Sir, you know, what are  the authorities asking this suspect right now? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, first of all, they want to get his name, and then you  want to get where he goes to church, what his basic beliefs are, what is  the reason he did this. If one person was killed, fine, that happens. But  not nine people. Not nine people. </p><p> MACDONALD:  General, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in  and handling two stories. I really appreciate it. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Again, we're going to take you back to the White House. This is  -- we're in breaking news mode. The president and first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and the first lady of France, they're  about to leave for Mount Vernon for a dinner overlooking at the Potomac. We  will bring it to you live. That is the home of George Washington.</p><p> And we're also moments away from that vote out of the Senate panel on the  nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. It looks like  that panel will vote for Mike Pompeo. Jeff Flake and Rand Paul saying yes  to Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p> But first, after Facebook's data breach scandal, other big tech companies  like Google could be next to face scrutiny over its data privacy practices.  We're on that story for you coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  After Facebook's data breach and data mining scandal, other big  tech companies like Google they are now in the hot seat over their data  privacy practices. A new report shows Google is way worse than Facebook at  collecting and keeping your personal information. They've been  cyberstalking you all over the internet even if you're not on Google's web  site for something else. </p><p> Let's take a look at how the stock of -- the stock of Google's parent  company Alphabet did after their company reporting slide to the downside,  and falling to less than 1 percent after hours. </p><p> Let's get to the panel on this. I want to bring in Danielle McLaughlin and  Kelsey Harkness. First to you, Kelsey, you know what's the creepiest part  of the story? It's that this Silicon Valley stalks you all over the  internet even though you're not on their web sites. That's the worse part  of the story. I don't think people realize that, Kelsey. </p><p> KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR REPORTER, DAILY SIGNAL:  Well, the level of outrage  directed at Google and Facebook is certainly understandable, but it's  really not surprising because Google and Facebook are billion dollar  companies--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, but isn't it creepy that Silicon Valley has all of the  information about what we're doing on the internet? </p><p> HARKNESS:  It's certainly creepy which is why Americans are upset about  this, but it's not surprising because they're not providing these services  for free. But I think what's important about these stories is that we don't  direct our anger towards the government and ask the government to regulate  the tech industry because the government, too, is collecting our personal  data. </p><p> Look at the CFBP, look at OPM, both of them had big, massive breaches. So  we need to let the free market solve this, we need to demand that tech  companies take it upon themselves to solve this and not get the government  involved in an area it really doesn't belong. </p><p> MACDONALD:  I used to be kind of OK with it, Danielle, and say, OK, you  know. But now I'm thinking, wait, this isn't good. To Kelsey's point, the  IRS has also had data breaches. The IRS knows a lot about our income. And  now Silicon Valley, Danielle knows too much about what we're doing on the  internet. I think it's kind of weird. </p><p> DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST:  It is weird, and it is a little  bit creepy, to your point. I think we have to make a decision societally  about who is going to regulate this. I take Kelsey's point about the notion  of the free market solving for this, but the free market hasn't solved for  this, and that's why we're in this position in the first place. </p><p> I actually do think that more like Europe -- which has very robust privacy  laws -- we should ask your government who are elected representative to  step in and make sure that these billion, trillion dollar companies in  Silicon Valley aren't just data mining. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Guys, I'm so sorry, we've got to break away because that Senate  vote on Mike Pompeo coming in, Rand Paul just now explaining why he changed  his vote. Let's listen. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RAND PAUL, (R) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  I decided to go ahead and vote for  Director Pompeo because he's assured me that he's learned the lesson. Now,  time will tell if those assurances are true or not. And I won't say that --  I can say with absolute certainty I know what his opinions will be and how  they will come out over time, but I do take him at his word. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  So they're about to vote, Kelsey, what's your reaction to this  180 out of Senate foreign relations now after that. Now the breaking news  it will, that panel will approve Mike Pompeo as secretary of state? What's  your reaction to the 180 here? </p><p> HARKNESS:  I think it's very good news. I think that it maybe appears  normal to a lot of Americans to hear that all Democrats are opposing  Pompeo's nomination, but this is not normal. Under the Obama administration  94 senators approved both Hillary Clinton and John Kerry for the same  position and, clearly, those are very divisive figures. </p><p> Mike Pompeo is very qualified to do this job and at a time when we are  about to enter into serious negotiations with North Korea, President Trump  needs a secretary of state by his side. </p><p> MACDONALD:  What do you think, Danielle? </p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I do agree that we need a secretary of state at this very  crucial time in North Korea relations. What Rand Paul asked of Mike Pompeo  was two things, do you agree that war in the Middle East, more war in the  Middle East is destabilizing, number one, and number two, do you agree that  Iraq was a mistake? He got those reassurances from Mike Pompeo, and that's  what changed his vote. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Interesting. The vote is now underway. We're staying on top of  the vote. Final thought, Kelsey. </p><p> HARKNESS:  I think that this is good news for all Americans. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Kelsey and Danielle, thank you so much. We're up against a  hard break. The president and the president of France about to arrive at  Mount Vernon. We're going to stay on that story for you as well. Jam-packed  hour, don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news. The Senate foreign relations committee now  voting for Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. Jeff Flake is yes, so as  Rand Paul. It goes to the full chamber for a vote where he is expected to  be confirmed as secretary of state. </p><p> We're also are waiting for President Trump and the first lady, the French  President Emmanuel Macron and his wife. They're headed to Mount Vernon, the  home of George Washington to have dinner overlooking the Potomac.</p><p> That does it for us. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources and I can assure the public all available  resources have been brought into address this tragic situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ELIZABETH MACDONALD, HOST, FOX NEWS:  Breaking news to the developing  situation in Toronto, a driver now in custody after plowing a van into a  crowd among Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, nine dead, 16 injured 17  critically. </p><p> I am Elizabeth MacDonald. This is Risk &amp; Reward. </p><p> The mayor of Toronto authorities just now holding a press conference, the  mayor saying it will likely be several days of disruption to the area  during the investigation. </p><p> Here with more let's get to Kristina Partsinevelos in the newsroom.  Kristina? </p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Yes, this event only  happened a few hours ago at 1.30 p.m. Eastern Time. A white van from the  company Ryder, it's a rental van company plowed on to the sidewalk, what  you're seeing right now, started to hit a few pedestrians. According to eye  witnesses the pedestrians asked the van to stop, the driver continued going  hitting more pedestrians. </p><p> And as you mentioned there are nine dead, 16 injured. There's still no word  yet about the motivation behind this van attack. You had the mayor just  speak very recently, the Mayor of Toronto that's John Tory, and he said we  are admired the around the world for being inclusive doesn't want anybody  to jump to conclusions just yet as to the motive behind this attack. </p><p> Very importantly to note as well, this is the remaining a Toronto  investigation not a national investigation with the RCMP, the Royal  Canadian Mountain Police, again, this is a Toronto investigation they are  not releasing the name of the driver of the van but they were able to bring  him into custody. </p><p> He seemed uninjured based off of several eye witness videos that I've seen  when they caught him, he happened to have something in his hand. There's  still no confirmation what he was carrying but he was pointing it at a  police officer. There were no shots fired. </p><p> Again, this man is in custody. We do not have any details just yet on who  he is, what his motivation is, are the Toronto police are being very  careful right now with the information, making sure going through to see if  he had any cell phones looking through his records to see most importantly  if he is somebody that they recognize, that they know and could be  affiliated with other people, but right now this is a Toronto  investigation. </p><p> You have several, 16 people still injured and businesses that have been  damaged along the road because this white van went up on to the sidewalk,  hit pedestrians, even rammed into a bus station. There was one eye witness  that said he saw his family they're looking for their grandfather and  they're very worried and I was just listening to this live through Canadian  media that they found the grandfather's glasses on the ground and so  they're still waiting confirmation. </p><p> Several of the patients or victims have been brought to Sunny Brook  Hospital in Toronto, again Sunny Brook Hospital, so again we have nine  dead, 16 injured in this tragic event that's happening in Toronto as we  speak. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Thank you, Kristina. We'll be staying on top of that story and  much more. </p><p> Let's get to your money. A widely held stock making lots of 401k plans  going up. Google parent company Alphabet reporting solid earnings and  revenues better than expected after the bell. </p><p> Let's get to Deirdre Bolton on the latest with that. Deirdre? </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Hey, Liz. So after-hours, you are  going to see this stock kind of see sawing back and forth. So it had a big  reaction as you mentioned, Alphabet, Google exceeding both on the top and  bottom line and you had a jump of around 4 percent initially, so you can  see still higher. </p><p> But just coming off those posted session highs, there are still some really  big questions out there, Liz, for the long term of this company. You know,  Google has between eight to 10 times more data on you and on me than  Facebook so a lot of Facebook investors were saying hey, how come Mark  Zuckerberg got dragged before Congress? </p><p> Google has about eight gigabytes of data per person, that equals about  2,000 hours if we just listen straight through of music. If you want a  comparison point Facebook has about 650 megabytes which are smaller than  gigabytes and that equals about 160 hours of music. So just an interesting  kind of data point and it just shows you where this data power is. </p><p> A lot of people are saying Google is one of a kind so if you are an  investor you like to hear that. The flip side is, will it make regulators  consider one of a kind akin to monopoly which is not too far of a stretch.</p><p> We do know that the European regulators are putting in new privacy laws as  of May 25th of this year so tech companies, ones that are based here but  have customers in Europe, need to be compliant. If these companies are not  compliant this is not a small slap on the wrist, Liz, it is between $30  million or 4 percent of annual revenue whichever is higher, so there's a  lot of people saying OK, Google has a lot of work ahead. Alphabet Google,  excuse me. Liz?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Deirdre. Thank you so much.</p><p> We have a jam packed busy hour ahead. We are moments away from President  Trump and the first lady welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and his  wife at the White House for the administration's first official state  dinner.</p><p> Let's get to Blake Burman with the latest. Blake? </p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  At the hour the French president  has a busy couple of days here in Washington, Liz. I think you can see  behind me that they are expecting Emmanuel Macron here at the White House  within the next few minutes or so. </p><p> The itinerary is as follows. The Macron family, him and his wife, rather,  and the president and first lady will head to dinner tonight to George  Washington's home followed by talks tomorrow, a state dinner and then he  addresses Congress on Wednesday. </p><p> The White House says these two have a great rapport, and part of the reason  why he's receiving the first state visit. However, it is also clear that  there are stark differences on a policy level, for example, there are trade  issues at hand, as well as different views on the Iran nuclear deal and the  Paris climate accord all will be discussed in the up upcoming days. </p><p> As we await Macron here at the White House, the White House as well also  has its eyes on the goings up on Capitol Hill as it relates to the Senate  foreign relations committee as the secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo  is set to get the thumbs down from the Senate foreign relations committee  it appears within the next few minutes or so.</p><p> All 10 Democrats plus the Republican Rand Paul expected to vote against  Pompeo to become the next secretary of state; however, Pompeo still  expected to get a vote on the Senate floor and there it appears as though  as if he will have the numbers to become the next secretary of state. </p><p> Today, two more Democrats came to his side saying that they would support  him, Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly, add to that Heidi Heitkamp to that group  as well. </p><p> The White House is trying to make the argument to the United States Senate  that if you voted for John Kerry and if you voted for Hillary Clinton, then  you should vote for Mike Pompeo as well. The White House press secretary  Sarah Sanders saying what's going on, on Capitol Hill sends this message to  the rest of the world.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What it says to the  world is what we've been saying for a long time, the Senate has got some  real problems, namely to figure out how to actually show up and do their  job a little bit better. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Now if Pompeo is voted down by the Senate foreign relations  committee, Liz, that would be the first time that would ever happen to a  secretary of state nominee if they eventually go on to become in that  position. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Wow, historic times, Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And by the way both Democrats and Republicans voted for Pompeo  as CIA director. </p><p> BURMAN:  Yes, CIA director.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  You as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senate foreign relations committee, as Blake Burman just noted  is about -- they are about to vote on Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state.  Rand Paul tweeting out he will support the nomination he was against it. </p><p> Last month President Trump announced the departure of Rex Tillerson as  secretary of state and as nomination of Pompeo as the replacement. Now the  thinking is if it gets to the full chamber Pompeo will become the secretary  of state. Just going through this process right now, we're monitoring the  vote for you in the beginning.</p><p> Let's get to what's going on with the French visit. The media says this is  going to be a bad relationship. Got off to a rocky start but now, French  President Macron even taking a line from President Trump ahead of today's  state visit to the White House. Watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE We have this very special relationship  because both of us are probably the maverick of the system, on both sides I  think President Trump's election was unexpected in your country, and  probably my election wasn't expected in my country, and we are not part of  the political system. I'm here to serve my people and my country and make  it great again, somebody I know very well could say, but that's it, that's  the whole story. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Joining me now, Weekly Standard executive editor, Fred Barnes.  Fred, make France great again, did you hear that? </p><p> FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes, look, Macron, this  is, he is so sure, so smart, so likable, and Trump is just basking in and  he's getting everything he wants and Macron fought a big war and he wants  to make sure that Trump doesn't get out of the Iran nuclear deal and that  he gets back in the Paris accord, I think not much chance for that. </p><p> But he is smart. He is the big European leader who has stepped forward to  embrace Trump, not endorse him but give Trump somebody big to deal with. It  isn't going to be England, it isn't going to be what's the name, Angela  Merkel in Germany comes in I think on Friday and that's just a bit of a  sour puss and doesn't get along with Trump. But Macron has made an effort  here and it's very wise on his part. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, here is the thing. We've got that May 12 deadline for  the Iran deal. </p><p> BARNES:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  The president is expected to yank it saying he already said  this is the worst deal ever. So, and you're right, we've got Angela Merkel  coming in. You know, Fred, these state visits are coming at a time when  economic growth is up, optimism is up, the media reporting how the  Democrats may take back control of the House. </p><p> The president seems to be dominating the message, when people go to vote  they say, what are you going to do for me? </p><p> BARNES:  Yes, look, I wouldn't buy this line from the Democrats and from a  lot of people in the media that there's a blue wave coming and Democrats  are just going to sweep through and win the House and maybe the Senate in  November. </p><p> They do very well that would be what happens historically in the first mid- term election for a new president, but Trump is the dominant figure here  and he has got some very optimistic things to talk about, not just the  economy but in foreign policy as well. </p><p> Look, Macron was one of those who joined in the attack on the plants in  Syria where they mix and made the poisonous product that were used to kill  so many Syrians, so look, they worked together before and I think they'll  work together again, particularly here. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Macron has pointed out that they're both maverick  outsiders. </p><p> BARNES:  They are. </p><p> MACDONALD:  They're both businessmen, they're not part of the classical  political system. Both were elected on the first try. It seems like these  two men have a lot in common. So we've got the D.C. media up in arms  saying, you know, this is again it's going to be problems here with the  state visit, certainly with Angela Merkel, they're raising the red flags  about it. What do you see? </p><p> BARNES:  Well, look, I'll tell you what the media really wants and they're  going to hound poor Macron while he's here. They want him to dump on Trump  and he is refusing to do it, wouldn't be smart to do it. </p><p> MACDONALD:  How are they going -- how are they going to get the French  president to dump on President Trump? </p><p> BARNES:  Well, he's going to have a press conference among other things,  they'll yell questions at him, and look, they have ways to get that  question asked, but Macron is I think not going to do it. What purpose of  his would it serve? He says he's here to deal with the president of the  United States. He doesn't have to and doesn't have to comment personally on  Trump. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know what, to your point, Fred, and it's an important one.  The media again, is misreading the situation.</p><p> BARNES:  I think so.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Macron likes his relationship with Trump because it improves  his own basically rookie standing with the E.U. He's now being called the  Trump whisperer. Macron is not going to damage that. He's not going to  damage how important he is now to the E.U. given his relationship with  Trump. </p><p> BARNES:  I think you're absolutely right. It serves his purpose very well.  Now, will Macron be able to talk Trump into not getting out of the Iran  deal, will he be able to talk him to getting into Paris climate accord? I  don't think so on either one of those things, but he'll get credit for  trying. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Fred Barnes. Great stuff. Come back soon. </p><p> BARNES:  OK.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now let's get to this fast moving stock as Google parent  Alphabet reporting strong earnings and revenue after the bell. It's been  doing that every quarter since 2010. The stock is moving after-hours.  another great quarter for Google. But now, this. A new report Google does  get more personal information about you than even Facebook, as Deirdre  Bolton just said 8 to 10 times of Facebook. We're going to show you the  details.</p><p> We're also monitoring that Senate foreign relationships vote of Mike Pompeo  as secretary of state. Rand Paul breaking news here, just putting out he  will vote for Michael Pompeo, when the vote comes we're going to bring it  to you. Liberal newspapers now supporting Pompeo. We're going to show who.</p><p> But first, we're also watching President Trump and the first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife at the White House for the  administration's first official state dinner. We're going to bring that to  you live as well, jam-packed hour, really busy hour ahead, don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Back to this breaking news. We are monitoring French President  Emmanuel Macron he's about to appear at the White House any second, but the  first lady and the president will greet the French president and Mrs.  Macron at the White House.</p><p> Let's bring in Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor Katrina Pierson. It's a  historic visit, Katrina, now even President Macron effectively saying you  know what? President is the president to the American people, he's giving  that message the American people will deal with it. He's the president. </p><p> KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISOR:  Absolutely. This truly is a  refreshing display of leadership. You have two leaders who don't agree 100  percent on all of the policy positions but who have become friends and  respect each other as leaders and now we're here having a great visit. I  fully expect President Macron to make his case, with regards to trade and  Syria and Iraq. But here, I mean, Iran.</p><p> So here is the thing. President Trump is going to consider the president of  France as counsel absolutely as a courtesy, Liz. But let's make no mistake.  The president of the United States will be making policy for the United  States so I think this is a great opportunity for many in our own country  to see how elected leaders should act.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, to your point, it's well taken. Because the thinking  in the E.U. as President Macron is the leading edge of that wedge to get  the president to step back on the Iran deal, dial back on, you know, the  tariffs, and the potential trade wars, and also climate change. But your  point is President Trump is not going to do that, right? </p><p> PIERSON:  No, I don't think so because these are things that the president  has hold very dear and we've seen it throughout the campaign. You can go  all the way back to the 80s on some of these positions. But I do think he  would consider the counsel, but at the same time the president has made a  commitment to the United States and that is to put America and its people  first. That is not going to change. And I think the president of France  respects the president's opinion as well.</p><p> And when we look at the things like Iran, for example, the president was  very adamant on making some significant changes, things that a lot of  people agree with, regardless of how we entered this deal. We have a new  leader of the United States and he wants to have input. </p><p> MACDONALD:  So again, we're monitoring this situation unfolding right now  at the White House. You're looking at a live action shot of the White  House, the president of France with the first lady of France expected to  appear momentarily to greet the president and first lady Melania Trump. </p><p> President Macron to your point, Katrina, is expected to press President  Trump on trade. Here is what he said over the weekend. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACRON:  You cannot make it through the wall with the allies, it's too  complicated. If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade war  against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against them,  come on, it doesn't work. You need ally. We are the ally.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, so here is the messaging problem right for the president?  Katrina, he's got to say listen we're not talking about trade war. We're  talking about fair trade and the E.U. needs to get that message China has  not been fair. Go ahead. </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, absolutely, and we keep hearing that the president is doing  this to everyone else when in fact, everyone else has done this to the  United States and the president is simply saying look, we need fair and  reciprocal trade. </p><p> At the end of the day that's what going to matter. Many people in our own  country have doubted his ability to make these deals and to get things  done, but if you look at ISIS and tax reform he's even been bringing North  Korea to the table. So the president is actually doing things right. It  might be different, but we're actually getting things done. </p><p> And I think President Macron is going to get to hear President Trump's  position on these things as well. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Here is an unfolding breaking news situation and it's happening  right now with Russia and Iran as it pertains to the E.U. Katrina, to your  point, record amounts of U.S. oil is now flooding into E.U. markets, that  deal with Iran that Obama struck, there's a May 12 deadline that is looming  the president could yank what he says is the worst deal ever and impose  sanctions.</p><p> Again, Iran is backed by Russia, Russia supplies a lot of oil and Nat gas  to the E.U. We are just hearing the breaking news that the U.S. is now  becoming the number one oil exporter into the E.U changing geopolitical  landscape in the favor of the U.S. right here, Katrina. </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, and that's exactly what we call making America great again,  and President Trump knows one thing and that is leverage. He wrote about  it. And he knows and the world knows that if the president was to pull out  of the Iran deal, perhaps go back to the sanctions on the Iran central bank  or oil exports it's going to be a problem. </p><p> But these are things like, you know, looking at including the long range  missiles and you know, eliminating the sunset provision on things like I  don't know, you're reaching -- enriching uranium which is a huge problem  for Iran.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> PIERSON:  And the president of France they need to understand is we don't  see the dust to France chance coming out of Iran like we see coming from  Iran to America.</p><p> MACDONALD:  To you--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PIERSON:  And President Trump takes that very seriously.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, they are now as you can see at the White House raising  the welcoming flags 15 months into his presidency, the president is finally  rolling out the red carpet for the president of France and what will happen  after Macron appears they will go for a sunset dinner on the terrace of  George Washington's home in Mount Vernon overlooking the Potomac. </p><p> Katrina, Macron is expected to, to your point, really prep the president on  the Iran deal. He is the leader, he's seen by the E.U. as the Trump whisper  that he can basically coax the president into staying in the Iran deal.  Macron, though, watch this, Katrina, admitting though that that deal as the  president has said has flaws. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MACRON:  It this as if agreement perfect and this JCPOA a perfect thing for  our relationship with Iran, no. But for nuclear, what do you have as a  better option? I don't see it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  The car is now rolling up with the leader of France so Macron  says that they would finish the war against ISIS. If we leave, we leave it  open to Iran and Syria, they are going to fuel a new terrorist war. What  are your thoughts? </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, I think President Trump is also coming at this from a  different perspective. You know, we've had this, that we've been doing the  same thing over and over again expecting different results and President  Trump doesn't want to do that anymore and he's not saying end it  altogether, he wants to make revisions. </p><p> And now that we see that they're cracking down on anti-government  protesters that's a problem particularly if we're just going to sit back  and allow this to happen not really knowing what's going on. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Let me break in here. The president is just stepping  outside the White House with the first lady ready to greet the president of  France, and Mrs. Macron as well. Tomorrow night there will be a state  dinner and a break with tradition, President Trump has invited no Democrat  members of Congress or journalists. About 150 guests will take their seats  in the state ding room tomorrow night. </p><p> It's going to be a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack  Obama. Obama's guest list went into the hundreds and the president really  wants to keep this close relationship. And here he is, the president of  France greeting and a hug with the president of the United States. Let's  watch this and let this moment sink in. </p><p> OK, Katrina, what we're watching now is a warm embrace between the leader  of France and his wife is with the leader of the United States. It looks  really quite collegial; they are now turning for the official photograph. </p><p> Katrina, Trump seems, the president seems to be going all out on pomp and  circumstance. That's how much he had in Paris last July when the president  of France invited him to watch the annual Bastille Day. What's your  reaction to rolling out the red carpet for the president of France? </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, it is Donald Trump, Liz, so I think we can fully expect the  best with the president and Melania who, you know, is a class act in and of  her own. I mean, it's just an amazing opportunity for us to all see what  we're seeing right now and that is, you know, refreshing leadership,  bringing two countries together, even though they have their differences,  willing to work together for what they do agree upon. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Our allies, Katrina, for 50 years. Katrina Pierson, thank you  so much for weighing in there. I really appreciate it.</p><p> PIERSON:  Great to be here. Thank you. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We're also monitoring this breaking developing situation,  we're moments away from the Senate foreign relations vote on the nomination  of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Not the final  confirmation the full chamber is expected to vote for Pompeo. A rebuke  tough, Senate foreign relations don't want him. We're going to bring you  that breaking news as it comes in. Don't go away, stay with us, more after  the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SANDERS:  At some point, Democrats have to decide whether they love this  country more than they hate this president, and they have to decide that  they want to put the safety and the security and the diplomacy of our  country ahead of their own political games, and we're very hopeful that  they will. </p><p> Mike Pompeo is a highly qualified individual. He's been one of the leading  people when it comes to the negotiations and the conversations with North  Korea, and to stop that would be a incredibly dangerous and damaging for  our country and for the world. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We're staying in breaking news mode. We've got more  developments, look at this. Republican Senator Jeff Flake now a yes on the  nomination. He will vote yes that Pompeo should be secretary of state with  Rand Paul. That means the Senate foreign relations panel is doing a 180. </p><p> Instead of rebuking this nomination it looks like the Senate foreign  relations panel will confirm Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p> Let's bring in the Daily Caller editorial director, Vince Coglianese. What  a turn around, Vince? </p><p> VINCE COGLIANESE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, DAILY CALLER:  That's quite a change of  events. Rand Paul, of course the big hold out, you mentioned Jeff Flake as  well, but Rand Paul, the president saying in public that he wanted to see  Rand come with him, and that is happening, that's a huge deal. </p><p> And it's important that the Senate foreign relations committee do this,  give him a stamp of approval given the unheard-of nature of sending out  somebody with disapproval to be voted on by the full Senate approve. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, that's right. Let's get to the viewer, he comes out of  Senate foreign relations, it looks like the Senate foreign relations panel  does vote yes saying, yes, Pompeo should be the next secretary of state.  Then it goes to the full Senate where Pompeo is expected to be confirmed as  secretary of state. </p><p> You know, here's the thing, initially, Vince, the storyline was that, you  know, they didn't like Pompeo's position on Iran.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  They thought he was too much of a hawk. He was supposed to be  the easy confirmation. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes</p><p> MACDONALD:  He was supposed to be the no-brainer, and all of a sudden he  was a problem that even Democrats and Republicans who voted for him as CIA  director were saying, no, we don't want him as secretary of state in the  middle of the North Korea breakthroughs. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Right. </p><p> MACDONALD:  I mean, it is a stunning, you know, revelation of what's going  on in D.C. when you have historic developments going on with North Korea.  And they're saying no to Pompeo when he's trying to strike these deals. Go  ahead.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes. And it was a temper tantrum that lead them to that  conclusion, and I say that because this was a referendum on Trump. And all  of the assessments that we've heard from Democrats it was about -- it was  about Mike Pompeo's insufficient because he's not going to rein in Trump's  worth instincts. </p><p> There's no evidence for that. As the head of the CIA, he's had an  unblemished career there, he's had a good career prior to that as well. He  was, as you said, confirmed by the Senate to run the CIA before including  with Democratic support, and now he's got the opportunity to be secretary  of state. </p><p> And there's such an important resume item there for Mike Pompeo, and you  mentioned it. It's the fact that he's leading negotiations with North  Korea. This is an historic moment in terms of just having a U.S. official  leading such a high-level negotiation with North Korea. </p><p> To throw him out, to get rid of him as secretary of state would be a  preposterous exercise in politics--</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  -- and one the Democrats should not suffer right now because  if they do, they will suffer politically in the future politically for  making such a horrendous decision. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, historians and analysts have already said if the  president gets that North Korea deal, it will be on the level of  Reagan/Gorbachev. </p><p> We have three liberal newspapers saying, you know what? Obstructionist  Democrats, stop. You have to put Pompeo in as secretary of state. The  president needs be a secretary of state. They are, USA Today, a writer at  the Washington Post, and the New York Daily News. Your final reaction,  Vince. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Well, only that Barack Obama was given a Nobel Peace prize the  moment he came into office for doing nothing. If this is accomplished, as  you were mentioning, a peaceful North Korea of any kind, a meaningful peace  and one that draws down nuclear weapons, then I expect that Donald Trump  will receive a nomination for it, not that the Nobel Prize committee will  ever seriously consider him. </p><p> He's not exactly beloved by the globalist communist, but Mike Pompeo should  be right up there on that stage accepting the same thing. We have a long  way to go before we get there, but this is a big deal, and Mike Pompeo  should clear the bar at the United States Senate. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Great to see you, Vince. </p><p> Let's take you back to the White House. A truly lovely event is about to  be, take place right now. The two couples will plant a tree. It's a gift  from the president and president of France and Mrs. Macron they are going  to plant a tree, a sapling, a European oak on the South Lawn of the White  House about four and a half feet tall. </p><p> We're going to bring that to you live as it happens. Interesting note here,  First lady Melania Trump is really taking the lead here in organizing this  historic visit. </p><p> Quick, we're going to have more after the break. Also we're staying on the  situation in Toronto, that van plowing down pedestrians. Nine dead, 17  injured, seven critically. We're going to bring you the latest on that. A  suspect has been arrested. No motive yet. We will bring that to you live.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The nightmare, I've got to Yonge, and I've seen a lady  with her leg -- man, it was a gruesome scene. It's really bad out there. I  couldn't believe what I've seen, man. It was, man. Everybody, all these  people on the streets getting hit one by one. Post office boxes getting  crumpled up on people. And one person got dragged on and their blood is all  over Yonge. It's really bad out there, man. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We are basically are watching the president with the first  lady and the leader of France and the first lady of France now stepping out  of the portico, the White House. They're now going to enter the South Lawn. </p><p> There's first lady Melania right there. She's been organizing this historic  state visit. It is the White House's first state visit 15 months into the  Trump presidency. </p><p> They're going to plant a tree on the South Lawn. It is a gift from France  to the United States. It is a European oak sapling, four and a half feet  tall. </p><p> We have lieutenant general Thomas McInerney here. Sir, this is a developing  situation as well. General, the E.U. is look to the president of France to  coax President Donald Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. Your  reaction. </p><p> THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE:  Well, it's natural, and  they send President Macron over here to use him because he probably has the  best relationship of any of the European leaders right now, so I'm not  surprise. I do not think the president is going to change. He knows what he  wants to do. </p><p> The Europeans on the Iranian deal, it's purely a cash cow. They're ignoring  the nuclear threat per se. It's cash. They've got a huge trade surplus  going, and they're working it to their advantage. But that's not good  enough. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, it seems when you read, study what the president of  France, general, has been saying about ISIS leaving Syria and Iran's  growing presence with military bases in Syria, on the one hand the  president of France is saying as soon as -- if we leave, if we, the United  States, leave Syria, Iran will step in and cause terrorist activities to go  on the increase. </p><p> But at the same time, he wants the president to stay in the Iran nuclear  deal. Can you square this for the viewer, can you explain that and sort  that out? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Yes, I'll make it very simple. We should stay with the limited  number of people in Syria with 24/7 air power, so if they try to take over  any of the Kurdish places or the Syrian allies, then we can use that air  power to beat them down and to defeat them. </p><p> Now, as far as the nuclear deal goes, that was such a bad deal that no  agreement should ever have been made, the JCPOA, Liz. And we should back  out of that from both a military and a political point of view. Again,  remember, the European Union's interest is primarily in trade. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Let me just give you some background information about the tree  that was just planted. There is historic information about the reason that  France gave the United States and the White House this tree. </p><p> Over 9,000 American marines died in World War I in what's called the  Belleau Wood, this tree is from the area of that battle in June 1918 where  9,000 American marines died in World War I. That as far is a memorial site.  It's an important symbol of the sacrifice the United States made to insure  peace and stability in Europe.</p><p> General, your reaction to the president of France giving this oak tree to  the United States in commemoration of World War I marines dying there. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Liz, it's very, very symbolic. The Battle of Belleau Wood was a  horrendous battle. We lost, as you said, 9,000 marines. And to make this  tree come from that region really touches on our relationship. And I think  it is a very symbolic gesture by President Macron and symbolic of the  relationship between the president and President Trump. </p><p> MACDONALD:  What does this do for the psyche of the Trump administration,  to have these memorable events come up and in the ensuing days? This will  be a three-day visit, the president of Germany -- Germany, rather, Angela  Merkel will be coming on Friday. How does this set the scene for the  presidency of Donald Trump? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, I think it establishes it on a high note. People are  seeing the way the Trumps handle their visitors and the relationships  developing. The left has always wanted to deny that President Trump had  that capability. He's absolutely brilliant at it. You're seeing it today  and you'll see it at dinner tonight at Mount Vernon and the state dinner  they have. </p><p> The whole three days that the Macrons are here and how they're honored is  going to show the world and the American people what a great leader  President Trump and Mrs. Trump are. </p><p> MACDONALD:  We will be covering the Chancellor of Germany's visit, Angela  Merkel as well, coming later this week. Good to see you, general. Thanks  for coming in. I really appreciate it. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Thank, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  We are moments away from that Senate foreign relations vote on  the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Breaking  news, it looks like that Senate panel will vote for Mike Pompeo to be  secretary of state. </p><p> Jeff Flake and Rand Paul now saying they will vote for Michael Pompeo as  secretary of state. </p><p> We're going to take you back to Toronto, van mowed down nine people, and  injuring 16, killing nine in Toronto. We're going to bring you the latest  on that after the break. Don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Being confirm for you tonight, right now, we have nine  people that are dead. Sixteen that are injured. Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources, and I can assure the public all our  available resources have been brought in to address this tragic situation. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Take you to the developments in Toronto. Driver now in custody  after plowing a van into a crowd leaving nine people dead, sixteen injured,  seven critically. Toronto authorities held the press conference just  moments ago. We still do not know the driver's identity and his motive, we  will bring that to you as soon as it comes in. </p><p> General, listen, we have seen numerous van attacks like this and vehicular  attacks, a dozen since 2006, general. We've seen them in England, we've  seen them in Germany and Spain. And, of course, in Canada, as well as the  U.S. Your reaction, sir. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, it looks like a cookie cutter, Liz. By the rental van,  the number of people -- nine dead and 16 injured -- all the makings of  radical Islam. All I need to know is the driver's name and a little more  background, but I would say there's a 90 percent chance that this is  radical Islam. It wasn't an old man that had a heart attack or a stroke. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Again, we don't know the motive just yet. But we do know the  facts about prior vehicular attacks. Let's talk about that. Again, we don't  know the motive in Toronto. </p><p> General, you know, the terror capability has shifted. It is very difficult  for terrorists -- we're not saying this is terrorism -- it's difficult for  them to get bombs and explosives. It is easy for them to do vehicular  attacks. Your reaction to that. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, that's exactly what ISIS is telling their warriors across  the world, use vehicular attacks. And you can see all the ones that they've  done in the last year rather than explosives or even weapons, although  London are getting a lot of knives over there. But the fact is that is now  their modus operandi, and it's something that we should be cognizant of,  and it's very, very difficult to stop, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, and to your point, the days of the terror cell are  over. Now I think, to your point, terrorists -- and, again, we don't know  the motives of this attack. It has the hallmark of a terrorist attack.  Again, we'll bring you the motive as soon as it breaks. </p><p> To your point, general, you have said this before, ISIS and radical  terrorist leaders are saying stay in place and do your own terrorism. This  is a form of micro terrorism, right? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Exactly. And it's the patterns of behavior that I look at,  that's my business, patterns of behavior. And this is what you're seeing  now spread across all the cities in Europe as well as the United States in  New York City, for instance, where you are. And so this is what we must  expect, and it's extremely difficult to counter this. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, it's a senseless act of violence. What do you say to  the viewer out there, you know, these are just pedestrians walking on one  of Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, it's just near downtown Toronto. Are we  supposed to be having security barricades on every major block in every  urban area, every city? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  They would like that, but we're not going to do that. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Why would they like that? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Because that means the western world is being influenced by the  radical Islamists, to their way of thinking. They are putting control on  what we do just like when we go to an airport and all the checks we go  through. They like that. </p><p> But the fact is we've got to defeat this Islamic terrorism where the  ideology comes from, Mecca and Medina from the Middle East, and that's the  Muslims themselves. They must do that. And I'm hopeful that the new crown  prince of Saudi Arabia will be the leader against the radical Islamists in  his region so that they are no longer holy warriors and will go to paradise  for killing infidels. No, we must destroy that ideology. </p><p> MACDONALD:  It should be noted too that in Toronto a group of seven  security international meeting was occurring just up -- a few blocks away  from that terror attack. If we think -- let me back up, we don't know if  it's a terror attack, it has the hallmarks of that. Sir, you know, what are  the authorities asking this suspect right now? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, first of all, they want to get his name, and then you  want to get where he goes to church, what his basic beliefs are, what is  the reason he did this. If one person was killed, fine, that happens. But  not nine people. Not nine people. </p><p> MACDONALD:  General, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in  and handling two stories. I really appreciate it. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Again, we're going to take you back to the White House. This is  -- we're in breaking news mode. The president and first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and the first lady of France, they're  about to leave for Mount Vernon for a dinner overlooking at the Potomac. We  will bring it to you live. That is the home of George Washington.</p><p> And we're also moments away from that vote out of the Senate panel on the  nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. It looks like  that panel will vote for Mike Pompeo. Jeff Flake and Rand Paul saying yes  to Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p> But first, after Facebook's data breach scandal, other big tech companies  like Google could be next to face scrutiny over its data privacy practices.  We're on that story for you coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  After Facebook's data breach and data mining scandal, other big  tech companies like Google they are now in the hot seat over their data  privacy practices. A new report shows Google is way worse than Facebook at  collecting and keeping your personal information. They've been  cyberstalking you all over the internet even if you're not on Google's web  site for something else. </p><p> Let's take a look at how the stock of -- the stock of Google's parent  company Alphabet did after their company reporting slide to the downside,  and falling to less than 1 percent after hours. </p><p> Let's get to the panel on this. I want to bring in Danielle McLaughlin and  Kelsey Harkness. First to you, Kelsey, you know what's the creepiest part  of the story? It's that this Silicon Valley stalks you all over the  internet even though you're not on their web sites. That's the worse part  of the story. I don't think people realize that, Kelsey. </p><p> KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR REPORTER, DAILY SIGNAL:  Well, the level of outrage  directed at Google and Facebook is certainly understandable, but it's  really not surprising because Google and Facebook are billion dollar  companies--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, but isn't it creepy that Silicon Valley has all of the  information about what we're doing on the internet? </p><p> HARKNESS:  It's certainly creepy which is why Americans are upset about  this, but it's not surprising because they're not providing these services  for free. But I think what's important about these stories is that we don't  direct our anger towards the government and ask the government to regulate  the tech industry because the government, too, is collecting our personal  data. </p><p> Look at the CFBP, look at OPM, both of them had big, massive breaches. So  we need to let the free market solve this, we need to demand that tech  companies take it upon themselves to solve this and not get the government  involved in an area it really doesn't belong. </p><p> MACDONALD:  I used to be kind of OK with it, Danielle, and say, OK, you  know. But now I'm thinking, wait, this isn't good. To Kelsey's point, the  IRS has also had data breaches. The IRS knows a lot about our income. And  now Silicon Valley, Danielle knows too much about what we're doing on the  internet. I think it's kind of weird. </p><p> DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST:  It is weird, and it is a little  bit creepy, to your point. I think we have to make a decision societally  about who is going to regulate this. I take Kelsey's point about the notion  of the free market solving for this, but the free market hasn't solved for  this, and that's why we're in this position in the first place. </p><p> I actually do think that more like Europe -- which has very robust privacy  laws -- we should ask your government who are elected representative to  step in and make sure that these billion, trillion dollar companies in  Silicon Valley aren't just data mining. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Guys, I'm so sorry, we've got to break away because that Senate  vote on Mike Pompeo coming in, Rand Paul just now explaining why he changed  his vote. Let's listen. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RAND PAUL, (R) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  I decided to go ahead and vote for  Director Pompeo because he's assured me that he's learned the lesson. Now,  time will tell if those assurances are true or not. And I won't say that --  I can say with absolute certainty I know what his opinions will be and how  they will come out over time, but I do take him at his word. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  So they're about to vote, Kelsey, what's your reaction to this  180 out of Senate foreign relations now after that. Now the breaking news  it will, that panel will approve Mike Pompeo as secretary of state? What's  your reaction to the 180 here? </p><p> HARKNESS:  I think it's very good news. I think that it maybe appears  normal to a lot of Americans to hear that all Democrats are opposing  Pompeo's nomination, but this is not normal. Under the Obama administration  94 senators approved both Hillary Clinton and John Kerry for the same  position and, clearly, those are very divisive figures. </p><p> Mike Pompeo is very qualified to do this job and at a time when we are  about to enter into serious negotiations with North Korea, President Trump  needs a secretary of state by his side. </p><p> MACDONALD:  What do you think, Danielle? </p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I do agree that we need a secretary of state at this very  crucial time in North Korea relations. What Rand Paul asked of Mike Pompeo  was two things, do you agree that war in the Middle East, more war in the  Middle East is destabilizing, number one, and number two, do you agree that  Iraq was a mistake? He got those reassurances from Mike Pompeo, and that's  what changed his vote. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Interesting. The vote is now underway. We're staying on top of  the vote. Final thought, Kelsey. </p><p> HARKNESS:  I think that this is good news for all Americans. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Kelsey and Danielle, thank you so much. We're up against a  hard break. The president and the president of France about to arrive at  Mount Vernon. We're going to stay on that story for you as well. Jam-packed  hour, don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news. The Senate foreign relations committee now  voting for Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. Jeff Flake is yes, so as  Rand Paul. It goes to the full chamber for a vote where he is expected to  be confirmed as secretary of state. </p><p> We're also are waiting for President Trump and the first lady, the French  President Emmanuel Macron and his wife. They're headed to Mount Vernon, the  home of George Washington to have dinner overlooking the Potomac.</p><p> That does it for us. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources and I can assure the public all available  resources have been brought into address this tragic situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ELIZABETH MACDONALD, HOST, FOX NEWS:  Breaking news to the developing  situation in Toronto, a driver now in custody after plowing a van into a  crowd among Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, nine dead, 16 injured 17  critically. </p><p>I am Elizabeth MacDonald. This is Risk &amp; Reward. </p><p>The mayor of Toronto authorities just now holding a press conference, the  mayor saying it will likely be several days of disruption to the area  during the investigation. </p><p>Here with more let's get to Kristina Partsinevelos in the newsroom.  Kristina? </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Yes, this event only  happened a few hours ago at 1.30 p.m. Eastern Time. A white van from the  company Ryder, it's a rental van company plowed on to the sidewalk, what  you're seeing right now, started to hit a few pedestrians. According to eye  witnesses the pedestrians asked the van to stop, the driver continued going  hitting more pedestrians. </p><p>And as you mentioned there are nine dead, 16 injured. There's still no word  yet about the motivation behind this van attack. You had the mayor just  speak very recently, the Mayor of Toronto that's John Tory, and he said we  are admired the around the world for being inclusive doesn't want anybody  to jump to conclusions just yet as to the motive behind this attack. </p><p>Very importantly to note as well, this is the remaining a Toronto  investigation not a national investigation with the RCMP, the Royal  Canadian Mountain Police, again, this is a Toronto investigation they are  not releasing the name of the driver of the van but they were able to bring  him into custody. </p><p>He seemed uninjured based off of several eye witness videos that I've seen  when they caught him, he happened to have something in his hand. There's  still no confirmation what he was carrying but he was pointing it at a  police officer. There were no shots fired. </p><p>Again, this man is in custody. We do not have any details just yet on who  he is, what his motivation is, are the Toronto police are being very  careful right now with the information, making sure going through to see if  he had any cell phones looking through his records to see most importantly  if he is somebody that they recognize, that they know and could be  affiliated with other people, but right now this is a Toronto  investigation. </p><p>You have several, 16 people still injured and businesses that have been  damaged along the road because this white van went up on to the sidewalk,  hit pedestrians, even rammed into a bus station. There was one eye witness  that said he saw his family they're looking for their grandfather and  they're very worried and I was just listening to this live through Canadian  media that they found the grandfather's glasses on the ground and so  they're still waiting confirmation. </p><p>Several of the patients or victims have been brought to Sunny Brook  Hospital in Toronto, again Sunny Brook Hospital, so again we have nine  dead, 16 injured in this tragic event that's happening in Toronto as we  speak. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Kristina. We'll be staying on top of that story and  much more. </p><p>Let's get to your money. A widely held stock making lots of 401k plans  going up. Google parent company Alphabet reporting solid earnings and  revenues better than expected after the bell. </p><p>Let's get to Deirdre Bolton on the latest with that. Deirdre? </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Hey, Liz. So after-hours, you are  going to see this stock kind of see sawing back and forth. So it had a big  reaction as you mentioned, Alphabet, Google exceeding both on the top and  bottom line and you had a jump of around 4 percent initially, so you can  see still higher. </p><p>But just coming off those posted session highs, there are still some really  big questions out there, Liz, for the long term of this company. You know,  Google has between eight to 10 times more data on you and on me than  Facebook so a lot of Facebook investors were saying hey, how come Mark  Zuckerberg got dragged before Congress? </p><p>Google has about eight gigabytes of data per person, that equals about  2,000 hours if we just listen straight through of music. If you want a  comparison point Facebook has about 650 megabytes which are smaller than  gigabytes and that equals about 160 hours of music. So just an interesting  kind of data point and it just shows you where this data power is. </p><p>A lot of people are saying Google is one of a kind so if you are an  investor you like to hear that. The flip side is, will it make regulators  consider one of a kind akin to monopoly which is not too far of a stretch.</p><p>We do know that the European regulators are putting in new privacy laws as  of May 25th of this year so tech companies, ones that are based here but  have customers in Europe, need to be compliant. If these companies are not  compliant this is not a small slap on the wrist, Liz, it is between $30  million or 4 percent of annual revenue whichever is higher, so there's a  lot of people saying OK, Google has a lot of work ahead. AlphabetGoogle,  excuse me. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Deirdre. Thank you so much.</p><p>We have a jam packed busy hour ahead. We are moments away from President  Trump and the first lady welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and his  wife at the White House for the administration's first official state  dinner.</p><p>Let's get to Blake Burman with the latest. Blake? </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  At the hour the French president  has a busy couple of days here in Washington, Liz. I think you can see  behind me that they are expecting Emmanuel Macron here at the White House  within the next few minutes or so. </p><p>The itinerary is as follows. The Macron family, him and his wife, rather,  and the president and first lady will head to dinner tonight to George  Washington's home followed by talks tomorrow, a state dinner and then he  addresses Congress on Wednesday. </p><p>The White House says these two have a great rapport, and part of the reason  why he's receiving the first state visit. However, it is also clear that  there are stark differences on a policy level, for example, there are trade  issues at hand, as well as different views on the Iran nuclear deal and the  Paris climate accord all will be discussed in the up upcoming days. </p><p>As we await Macron here at the White House, the White House as well also  has its eyes on the goings up on Capitol Hill as it relates to the Senate  foreign relations committee as the secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo  is set to get the thumbs down from the Senate foreign relations committee  it appears within the next few minutes or so.</p><p>All 10 Democrats plus the Republican Rand Paul expected to vote against  Pompeo to become the next secretary of state; however, Pompeo still  expected to get a vote on the Senate floor and there it appears as though  as if he will have the numbers to become the next secretary of state. </p><p>Today, two more Democrats came to his side saying that they would support  him, Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly, add to that Heidi Heitkamp to that group  as well. </p><p>The White House is trying to make the argument to the United States Senate  that if you voted for John Kerry and if you voted for Hillary Clinton, then  you should vote for Mike Pompeo as well. The White House press secretary  Sarah Sanders saying what's going on, on Capitol Hill sends this message to  the rest of the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What it says to the  world is what we've been saying for a long time, the Senate has got some  real problems, namely to figure out how to actually show up and do their  job a little bit better. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now if Pompeo is voted down by the Senate foreign relations  committee, Liz, that would be the first time that would ever happen to a  secretary of state nominee if they eventually go on to become in that  position. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow, historic times, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And by the way both Democrats and Republicans voted for Pompeo  as CIA director. </p><p>BURMAN:  Yes, CIA director.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  You as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senate foreign relations committee, as Blake Burman just noted  is about -- they are about to vote on Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state.  Rand Paul tweeting out he will support the nomination he was against it. </p><p>Last month President Trump announced the departure of Rex Tillerson as  secretary of state and as nomination of Pompeo as the replacement. Now the  thinking is if it gets to the full chamber Pompeo will become the secretary  of state. Just going through this process right now, we're monitoring the  vote for you in the beginning.</p><p>Let's get to what's going on with the French visit. The media says this is  going to be a bad relationship. Got off to a rocky start but now, French  President Macron even taking a line from President Trump ahead of today's  state visit to the White House. Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE We have this very special relationship  because both of us are probably the maverick of the system, on both sides I  think President Trump's election was unexpected in your country, and  probably my election wasn't expected in my country, and we are not part of  the political system. I'm here to serve my people and my country and make  it great again, somebody I know very well could say, but that's it, that's  the whole story. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joining me now, Weekly Standard executive editor, Fred Barnes.  Fred, make France great again, did you hear that? </p><p>FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes, look, Macron, this  is, he is so sure, so smart, so likable, and Trump is just basking in and  he's getting everything he wants and Macron fought a big war and he wants  to make sure that Trump doesn't get out of the Iran nuclear deal and that  he gets back in the Paris accord, I think not much chance for that. </p><p>But he is smart. He is the big European leader who has stepped forward to  embrace Trump, not endorse him but give Trump somebody big to deal with. It  isn't going to be England, it isn't going to be what's the name, Angela  Merkel in Germany comes in I think on Friday and that's just a bit of a  sour puss and doesn't get along with Trump. But Macron has made an effort  here and it's very wise on his part. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, here is the thing. We've got that May 12 deadline for  the Iran deal. </p><p>BARNES:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  The president is expected to yank it saying he already said  this is the worst deal ever. So, and you're right, we've got Angela Merkel  coming in. You know, Fred, these state visits are coming at a time when  economic growth is up, optimism is up, the media reporting how the  Democrats may take back control of the House. </p><p>The president seems to be dominating the message, when people go to vote  they say, what are you going to do for me? </p><p>BARNES:  Yes, look, I wouldn't buy this line from the Democrats and from a  lot of people in the media that there's a blue wave coming and Democrats  are just going to sweep through and win the House and maybe the Senate in  November. </p><p>They do very well that would be what happens historically in the first mid- term election for a new president, but Trump is the dominant figure here  and he has got some very optimistic things to talk about, not just the  economy but in foreign policy as well. </p><p>Look, Macron was one of those who joined in the attack on the plants in  Syria where they mix and made the poisonous product that were used to kill  so many Syrians, so look, they worked together before and I think they'll  work together again, particularly here. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Macron has pointed out that they're both maverick  outsiders. </p><p>BARNES:  They are. </p><p>MACDONALD:  They're both businessmen, they're not part of the classical  political system. Both were elected on the first try. It seems like these  two men have a lot in common. So we've got the D.C. media up in arms  saying, you know, this is again it's going to be problems here with the  state visit, certainly with Angela Merkel, they're raising the red flags  about it. What do you see? </p><p>BARNES:  Well, look, I'll tell you what the media really wants and they're  going to hound poor Macron while he's here. They want him to dump on Trump  and he is refusing to do it, wouldn't be smart to do it. </p><p>MACDONALD:  How are they going -- how are they going to get the French  president to dump on President Trump? </p><p>BARNES:  Well, he's going to have a press conference among other things,  they'll yell questions at him, and look, they have ways to get that  question asked, but Macron is I think not going to do it. What purpose of  his would it serve? He says he's here to deal with the president of the  United States. He doesn't have to and doesn't have to comment personally on  Trump. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what, to your point, Fred, and it's an important one.  The media again, is misreading the situation.</p><p>BARNES:  I think so.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Macron likes his relationship with Trump because it improves  his own basically rookie standing with the E.U. He's now being called the  Trump whisperer. Macron is not going to damage that. He's not going to  damage how important he is now to the E.U. given his relationship with  Trump. </p><p>BARNES:  I think you're absolutely right. It serves his purpose very well.  Now, will Macron be able to talk Trump into not getting out of the Iran  deal, will he be able to talk him to getting into Paris climate accord? I  don't think so on either one of those things, but he'll get credit for  trying. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Fred Barnes. Great stuff. Come back soon. </p><p>BARNES:  OK.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now let's get to this fast moving stock as Google parent  Alphabet reporting strong earnings and revenue after the bell. It's been  doing that every quarter since 2010. The stock is moving after-hours.  another great quarter for Google. But now, this. A new report Google does  get more personal information about you than even Facebook, as Deirdre  Bolton just said 8 to 10 times of Facebook. We're going to show you the  details.</p><p>We're also monitoring that Senate foreign relationships vote of Mike Pompeo  as secretary of state. Rand Paul breaking news here, just putting out he  will vote for Michael Pompeo, when the vote comes we're going to bring it  to you. Liberal newspapers now supporting Pompeo. We're going to show who.</p><p>But first, we're also watching President Trump and the first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife at the White House for the  administration's first official state dinner. We're going to bring that to  you live as well, jam-packed hour, really busy hour ahead, don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Back to this breaking news. We are monitoring French President  Emmanuel Macron he's about to appear at the White House any second, but the  first lady and the president will greet the French president and Mrs.  Macron at the White House.</p><p>Let's bring in Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor Katrina Pierson. It's a  historic visit, Katrina, now even President Macron effectively saying you  know what? President is the president to the American people, he's giving  that message the American people will deal with it. He's the president. </p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISOR:  Absolutely. This truly is a  refreshing display of leadership. You have two leaders who don't agree 100  percent on all of the policy positions but who have become friends and  respect each other as leaders and now we're here having a great visit. I  fully expect President Macron to make his case, with regards to trade and  Syria and Iraq. But here, I mean, Iran.</p><p>So here is the thing. President Trump is going to consider the president of  France as counsel absolutely as a courtesy, Liz. But let's make no mistake.  The president of the United States will be making policy for the United  States so I think this is a great opportunity for many in our own country  to see how elected leaders should act.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, to your point, it's well taken. Because the thinking  in the E.U. as President Macron is the leading edge of that wedge to get  the president to step back on the Iran deal, dial back on, you know, the  tariffs, and the potential trade wars, and also climate change. But your  point is President Trump is not going to do that, right? </p><p>PIERSON:  No, I don't think so because these are things that the president  has hold very dear and we've seen it throughout the campaign. You can go  all the way back to the 80s on some of these positions. But I do think he  would consider the counsel, but at the same time the president has made a  commitment to the United States and that is to put America and its people  first. That is not going to change. And I think the president of France  respects the president's opinion as well.</p><p>And when we look at the things like Iran, for example, the president was  very adamant on making some significant changes, things that a lot of  people agree with, regardless of how we entered this deal. We have a new  leader of the United States and he wants to have input. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So again, we're monitoring this situation unfolding right now  at the White House. You're looking at a live action shot of the White  House, the president of France with the first lady of France expected to  appear momentarily to greet the president and first lady Melania Trump. </p><p>President Macron to your point, Katrina, is expected to press President  Trump on trade. Here is what he said over the weekend. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACRON:  You cannot make it through the wall with the allies, it's too  complicated. If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade war  against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against them,  come on, it doesn't work. You need ally. We are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, so here is the messaging problem right for the president?  Katrina, he's got to say listen we're not talking about trade war. We're  talking about fair trade and the E.U. needs to get that message China has  not been fair. Go ahead. </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, absolutely, and we keep hearing that the president is doing  this to everyone else when in fact, everyone else has done this to the  United States and the president is simply saying look, we need fair and  reciprocal trade. </p><p>At the end of the day that's what going to matter. Many people in our own  country have doubted his ability to make these deals and to get things  done, but if you look at ISIS and tax reform he's even been bringing North  Korea to the table. So the president is actually doing things right. It  might be different, but we're actually getting things done. </p><p>And I think President Macron is going to get to hear President Trump's  position on these things as well. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Here is an unfolding breaking news situation and it's happening  right now with Russia and Iran as it pertains to the E.U. Katrina, to your  point, record amounts of U.S. oil is now flooding into E.U. markets, that  deal with Iran that Obama struck, there's a May 12 deadline that is looming  the president could yank what he says is the worst deal ever and impose  sanctions.</p><p>Again, Iran is backed by Russia, Russia supplies a lot of oil and Nat gas  to the E.U. We are just hearing the breaking news that the U.S. is now  becoming the number one oil exporter into the E.U changing geopolitical  landscape in the favor of the U.S. right here, Katrina. </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, and that's exactly what we call making America great again,  and President Trump knows one thing and that is leverage. He wrote about  it. And he knows and the world knows that if the president was to pull out  of the Iran deal, perhaps go back to the sanctions on the Iran central bank  or oil exports it's going to be a problem. </p><p>But these are things like, you know, looking at including the long range  missiles and you know, eliminating the sunset provision on things like I  don't know, you're reaching -- enriching uranium which is a huge problem  for Iran.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>PIERSON:  And the president of France they need to understand is we don't  see the dust to France chance coming out of Iran like we see coming from  Iran to America.</p><p>MACDONALD:  To you--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PIERSON:  And President Trump takes that very seriously.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, they are now as you can see at the White House raising  the welcoming flags 15 months into his presidency, the president is finally  rolling out the red carpet for the president of France and what will happen  after Macron appears they will go for a sunset dinner on the terrace of  George Washington's home in Mount Vernon overlooking the Potomac. </p><p>Katrina, Macron is expected to, to your point, really prep the president on  the Iran deal. He is the leader, he's seen by the E.U. as the Trump whisper  that he can basically coax the president into staying in the Iran deal.  Macron, though, watch this, Katrina, admitting though that that deal as the  president has said has flaws. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACRON:  It this as if agreement perfect and this JCPOA a perfect thing for  our relationship with Iran, no. But for nuclear, what do you have as a  better option? I don't see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  The car is now rolling up with the leader of France so Macron  says that they would finish the war against ISIS. If we leave, we leave it  open to Iran and Syria, they are going to fuel a new terrorist war. What  are your thoughts? </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, I think President Trump is also coming at this from a  different perspective. You know, we've had this, that we've been doing the  same thing over and over again expecting different results and President  Trump doesn't want to do that anymore and he's not saying end it  altogether, he wants to make revisions. </p><p>And now that we see that they're cracking down on anti-government  protesters that's a problem particularly if we're just going to sit back  and allow this to happen not really knowing what's going on. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Let me break in here. The president is just stepping  outside the White House with the first lady ready to greet the president of  France, and Mrs. Macron as well. Tomorrow night there will be a state  dinner and a break with tradition, President Trump has invited no Democrat  members of Congress or journalists. About 150 guests will take their seats  in the state ding room tomorrow night. </p><p>It's going to be a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack  Obama. Obama's guest list went into the hundreds and the president really  wants to keep this close relationship. And here he is, the president of  France greeting and a hug with the president of the United States. Let's  watch this and let this moment sink in. </p><p>OK, Katrina, what we're watching now is a warm embrace between the leader  of France and his wife is with the leader of the United States. It looks  really quite collegial; they are now turning for the official photograph. </p><p>Katrina, Trump seems, the president seems to be going all out on pomp and  circumstance. That's how much he had in Paris last July when the president  of France invited him to watch the annual Bastille Day. What's your  reaction to rolling out the red carpet for the president of France? </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, it is Donald Trump, Liz, so I think we can fully expect the  best with the president and Melania who, you know, is a class act in and of  her own. I mean, it's just an amazing opportunity for us to all see what  we're seeing right now and that is, you know, refreshing leadership,  bringing two countries together, even though they have their differences,  willing to work together for what they do agree upon. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Our allies, Katrina, for 50 years. Katrina Pierson, thank you  so much for weighing in there. I really appreciate it.</p><p>PIERSON:  Great to be here. Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We're also monitoring this breaking developing situation,  we're moments away from the Senate foreign relations vote on the nomination  of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Not the final  confirmation the full chamber is expected to vote for Pompeo. A rebuke  tough, Senate foreign relations don't want him. We're going to bring you  that breaking news as it comes in. Don't go away, stay with us, more after  the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS:  At some point, Democrats have to decide whether they love this  country more than they hate this president, and they have to decide that  they want to put the safety and the security and the diplomacy of our  country ahead of their own political games, and we're very hopeful that  they will. </p><p>Mike Pompeo is a highly qualified individual. He's been one of the leading  people when it comes to the negotiations and the conversations with North  Korea, and to stop that would be a incredibly dangerous and damaging for  our country and for the world. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We're staying in breaking news mode. We've got more  developments, look at this. Republican Senator Jeff Flake now a yes on the  nomination. He will vote yes that Pompeo should be secretary of state with  Rand Paul. That means the Senate foreign relations panel is doing a 180. </p><p>Instead of rebuking this nomination it looks like the Senate foreign  relations panel will confirm Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p>Let's bring in the Daily Caller editorial director, Vince Coglianese. What  a turn around, Vince? </p><p>VINCE COGLIANESE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, DAILY CALLER:  That's quite a change of  events. Rand Paul, of course the big hold out, you mentioned Jeff Flake as  well, but Rand Paul, the president saying in public that he wanted to see  Rand come with him, and that is happening, that's a huge deal. </p><p>And it's important that the Senate foreign relations committee do this,  give him a stamp of approval given the unheard-of nature of sending out  somebody with disapproval to be voted on by the full Senate approve. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's right. Let's get to the viewer, he comes out of  Senate foreign relations, it looks like the Senate foreign relations panel  does vote yes saying, yes, Pompeo should be the next secretary of state.  Then it goes to the full Senate where Pompeo is expected to be confirmed as  secretary of state. </p><p>You know, here's the thing, initially, Vince, the storyline was that, you  know, they didn't like Pompeo's position on Iran.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  They thought he was too much of a hawk. He was supposed to be  the easy confirmation. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes</p><p>MACDONALD:  He was supposed to be the no-brainer, and all of a sudden he  was a problem that even Democrats and Republicans who voted for him as CIA  director were saying, no, we don't want him as secretary of state in the  middle of the North Korea breakthroughs. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Right. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I mean, it is a stunning, you know, revelation of what's going  on in D.C. when you have historic developments going on with North Korea.  And they're saying no to Pompeo when he's trying to strike these deals. Go  ahead.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes. And it was a temper tantrum that lead them to that  conclusion, and I say that because this was a referendum on Trump. And all  of the assessments that we've heard from Democrats it was about -- it was  about Mike Pompeo's insufficient because he's not going to rein in Trump's  worth instincts. </p><p>There's no evidence for that. As the head of the CIA, he's had an  unblemished career there, he's had a good career prior to that as well. He  was, as you said, confirmed by the Senate to run the CIA before including  with Democratic support, and now he's got the opportunity to be secretary  of state. </p><p>And there's such an important resume item there for Mike Pompeo, and you  mentioned it. It's the fact that he's leading negotiations with North  Korea. This is an historic moment in terms of just having a U.S. official  leading such a high-level negotiation with North Korea. </p><p>To throw him out, to get rid of him as secretary of state would be a  preposterous exercise in politics--</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  -- and one the Democrats should not suffer right now because  if they do, they will suffer politically in the future politically for  making such a horrendous decision. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, historians and analysts have already said if the  president gets that North Korea deal, it will be on the level of  Reagan/Gorbachev. </p><p>We have three liberal newspapers saying, you know what? Obstructionist  Democrats, stop. You have to put Pompeo in as secretary of state. The  president needs be a secretary of state. They are, USA Today, a writer at  the Washington Post, and the New York Daily News. Your final reaction,  Vince. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Well, only that Barack Obama was given a Nobel Peace prize the  moment he came into office for doing nothing. If this is accomplished, as  you were mentioning, a peaceful North Korea of any kind, a meaningful peace  and one that draws down nuclear weapons, then I expect that Donald Trump  will receive a nomination for it, not that the Nobel Prize committee will  ever seriously consider him. </p><p>He's not exactly beloved by the globalist communist, but Mike Pompeo should  be right up there on that stage accepting the same thing. We have a long  way to go before we get there, but this is a big deal, and Mike Pompeo  should clear the bar at the United States Senate. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Great to see you, Vince. </p><p>Let's take you back to the White House. A truly lovely event is about to  be, take place right now. The two couples will plant a tree. It's a gift  from the president and president of France and Mrs. Macron they are going  to plant a tree, a sapling, a European oak on the South Lawn of the White  House about four and a half feet tall. </p><p>We're going to bring that to you live as it happens. Interesting note here,  First lady Melania Trump is really taking the lead here in organizing this  historic visit. </p><p>Quick, we're going to have more after the break. Also we're staying on the  situation in Toronto, that van plowing down pedestrians. Nine dead, 17  injured, seven critically. We're going to bring you the latest on that. A  suspect has been arrested. No motive yet. We will bring that to you live.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The nightmare, I've got to Yonge, and I've seen a lady  with her leg -- man, it was a gruesome scene. It's really bad out there. I  couldn't believe what I've seen, man. It was, man. Everybody, all these  people on the streets getting hit one by one. Post office boxes getting  crumpled up on people. And one person got dragged on and their blood is all  over Yonge. It's really bad out there, man. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We are basically are watching the president with the first  lady and the leader of France and the first lady of France now stepping out  of the portico, the White House. They're now going to enter the South Lawn. </p><p>There's first lady Melania right there. She's been organizing this historic  state visit. It is the White House's first state visit 15 months into the  Trump presidency. </p><p>They're going to plant a tree on the South Lawn. It is a gift from France  to the United States. It is a European oak sapling, four and a half feet  tall. </p><p>We have lieutenant general Thomas McInerney here. Sir, this is a developing  situation as well. General, the E.U. is look to the president of France to  coax President Donald Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. Your  reaction. </p><p>THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE:  Well, it's natural, and  they send President Macron over here to use him because he probably has the  best relationship of any of the European leaders right now, so I'm not  surprise. I do not think the president is going to change. He knows what he  wants to do. </p><p>The Europeans on the Iranian deal, it's purely a cash cow. They're ignoring  the nuclear threat per se. It's cash. They've got a huge trade surplus  going, and they're working it to their advantage. But that's not good  enough. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, it seems when you read, study what the president of  France, general, has been saying about ISIS leaving Syria and Iran's  growing presence with military bases in Syria, on the one hand the  president of France is saying as soon as -- if we leave, if we, the United  States, leave Syria, Iran will step in and cause terrorist activities to go  on the increase. </p><p>But at the same time, he wants the president to stay in the Iran nuclear  deal. Can you square this for the viewer, can you explain that and sort  that out? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Yes, I'll make it very simple. We should stay with the limited  number of people in Syria with 24/7 air power, so if they try to take over  any of the Kurdish places or the Syrian allies, then we can use that air  power to beat them down and to defeat them. </p><p>Now, as far as the nuclear deal goes, that was such a bad deal that no  agreement should ever have been made, the JCPOA, Liz. And we should back  out of that from both a military and a political point of view. Again,  remember, the European Union's interest is primarily in trade. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Let me just give you some background information about the tree  that was just planted. There is historic information about the reason that  France gave the United States and the White House this tree. </p><p>Over 9,000 American marines died in World War I in what's called the  Belleau Wood, this tree is from the area of that battle in June 1918 where  9,000 American marines died in World War I. That as far is a memorial site.  It's an important symbol of the sacrifice the United States made to insure  peace and stability in Europe.</p><p>General, your reaction to the president of France giving this oak tree to  the United States in commemoration of World War I marines dying there. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Liz, it's very, very symbolic. The Battle of Belleau Wood was a  horrendous battle. We lost, as you said, 9,000 marines. And to make this  tree come from that region really touches on our relationship. And I think  it is a very symbolic gesture by President Macron and symbolic of the  relationship between the president and President Trump. </p><p>MACDONALD:  What does this do for the psyche of the Trump administration,  to have these memorable events come up and in the ensuing days? This will  be a three-day visit, the president of Germany -- Germany, rather, Angela  Merkel will be coming on Friday. How does this set the scene for the  presidency of Donald Trump? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, I think it establishes it on a high note. People are  seeing the way the Trumps handle their visitors and the relationships  developing. The left has always wanted to deny that President Trump had  that capability. He's absolutely brilliant at it. You're seeing it today  and you'll see it at dinner tonight at Mount Vernon and the state dinner  they have. </p><p>The whole three days that the Macrons are here and how they're honored is  going to show the world and the American people what a great leader  President Trump and Mrs. Trump are. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We will be covering the Chancellor of Germany's visit, Angela  Merkel as well, coming later this week. Good to see you, general. Thanks  for coming in. I really appreciate it. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Thank, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We are moments away from that Senate foreign relations vote on  the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Breaking  news, it looks like that Senate panel will vote for Mike Pompeo to be  secretary of state. </p><p>Jeff Flake and Rand Paul now saying they will vote for Michael Pompeo as  secretary of state. </p><p>We're going to take you back to Toronto, van mowed down nine people, and  injuring 16, killing nine in Toronto. We're going to bring you the latest  on that after the break. Don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Being confirm for you tonight, right now, we have nine  people that are dead. Sixteen that are injured. Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources, and I can assure the public all our  available resources have been brought in to address this tragic situation. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Take you to the developments in Toronto. Driver now in custody  after plowing a van into a crowd leaving nine people dead, sixteen injured,  seven critically. Toronto authorities held the press conference just  moments ago. We still do not know the driver's identity and his motive, we  will bring that to you as soon as it comes in. </p><p>General, listen, we have seen numerous van attacks like this and vehicular  attacks, a dozen since 2006, general. We've seen them in England, we've  seen them in Germany and Spain. And, of course, in Canada, as well as the  U.S. Your reaction, sir. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, it looks like a cookie cutter, Liz. By the rental van,  the number of people -- nine dead and 16 injured -- all the makings of  radical Islam. All I need to know is the driver's name and a little more  background, but I would say there's a 90 percent chance that this is  radical Islam. It wasn't an old man that had a heart attack or a stroke. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Again, we don't know the motive just yet. But we do know the  facts about prior vehicular attacks. Let's talk about that. Again, we don't  know the motive in Toronto. </p><p>General, you know, the terror capability has shifted. It is very difficult  for terrorists -- we're not saying this is terrorism -- it's difficult for  them to get bombs and explosives. It is easy for them to do vehicular  attacks. Your reaction to that. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, that's exactly what ISIS is telling their warriors across  the world, use vehicular attacks. And you can see all the ones that they've  done in the last year rather than explosives or even weapons, although  London are getting a lot of knives over there. But the fact is that is now  their modus operandi, and it's something that we should be cognizant of,  and it's very, very difficult to stop, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, and to your point, the days of the terror cell are  over. Now I think, to your point, terrorists -- and, again, we don't know  the motives of this attack. It has the hallmark of a terrorist attack.  Again, we'll bring you the motive as soon as it breaks. </p><p>To your point, general, you have said this before, ISIS and radical  terrorist leaders are saying stay in place and do your own terrorism. This  is a form of micro terrorism, right? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Exactly. And it's the patterns of behavior that I look at,  that's my business, patterns of behavior. And this is what you're seeing  now spread across all the cities in Europe as well as the United States in  New York City, for instance, where you are. And so this is what we must  expect, and it's extremely difficult to counter this. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, it's a senseless act of violence. What do you say to  the viewer out there, you know, these are just pedestrians walking on one  of Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, it's just near downtown Toronto. Are we  supposed to be having security barricades on every major block in every  urban area, every city? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  They would like that, but we're not going to do that. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Why would they like that? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Because that means the western world is being influenced by the  radical Islamists, to their way of thinking. They are putting control on  what we do just like when we go to an airport and all the checks we go  through. They like that. </p><p>But the fact is we've got to defeat this Islamic terrorism where the  ideology comes from, Mecca and Medina from the Middle East, and that's the  Muslims themselves. They must do that. And I'm hopeful that the new crown  prince of Saudi Arabia will be the leader against the radical Islamists in  his region so that they are no longer holy warriors and will go to paradise  for killing infidels. No, we must destroy that ideology. </p><p>MACDONALD:  It should be noted too that in Toronto a group of seven  security international meeting was occurring just up -- a few blocks away  from that terror attack. If we think -- let me back up, we don't know if  it's a terror attack, it has the hallmarks of that. Sir, you know, what are  the authorities asking this suspect right now? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, first of all, they want to get his name, and then you  want to get where he goes to church, what his basic beliefs are, what is  the reason he did this. If one person was killed, fine, that happens. But  not nine people. Not nine people. </p><p>MACDONALD:  General, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in  and handling two stories. I really appreciate it. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Again, we're going to take you back to the White House. This is  -- we're in breaking news mode. The president and first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and the first lady of France, they're  about to leave for Mount Vernon for a dinner overlooking at the Potomac. We  will bring it to you live. That is the home of George Washington.</p><p>And we're also moments away from that vote out of the Senate panel on the  nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. It looks like  that panel will vote for Mike Pompeo. Jeff Flake and Rand Paul saying yes  to Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p>But first, after Facebook's data breach scandal, other big tech companies  like Google could be next to face scrutiny over its data privacy practices.  We're on that story for you coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  After Facebook's data breach and data mining scandal, other big  tech companies like Google they are now in the hot seat over their data  privacy practices. A new report shows Google is way worse than Facebook at  collecting and keeping your personal information. They've been  cyberstalking you all over the internet even if you're not on Google's web  site for something else. </p><p>Let's take a look at how the stock of -- the stock of Google's parent  company Alphabet did after their company reporting slide to the downside,  and falling to less than 1 percent after hours. </p><p>Let's get to the panel on this. I want to bring in Danielle McLaughlin and  Kelsey Harkness. First to you, Kelsey, you know what's the creepiest part  of the story? It's that this Silicon Valley stalks you all over the  internet even though you're not on their web sites. That's the worse part  of the story. I don't think people realize that, Kelsey. </p><p>KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR REPORTER, DAILY SIGNAL:  Well, the level of outrage  directed at Google and Facebook is certainly understandable, but it's  really not surprising because Google and Facebook are billion dollar  companies--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, but isn't it creepy that Silicon Valley has all of the  information about what we're doing on the internet? </p><p>HARKNESS:  It's certainly creepy which is why Americans are upset about  this, but it's not surprising because they're not providing these services  for free. But I think what's important about these stories is that we don't  direct our anger towards the government and ask the government to regulate  the tech industry because the government, too, is collecting our personal  data. </p><p>Look at the CFBP, look at OPM, both of them had big, massive breaches. So  we need to let the free market solve this, we need to demand that tech  companies take it upon themselves to solve this and not get the government  involved in an area it really doesn't belong. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I used to be kind of OK with it, Danielle, and say, OK, you  know. But now I'm thinking, wait, this isn't good. To Kelsey's point, the  IRS has also had data breaches. The IRS knows a lot about our income. And  now Silicon Valley, Danielle knows too much about what we're doing on the  internet. I think it's kind of weird. </p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST:  It is weird, and it is a little  bit creepy, to your point. I think we have to make a decision societally  about who is going to regulate this. I take Kelsey's point about the notion  of the free market solving for this, but the free market hasn't solved for  this, and that's why we're in this position in the first place. </p><p>I actually do think that more like Europe -- which has very robust privacy  laws -- we should ask your government who are elected representative to  step in and make sure that these billion, trillion dollar companies in  Silicon Valley aren't just data mining. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Guys, I'm so sorry, we've got to break away because that Senate  vote on Mike Pompeo coming in, Rand Paul just now explaining why he changed  his vote. Let's listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAND PAUL, (R) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  I decided to go ahead and vote for  Director Pompeo because he's assured me that he's learned the lesson. Now,  time will tell if those assurances are true or not. And I won't say that --  I can say with absolute certainty I know what his opinions will be and how  they will come out over time, but I do take him at his word. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So they're about to vote, Kelsey, what's your reaction to this  180 out of Senate foreign relations now after that. Now the breaking news  it will, that panel will approve Mike Pompeo as secretary of state? What's  your reaction to the 180 here? </p><p>HARKNESS:  I think it's very good news. I think that it maybe appears  normal to a lot of Americans to hear that all Democrats are opposing  Pompeo's nomination, but this is not normal. Under the Obama administration  94 senators approved both Hillary Clinton and John Kerry for the same  position and, clearly, those are very divisive figures. </p><p>Mike Pompeo is very qualified to do this job and at a time when we are  about to enter into serious negotiations with North Korea, President Trump  needs a secretary of state by his side. </p><p>MACDONALD:  What do you think, Danielle? </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I do agree that we need a secretary of state at this very  crucial time in North Korea relations. What Rand Paul asked of Mike Pompeo  was two things, do you agree that war in the Middle East, more war in the  Middle East is destabilizing, number one, and number two, do you agree that  Iraq was a mistake? He got those reassurances from Mike Pompeo, and that's  what changed his vote. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Interesting. The vote is now underway. We're staying on top of  the vote. Final thought, Kelsey. </p><p>HARKNESS:  I think that this is good news for all Americans. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Kelsey and Danielle, thank you so much. We're up against a  hard break. The president and the president of France about to arrive at  Mount Vernon. We're going to stay on that story for you as well. Jam-packed  hour, don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. The Senate foreign relations committee now  voting for Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. Jeff Flake is yes, so as  Rand Paul. It goes to the full chamber for a vote where he is expected to  be confirmed as secretary of state. </p><p>We're also are waiting for President Trump and the first lady, the French  President Emmanuel Macron and his wife. They're headed to Mount Vernon, the  home of George Washington to have dinner overlooking the Potomac.</p><p>That does it for us. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources and I can assure the public all available  resources have been brought into address this tragic situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ELIZABETH MACDONALD, HOST, FOX NEWS:  Breaking news to the developing  situation in Toronto, a driver now in custody after plowing a van into a  crowd among Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, nine dead, 16 injured 17  critically. </p><p> I am Elizabeth MacDonald. This is Risk &amp; Reward. </p><p> The mayor of Toronto authorities just now holding a press conference, the  mayor saying it will likely be several days of disruption to the area  during the investigation. </p><p> Here with more let's get to Kristina Partsinevelos in the newsroom.  Kristina? </p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Yes, this event only  happened a few hours ago at 1.30 p.m. Eastern Time. A white van from the  company Ryder, it's a rental van company plowed on to the sidewalk, what  you're seeing right now, started to hit a few pedestrians. According to eye  witnesses the pedestrians asked the van to stop, the driver continued going  hitting more pedestrians. </p><p> And as you mentioned there are nine dead, 16 injured. There's still no word  yet about the motivation behind this van attack. You had the mayor just  speak very recently, the Mayor of Toronto that's John Tory, and he said we  are admired the around the world for being inclusive doesn't want anybody  to jump to conclusions just yet as to the motive behind this attack. </p><p> Very importantly to note as well, this is the remaining a Toronto  investigation not a national investigation with the RCMP, the Royal  Canadian Mountain Police, again, this is a Toronto investigation they are  not releasing the name of the driver of the van but they were able to bring  him into custody. </p><p> He seemed uninjured based off of several eye witness videos that I've seen  when they caught him, he happened to have something in his hand. There's  still no confirmation what he was carrying but he was pointing it at a  police officer. There were no shots fired. </p><p> Again, this man is in custody. We do not have any details just yet on who  he is, what his motivation is, are the Toronto police are being very  careful right now with the information, making sure going through to see if  he had any cell phones looking through his records to see most importantly  if he is somebody that they recognize, that they know and could be  affiliated with other people, but right now this is a Toronto  investigation. </p><p> You have several, 16 people still injured and businesses that have been  damaged along the road because this white van went up on to the sidewalk,  hit pedestrians, even rammed into a bus station. There was one eye witness  that said he saw his family they're looking for their grandfather and  they're very worried and I was just listening to this live through Canadian  media that they found the grandfather's glasses on the ground and so  they're still waiting confirmation. </p><p> Several of the patients or victims have been brought to Sunny Brook  Hospital in Toronto, again Sunny Brook Hospital, so again we have nine  dead, 16 injured in this tragic event that's happening in Toronto as we  speak. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Thank you, Kristina. We'll be staying on top of that story and  much more. </p><p> Let's get to your money. A widely held stock making lots of 401k plans  going up. Google parent company Alphabet reporting solid earnings and  revenues better than expected after the bell. </p><p> Let's get to Deirdre Bolton on the latest with that. Deirdre? </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Hey, Liz. So after-hours, you are  going to see this stock kind of see sawing back and forth. So it had a big  reaction as you mentioned, Alphabet, Google exceeding both on the top and  bottom line and you had a jump of around 4 percent initially, so you can  see still higher. </p><p> But just coming off those posted session highs, there are still some really  big questions out there, Liz, for the long term of this company. You know,  Google has between eight to 10 times more data on you and on me than  Facebook so a lot of Facebook investors were saying hey, how come Mark  Zuckerberg got dragged before Congress? </p><p> Google has about eight gigabytes of data per person, that equals about  2,000 hours if we just listen straight through of music. If you want a  comparison point Facebook has about 650 megabytes which are smaller than  gigabytes and that equals about 160 hours of music. So just an interesting  kind of data point and it just shows you where this data power is. </p><p> A lot of people are saying Google is one of a kind so if you are an  investor you like to hear that. The flip side is, will it make regulators  consider one of a kind akin to monopoly which is not too far of a stretch.</p><p> We do know that the European regulators are putting in new privacy laws as  of May 25th of this year so tech companies, ones that are based here but  have customers in Europe, need to be compliant. If these companies are not  compliant this is not a small slap on the wrist, Liz, it is between $30  million or 4 percent of annual revenue whichever is higher, so there's a  lot of people saying OK, Google has a lot of work ahead. Alphabet Google,  excuse me. Liz?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Deirdre. Thank you so much.</p><p> We have a jam packed busy hour ahead. We are moments away from President  Trump and the first lady welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and his  wife at the White House for the administration's first official state  dinner.</p><p> Let's get to Blake Burman with the latest. Blake? </p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  At the hour the French president  has a busy couple of days here in Washington, Liz. I think you can see  behind me that they are expecting Emmanuel Macron here at the White House  within the next few minutes or so. </p><p> The itinerary is as follows. The Macron family, him and his wife, rather,  and the president and first lady will head to dinner tonight to George  Washington's home followed by talks tomorrow, a state dinner and then he  addresses Congress on Wednesday. </p><p> The White House says these two have a great rapport, and part of the reason  why he's receiving the first state visit. However, it is also clear that  there are stark differences on a policy level, for example, there are trade  issues at hand, as well as different views on the Iran nuclear deal and the  Paris climate accord all will be discussed in the up upcoming days. </p><p> As we await Macron here at the White House, the White House as well also  has its eyes on the goings up on Capitol Hill as it relates to the Senate  foreign relations committee as the secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo  is set to get the thumbs down from the Senate foreign relations committee  it appears within the next few minutes or so.</p><p> All 10 Democrats plus the Republican Rand Paul expected to vote against  Pompeo to become the next secretary of state; however, Pompeo still  expected to get a vote on the Senate floor and there it appears as though  as if he will have the numbers to become the next secretary of state. </p><p> Today, two more Democrats came to his side saying that they would support  him, Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly, add to that Heidi Heitkamp to that group  as well. </p><p> The White House is trying to make the argument to the United States Senate  that if you voted for John Kerry and if you voted for Hillary Clinton, then  you should vote for Mike Pompeo as well. The White House press secretary  Sarah Sanders saying what's going on, on Capitol Hill sends this message to  the rest of the world.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What it says to the  world is what we've been saying for a long time, the Senate has got some  real problems, namely to figure out how to actually show up and do their  job a little bit better. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Now if Pompeo is voted down by the Senate foreign relations  committee, Liz, that would be the first time that would ever happen to a  secretary of state nominee if they eventually go on to become in that  position. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Wow, historic times, Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And by the way both Democrats and Republicans voted for Pompeo  as CIA director. </p><p> BURMAN:  Yes, CIA director.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  You as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senate foreign relations committee, as Blake Burman just noted  is about -- they are about to vote on Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state.  Rand Paul tweeting out he will support the nomination he was against it. </p><p> Last month President Trump announced the departure of Rex Tillerson as  secretary of state and as nomination of Pompeo as the replacement. Now the  thinking is if it gets to the full chamber Pompeo will become the secretary  of state. Just going through this process right now, we're monitoring the  vote for you in the beginning.</p><p> Let's get to what's going on with the French visit. The media says this is  going to be a bad relationship. Got off to a rocky start but now, French  President Macron even taking a line from President Trump ahead of today's  state visit to the White House. Watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE We have this very special relationship  because both of us are probably the maverick of the system, on both sides I  think President Trump's election was unexpected in your country, and  probably my election wasn't expected in my country, and we are not part of  the political system. I'm here to serve my people and my country and make  it great again, somebody I know very well could say, but that's it, that's  the whole story. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Joining me now, Weekly Standard executive editor, Fred Barnes.  Fred, make France great again, did you hear that? </p><p> FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes, look, Macron, this  is, he is so sure, so smart, so likable, and Trump is just basking in and  he's getting everything he wants and Macron fought a big war and he wants  to make sure that Trump doesn't get out of the Iran nuclear deal and that  he gets back in the Paris accord, I think not much chance for that. </p><p> But he is smart. He is the big European leader who has stepped forward to  embrace Trump, not endorse him but give Trump somebody big to deal with. It  isn't going to be England, it isn't going to be what's the name, Angela  Merkel in Germany comes in I think on Friday and that's just a bit of a  sour puss and doesn't get along with Trump. But Macron has made an effort  here and it's very wise on his part. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, here is the thing. We've got that May 12 deadline for  the Iran deal. </p><p> BARNES:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  The president is expected to yank it saying he already said  this is the worst deal ever. So, and you're right, we've got Angela Merkel  coming in. You know, Fred, these state visits are coming at a time when  economic growth is up, optimism is up, the media reporting how the  Democrats may take back control of the House. </p><p> The president seems to be dominating the message, when people go to vote  they say, what are you going to do for me? </p><p> BARNES:  Yes, look, I wouldn't buy this line from the Democrats and from a  lot of people in the media that there's a blue wave coming and Democrats  are just going to sweep through and win the House and maybe the Senate in  November. </p><p> They do very well that would be what happens historically in the first mid- term election for a new president, but Trump is the dominant figure here  and he has got some very optimistic things to talk about, not just the  economy but in foreign policy as well. </p><p> Look, Macron was one of those who joined in the attack on the plants in  Syria where they mix and made the poisonous product that were used to kill  so many Syrians, so look, they worked together before and I think they'll  work together again, particularly here. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Macron has pointed out that they're both maverick  outsiders. </p><p> BARNES:  They are. </p><p> MACDONALD:  They're both businessmen, they're not part of the classical  political system. Both were elected on the first try. It seems like these  two men have a lot in common. So we've got the D.C. media up in arms  saying, you know, this is again it's going to be problems here with the  state visit, certainly with Angela Merkel, they're raising the red flags  about it. What do you see? </p><p> BARNES:  Well, look, I'll tell you what the media really wants and they're  going to hound poor Macron while he's here. They want him to dump on Trump  and he is refusing to do it, wouldn't be smart to do it. </p><p> MACDONALD:  How are they going -- how are they going to get the French  president to dump on President Trump? </p><p> BARNES:  Well, he's going to have a press conference among other things,  they'll yell questions at him, and look, they have ways to get that  question asked, but Macron is I think not going to do it. What purpose of  his would it serve? He says he's here to deal with the president of the  United States. He doesn't have to and doesn't have to comment personally on  Trump. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know what, to your point, Fred, and it's an important one.  The media again, is misreading the situation.</p><p> BARNES:  I think so.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Macron likes his relationship with Trump because it improves  his own basically rookie standing with the E.U. He's now being called the  Trump whisperer. Macron is not going to damage that. He's not going to  damage how important he is now to the E.U. given his relationship with  Trump. </p><p> BARNES:  I think you're absolutely right. It serves his purpose very well.  Now, will Macron be able to talk Trump into not getting out of the Iran  deal, will he be able to talk him to getting into Paris climate accord? I  don't think so on either one of those things, but he'll get credit for  trying. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Fred Barnes. Great stuff. Come back soon. </p><p> BARNES:  OK.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now let's get to this fast moving stock as Google parent  Alphabet reporting strong earnings and revenue after the bell. It's been  doing that every quarter since 2010. The stock is moving after-hours.  another great quarter for Google. But now, this. A new report Google does  get more personal information about you than even Facebook, as Deirdre  Bolton just said 8 to 10 times of Facebook. We're going to show you the  details.</p><p> We're also monitoring that Senate foreign relationships vote of Mike Pompeo  as secretary of state. Rand Paul breaking news here, just putting out he  will vote for Michael Pompeo, when the vote comes we're going to bring it  to you. Liberal newspapers now supporting Pompeo. We're going to show who.</p><p> But first, we're also watching President Trump and the first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife at the White House for the  administration's first official state dinner. We're going to bring that to  you live as well, jam-packed hour, really busy hour ahead, don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Back to this breaking news. We are monitoring French President  Emmanuel Macron he's about to appear at the White House any second, but the  first lady and the president will greet the French president and Mrs.  Macron at the White House.</p><p> Let's bring in Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor Katrina Pierson. It's a  historic visit, Katrina, now even President Macron effectively saying you  know what? President is the president to the American people, he's giving  that message the American people will deal with it. He's the president. </p><p> KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISOR:  Absolutely. This truly is a  refreshing display of leadership. You have two leaders who don't agree 100  percent on all of the policy positions but who have become friends and  respect each other as leaders and now we're here having a great visit. I  fully expect President Macron to make his case, with regards to trade and  Syria and Iraq. But here, I mean, Iran.</p><p> So here is the thing. President Trump is going to consider the president of  France as counsel absolutely as a courtesy, Liz. But let's make no mistake.  The president of the United States will be making policy for the United  States so I think this is a great opportunity for many in our own country  to see how elected leaders should act.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, to your point, it's well taken. Because the thinking  in the E.U. as President Macron is the leading edge of that wedge to get  the president to step back on the Iran deal, dial back on, you know, the  tariffs, and the potential trade wars, and also climate change. But your  point is President Trump is not going to do that, right? </p><p> PIERSON:  No, I don't think so because these are things that the president  has hold very dear and we've seen it throughout the campaign. You can go  all the way back to the 80s on some of these positions. But I do think he  would consider the counsel, but at the same time the president has made a  commitment to the United States and that is to put America and its people  first. That is not going to change. And I think the president of France  respects the president's opinion as well.</p><p> And when we look at the things like Iran, for example, the president was  very adamant on making some significant changes, things that a lot of  people agree with, regardless of how we entered this deal. We have a new  leader of the United States and he wants to have input. </p><p> MACDONALD:  So again, we're monitoring this situation unfolding right now  at the White House. You're looking at a live action shot of the White  House, the president of France with the first lady of France expected to  appear momentarily to greet the president and first lady Melania Trump. </p><p> President Macron to your point, Katrina, is expected to press President  Trump on trade. Here is what he said over the weekend. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACRON:  You cannot make it through the wall with the allies, it's too  complicated. If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade war  against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against them,  come on, it doesn't work. You need ally. We are the ally.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, so here is the messaging problem right for the president?  Katrina, he's got to say listen we're not talking about trade war. We're  talking about fair trade and the E.U. needs to get that message China has  not been fair. Go ahead. </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, absolutely, and we keep hearing that the president is doing  this to everyone else when in fact, everyone else has done this to the  United States and the president is simply saying look, we need fair and  reciprocal trade. </p><p> At the end of the day that's what going to matter. Many people in our own  country have doubted his ability to make these deals and to get things  done, but if you look at ISIS and tax reform he's even been bringing North  Korea to the table. So the president is actually doing things right. It  might be different, but we're actually getting things done. </p><p> And I think President Macron is going to get to hear President Trump's  position on these things as well. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Here is an unfolding breaking news situation and it's happening  right now with Russia and Iran as it pertains to the E.U. Katrina, to your  point, record amounts of U.S. oil is now flooding into E.U. markets, that  deal with Iran that Obama struck, there's a May 12 deadline that is looming  the president could yank what he says is the worst deal ever and impose  sanctions.</p><p> Again, Iran is backed by Russia, Russia supplies a lot of oil and Nat gas  to the E.U. We are just hearing the breaking news that the U.S. is now  becoming the number one oil exporter into the E.U changing geopolitical  landscape in the favor of the U.S. right here, Katrina. </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, and that's exactly what we call making America great again,  and President Trump knows one thing and that is leverage. He wrote about  it. And he knows and the world knows that if the president was to pull out  of the Iran deal, perhaps go back to the sanctions on the Iran central bank  or oil exports it's going to be a problem. </p><p> But these are things like, you know, looking at including the long range  missiles and you know, eliminating the sunset provision on things like I  don't know, you're reaching -- enriching uranium which is a huge problem  for Iran.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> PIERSON:  And the president of France they need to understand is we don't  see the dust to France chance coming out of Iran like we see coming from  Iran to America.</p><p> MACDONALD:  To you--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PIERSON:  And President Trump takes that very seriously.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, they are now as you can see at the White House raising  the welcoming flags 15 months into his presidency, the president is finally  rolling out the red carpet for the president of France and what will happen  after Macron appears they will go for a sunset dinner on the terrace of  George Washington's home in Mount Vernon overlooking the Potomac. </p><p> Katrina, Macron is expected to, to your point, really prep the president on  the Iran deal. He is the leader, he's seen by the E.U. as the Trump whisper  that he can basically coax the president into staying in the Iran deal.  Macron, though, watch this, Katrina, admitting though that that deal as the  president has said has flaws. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MACRON:  It this as if agreement perfect and this JCPOA a perfect thing for  our relationship with Iran, no. But for nuclear, what do you have as a  better option? I don't see it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  The car is now rolling up with the leader of France so Macron  says that they would finish the war against ISIS. If we leave, we leave it  open to Iran and Syria, they are going to fuel a new terrorist war. What  are your thoughts? </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, I think President Trump is also coming at this from a  different perspective. You know, we've had this, that we've been doing the  same thing over and over again expecting different results and President  Trump doesn't want to do that anymore and he's not saying end it  altogether, he wants to make revisions. </p><p> And now that we see that they're cracking down on anti-government  protesters that's a problem particularly if we're just going to sit back  and allow this to happen not really knowing what's going on. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Let me break in here. The president is just stepping  outside the White House with the first lady ready to greet the president of  France, and Mrs. Macron as well. Tomorrow night there will be a state  dinner and a break with tradition, President Trump has invited no Democrat  members of Congress or journalists. About 150 guests will take their seats  in the state ding room tomorrow night. </p><p> It's going to be a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack  Obama. Obama's guest list went into the hundreds and the president really  wants to keep this close relationship. And here he is, the president of  France greeting and a hug with the president of the United States. Let's  watch this and let this moment sink in. </p><p> OK, Katrina, what we're watching now is a warm embrace between the leader  of France and his wife is with the leader of the United States. It looks  really quite collegial; they are now turning for the official photograph. </p><p> Katrina, Trump seems, the president seems to be going all out on pomp and  circumstance. That's how much he had in Paris last July when the president  of France invited him to watch the annual Bastille Day. What's your  reaction to rolling out the red carpet for the president of France? </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, it is Donald Trump, Liz, so I think we can fully expect the  best with the president and Melania who, you know, is a class act in and of  her own. I mean, it's just an amazing opportunity for us to all see what  we're seeing right now and that is, you know, refreshing leadership,  bringing two countries together, even though they have their differences,  willing to work together for what they do agree upon. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Our allies, Katrina, for 50 years. Katrina Pierson, thank you  so much for weighing in there. I really appreciate it.</p><p> PIERSON:  Great to be here. Thank you. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We're also monitoring this breaking developing situation,  we're moments away from the Senate foreign relations vote on the nomination  of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Not the final  confirmation the full chamber is expected to vote for Pompeo. A rebuke  tough, Senate foreign relations don't want him. We're going to bring you  that breaking news as it comes in. Don't go away, stay with us, more after  the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SANDERS:  At some point, Democrats have to decide whether they love this  country more than they hate this president, and they have to decide that  they want to put the safety and the security and the diplomacy of our  country ahead of their own political games, and we're very hopeful that  they will. </p><p> Mike Pompeo is a highly qualified individual. He's been one of the leading  people when it comes to the negotiations and the conversations with North  Korea, and to stop that would be a incredibly dangerous and damaging for  our country and for the world. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We're staying in breaking news mode. We've got more  developments, look at this. Republican Senator Jeff Flake now a yes on the  nomination. He will vote yes that Pompeo should be secretary of state with  Rand Paul. That means the Senate foreign relations panel is doing a 180. </p><p> Instead of rebuking this nomination it looks like the Senate foreign  relations panel will confirm Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p> Let's bring in the Daily Caller editorial director, Vince Coglianese. What  a turn around, Vince? </p><p> VINCE COGLIANESE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, DAILY CALLER:  That's quite a change of  events. Rand Paul, of course the big hold out, you mentioned Jeff Flake as  well, but Rand Paul, the president saying in public that he wanted to see  Rand come with him, and that is happening, that's a huge deal. </p><p> And it's important that the Senate foreign relations committee do this,  give him a stamp of approval given the unheard-of nature of sending out  somebody with disapproval to be voted on by the full Senate approve. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, that's right. Let's get to the viewer, he comes out of  Senate foreign relations, it looks like the Senate foreign relations panel  does vote yes saying, yes, Pompeo should be the next secretary of state.  Then it goes to the full Senate where Pompeo is expected to be confirmed as  secretary of state. </p><p> You know, here's the thing, initially, Vince, the storyline was that, you  know, they didn't like Pompeo's position on Iran.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  They thought he was too much of a hawk. He was supposed to be  the easy confirmation. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes</p><p> MACDONALD:  He was supposed to be the no-brainer, and all of a sudden he  was a problem that even Democrats and Republicans who voted for him as CIA  director were saying, no, we don't want him as secretary of state in the  middle of the North Korea breakthroughs. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Right. </p><p> MACDONALD:  I mean, it is a stunning, you know, revelation of what's going  on in D.C. when you have historic developments going on with North Korea.  And they're saying no to Pompeo when he's trying to strike these deals. Go  ahead.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes. And it was a temper tantrum that lead them to that  conclusion, and I say that because this was a referendum on Trump. And all  of the assessments that we've heard from Democrats it was about -- it was  about Mike Pompeo's insufficient because he's not going to rein in Trump's  worth instincts. </p><p> There's no evidence for that. As the head of the CIA, he's had an  unblemished career there, he's had a good career prior to that as well. He  was, as you said, confirmed by the Senate to run the CIA before including  with Democratic support, and now he's got the opportunity to be secretary  of state. </p><p> And there's such an important resume item there for Mike Pompeo, and you  mentioned it. It's the fact that he's leading negotiations with North  Korea. This is an historic moment in terms of just having a U.S. official  leading such a high-level negotiation with North Korea. </p><p> To throw him out, to get rid of him as secretary of state would be a  preposterous exercise in politics--</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  -- and one the Democrats should not suffer right now because  if they do, they will suffer politically in the future politically for  making such a horrendous decision. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, historians and analysts have already said if the  president gets that North Korea deal, it will be on the level of  Reagan/Gorbachev. </p><p> We have three liberal newspapers saying, you know what? Obstructionist  Democrats, stop. You have to put Pompeo in as secretary of state. The  president needs be a secretary of state. They are, USA Today, a writer at  the Washington Post, and the New York Daily News. Your final reaction,  Vince. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Well, only that Barack Obama was given a Nobel Peace prize the  moment he came into office for doing nothing. If this is accomplished, as  you were mentioning, a peaceful North Korea of any kind, a meaningful peace  and one that draws down nuclear weapons, then I expect that Donald Trump  will receive a nomination for it, not that the Nobel Prize committee will  ever seriously consider him. </p><p> He's not exactly beloved by the globalist communist, but Mike Pompeo should  be right up there on that stage accepting the same thing. We have a long  way to go before we get there, but this is a big deal, and Mike Pompeo  should clear the bar at the United States Senate. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Great to see you, Vince. </p><p> Let's take you back to the White House. A truly lovely event is about to  be, take place right now. The two couples will plant a tree. It's a gift  from the president and president of France and Mrs. Macron they are going  to plant a tree, a sapling, a European oak on the South Lawn of the White  House about four and a half feet tall. </p><p> We're going to bring that to you live as it happens. Interesting note here,  First lady Melania Trump is really taking the lead here in organizing this  historic visit. </p><p> Quick, we're going to have more after the break. Also we're staying on the  situation in Toronto, that van plowing down pedestrians. Nine dead, 17  injured, seven critically. We're going to bring you the latest on that. A  suspect has been arrested. No motive yet. We will bring that to you live.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The nightmare, I've got to Yonge, and I've seen a lady  with her leg -- man, it was a gruesome scene. It's really bad out there. I  couldn't believe what I've seen, man. It was, man. Everybody, all these  people on the streets getting hit one by one. Post office boxes getting  crumpled up on people. And one person got dragged on and their blood is all  over Yonge. It's really bad out there, man. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We are basically are watching the president with the first  lady and the leader of France and the first lady of France now stepping out  of the portico, the White House. They're now going to enter the South Lawn. </p><p> There's first lady Melania right there. She's been organizing this historic  state visit. It is the White House's first state visit 15 months into the  Trump presidency. </p><p> They're going to plant a tree on the South Lawn. It is a gift from France  to the United States. It is a European oak sapling, four and a half feet  tall. </p><p> We have lieutenant general Thomas McInerney here. Sir, this is a developing  situation as well. General, the E.U. is look to the president of France to  coax President Donald Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. Your  reaction. </p><p> THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE:  Well, it's natural, and  they send President Macron over here to use him because he probably has the  best relationship of any of the European leaders right now, so I'm not  surprise. I do not think the president is going to change. He knows what he  wants to do. </p><p> The Europeans on the Iranian deal, it's purely a cash cow. They're ignoring  the nuclear threat per se. It's cash. They've got a huge trade surplus  going, and they're working it to their advantage. But that's not good  enough. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, it seems when you read, study what the president of  France, general, has been saying about ISIS leaving Syria and Iran's  growing presence with military bases in Syria, on the one hand the  president of France is saying as soon as -- if we leave, if we, the United  States, leave Syria, Iran will step in and cause terrorist activities to go  on the increase. </p><p> But at the same time, he wants the president to stay in the Iran nuclear  deal. Can you square this for the viewer, can you explain that and sort  that out? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Yes, I'll make it very simple. We should stay with the limited  number of people in Syria with 24/7 air power, so if they try to take over  any of the Kurdish places or the Syrian allies, then we can use that air  power to beat them down and to defeat them. </p><p> Now, as far as the nuclear deal goes, that was such a bad deal that no  agreement should ever have been made, the JCPOA, Liz. And we should back  out of that from both a military and a political point of view. Again,  remember, the European Union's interest is primarily in trade. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Let me just give you some background information about the tree  that was just planted. There is historic information about the reason that  France gave the United States and the White House this tree. </p><p> Over 9,000 American marines died in World War I in what's called the  Belleau Wood, this tree is from the area of that battle in June 1918 where  9,000 American marines died in World War I. That as far is a memorial site.  It's an important symbol of the sacrifice the United States made to insure  peace and stability in Europe.</p><p> General, your reaction to the president of France giving this oak tree to  the United States in commemoration of World War I marines dying there. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Liz, it's very, very symbolic. The Battle of Belleau Wood was a  horrendous battle. We lost, as you said, 9,000 marines. And to make this  tree come from that region really touches on our relationship. And I think  it is a very symbolic gesture by President Macron and symbolic of the  relationship between the president and President Trump. </p><p> MACDONALD:  What does this do for the psyche of the Trump administration,  to have these memorable events come up and in the ensuing days? This will  be a three-day visit, the president of Germany -- Germany, rather, Angela  Merkel will be coming on Friday. How does this set the scene for the  presidency of Donald Trump? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, I think it establishes it on a high note. People are  seeing the way the Trumps handle their visitors and the relationships  developing. The left has always wanted to deny that President Trump had  that capability. He's absolutely brilliant at it. You're seeing it today  and you'll see it at dinner tonight at Mount Vernon and the state dinner  they have. </p><p> The whole three days that the Macrons are here and how they're honored is  going to show the world and the American people what a great leader  President Trump and Mrs. Trump are. </p><p> MACDONALD:  We will be covering the Chancellor of Germany's visit, Angela  Merkel as well, coming later this week. Good to see you, general. Thanks  for coming in. I really appreciate it. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Thank, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  We are moments away from that Senate foreign relations vote on  the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Breaking  news, it looks like that Senate panel will vote for Mike Pompeo to be  secretary of state. </p><p> Jeff Flake and Rand Paul now saying they will vote for Michael Pompeo as  secretary of state. </p><p> We're going to take you back to Toronto, van mowed down nine people, and  injuring 16, killing nine in Toronto. We're going to bring you the latest  on that after the break. Don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Being confirm for you tonight, right now, we have nine  people that are dead. Sixteen that are injured. Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources, and I can assure the public all our  available resources have been brought in to address this tragic situation. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Take you to the developments in Toronto. Driver now in custody  after plowing a van into a crowd leaving nine people dead, sixteen injured,  seven critically. Toronto authorities held the press conference just  moments ago. We still do not know the driver's identity and his motive, we  will bring that to you as soon as it comes in. </p><p> General, listen, we have seen numerous van attacks like this and vehicular  attacks, a dozen since 2006, general. We've seen them in England, we've  seen them in Germany and Spain. And, of course, in Canada, as well as the  U.S. Your reaction, sir. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, it looks like a cookie cutter, Liz. By the rental van,  the number of people -- nine dead and 16 injured -- all the makings of  radical Islam. All I need to know is the driver's name and a little more  background, but I would say there's a 90 percent chance that this is  radical Islam. It wasn't an old man that had a heart attack or a stroke. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Again, we don't know the motive just yet. But we do know the  facts about prior vehicular attacks. Let's talk about that. Again, we don't  know the motive in Toronto. </p><p> General, you know, the terror capability has shifted. It is very difficult  for terrorists -- we're not saying this is terrorism -- it's difficult for  them to get bombs and explosives. It is easy for them to do vehicular  attacks. Your reaction to that. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, that's exactly what ISIS is telling their warriors across  the world, use vehicular attacks. And you can see all the ones that they've  done in the last year rather than explosives or even weapons, although  London are getting a lot of knives over there. But the fact is that is now  their modus operandi, and it's something that we should be cognizant of,  and it's very, very difficult to stop, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, and to your point, the days of the terror cell are  over. Now I think, to your point, terrorists -- and, again, we don't know  the motives of this attack. It has the hallmark of a terrorist attack.  Again, we'll bring you the motive as soon as it breaks. </p><p> To your point, general, you have said this before, ISIS and radical  terrorist leaders are saying stay in place and do your own terrorism. This  is a form of micro terrorism, right? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Exactly. And it's the patterns of behavior that I look at,  that's my business, patterns of behavior. And this is what you're seeing  now spread across all the cities in Europe as well as the United States in  New York City, for instance, where you are. And so this is what we must  expect, and it's extremely difficult to counter this. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, it's a senseless act of violence. What do you say to  the viewer out there, you know, these are just pedestrians walking on one  of Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, it's just near downtown Toronto. Are we  supposed to be having security barricades on every major block in every  urban area, every city? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  They would like that, but we're not going to do that. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Why would they like that? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Because that means the western world is being influenced by the  radical Islamists, to their way of thinking. They are putting control on  what we do just like when we go to an airport and all the checks we go  through. They like that. </p><p> But the fact is we've got to defeat this Islamic terrorism where the  ideology comes from, Mecca and Medina from the Middle East, and that's the  Muslims themselves. They must do that. And I'm hopeful that the new crown  prince of Saudi Arabia will be the leader against the radical Islamists in  his region so that they are no longer holy warriors and will go to paradise  for killing infidels. No, we must destroy that ideology. </p><p> MACDONALD:  It should be noted too that in Toronto a group of seven  security international meeting was occurring just up -- a few blocks away  from that terror attack. If we think -- let me back up, we don't know if  it's a terror attack, it has the hallmarks of that. Sir, you know, what are  the authorities asking this suspect right now? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, first of all, they want to get his name, and then you  want to get where he goes to church, what his basic beliefs are, what is  the reason he did this. If one person was killed, fine, that happens. But  not nine people. Not nine people. </p><p> MACDONALD:  General, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in  and handling two stories. I really appreciate it. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Again, we're going to take you back to the White House. This is  -- we're in breaking news mode. The president and first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and the first lady of France, they're  about to leave for Mount Vernon for a dinner overlooking at the Potomac. We  will bring it to you live. That is the home of George Washington.</p><p> And we're also moments away from that vote out of the Senate panel on the  nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. It looks like  that panel will vote for Mike Pompeo. Jeff Flake and Rand Paul saying yes  to Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p> But first, after Facebook's data breach scandal, other big tech companies  like Google could be next to face scrutiny over its data privacy practices.  We're on that story for you coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  After Facebook's data breach and data mining scandal, other big  tech companies like Google they are now in the hot seat over their data  privacy practices. A new report shows Google is way worse than Facebook at  collecting and keeping your personal information. They've been  cyberstalking you all over the internet even if you're not on Google's web  site for something else. </p><p> Let's take a look at how the stock of -- the stock of Google's parent  company Alphabet did after their company reporting slide to the downside,  and falling to less than 1 percent after hours. </p><p> Let's get to the panel on this. I want to bring in Danielle McLaughlin and  Kelsey Harkness. First to you, Kelsey, you know what's the creepiest part  of the story? It's that this Silicon Valley stalks you all over the  internet even though you're not on their web sites. That's the worse part  of the story. I don't think people realize that, Kelsey. </p><p> KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR REPORTER, DAILY SIGNAL:  Well, the level of outrage  directed at Google and Facebook is certainly understandable, but it's  really not surprising because Google and Facebook are billion dollar  companies--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, but isn't it creepy that Silicon Valley has all of the  information about what we're doing on the internet? </p><p> HARKNESS:  It's certainly creepy which is why Americans are upset about  this, but it's not surprising because they're not providing these services  for free. But I think what's important about these stories is that we don't  direct our anger towards the government and ask the government to regulate  the tech industry because the government, too, is collecting our personal  data. </p><p> Look at the CFBP, look at OPM, both of them had big, massive breaches. So  we need to let the free market solve this, we need to demand that tech  companies take it upon themselves to solve this and not get the government  involved in an area it really doesn't belong. </p><p> MACDONALD:  I used to be kind of OK with it, Danielle, and say, OK, you  know. But now I'm thinking, wait, this isn't good. To Kelsey's point, the  IRS has also had data breaches. The IRS knows a lot about our income. And  now Silicon Valley, Danielle knows too much about what we're doing on the  internet. I think it's kind of weird. </p><p> DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST:  It is weird, and it is a little  bit creepy, to your point. I think we have to make a decision societally  about who is going to regulate this. I take Kelsey's point about the notion  of the free market solving for this, but the free market hasn't solved for  this, and that's why we're in this position in the first place. </p><p> I actually do think that more like Europe -- which has very robust privacy  laws -- we should ask your government who are elected representative to  step in and make sure that these billion, trillion dollar companies in  Silicon Valley aren't just data mining. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Guys, I'm so sorry, we've got to break away because that Senate  vote on Mike Pompeo coming in, Rand Paul just now explaining why he changed  his vote. Let's listen. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RAND PAUL, (R) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  I decided to go ahead and vote for  Director Pompeo because he's assured me that he's learned the lesson. Now,  time will tell if those assurances are true or not. And I won't say that --  I can say with absolute certainty I know what his opinions will be and how  they will come out over time, but I do take him at his word. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  So they're about to vote, Kelsey, what's your reaction to this  180 out of Senate foreign relations now after that. Now the breaking news  it will, that panel will approve Mike Pompeo as secretary of state? What's  your reaction to the 180 here? </p><p> HARKNESS:  I think it's very good news. I think that it maybe appears  normal to a lot of Americans to hear that all Democrats are opposing  Pompeo's nomination, but this is not normal. Under the Obama administration  94 senators approved both Hillary Clinton and John Kerry for the same  position and, clearly, those are very divisive figures. </p><p> Mike Pompeo is very qualified to do this job and at a time when we are  about to enter into serious negotiations with North Korea, President Trump  needs a secretary of state by his side. </p><p> MACDONALD:  What do you think, Danielle? </p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I do agree that we need a secretary of state at this very  crucial time in North Korea relations. What Rand Paul asked of Mike Pompeo  was two things, do you agree that war in the Middle East, more war in the  Middle East is destabilizing, number one, and number two, do you agree that  Iraq was a mistake? He got those reassurances from Mike Pompeo, and that's  what changed his vote. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Interesting. The vote is now underway. We're staying on top of  the vote. Final thought, Kelsey. </p><p> HARKNESS:  I think that this is good news for all Americans. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Kelsey and Danielle, thank you so much. We're up against a  hard break. The president and the president of France about to arrive at  Mount Vernon. We're going to stay on that story for you as well. Jam-packed  hour, don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news. The Senate foreign relations committee now  voting for Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. Jeff Flake is yes, so as  Rand Paul. It goes to the full chamber for a vote where he is expected to  be confirmed as secretary of state. </p><p> We're also are waiting for President Trump and the first lady, the French  President Emmanuel Macron and his wife. They're headed to Mount Vernon, the  home of George Washington to have dinner overlooking the Potomac.</p><p> That does it for us. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources and I can assure the public all available  resources have been brought into address this tragic situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ELIZABETH MACDONALD, HOST, FOX NEWS:  Breaking news to the developing  situation in Toronto, a driver now in custody after plowing a van into a  crowd among Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, nine dead, 16 injured 17  critically. </p><p> I am Elizabeth MacDonald. This is Risk &amp; Reward. </p><p> The mayor of Toronto authorities just now holding a press conference, the  mayor saying it will likely be several days of disruption to the area  during the investigation. </p><p> Here with more let's get to Kristina Partsinevelos in the newsroom.  Kristina? </p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Yes, this event only  happened a few hours ago at 1.30 p.m. Eastern Time. A white van from the  company Ryder, it's a rental van company plowed on to the sidewalk, what  you're seeing right now, started to hit a few pedestrians. According to eye  witnesses the pedestrians asked the van to stop, the driver continued going  hitting more pedestrians. </p><p> And as you mentioned there are nine dead, 16 injured. There's still no word  yet about the motivation behind this van attack. You had the mayor just  speak very recently, the Mayor of Toronto that's John Tory, and he said we  are admired the around the world for being inclusive doesn't want anybody  to jump to conclusions just yet as to the motive behind this attack. </p><p> Very importantly to note as well, this is the remaining a Toronto  investigation not a national investigation with the RCMP, the Royal  Canadian Mountain Police, again, this is a Toronto investigation they are  not releasing the name of the driver of the van but they were able to bring  him into custody. </p><p> He seemed uninjured based off of several eye witness videos that I've seen  when they caught him, he happened to have something in his hand. There's  still no confirmation what he was carrying but he was pointing it at a  police officer. There were no shots fired. </p><p> Again, this man is in custody. We do not have any details just yet on who  he is, what his motivation is, are the Toronto police are being very  careful right now with the information, making sure going through to see if  he had any cell phones looking through his records to see most importantly  if he is somebody that they recognize, that they know and could be  affiliated with other people, but right now this is a Toronto  investigation. </p><p> You have several, 16 people still injured and businesses that have been  damaged along the road because this white van went up on to the sidewalk,  hit pedestrians, even rammed into a bus station. There was one eye witness  that said he saw his family they're looking for their grandfather and  they're very worried and I was just listening to this live through Canadian  media that they found the grandfather's glasses on the ground and so  they're still waiting confirmation. </p><p> Several of the patients or victims have been brought to Sunny Brook  Hospital in Toronto, again Sunny Brook Hospital, so again we have nine  dead, 16 injured in this tragic event that's happening in Toronto as we  speak. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Thank you, Kristina. We'll be staying on top of that story and  much more. </p><p> Let's get to your money. A widely held stock making lots of 401k plans  going up. Google parent company Alphabet reporting solid earnings and  revenues better than expected after the bell. </p><p> Let's get to Deirdre Bolton on the latest with that. Deirdre? </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Hey, Liz. So after-hours, you are  going to see this stock kind of see sawing back and forth. So it had a big  reaction as you mentioned, Alphabet, Google exceeding both on the top and  bottom line and you had a jump of around 4 percent initially, so you can  see still higher. </p><p> But just coming off those posted session highs, there are still some really  big questions out there, Liz, for the long term of this company. You know,  Google has between eight to 10 times more data on you and on me than  Facebook so a lot of Facebook investors were saying hey, how come Mark  Zuckerberg got dragged before Congress? </p><p> Google has about eight gigabytes of data per person, that equals about  2,000 hours if we just listen straight through of music. If you want a  comparison point Facebook has about 650 megabytes which are smaller than  gigabytes and that equals about 160 hours of music. So just an interesting  kind of data point and it just shows you where this data power is. </p><p> A lot of people are saying Google is one of a kind so if you are an  investor you like to hear that. The flip side is, will it make regulators  consider one of a kind akin to monopoly which is not too far of a stretch.</p><p> We do know that the European regulators are putting in new privacy laws as  of May 25th of this year so tech companies, ones that are based here but  have customers in Europe, need to be compliant. If these companies are not  compliant this is not a small slap on the wrist, Liz, it is between $30  million or 4 percent of annual revenue whichever is higher, so there's a  lot of people saying OK, Google has a lot of work ahead. Alphabet Google,  excuse me. Liz?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Deirdre. Thank you so much.</p><p> We have a jam packed busy hour ahead. We are moments away from President  Trump and the first lady welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and his  wife at the White House for the administration's first official state  dinner.</p><p> Let's get to Blake Burman with the latest. Blake? </p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  At the hour the French president  has a busy couple of days here in Washington, Liz. I think you can see  behind me that they are expecting Emmanuel Macron here at the White House  within the next few minutes or so. </p><p> The itinerary is as follows. The Macron family, him and his wife, rather,  and the president and first lady will head to dinner tonight to George  Washington's home followed by talks tomorrow, a state dinner and then he  addresses Congress on Wednesday. </p><p> The White House says these two have a great rapport, and part of the reason  why he's receiving the first state visit. However, it is also clear that  there are stark differences on a policy level, for example, there are trade  issues at hand, as well as different views on the Iran nuclear deal and the  Paris climate accord all will be discussed in the up upcoming days. </p><p> As we await Macron here at the White House, the White House as well also  has its eyes on the goings up on Capitol Hill as it relates to the Senate  foreign relations committee as the secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo  is set to get the thumbs down from the Senate foreign relations committee  it appears within the next few minutes or so.</p><p> All 10 Democrats plus the Republican Rand Paul expected to vote against  Pompeo to become the next secretary of state; however, Pompeo still  expected to get a vote on the Senate floor and there it appears as though  as if he will have the numbers to become the next secretary of state. </p><p> Today, two more Democrats came to his side saying that they would support  him, Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly, add to that Heidi Heitkamp to that group  as well. </p><p> The White House is trying to make the argument to the United States Senate  that if you voted for John Kerry and if you voted for Hillary Clinton, then  you should vote for Mike Pompeo as well. The White House press secretary  Sarah Sanders saying what's going on, on Capitol Hill sends this message to  the rest of the world.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What it says to the  world is what we've been saying for a long time, the Senate has got some  real problems, namely to figure out how to actually show up and do their  job a little bit better. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Now if Pompeo is voted down by the Senate foreign relations  committee, Liz, that would be the first time that would ever happen to a  secretary of state nominee if they eventually go on to become in that  position. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Wow, historic times, Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And by the way both Democrats and Republicans voted for Pompeo  as CIA director. </p><p> BURMAN:  Yes, CIA director.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  You as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senate foreign relations committee, as Blake Burman just noted  is about -- they are about to vote on Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state.  Rand Paul tweeting out he will support the nomination he was against it. </p><p> Last month President Trump announced the departure of Rex Tillerson as  secretary of state and as nomination of Pompeo as the replacement. Now the  thinking is if it gets to the full chamber Pompeo will become the secretary  of state. Just going through this process right now, we're monitoring the  vote for you in the beginning.</p><p> Let's get to what's going on with the French visit. The media says this is  going to be a bad relationship. Got off to a rocky start but now, French  President Macron even taking a line from President Trump ahead of today's  state visit to the White House. Watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE We have this very special relationship  because both of us are probably the maverick of the system, on both sides I  think President Trump's election was unexpected in your country, and  probably my election wasn't expected in my country, and we are not part of  the political system. I'm here to serve my people and my country and make  it great again, somebody I know very well could say, but that's it, that's  the whole story. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Joining me now, Weekly Standard executive editor, Fred Barnes.  Fred, make France great again, did you hear that? </p><p> FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes, look, Macron, this  is, he is so sure, so smart, so likable, and Trump is just basking in and  he's getting everything he wants and Macron fought a big war and he wants  to make sure that Trump doesn't get out of the Iran nuclear deal and that  he gets back in the Paris accord, I think not much chance for that. </p><p> But he is smart. He is the big European leader who has stepped forward to  embrace Trump, not endorse him but give Trump somebody big to deal with. It  isn't going to be England, it isn't going to be what's the name, Angela  Merkel in Germany comes in I think on Friday and that's just a bit of a  sour puss and doesn't get along with Trump. But Macron has made an effort  here and it's very wise on his part. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, here is the thing. We've got that May 12 deadline for  the Iran deal. </p><p> BARNES:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  The president is expected to yank it saying he already said  this is the worst deal ever. So, and you're right, we've got Angela Merkel  coming in. You know, Fred, these state visits are coming at a time when  economic growth is up, optimism is up, the media reporting how the  Democrats may take back control of the House. </p><p> The president seems to be dominating the message, when people go to vote  they say, what are you going to do for me? </p><p> BARNES:  Yes, look, I wouldn't buy this line from the Democrats and from a  lot of people in the media that there's a blue wave coming and Democrats  are just going to sweep through and win the House and maybe the Senate in  November. </p><p> They do very well that would be what happens historically in the first mid- term election for a new president, but Trump is the dominant figure here  and he has got some very optimistic things to talk about, not just the  economy but in foreign policy as well. </p><p> Look, Macron was one of those who joined in the attack on the plants in  Syria where they mix and made the poisonous product that were used to kill  so many Syrians, so look, they worked together before and I think they'll  work together again, particularly here. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Macron has pointed out that they're both maverick  outsiders. </p><p> BARNES:  They are. </p><p> MACDONALD:  They're both businessmen, they're not part of the classical  political system. Both were elected on the first try. It seems like these  two men have a lot in common. So we've got the D.C. media up in arms  saying, you know, this is again it's going to be problems here with the  state visit, certainly with Angela Merkel, they're raising the red flags  about it. What do you see? </p><p> BARNES:  Well, look, I'll tell you what the media really wants and they're  going to hound poor Macron while he's here. They want him to dump on Trump  and he is refusing to do it, wouldn't be smart to do it. </p><p> MACDONALD:  How are they going -- how are they going to get the French  president to dump on President Trump? </p><p> BARNES:  Well, he's going to have a press conference among other things,  they'll yell questions at him, and look, they have ways to get that  question asked, but Macron is I think not going to do it. What purpose of  his would it serve? He says he's here to deal with the president of the  United States. He doesn't have to and doesn't have to comment personally on  Trump. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know what, to your point, Fred, and it's an important one.  The media again, is misreading the situation.</p><p> BARNES:  I think so.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Macron likes his relationship with Trump because it improves  his own basically rookie standing with the E.U. He's now being called the  Trump whisperer. Macron is not going to damage that. He's not going to  damage how important he is now to the E.U. given his relationship with  Trump. </p><p> BARNES:  I think you're absolutely right. It serves his purpose very well.  Now, will Macron be able to talk Trump into not getting out of the Iran  deal, will he be able to talk him to getting into Paris climate accord? I  don't think so on either one of those things, but he'll get credit for  trying. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Fred Barnes. Great stuff. Come back soon. </p><p> BARNES:  OK.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now let's get to this fast moving stock as Google parent  Alphabet reporting strong earnings and revenue after the bell. It's been  doing that every quarter since 2010. The stock is moving after-hours.  another great quarter for Google. But now, this. A new report Google does  get more personal information about you than even Facebook, as Deirdre  Bolton just said 8 to 10 times of Facebook. We're going to show you the  details.</p><p> We're also monitoring that Senate foreign relationships vote of Mike Pompeo  as secretary of state. Rand Paul breaking news here, just putting out he  will vote for Michael Pompeo, when the vote comes we're going to bring it  to you. Liberal newspapers now supporting Pompeo. We're going to show who.</p><p> But first, we're also watching President Trump and the first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife at the White House for the  administration's first official state dinner. We're going to bring that to  you live as well, jam-packed hour, really busy hour ahead, don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Back to this breaking news. We are monitoring French President  Emmanuel Macron he's about to appear at the White House any second, but the  first lady and the president will greet the French president and Mrs.  Macron at the White House.</p><p> Let's bring in Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor Katrina Pierson. It's a  historic visit, Katrina, now even President Macron effectively saying you  know what? President is the president to the American people, he's giving  that message the American people will deal with it. He's the president. </p><p> KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISOR:  Absolutely. This truly is a  refreshing display of leadership. You have two leaders who don't agree 100  percent on all of the policy positions but who have become friends and  respect each other as leaders and now we're here having a great visit. I  fully expect President Macron to make his case, with regards to trade and  Syria and Iraq. But here, I mean, Iran.</p><p> So here is the thing. President Trump is going to consider the president of  France as counsel absolutely as a courtesy, Liz. But let's make no mistake.  The president of the United States will be making policy for the United  States so I think this is a great opportunity for many in our own country  to see how elected leaders should act.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, to your point, it's well taken. Because the thinking  in the E.U. as President Macron is the leading edge of that wedge to get  the president to step back on the Iran deal, dial back on, you know, the  tariffs, and the potential trade wars, and also climate change. But your  point is President Trump is not going to do that, right? </p><p> PIERSON:  No, I don't think so because these are things that the president  has hold very dear and we've seen it throughout the campaign. You can go  all the way back to the 80s on some of these positions. But I do think he  would consider the counsel, but at the same time the president has made a  commitment to the United States and that is to put America and its people  first. That is not going to change. And I think the president of France  respects the president's opinion as well.</p><p> And when we look at the things like Iran, for example, the president was  very adamant on making some significant changes, things that a lot of  people agree with, regardless of how we entered this deal. We have a new  leader of the United States and he wants to have input. </p><p> MACDONALD:  So again, we're monitoring this situation unfolding right now  at the White House. You're looking at a live action shot of the White  House, the president of France with the first lady of France expected to  appear momentarily to greet the president and first lady Melania Trump. </p><p> President Macron to your point, Katrina, is expected to press President  Trump on trade. Here is what he said over the weekend. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACRON:  You cannot make it through the wall with the allies, it's too  complicated. If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade war  against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against them,  come on, it doesn't work. You need ally. We are the ally.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, so here is the messaging problem right for the president?  Katrina, he's got to say listen we're not talking about trade war. We're  talking about fair trade and the E.U. needs to get that message China has  not been fair. Go ahead. </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, absolutely, and we keep hearing that the president is doing  this to everyone else when in fact, everyone else has done this to the  United States and the president is simply saying look, we need fair and  reciprocal trade. </p><p> At the end of the day that's what going to matter. Many people in our own  country have doubted his ability to make these deals and to get things  done, but if you look at ISIS and tax reform he's even been bringing North  Korea to the table. So the president is actually doing things right. It  might be different, but we're actually getting things done. </p><p> And I think President Macron is going to get to hear President Trump's  position on these things as well. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Here is an unfolding breaking news situation and it's happening  right now with Russia and Iran as it pertains to the E.U. Katrina, to your  point, record amounts of U.S. oil is now flooding into E.U. markets, that  deal with Iran that Obama struck, there's a May 12 deadline that is looming  the president could yank what he says is the worst deal ever and impose  sanctions.</p><p> Again, Iran is backed by Russia, Russia supplies a lot of oil and Nat gas  to the E.U. We are just hearing the breaking news that the U.S. is now  becoming the number one oil exporter into the E.U changing geopolitical  landscape in the favor of the U.S. right here, Katrina. </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, and that's exactly what we call making America great again,  and President Trump knows one thing and that is leverage. He wrote about  it. And he knows and the world knows that if the president was to pull out  of the Iran deal, perhaps go back to the sanctions on the Iran central bank  or oil exports it's going to be a problem. </p><p> But these are things like, you know, looking at including the long range  missiles and you know, eliminating the sunset provision on things like I  don't know, you're reaching -- enriching uranium which is a huge problem  for Iran.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> PIERSON:  And the president of France they need to understand is we don't  see the dust to France chance coming out of Iran like we see coming from  Iran to America.</p><p> MACDONALD:  To you--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PIERSON:  And President Trump takes that very seriously.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, they are now as you can see at the White House raising  the welcoming flags 15 months into his presidency, the president is finally  rolling out the red carpet for the president of France and what will happen  after Macron appears they will go for a sunset dinner on the terrace of  George Washington's home in Mount Vernon overlooking the Potomac. </p><p> Katrina, Macron is expected to, to your point, really prep the president on  the Iran deal. He is the leader, he's seen by the E.U. as the Trump whisper  that he can basically coax the president into staying in the Iran deal.  Macron, though, watch this, Katrina, admitting though that that deal as the  president has said has flaws. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MACRON:  It this as if agreement perfect and this JCPOA a perfect thing for  our relationship with Iran, no. But for nuclear, what do you have as a  better option? I don't see it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  The car is now rolling up with the leader of France so Macron  says that they would finish the war against ISIS. If we leave, we leave it  open to Iran and Syria, they are going to fuel a new terrorist war. What  are your thoughts? </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, I think President Trump is also coming at this from a  different perspective. You know, we've had this, that we've been doing the  same thing over and over again expecting different results and President  Trump doesn't want to do that anymore and he's not saying end it  altogether, he wants to make revisions. </p><p> And now that we see that they're cracking down on anti-government  protesters that's a problem particularly if we're just going to sit back  and allow this to happen not really knowing what's going on. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Let me break in here. The president is just stepping  outside the White House with the first lady ready to greet the president of  France, and Mrs. Macron as well. Tomorrow night there will be a state  dinner and a break with tradition, President Trump has invited no Democrat  members of Congress or journalists. About 150 guests will take their seats  in the state ding room tomorrow night. </p><p> It's going to be a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack  Obama. Obama's guest list went into the hundreds and the president really  wants to keep this close relationship. And here he is, the president of  France greeting and a hug with the president of the United States. Let's  watch this and let this moment sink in. </p><p> OK, Katrina, what we're watching now is a warm embrace between the leader  of France and his wife is with the leader of the United States. It looks  really quite collegial; they are now turning for the official photograph. </p><p> Katrina, Trump seems, the president seems to be going all out on pomp and  circumstance. That's how much he had in Paris last July when the president  of France invited him to watch the annual Bastille Day. What's your  reaction to rolling out the red carpet for the president of France? </p><p> PIERSON:  Well, it is Donald Trump, Liz, so I think we can fully expect the  best with the president and Melania who, you know, is a class act in and of  her own. I mean, it's just an amazing opportunity for us to all see what  we're seeing right now and that is, you know, refreshing leadership,  bringing two countries together, even though they have their differences,  willing to work together for what they do agree upon. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Our allies, Katrina, for 50 years. Katrina Pierson, thank you  so much for weighing in there. I really appreciate it.</p><p> PIERSON:  Great to be here. Thank you. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We're also monitoring this breaking developing situation,  we're moments away from the Senate foreign relations vote on the nomination  of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Not the final  confirmation the full chamber is expected to vote for Pompeo. A rebuke  tough, Senate foreign relations don't want him. We're going to bring you  that breaking news as it comes in. Don't go away, stay with us, more after  the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SANDERS:  At some point, Democrats have to decide whether they love this  country more than they hate this president, and they have to decide that  they want to put the safety and the security and the diplomacy of our  country ahead of their own political games, and we're very hopeful that  they will. </p><p> Mike Pompeo is a highly qualified individual. He's been one of the leading  people when it comes to the negotiations and the conversations with North  Korea, and to stop that would be a incredibly dangerous and damaging for  our country and for the world. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We're staying in breaking news mode. We've got more  developments, look at this. Republican Senator Jeff Flake now a yes on the  nomination. He will vote yes that Pompeo should be secretary of state with  Rand Paul. That means the Senate foreign relations panel is doing a 180. </p><p> Instead of rebuking this nomination it looks like the Senate foreign  relations panel will confirm Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p> Let's bring in the Daily Caller editorial director, Vince Coglianese. What  a turn around, Vince? </p><p> VINCE COGLIANESE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, DAILY CALLER:  That's quite a change of  events. Rand Paul, of course the big hold out, you mentioned Jeff Flake as  well, but Rand Paul, the president saying in public that he wanted to see  Rand come with him, and that is happening, that's a huge deal. </p><p> And it's important that the Senate foreign relations committee do this,  give him a stamp of approval given the unheard-of nature of sending out  somebody with disapproval to be voted on by the full Senate approve. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, that's right. Let's get to the viewer, he comes out of  Senate foreign relations, it looks like the Senate foreign relations panel  does vote yes saying, yes, Pompeo should be the next secretary of state.  Then it goes to the full Senate where Pompeo is expected to be confirmed as  secretary of state. </p><p> You know, here's the thing, initially, Vince, the storyline was that, you  know, they didn't like Pompeo's position on Iran.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  They thought he was too much of a hawk. He was supposed to be  the easy confirmation. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes</p><p> MACDONALD:  He was supposed to be the no-brainer, and all of a sudden he  was a problem that even Democrats and Republicans who voted for him as CIA  director were saying, no, we don't want him as secretary of state in the  middle of the North Korea breakthroughs. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Right. </p><p> MACDONALD:  I mean, it is a stunning, you know, revelation of what's going  on in D.C. when you have historic developments going on with North Korea.  And they're saying no to Pompeo when he's trying to strike these deals. Go  ahead.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  Yes. And it was a temper tantrum that lead them to that  conclusion, and I say that because this was a referendum on Trump. And all  of the assessments that we've heard from Democrats it was about -- it was  about Mike Pompeo's insufficient because he's not going to rein in Trump's  worth instincts. </p><p> There's no evidence for that. As the head of the CIA, he's had an  unblemished career there, he's had a good career prior to that as well. He  was, as you said, confirmed by the Senate to run the CIA before including  with Democratic support, and now he's got the opportunity to be secretary  of state. </p><p> And there's such an important resume item there for Mike Pompeo, and you  mentioned it. It's the fact that he's leading negotiations with North  Korea. This is an historic moment in terms of just having a U.S. official  leading such a high-level negotiation with North Korea. </p><p> To throw him out, to get rid of him as secretary of state would be a  preposterous exercise in politics--</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> COGLIANESE:  -- and one the Democrats should not suffer right now because  if they do, they will suffer politically in the future politically for  making such a horrendous decision. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, historians and analysts have already said if the  president gets that North Korea deal, it will be on the level of  Reagan/Gorbachev. </p><p> We have three liberal newspapers saying, you know what? Obstructionist  Democrats, stop. You have to put Pompeo in as secretary of state. The  president needs be a secretary of state. They are, USA Today, a writer at  the Washington Post, and the New York Daily News. Your final reaction,  Vince. </p><p> COGLIANESE:  Well, only that Barack Obama was given a Nobel Peace prize the  moment he came into office for doing nothing. If this is accomplished, as  you were mentioning, a peaceful North Korea of any kind, a meaningful peace  and one that draws down nuclear weapons, then I expect that Donald Trump  will receive a nomination for it, not that the Nobel Prize committee will  ever seriously consider him. </p><p> He's not exactly beloved by the globalist communist, but Mike Pompeo should  be right up there on that stage accepting the same thing. We have a long  way to go before we get there, but this is a big deal, and Mike Pompeo  should clear the bar at the United States Senate. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Great to see you, Vince. </p><p> Let's take you back to the White House. A truly lovely event is about to  be, take place right now. The two couples will plant a tree. It's a gift  from the president and president of France and Mrs. Macron they are going  to plant a tree, a sapling, a European oak on the South Lawn of the White  House about four and a half feet tall. </p><p> We're going to bring that to you live as it happens. Interesting note here,  First lady Melania Trump is really taking the lead here in organizing this  historic visit. </p><p> Quick, we're going to have more after the break. Also we're staying on the  situation in Toronto, that van plowing down pedestrians. Nine dead, 17  injured, seven critically. We're going to bring you the latest on that. A  suspect has been arrested. No motive yet. We will bring that to you live.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The nightmare, I've got to Yonge, and I've seen a lady  with her leg -- man, it was a gruesome scene. It's really bad out there. I  couldn't believe what I've seen, man. It was, man. Everybody, all these  people on the streets getting hit one by one. Post office boxes getting  crumpled up on people. And one person got dragged on and their blood is all  over Yonge. It's really bad out there, man. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We are basically are watching the president with the first  lady and the leader of France and the first lady of France now stepping out  of the portico, the White House. They're now going to enter the South Lawn. </p><p> There's first lady Melania right there. She's been organizing this historic  state visit. It is the White House's first state visit 15 months into the  Trump presidency. </p><p> They're going to plant a tree on the South Lawn. It is a gift from France  to the United States. It is a European oak sapling, four and a half feet  tall. </p><p> We have lieutenant general Thomas McInerney here. Sir, this is a developing  situation as well. General, the E.U. is look to the president of France to  coax President Donald Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. Your  reaction. </p><p> THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE:  Well, it's natural, and  they send President Macron over here to use him because he probably has the  best relationship of any of the European leaders right now, so I'm not  surprise. I do not think the president is going to change. He knows what he  wants to do. </p><p> The Europeans on the Iranian deal, it's purely a cash cow. They're ignoring  the nuclear threat per se. It's cash. They've got a huge trade surplus  going, and they're working it to their advantage. But that's not good  enough. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, it seems when you read, study what the president of  France, general, has been saying about ISIS leaving Syria and Iran's  growing presence with military bases in Syria, on the one hand the  president of France is saying as soon as -- if we leave, if we, the United  States, leave Syria, Iran will step in and cause terrorist activities to go  on the increase. </p><p> But at the same time, he wants the president to stay in the Iran nuclear  deal. Can you square this for the viewer, can you explain that and sort  that out? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Yes, I'll make it very simple. We should stay with the limited  number of people in Syria with 24/7 air power, so if they try to take over  any of the Kurdish places or the Syrian allies, then we can use that air  power to beat them down and to defeat them. </p><p> Now, as far as the nuclear deal goes, that was such a bad deal that no  agreement should ever have been made, the JCPOA, Liz. And we should back  out of that from both a military and a political point of view. Again,  remember, the European Union's interest is primarily in trade. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Let me just give you some background information about the tree  that was just planted. There is historic information about the reason that  France gave the United States and the White House this tree. </p><p> Over 9,000 American marines died in World War I in what's called the  Belleau Wood, this tree is from the area of that battle in June 1918 where  9,000 American marines died in World War I. That as far is a memorial site.  It's an important symbol of the sacrifice the United States made to insure  peace and stability in Europe.</p><p> General, your reaction to the president of France giving this oak tree to  the United States in commemoration of World War I marines dying there. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Liz, it's very, very symbolic. The Battle of Belleau Wood was a  horrendous battle. We lost, as you said, 9,000 marines. And to make this  tree come from that region really touches on our relationship. And I think  it is a very symbolic gesture by President Macron and symbolic of the  relationship between the president and President Trump. </p><p> MACDONALD:  What does this do for the psyche of the Trump administration,  to have these memorable events come up and in the ensuing days? This will  be a three-day visit, the president of Germany -- Germany, rather, Angela  Merkel will be coming on Friday. How does this set the scene for the  presidency of Donald Trump? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, I think it establishes it on a high note. People are  seeing the way the Trumps handle their visitors and the relationships  developing. The left has always wanted to deny that President Trump had  that capability. He's absolutely brilliant at it. You're seeing it today  and you'll see it at dinner tonight at Mount Vernon and the state dinner  they have. </p><p> The whole three days that the Macrons are here and how they're honored is  going to show the world and the American people what a great leader  President Trump and Mrs. Trump are. </p><p> MACDONALD:  We will be covering the Chancellor of Germany's visit, Angela  Merkel as well, coming later this week. Good to see you, general. Thanks  for coming in. I really appreciate it. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Thank, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  We are moments away from that Senate foreign relations vote on  the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Breaking  news, it looks like that Senate panel will vote for Mike Pompeo to be  secretary of state. </p><p> Jeff Flake and Rand Paul now saying they will vote for Michael Pompeo as  secretary of state. </p><p> We're going to take you back to Toronto, van mowed down nine people, and  injuring 16, killing nine in Toronto. We're going to bring you the latest  on that after the break. Don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Being confirm for you tonight, right now, we have nine  people that are dead. Sixteen that are injured. Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources, and I can assure the public all our  available resources have been brought in to address this tragic situation. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Take you to the developments in Toronto. Driver now in custody  after plowing a van into a crowd leaving nine people dead, sixteen injured,  seven critically. Toronto authorities held the press conference just  moments ago. We still do not know the driver's identity and his motive, we  will bring that to you as soon as it comes in. </p><p> General, listen, we have seen numerous van attacks like this and vehicular  attacks, a dozen since 2006, general. We've seen them in England, we've  seen them in Germany and Spain. And, of course, in Canada, as well as the  U.S. Your reaction, sir. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, it looks like a cookie cutter, Liz. By the rental van,  the number of people -- nine dead and 16 injured -- all the makings of  radical Islam. All I need to know is the driver's name and a little more  background, but I would say there's a 90 percent chance that this is  radical Islam. It wasn't an old man that had a heart attack or a stroke. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Again, we don't know the motive just yet. But we do know the  facts about prior vehicular attacks. Let's talk about that. Again, we don't  know the motive in Toronto. </p><p> General, you know, the terror capability has shifted. It is very difficult  for terrorists -- we're not saying this is terrorism -- it's difficult for  them to get bombs and explosives. It is easy for them to do vehicular  attacks. Your reaction to that. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, that's exactly what ISIS is telling their warriors across  the world, use vehicular attacks. And you can see all the ones that they've  done in the last year rather than explosives or even weapons, although  London are getting a lot of knives over there. But the fact is that is now  their modus operandi, and it's something that we should be cognizant of,  and it's very, very difficult to stop, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, and to your point, the days of the terror cell are  over. Now I think, to your point, terrorists -- and, again, we don't know  the motives of this attack. It has the hallmark of a terrorist attack.  Again, we'll bring you the motive as soon as it breaks. </p><p> To your point, general, you have said this before, ISIS and radical  terrorist leaders are saying stay in place and do your own terrorism. This  is a form of micro terrorism, right? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Exactly. And it's the patterns of behavior that I look at,  that's my business, patterns of behavior. And this is what you're seeing  now spread across all the cities in Europe as well as the United States in  New York City, for instance, where you are. And so this is what we must  expect, and it's extremely difficult to counter this. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, it's a senseless act of violence. What do you say to  the viewer out there, you know, these are just pedestrians walking on one  of Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, it's just near downtown Toronto. Are we  supposed to be having security barricades on every major block in every  urban area, every city? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  They would like that, but we're not going to do that. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Why would they like that? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Because that means the western world is being influenced by the  radical Islamists, to their way of thinking. They are putting control on  what we do just like when we go to an airport and all the checks we go  through. They like that. </p><p> But the fact is we've got to defeat this Islamic terrorism where the  ideology comes from, Mecca and Medina from the Middle East, and that's the  Muslims themselves. They must do that. And I'm hopeful that the new crown  prince of Saudi Arabia will be the leader against the radical Islamists in  his region so that they are no longer holy warriors and will go to paradise  for killing infidels. No, we must destroy that ideology. </p><p> MACDONALD:  It should be noted too that in Toronto a group of seven  security international meeting was occurring just up -- a few blocks away  from that terror attack. If we think -- let me back up, we don't know if  it's a terror attack, it has the hallmarks of that. Sir, you know, what are  the authorities asking this suspect right now? </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Well, first of all, they want to get his name, and then you  want to get where he goes to church, what his basic beliefs are, what is  the reason he did this. If one person was killed, fine, that happens. But  not nine people. Not nine people. </p><p> MACDONALD:  General, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in  and handling two stories. I really appreciate it. </p><p> MCINERNEY:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Again, we're going to take you back to the White House. This is  -- we're in breaking news mode. The president and first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and the first lady of France, they're  about to leave for Mount Vernon for a dinner overlooking at the Potomac. We  will bring it to you live. That is the home of George Washington.</p><p> And we're also moments away from that vote out of the Senate panel on the  nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. It looks like  that panel will vote for Mike Pompeo. Jeff Flake and Rand Paul saying yes  to Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p> But first, after Facebook's data breach scandal, other big tech companies  like Google could be next to face scrutiny over its data privacy practices.  We're on that story for you coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  After Facebook's data breach and data mining scandal, other big  tech companies like Google they are now in the hot seat over their data  privacy practices. A new report shows Google is way worse than Facebook at  collecting and keeping your personal information. They've been  cyberstalking you all over the internet even if you're not on Google's web  site for something else. </p><p> Let's take a look at how the stock of -- the stock of Google's parent  company Alphabet did after their company reporting slide to the downside,  and falling to less than 1 percent after hours. </p><p> Let's get to the panel on this. I want to bring in Danielle McLaughlin and  Kelsey Harkness. First to you, Kelsey, you know what's the creepiest part  of the story? It's that this Silicon Valley stalks you all over the  internet even though you're not on their web sites. That's the worse part  of the story. I don't think people realize that, Kelsey. </p><p> KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR REPORTER, DAILY SIGNAL:  Well, the level of outrage  directed at Google and Facebook is certainly understandable, but it's  really not surprising because Google and Facebook are billion dollar  companies--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, but isn't it creepy that Silicon Valley has all of the  information about what we're doing on the internet? </p><p> HARKNESS:  It's certainly creepy which is why Americans are upset about  this, but it's not surprising because they're not providing these services  for free. But I think what's important about these stories is that we don't  direct our anger towards the government and ask the government to regulate  the tech industry because the government, too, is collecting our personal  data. </p><p> Look at the CFBP, look at OPM, both of them had big, massive breaches. So  we need to let the free market solve this, we need to demand that tech  companies take it upon themselves to solve this and not get the government  involved in an area it really doesn't belong. </p><p> MACDONALD:  I used to be kind of OK with it, Danielle, and say, OK, you  know. But now I'm thinking, wait, this isn't good. To Kelsey's point, the  IRS has also had data breaches. The IRS knows a lot about our income. And  now Silicon Valley, Danielle knows too much about what we're doing on the  internet. I think it's kind of weird. </p><p> DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST:  It is weird, and it is a little  bit creepy, to your point. I think we have to make a decision societally  about who is going to regulate this. I take Kelsey's point about the notion  of the free market solving for this, but the free market hasn't solved for  this, and that's why we're in this position in the first place. </p><p> I actually do think that more like Europe -- which has very robust privacy  laws -- we should ask your government who are elected representative to  step in and make sure that these billion, trillion dollar companies in  Silicon Valley aren't just data mining. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Guys, I'm so sorry, we've got to break away because that Senate  vote on Mike Pompeo coming in, Rand Paul just now explaining why he changed  his vote. Let's listen. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RAND PAUL, (R) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  I decided to go ahead and vote for  Director Pompeo because he's assured me that he's learned the lesson. Now,  time will tell if those assurances are true or not. And I won't say that --  I can say with absolute certainty I know what his opinions will be and how  they will come out over time, but I do take him at his word. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  So they're about to vote, Kelsey, what's your reaction to this  180 out of Senate foreign relations now after that. Now the breaking news  it will, that panel will approve Mike Pompeo as secretary of state? What's  your reaction to the 180 here? </p><p> HARKNESS:  I think it's very good news. I think that it maybe appears  normal to a lot of Americans to hear that all Democrats are opposing  Pompeo's nomination, but this is not normal. Under the Obama administration  94 senators approved both Hillary Clinton and John Kerry for the same  position and, clearly, those are very divisive figures. </p><p> Mike Pompeo is very qualified to do this job and at a time when we are  about to enter into serious negotiations with North Korea, President Trump  needs a secretary of state by his side. </p><p> MACDONALD:  What do you think, Danielle? </p><p> MCLAUGHLIN:  I do agree that we need a secretary of state at this very  crucial time in North Korea relations. What Rand Paul asked of Mike Pompeo  was two things, do you agree that war in the Middle East, more war in the  Middle East is destabilizing, number one, and number two, do you agree that  Iraq was a mistake? He got those reassurances from Mike Pompeo, and that's  what changed his vote. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Interesting. The vote is now underway. We're staying on top of  the vote. Final thought, Kelsey. </p><p> HARKNESS:  I think that this is good news for all Americans. </p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Kelsey and Danielle, thank you so much. We're up against a  hard break. The president and the president of France about to arrive at  Mount Vernon. We're going to stay on that story for you as well. Jam-packed  hour, don't go away. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Breaking news. The Senate foreign relations committee now  voting for Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. Jeff Flake is yes, so as  Rand Paul. It goes to the full chamber for a vote where he is expected to  be confirmed as secretary of state. </p><p> We're also are waiting for President Trump and the first lady, the French  President Emmanuel Macron and his wife. They're headed to Mount Vernon, the  home of George Washington to have dinner overlooking the Potomac.</p><p> That does it for us. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources and I can assure the public all available  resources have been brought into address this tragic situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ELIZABETH MACDONALD, HOST, FOX NEWS:  Breaking news to the developing  situation in Toronto, a driver now in custody after plowing a van into a  crowd among Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, nine dead, 16 injured 17  critically. </p><p>I am Elizabeth MacDonald. This is Risk &amp; Reward. </p><p>The mayor of Toronto authorities just now holding a press conference, the  mayor saying it will likely be several days of disruption to the area  during the investigation. </p><p>Here with more let's get to Kristina Partsinevelos in the newsroom.  Kristina? </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Yes, this event only  happened a few hours ago at 1.30 p.m. Eastern Time. A white van from the  company Ryder, it's a rental van company plowed on to the sidewalk, what  you're seeing right now, started to hit a few pedestrians. According to eye  witnesses the pedestrians asked the van to stop, the driver continued going  hitting more pedestrians. </p><p>And as you mentioned there are nine dead, 16 injured. There's still no word  yet about the motivation behind this van attack. You had the mayor just  speak very recently, the Mayor of Toronto that's John Tory, and he said we  are admired the around the world for being inclusive doesn't want anybody  to jump to conclusions just yet as to the motive behind this attack. </p><p>Very importantly to note as well, this is the remaining a Toronto  investigation not a national investigation with the RCMP, the Royal  Canadian Mountain Police, again, this is a Toronto investigation they are  not releasing the name of the driver of the van but they were able to bring  him into custody. </p><p>He seemed uninjured based off of several eye witness videos that I've seen  when they caught him, he happened to have something in his hand. There's  still no confirmation what he was carrying but he was pointing it at a  police officer. There were no shots fired. </p><p>Again, this man is in custody. We do not have any details just yet on who  he is, what his motivation is, are the Toronto police are being very  careful right now with the information, making sure going through to see if  he had any cell phones looking through his records to see most importantly  if he is somebody that they recognize, that they know and could be  affiliated with other people, but right now this is a Toronto  investigation. </p><p>You have several, 16 people still injured and businesses that have been  damaged along the road because this white van went up on to the sidewalk,  hit pedestrians, even rammed into a bus station. There was one eye witness  that said he saw his family they're looking for their grandfather and  they're very worried and I was just listening to this live through Canadian  media that they found the grandfather's glasses on the ground and so  they're still waiting confirmation. </p><p>Several of the patients or victims have been brought to Sunny Brook  Hospital in Toronto, again Sunny Brook Hospital, so again we have nine  dead, 16 injured in this tragic event that's happening in Toronto as we  speak. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Kristina. We'll be staying on top of that story and  much more. </p><p>Let's get to your money. A widely held stock making lots of 401k plans  going up. Google parent company Alphabet reporting solid earnings and  revenues better than expected after the bell. </p><p>Let's get to Deirdre Bolton on the latest with that. Deirdre? </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Hey, Liz. So after-hours, you are  going to see this stock kind of see sawing back and forth. So it had a big  reaction as you mentioned, Alphabet, Google exceeding both on the top and  bottom line and you had a jump of around 4 percent initially, so you can  see still higher. </p><p>But just coming off those posted session highs, there are still some really  big questions out there, Liz, for the long term of this company. You know,  Google has between eight to 10 times more data on you and on me than  Facebook so a lot of Facebook investors were saying hey, how come Mark  Zuckerberg got dragged before Congress? </p><p>Google has about eight gigabytes of data per person, that equals about  2,000 hours if we just listen straight through of music. If you want a  comparison point Facebook has about 650 megabytes which are smaller than  gigabytes and that equals about 160 hours of music. So just an interesting  kind of data point and it just shows you where this data power is. </p><p>A lot of people are saying Google is one of a kind so if you are an  investor you like to hear that. The flip side is, will it make regulators  consider one of a kind akin to monopoly which is not too far of a stretch.</p><p>We do know that the European regulators are putting in new privacy laws as  of May 25th of this year so tech companies, ones that are based here but  have customers in Europe, need to be compliant. If these companies are not  compliant this is not a small slap on the wrist, Liz, it is between $30  million or 4 percent of annual revenue whichever is higher, so there's a  lot of people saying OK, Google has a lot of work ahead. AlphabetGoogle,  excuse me. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Deirdre. Thank you so much.</p><p>We have a jam packed busy hour ahead. We are moments away from President  Trump and the first lady welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and his  wife at the White House for the administration's first official state  dinner.</p><p>Let's get to Blake Burman with the latest. Blake? </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  At the hour the French president  has a busy couple of days here in Washington, Liz. I think you can see  behind me that they are expecting Emmanuel Macron here at the White House  within the next few minutes or so. </p><p>The itinerary is as follows. The Macron family, him and his wife, rather,  and the president and first lady will head to dinner tonight to George  Washington's home followed by talks tomorrow, a state dinner and then he  addresses Congress on Wednesday. </p><p>The White House says these two have a great rapport, and part of the reason  why he's receiving the first state visit. However, it is also clear that  there are stark differences on a policy level, for example, there are trade  issues at hand, as well as different views on the Iran nuclear deal and the  Paris climate accord all will be discussed in the up upcoming days. </p><p>As we await Macron here at the White House, the White House as well also  has its eyes on the goings up on Capitol Hill as it relates to the Senate  foreign relations committee as the secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo  is set to get the thumbs down from the Senate foreign relations committee  it appears within the next few minutes or so.</p><p>All 10 Democrats plus the Republican Rand Paul expected to vote against  Pompeo to become the next secretary of state; however, Pompeo still  expected to get a vote on the Senate floor and there it appears as though  as if he will have the numbers to become the next secretary of state. </p><p>Today, two more Democrats came to his side saying that they would support  him, Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly, add to that Heidi Heitkamp to that group  as well. </p><p>The White House is trying to make the argument to the United States Senate  that if you voted for John Kerry and if you voted for Hillary Clinton, then  you should vote for Mike Pompeo as well. The White House press secretary  Sarah Sanders saying what's going on, on Capitol Hill sends this message to  the rest of the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What it says to the  world is what we've been saying for a long time, the Senate has got some  real problems, namely to figure out how to actually show up and do their  job a little bit better. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now if Pompeo is voted down by the Senate foreign relations  committee, Liz, that would be the first time that would ever happen to a  secretary of state nominee if they eventually go on to become in that  position. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow, historic times, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And by the way both Democrats and Republicans voted for Pompeo  as CIA director. </p><p>BURMAN:  Yes, CIA director.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  You as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senate foreign relations committee, as Blake Burman just noted  is about -- they are about to vote on Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state.  Rand Paul tweeting out he will support the nomination he was against it. </p><p>Last month President Trump announced the departure of Rex Tillerson as  secretary of state and as nomination of Pompeo as the replacement. Now the  thinking is if it gets to the full chamber Pompeo will become the secretary  of state. Just going through this process right now, we're monitoring the  vote for you in the beginning.</p><p>Let's get to what's going on with the French visit. The media says this is  going to be a bad relationship. Got off to a rocky start but now, French  President Macron even taking a line from President Trump ahead of today's  state visit to the White House. Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE We have this very special relationship  because both of us are probably the maverick of the system, on both sides I  think President Trump's election was unexpected in your country, and  probably my election wasn't expected in my country, and we are not part of  the political system. I'm here to serve my people and my country and make  it great again, somebody I know very well could say, but that's it, that's  the whole story. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joining me now, Weekly Standard executive editor, Fred Barnes.  Fred, make France great again, did you hear that? </p><p>FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes, look, Macron, this  is, he is so sure, so smart, so likable, and Trump is just basking in and  he's getting everything he wants and Macron fought a big war and he wants  to make sure that Trump doesn't get out of the Iran nuclear deal and that  he gets back in the Paris accord, I think not much chance for that. </p><p>But he is smart. He is the big European leader who has stepped forward to  embrace Trump, not endorse him but give Trump somebody big to deal with. It  isn't going to be England, it isn't going to be what's the name, Angela  Merkel in Germany comes in I think on Friday and that's just a bit of a  sour puss and doesn't get along with Trump. But Macron has made an effort  here and it's very wise on his part. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, here is the thing. We've got that May 12 deadline for  the Iran deal. </p><p>BARNES:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  The president is expected to yank it saying he already said  this is the worst deal ever. So, and you're right, we've got Angela Merkel  coming in. You know, Fred, these state visits are coming at a time when  economic growth is up, optimism is up, the media reporting how the  Democrats may take back control of the House. </p><p>The president seems to be dominating the message, when people go to vote  they say, what are you going to do for me? </p><p>BARNES:  Yes, look, I wouldn't buy this line from the Democrats and from a  lot of people in the media that there's a blue wave coming and Democrats  are just going to sweep through and win the House and maybe the Senate in  November. </p><p>They do very well that would be what happens historically in the first mid- term election for a new president, but Trump is the dominant figure here  and he has got some very optimistic things to talk about, not just the  economy but in foreign policy as well. </p><p>Look, Macron was one of those who joined in the attack on the plants in  Syria where they mix and made the poisonous product that were used to kill  so many Syrians, so look, they worked together before and I think they'll  work together again, particularly here. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Macron has pointed out that they're both maverick  outsiders. </p><p>BARNES:  They are. </p><p>MACDONALD:  They're both businessmen, they're not part of the classical  political system. Both were elected on the first try. It seems like these  two men have a lot in common. So we've got the D.C. media up in arms  saying, you know, this is again it's going to be problems here with the  state visit, certainly with Angela Merkel, they're raising the red flags  about it. What do you see? </p><p>BARNES:  Well, look, I'll tell you what the media really wants and they're  going to hound poor Macron while he's here. They want him to dump on Trump  and he is refusing to do it, wouldn't be smart to do it. </p><p>MACDONALD:  How are they going -- how are they going to get the French  president to dump on President Trump? </p><p>BARNES:  Well, he's going to have a press conference among other things,  they'll yell questions at him, and look, they have ways to get that  question asked, but Macron is I think not going to do it. What purpose of  his would it serve? He says he's here to deal with the president of the  United States. He doesn't have to and doesn't have to comment personally on  Trump. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what, to your point, Fred, and it's an important one.  The media again, is misreading the situation.</p><p>BARNES:  I think so.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Macron likes his relationship with Trump because it improves  his own basically rookie standing with the E.U. He's now being called the  Trump whisperer. Macron is not going to damage that. He's not going to  damage how important he is now to the E.U. given his relationship with  Trump. </p><p>BARNES:  I think you're absolutely right. It serves his purpose very well.  Now, will Macron be able to talk Trump into not getting out of the Iran  deal, will he be able to talk him to getting into Paris climate accord? I  don't think so on either one of those things, but he'll get credit for  trying. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Fred Barnes. Great stuff. Come back soon. </p><p>BARNES:  OK.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now let's get to this fast moving stock as Google parent  Alphabet reporting strong earnings and revenue after the bell. It's been  doing that every quarter since 2010. The stock is moving after-hours.  another great quarter for Google. But now, this. A new report Google does  get more personal information about you than even Facebook, as Deirdre  Bolton just said 8 to 10 times of Facebook. We're going to show you the  details.</p><p>We're also monitoring that Senate foreign relationships vote of Mike Pompeo  as secretary of state. Rand Paul breaking news here, just putting out he  will vote for Michael Pompeo, when the vote comes we're going to bring it  to you. Liberal newspapers now supporting Pompeo. We're going to show who.</p><p>But first, we're also watching President Trump and the first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife at the White House for the  administration's first official state dinner. We're going to bring that to  you live as well, jam-packed hour, really busy hour ahead, don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Back to this breaking news. We are monitoring French President  Emmanuel Macron he's about to appear at the White House any second, but the  first lady and the president will greet the French president and Mrs.  Macron at the White House.</p><p>Let's bring in Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor Katrina Pierson. It's a  historic visit, Katrina, now even President Macron effectively saying you  know what? President is the president to the American people, he's giving  that message the American people will deal with it. He's the president. </p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISOR:  Absolutely. This truly is a  refreshing display of leadership. You have two leaders who don't agree 100  percent on all of the policy positions but who have become friends and  respect each other as leaders and now we're here having a great visit. I  fully expect President Macron to make his case, with regards to trade and  Syria and Iraq. But here, I mean, Iran.</p><p>So here is the thing. President Trump is going to consider the president of  France as counsel absolutely as a courtesy, Liz. But let's make no mistake.  The president of the United States will be making policy for the United  States so I think this is a great opportunity for many in our own country  to see how elected leaders should act.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, to your point, it's well taken. Because the thinking  in the E.U. as President Macron is the leading edge of that wedge to get  the president to step back on the Iran deal, dial back on, you know, the  tariffs, and the potential trade wars, and also climate change. But your  point is President Trump is not going to do that, right? </p><p>PIERSON:  No, I don't think so because these are things that the president  has hold very dear and we've seen it throughout the campaign. You can go  all the way back to the 80s on some of these positions. But I do think he  would consider the counsel, but at the same time the president has made a  commitment to the United States and that is to put America and its people  first. That is not going to change. And I think the president of France  respects the president's opinion as well.</p><p>And when we look at the things like Iran, for example, the president was  very adamant on making some significant changes, things that a lot of  people agree with, regardless of how we entered this deal. We have a new  leader of the United States and he wants to have input. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So again, we're monitoring this situation unfolding right now  at the White House. You're looking at a live action shot of the White  House, the president of France with the first lady of France expected to  appear momentarily to greet the president and first lady Melania Trump. </p><p>President Macron to your point, Katrina, is expected to press President  Trump on trade. Here is what he said over the weekend. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACRON:  You cannot make it through the wall with the allies, it's too  complicated. If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade war  against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against them,  come on, it doesn't work. You need ally. We are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, so here is the messaging problem right for the president?  Katrina, he's got to say listen we're not talking about trade war. We're  talking about fair trade and the E.U. needs to get that message China has  not been fair. Go ahead. </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, absolutely, and we keep hearing that the president is doing  this to everyone else when in fact, everyone else has done this to the  United States and the president is simply saying look, we need fair and  reciprocal trade. </p><p>At the end of the day that's what going to matter. Many people in our own  country have doubted his ability to make these deals and to get things  done, but if you look at ISIS and tax reform he's even been bringing North  Korea to the table. So the president is actually doing things right. It  might be different, but we're actually getting things done. </p><p>And I think President Macron is going to get to hear President Trump's  position on these things as well. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Here is an unfolding breaking news situation and it's happening  right now with Russia and Iran as it pertains to the E.U. Katrina, to your  point, record amounts of U.S. oil is now flooding into E.U. markets, that  deal with Iran that Obama struck, there's a May 12 deadline that is looming  the president could yank what he says is the worst deal ever and impose  sanctions.</p><p>Again, Iran is backed by Russia, Russia supplies a lot of oil and Nat gas  to the E.U. We are just hearing the breaking news that the U.S. is now  becoming the number one oil exporter into the E.U changing geopolitical  landscape in the favor of the U.S. right here, Katrina. </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, and that's exactly what we call making America great again,  and President Trump knows one thing and that is leverage. He wrote about  it. And he knows and the world knows that if the president was to pull out  of the Iran deal, perhaps go back to the sanctions on the Iran central bank  or oil exports it's going to be a problem. </p><p>But these are things like, you know, looking at including the long range  missiles and you know, eliminating the sunset provision on things like I  don't know, you're reaching -- enriching uranium which is a huge problem  for Iran.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>PIERSON:  And the president of France they need to understand is we don't  see the dust to France chance coming out of Iran like we see coming from  Iran to America.</p><p>MACDONALD:  To you--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PIERSON:  And President Trump takes that very seriously.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, they are now as you can see at the White House raising  the welcoming flags 15 months into his presidency, the president is finally  rolling out the red carpet for the president of France and what will happen  after Macron appears they will go for a sunset dinner on the terrace of  George Washington's home in Mount Vernon overlooking the Potomac. </p><p>Katrina, Macron is expected to, to your point, really prep the president on  the Iran deal. He is the leader, he's seen by the E.U. as the Trump whisper  that he can basically coax the president into staying in the Iran deal.  Macron, though, watch this, Katrina, admitting though that that deal as the  president has said has flaws. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACRON:  It this as if agreement perfect and this JCPOA a perfect thing for  our relationship with Iran, no. But for nuclear, what do you have as a  better option? I don't see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  The car is now rolling up with the leader of France so Macron  says that they would finish the war against ISIS. If we leave, we leave it  open to Iran and Syria, they are going to fuel a new terrorist war. What  are your thoughts? </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, I think President Trump is also coming at this from a  different perspective. You know, we've had this, that we've been doing the  same thing over and over again expecting different results and President  Trump doesn't want to do that anymore and he's not saying end it  altogether, he wants to make revisions. </p><p>And now that we see that they're cracking down on anti-government  protesters that's a problem particularly if we're just going to sit back  and allow this to happen not really knowing what's going on. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Let me break in here. The president is just stepping  outside the White House with the first lady ready to greet the president of  France, and Mrs. Macron as well. Tomorrow night there will be a state  dinner and a break with tradition, President Trump has invited no Democrat  members of Congress or journalists. About 150 guests will take their seats  in the state ding room tomorrow night. </p><p>It's going to be a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack  Obama. Obama's guest list went into the hundreds and the president really  wants to keep this close relationship. And here he is, the president of  France greeting and a hug with the president of the United States. Let's  watch this and let this moment sink in. </p><p>OK, Katrina, what we're watching now is a warm embrace between the leader  of France and his wife is with the leader of the United States. It looks  really quite collegial; they are now turning for the official photograph. </p><p>Katrina, Trump seems, the president seems to be going all out on pomp and  circumstance. That's how much he had in Paris last July when the president  of France invited him to watch the annual Bastille Day. What's your  reaction to rolling out the red carpet for the president of France? </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, it is Donald Trump, Liz, so I think we can fully expect the  best with the president and Melania who, you know, is a class act in and of  her own. I mean, it's just an amazing opportunity for us to all see what  we're seeing right now and that is, you know, refreshing leadership,  bringing two countries together, even though they have their differences,  willing to work together for what they do agree upon. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Our allies, Katrina, for 50 years. Katrina Pierson, thank you  so much for weighing in there. I really appreciate it.</p><p>PIERSON:  Great to be here. Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We're also monitoring this breaking developing situation,  we're moments away from the Senate foreign relations vote on the nomination  of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Not the final  confirmation the full chamber is expected to vote for Pompeo. A rebuke  tough, Senate foreign relations don't want him. We're going to bring you  that breaking news as it comes in. Don't go away, stay with us, more after  the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS:  At some point, Democrats have to decide whether they love this  country more than they hate this president, and they have to decide that  they want to put the safety and the security and the diplomacy of our  country ahead of their own political games, and we're very hopeful that  they will. </p><p>Mike Pompeo is a highly qualified individual. He's been one of the leading  people when it comes to the negotiations and the conversations with North  Korea, and to stop that would be a incredibly dangerous and damaging for  our country and for the world. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We're staying in breaking news mode. We've got more  developments, look at this. Republican Senator Jeff Flake now a yes on the  nomination. He will vote yes that Pompeo should be secretary of state with  Rand Paul. That means the Senate foreign relations panel is doing a 180. </p><p>Instead of rebuking this nomination it looks like the Senate foreign  relations panel will confirm Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p>Let's bring in the Daily Caller editorial director, Vince Coglianese. What  a turn around, Vince? </p><p>VINCE COGLIANESE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, DAILY CALLER:  That's quite a change of  events. Rand Paul, of course the big hold out, you mentioned Jeff Flake as  well, but Rand Paul, the president saying in public that he wanted to see  Rand come with him, and that is happening, that's a huge deal. </p><p>And it's important that the Senate foreign relations committee do this,  give him a stamp of approval given the unheard-of nature of sending out  somebody with disapproval to be voted on by the full Senate approve. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's right. Let's get to the viewer, he comes out of  Senate foreign relations, it looks like the Senate foreign relations panel  does vote yes saying, yes, Pompeo should be the next secretary of state.  Then it goes to the full Senate where Pompeo is expected to be confirmed as  secretary of state. </p><p>You know, here's the thing, initially, Vince, the storyline was that, you  know, they didn't like Pompeo's position on Iran.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  They thought he was too much of a hawk. He was supposed to be  the easy confirmation. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes</p><p>MACDONALD:  He was supposed to be the no-brainer, and all of a sudden he  was a problem that even Democrats and Republicans who voted for him as CIA  director were saying, no, we don't want him as secretary of state in the  middle of the North Korea breakthroughs. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Right. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I mean, it is a stunning, you know, revelation of what's going  on in D.C. when you have historic developments going on with North Korea.  And they're saying no to Pompeo when he's trying to strike these deals. Go  ahead.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes. And it was a temper tantrum that lead them to that  conclusion, and I say that because this was a referendum on Trump. And all  of the assessments that we've heard from Democrats it was about -- it was  about Mike Pompeo's insufficient because he's not going to rein in Trump's  worth instincts. </p><p>There's no evidence for that. As the head of the CIA, he's had an  unblemished career there, he's had a good career prior to that as well. He  was, as you said, confirmed by the Senate to run the CIA before including  with Democratic support, and now he's got the opportunity to be secretary  of state. </p><p>And there's such an important resume item there for Mike Pompeo, and you  mentioned it. It's the fact that he's leading negotiations with North  Korea. This is an historic moment in terms of just having a U.S. official  leading such a high-level negotiation with North Korea. </p><p>To throw him out, to get rid of him as secretary of state would be a  preposterous exercise in politics--</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  -- and one the Democrats should not suffer right now because  if they do, they will suffer politically in the future politically for  making such a horrendous decision. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, historians and analysts have already said if the  president gets that North Korea deal, it will be on the level of  Reagan/Gorbachev. </p><p>We have three liberal newspapers saying, you know what? Obstructionist  Democrats, stop. You have to put Pompeo in as secretary of state. The  president needs be a secretary of state. They are, USA Today, a writer at  the Washington Post, and the New York Daily News. Your final reaction,  Vince. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Well, only that Barack Obama was given a Nobel Peace prize the  moment he came into office for doing nothing. If this is accomplished, as  you were mentioning, a peaceful North Korea of any kind, a meaningful peace  and one that draws down nuclear weapons, then I expect that Donald Trump  will receive a nomination for it, not that the Nobel Prize committee will  ever seriously consider him. </p><p>He's not exactly beloved by the globalist communist, but Mike Pompeo should  be right up there on that stage accepting the same thing. We have a long  way to go before we get there, but this is a big deal, and Mike Pompeo  should clear the bar at the United States Senate. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Great to see you, Vince. </p><p>Let's take you back to the White House. A truly lovely event is about to  be, take place right now. The two couples will plant a tree. It's a gift  from the president and president of France and Mrs. Macron they are going  to plant a tree, a sapling, a European oak on the South Lawn of the White  House about four and a half feet tall. </p><p>We're going to bring that to you live as it happens. Interesting note here,  First lady Melania Trump is really taking the lead here in organizing this  historic visit. </p><p>Quick, we're going to have more after the break. Also we're staying on the  situation in Toronto, that van plowing down pedestrians. Nine dead, 17  injured, seven critically. We're going to bring you the latest on that. A  suspect has been arrested. No motive yet. We will bring that to you live.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The nightmare, I've got to Yonge, and I've seen a lady  with her leg -- man, it was a gruesome scene. It's really bad out there. I  couldn't believe what I've seen, man. It was, man. Everybody, all these  people on the streets getting hit one by one. Post office boxes getting  crumpled up on people. And one person got dragged on and their blood is all  over Yonge. It's really bad out there, man. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We are basically are watching the president with the first  lady and the leader of France and the first lady of France now stepping out  of the portico, the White House. They're now going to enter the South Lawn. </p><p>There's first lady Melania right there. She's been organizing this historic  state visit. It is the White House's first state visit 15 months into the  Trump presidency. </p><p>They're going to plant a tree on the South Lawn. It is a gift from France  to the United States. It is a European oak sapling, four and a half feet  tall. </p><p>We have lieutenant general Thomas McInerney here. Sir, this is a developing  situation as well. General, the E.U. is look to the president of France to  coax President Donald Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. Your  reaction. </p><p>THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE:  Well, it's natural, and  they send President Macron over here to use him because he probably has the  best relationship of any of the European leaders right now, so I'm not  surprise. I do not think the president is going to change. He knows what he  wants to do. </p><p>The Europeans on the Iranian deal, it's purely a cash cow. They're ignoring  the nuclear threat per se. It's cash. They've got a huge trade surplus  going, and they're working it to their advantage. But that's not good  enough. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, it seems when you read, study what the president of  France, general, has been saying about ISIS leaving Syria and Iran's  growing presence with military bases in Syria, on the one hand the  president of France is saying as soon as -- if we leave, if we, the United  States, leave Syria, Iran will step in and cause terrorist activities to go  on the increase. </p><p>But at the same time, he wants the president to stay in the Iran nuclear  deal. Can you square this for the viewer, can you explain that and sort  that out? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Yes, I'll make it very simple. We should stay with the limited  number of people in Syria with 24/7 air power, so if they try to take over  any of the Kurdish places or the Syrian allies, then we can use that air  power to beat them down and to defeat them. </p><p>Now, as far as the nuclear deal goes, that was such a bad deal that no  agreement should ever have been made, the JCPOA, Liz. And we should back  out of that from both a military and a political point of view. Again,  remember, the European Union's interest is primarily in trade. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Let me just give you some background information about the tree  that was just planted. There is historic information about the reason that  France gave the United States and the White House this tree. </p><p>Over 9,000 American marines died in World War I in what's called the  Belleau Wood, this tree is from the area of that battle in June 1918 where  9,000 American marines died in World War I. That as far is a memorial site.  It's an important symbol of the sacrifice the United States made to insure  peace and stability in Europe.</p><p>General, your reaction to the president of France giving this oak tree to  the United States in commemoration of World War I marines dying there. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Liz, it's very, very symbolic. The Battle of Belleau Wood was a  horrendous battle. We lost, as you said, 9,000 marines. And to make this  tree come from that region really touches on our relationship. And I think  it is a very symbolic gesture by President Macron and symbolic of the  relationship between the president and President Trump. </p><p>MACDONALD:  What does this do for the psyche of the Trump administration,  to have these memorable events come up and in the ensuing days? This will  be a three-day visit, the president of Germany -- Germany, rather, Angela  Merkel will be coming on Friday. How does this set the scene for the  presidency of Donald Trump? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, I think it establishes it on a high note. People are  seeing the way the Trumps handle their visitors and the relationships  developing. The left has always wanted to deny that President Trump had  that capability. He's absolutely brilliant at it. You're seeing it today  and you'll see it at dinner tonight at Mount Vernon and the state dinner  they have. </p><p>The whole three days that the Macrons are here and how they're honored is  going to show the world and the American people what a great leader  President Trump and Mrs. Trump are. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We will be covering the Chancellor of Germany's visit, Angela  Merkel as well, coming later this week. Good to see you, general. Thanks  for coming in. I really appreciate it. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Thank, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We are moments away from that Senate foreign relations vote on  the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Breaking  news, it looks like that Senate panel will vote for Mike Pompeo to be  secretary of state. </p><p>Jeff Flake and Rand Paul now saying they will vote for Michael Pompeo as  secretary of state. </p><p>We're going to take you back to Toronto, van mowed down nine people, and  injuring 16, killing nine in Toronto. We're going to bring you the latest  on that after the break. Don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Being confirm for you tonight, right now, we have nine  people that are dead. Sixteen that are injured. Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources, and I can assure the public all our  available resources have been brought in to address this tragic situation. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Take you to the developments in Toronto. Driver now in custody  after plowing a van into a crowd leaving nine people dead, sixteen injured,  seven critically. Toronto authorities held the press conference just  moments ago. We still do not know the driver's identity and his motive, we  will bring that to you as soon as it comes in. </p><p>General, listen, we have seen numerous van attacks like this and vehicular  attacks, a dozen since 2006, general. We've seen them in England, we've  seen them in Germany and Spain. And, of course, in Canada, as well as the  U.S. Your reaction, sir. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, it looks like a cookie cutter, Liz. By the rental van,  the number of people -- nine dead and 16 injured -- all the makings of  radical Islam. All I need to know is the driver's name and a little more  background, but I would say there's a 90 percent chance that this is  radical Islam. It wasn't an old man that had a heart attack or a stroke. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Again, we don't know the motive just yet. But we do know the  facts about prior vehicular attacks. Let's talk about that. Again, we don't  know the motive in Toronto. </p><p>General, you know, the terror capability has shifted. It is very difficult  for terrorists -- we're not saying this is terrorism -- it's difficult for  them to get bombs and explosives. It is easy for them to do vehicular  attacks. Your reaction to that. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, that's exactly what ISIS is telling their warriors across  the world, use vehicular attacks. And you can see all the ones that they've  done in the last year rather than explosives or even weapons, although  London are getting a lot of knives over there. But the fact is that is now  their modus operandi, and it's something that we should be cognizant of,  and it's very, very difficult to stop, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, and to your point, the days of the terror cell are  over. Now I think, to your point, terrorists -- and, again, we don't know  the motives of this attack. It has the hallmark of a terrorist attack.  Again, we'll bring you the motive as soon as it breaks. </p><p>To your point, general, you have said this before, ISIS and radical  terrorist leaders are saying stay in place and do your own terrorism. This  is a form of micro terrorism, right? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Exactly. And it's the patterns of behavior that I look at,  that's my business, patterns of behavior. And this is what you're seeing  now spread across all the cities in Europe as well as the United States in  New York City, for instance, where you are. And so this is what we must  expect, and it's extremely difficult to counter this. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, it's a senseless act of violence. What do you say to  the viewer out there, you know, these are just pedestrians walking on one  of Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, it's just near downtown Toronto. Are we  supposed to be having security barricades on every major block in every  urban area, every city? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  They would like that, but we're not going to do that. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Why would they like that? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Because that means the western world is being influenced by the  radical Islamists, to their way of thinking. They are putting control on  what we do just like when we go to an airport and all the checks we go  through. They like that. </p><p>But the fact is we've got to defeat this Islamic terrorism where the  ideology comes from, Mecca and Medina from the Middle East, and that's the  Muslims themselves. They must do that. And I'm hopeful that the new crown  prince of Saudi Arabia will be the leader against the radical Islamists in  his region so that they are no longer holy warriors and will go to paradise  for killing infidels. No, we must destroy that ideology. </p><p>MACDONALD:  It should be noted too that in Toronto a group of seven  security international meeting was occurring just up -- a few blocks away  from that terror attack. If we think -- let me back up, we don't know if  it's a terror attack, it has the hallmarks of that. Sir, you know, what are  the authorities asking this suspect right now? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, first of all, they want to get his name, and then you  want to get where he goes to church, what his basic beliefs are, what is  the reason he did this. If one person was killed, fine, that happens. But  not nine people. Not nine people. </p><p>MACDONALD:  General, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in  and handling two stories. I really appreciate it. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Again, we're going to take you back to the White House. This is  -- we're in breaking news mode. The president and first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and the first lady of France, they're  about to leave for Mount Vernon for a dinner overlooking at the Potomac. We  will bring it to you live. That is the home of George Washington.</p><p>And we're also moments away from that vote out of the Senate panel on the  nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. It looks like  that panel will vote for Mike Pompeo. Jeff Flake and Rand Paul saying yes  to Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p>But first, after Facebook's data breach scandal, other big tech companies  like Google could be next to face scrutiny over its data privacy practices.  We're on that story for you coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  After Facebook's data breach and data mining scandal, other big  tech companies like Google they are now in the hot seat over their data  privacy practices. A new report shows Google is way worse than Facebook at  collecting and keeping your personal information. They've been  cyberstalking you all over the internet even if you're not on Google's web  site for something else. </p><p>Let's take a look at how the stock of -- the stock of Google's parent  company Alphabet did after their company reporting slide to the downside,  and falling to less than 1 percent after hours. </p><p>Let's get to the panel on this. I want to bring in Danielle McLaughlin and  Kelsey Harkness. First to you, Kelsey, you know what's the creepiest part  of the story? It's that this Silicon Valley stalks you all over the  internet even though you're not on their web sites. That's the worse part  of the story. I don't think people realize that, Kelsey. </p><p>KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR REPORTER, DAILY SIGNAL:  Well, the level of outrage  directed at Google and Facebook is certainly understandable, but it's  really not surprising because Google and Facebook are billion dollar  companies--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, but isn't it creepy that Silicon Valley has all of the  information about what we're doing on the internet? </p><p>HARKNESS:  It's certainly creepy which is why Americans are upset about  this, but it's not surprising because they're not providing these services  for free. But I think what's important about these stories is that we don't  direct our anger towards the government and ask the government to regulate  the tech industry because the government, too, is collecting our personal  data. </p><p>Look at the CFBP, look at OPM, both of them had big, massive breaches. So  we need to let the free market solve this, we need to demand that tech  companies take it upon themselves to solve this and not get the government  involved in an area it really doesn't belong. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I used to be kind of OK with it, Danielle, and say, OK, you  know. But now I'm thinking, wait, this isn't good. To Kelsey's point, the  IRS has also had data breaches. The IRS knows a lot about our income. And  now Silicon Valley, Danielle knows too much about what we're doing on the  internet. I think it's kind of weird. </p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST:  It is weird, and it is a little  bit creepy, to your point. I think we have to make a decision societally  about who is going to regulate this. I take Kelsey's point about the notion  of the free market solving for this, but the free market hasn't solved for  this, and that's why we're in this position in the first place. </p><p>I actually do think that more like Europe -- which has very robust privacy  laws -- we should ask your government who are elected representative to  step in and make sure that these billion, trillion dollar companies in  Silicon Valley aren't just data mining. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Guys, I'm so sorry, we've got to break away because that Senate  vote on Mike Pompeo coming in, Rand Paul just now explaining why he changed  his vote. Let's listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAND PAUL, (R) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  I decided to go ahead and vote for  Director Pompeo because he's assured me that he's learned the lesson. Now,  time will tell if those assurances are true or not. And I won't say that --  I can say with absolute certainty I know what his opinions will be and how  they will come out over time, but I do take him at his word. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So they're about to vote, Kelsey, what's your reaction to this  180 out of Senate foreign relations now after that. Now the breaking news  it will, that panel will approve Mike Pompeo as secretary of state? What's  your reaction to the 180 here? </p><p>HARKNESS:  I think it's very good news. I think that it maybe appears  normal to a lot of Americans to hear that all Democrats are opposing  Pompeo's nomination, but this is not normal. Under the Obama administration  94 senators approved both Hillary Clinton and John Kerry for the same  position and, clearly, those are very divisive figures. </p><p>Mike Pompeo is very qualified to do this job and at a time when we are  about to enter into serious negotiations with North Korea, President Trump  needs a secretary of state by his side. </p><p>MACDONALD:  What do you think, Danielle? </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I do agree that we need a secretary of state at this very  crucial time in North Korea relations. What Rand Paul asked of Mike Pompeo  was two things, do you agree that war in the Middle East, more war in the  Middle East is destabilizing, number one, and number two, do you agree that  Iraq was a mistake? He got those reassurances from Mike Pompeo, and that's  what changed his vote. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Interesting. The vote is now underway. We're staying on top of  the vote. Final thought, Kelsey. </p><p>HARKNESS:  I think that this is good news for all Americans. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Kelsey and Danielle, thank you so much. We're up against a  hard break. The president and the president of France about to arrive at  Mount Vernon. We're going to stay on that story for you as well. Jam-packed  hour, don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. The Senate foreign relations committee now  voting for Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. Jeff Flake is yes, so as  Rand Paul. It goes to the full chamber for a vote where he is expected to  be confirmed as secretary of state. </p><p>We're also are waiting for President Trump and the first lady, the French  President Emmanuel Macron and his wife. They're headed to Mount Vernon, the  home of George Washington to have dinner overlooking the Potomac.</p><p>That does it for us. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources and I can assure the public all available  resources have been brought into address this tragic situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ELIZABETH MACDONALD, HOST, FOX NEWS:  Breaking news to the developing  situation in Toronto, a driver now in custody after plowing a van into a  crowd among Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, nine dead, 16 injured 17  critically. </p><p>I am Elizabeth MacDonald. This is Risk &amp; Reward. </p><p>The mayor of Toronto authorities just now holding a press conference, the  mayor saying it will likely be several days of disruption to the area  during the investigation. </p><p>Here with more let's get to Kristina Partsinevelos in the newsroom.  Kristina? </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Yes, this event only  happened a few hours ago at 1.30 p.m. Eastern Time. A white van from the  company Ryder, it's a rental van company plowed on to the sidewalk, what  you're seeing right now, started to hit a few pedestrians. According to eye  witnesses the pedestrians asked the van to stop, the driver continued going  hitting more pedestrians. </p><p>And as you mentioned there are nine dead, 16 injured. There's still no word  yet about the motivation behind this van attack. You had the mayor just  speak very recently, the Mayor of Toronto that's John Tory, and he said we  are admired the around the world for being inclusive doesn't want anybody  to jump to conclusions just yet as to the motive behind this attack. </p><p>Very importantly to note as well, this is the remaining a Toronto  investigation not a national investigation with the RCMP, the Royal  Canadian Mountain Police, again, this is a Toronto investigation they are  not releasing the name of the driver of the van but they were able to bring  him into custody. </p><p>He seemed uninjured based off of several eye witness videos that I've seen  when they caught him, he happened to have something in his hand. There's  still no confirmation what he was carrying but he was pointing it at a  police officer. There were no shots fired. </p><p>Again, this man is in custody. We do not have any details just yet on who  he is, what his motivation is, are the Toronto police are being very  careful right now with the information, making sure going through to see if  he had any cell phones looking through his records to see most importantly  if he is somebody that they recognize, that they know and could be  affiliated with other people, but right now this is a Toronto  investigation. </p><p>You have several, 16 people still injured and businesses that have been  damaged along the road because this white van went up on to the sidewalk,  hit pedestrians, even rammed into a bus station. There was one eye witness  that said he saw his family they're looking for their grandfather and  they're very worried and I was just listening to this live through Canadian  media that they found the grandfather's glasses on the ground and so  they're still waiting confirmation. </p><p>Several of the patients or victims have been brought to Sunny Brook  Hospital in Toronto, again Sunny Brook Hospital, so again we have nine  dead, 16 injured in this tragic event that's happening in Toronto as we  speak. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Kristina. We'll be staying on top of that story and  much more. </p><p>Let's get to your money. A widely held stock making lots of 401k plans  going up. Google parent company Alphabet reporting solid earnings and  revenues better than expected after the bell. </p><p>Let's get to Deirdre Bolton on the latest with that. Deirdre? </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  Hey, Liz. So after-hours, you are  going to see this stock kind of see sawing back and forth. So it had a big  reaction as you mentioned, Alphabet, Google exceeding both on the top and  bottom line and you had a jump of around 4 percent initially, so you can  see still higher. </p><p>But just coming off those posted session highs, there are still some really  big questions out there, Liz, for the long term of this company. You know,  Google has between eight to 10 times more data on you and on me than  Facebook so a lot of Facebook investors were saying hey, how come Mark  Zuckerberg got dragged before Congress? </p><p>Google has about eight gigabytes of data per person, that equals about  2,000 hours if we just listen straight through of music. If you want a  comparison point Facebook has about 650 megabytes which are smaller than  gigabytes and that equals about 160 hours of music. So just an interesting  kind of data point and it just shows you where this data power is. </p><p>A lot of people are saying Google is one of a kind so if you are an  investor you like to hear that. The flip side is, will it make regulators  consider one of a kind akin to monopoly which is not too far of a stretch.</p><p>We do know that the European regulators are putting in new privacy laws as  of May 25th of this year so tech companies, ones that are based here but  have customers in Europe, need to be compliant. If these companies are not  compliant this is not a small slap on the wrist, Liz, it is between $30  million or 4 percent of annual revenue whichever is higher, so there's a  lot of people saying OK, Google has a lot of work ahead. AlphabetGoogle,  excuse me. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Deirdre. Thank you so much.</p><p>We have a jam packed busy hour ahead. We are moments away from President  Trump and the first lady welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron and his  wife at the White House for the administration's first official state  dinner.</p><p>Let's get to Blake Burman with the latest. Blake? </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  At the hour the French president  has a busy couple of days here in Washington, Liz. I think you can see  behind me that they are expecting Emmanuel Macron here at the White House  within the next few minutes or so. </p><p>The itinerary is as follows. The Macron family, him and his wife, rather,  and the president and first lady will head to dinner tonight to George  Washington's home followed by talks tomorrow, a state dinner and then he  addresses Congress on Wednesday. </p><p>The White House says these two have a great rapport, and part of the reason  why he's receiving the first state visit. However, it is also clear that  there are stark differences on a policy level, for example, there are trade  issues at hand, as well as different views on the Iran nuclear deal and the  Paris climate accord all will be discussed in the up upcoming days. </p><p>As we await Macron here at the White House, the White House as well also  has its eyes on the goings up on Capitol Hill as it relates to the Senate  foreign relations committee as the secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo  is set to get the thumbs down from the Senate foreign relations committee  it appears within the next few minutes or so.</p><p>All 10 Democrats plus the Republican Rand Paul expected to vote against  Pompeo to become the next secretary of state; however, Pompeo still  expected to get a vote on the Senate floor and there it appears as though  as if he will have the numbers to become the next secretary of state. </p><p>Today, two more Democrats came to his side saying that they would support  him, Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly, add to that Heidi Heitkamp to that group  as well. </p><p>The White House is trying to make the argument to the United States Senate  that if you voted for John Kerry and if you voted for Hillary Clinton, then  you should vote for Mike Pompeo as well. The White House press secretary  Sarah Sanders saying what's going on, on Capitol Hill sends this message to  the rest of the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What it says to the  world is what we've been saying for a long time, the Senate has got some  real problems, namely to figure out how to actually show up and do their  job a little bit better. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now if Pompeo is voted down by the Senate foreign relations  committee, Liz, that would be the first time that would ever happen to a  secretary of state nominee if they eventually go on to become in that  position. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow, historic times, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And by the way both Democrats and Republicans voted for Pompeo  as CIA director. </p><p>BURMAN:  Yes, CIA director.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  You as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senate foreign relations committee, as Blake Burman just noted  is about -- they are about to vote on Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state.  Rand Paul tweeting out he will support the nomination he was against it. </p><p>Last month President Trump announced the departure of Rex Tillerson as  secretary of state and as nomination of Pompeo as the replacement. Now the  thinking is if it gets to the full chamber Pompeo will become the secretary  of state. Just going through this process right now, we're monitoring the  vote for you in the beginning.</p><p>Let's get to what's going on with the French visit. The media says this is  going to be a bad relationship. Got off to a rocky start but now, French  President Macron even taking a line from President Trump ahead of today's  state visit to the White House. Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE We have this very special relationship  because both of us are probably the maverick of the system, on both sides I  think President Trump's election was unexpected in your country, and  probably my election wasn't expected in my country, and we are not part of  the political system. I'm here to serve my people and my country and make  it great again, somebody I know very well could say, but that's it, that's  the whole story. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Joining me now, Weekly Standard executive editor, Fred Barnes.  Fred, make France great again, did you hear that? </p><p>FRED BARNES, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes, look, Macron, this  is, he is so sure, so smart, so likable, and Trump is just basking in and  he's getting everything he wants and Macron fought a big war and he wants  to make sure that Trump doesn't get out of the Iran nuclear deal and that  he gets back in the Paris accord, I think not much chance for that. </p><p>But he is smart. He is the big European leader who has stepped forward to  embrace Trump, not endorse him but give Trump somebody big to deal with. It  isn't going to be England, it isn't going to be what's the name, Angela  Merkel in Germany comes in I think on Friday and that's just a bit of a  sour puss and doesn't get along with Trump. But Macron has made an effort  here and it's very wise on his part. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, here is the thing. We've got that May 12 deadline for  the Iran deal. </p><p>BARNES:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  The president is expected to yank it saying he already said  this is the worst deal ever. So, and you're right, we've got Angela Merkel  coming in. You know, Fred, these state visits are coming at a time when  economic growth is up, optimism is up, the media reporting how the  Democrats may take back control of the House. </p><p>The president seems to be dominating the message, when people go to vote  they say, what are you going to do for me? </p><p>BARNES:  Yes, look, I wouldn't buy this line from the Democrats and from a  lot of people in the media that there's a blue wave coming and Democrats  are just going to sweep through and win the House and maybe the Senate in  November. </p><p>They do very well that would be what happens historically in the first mid- term election for a new president, but Trump is the dominant figure here  and he has got some very optimistic things to talk about, not just the  economy but in foreign policy as well. </p><p>Look, Macron was one of those who joined in the attack on the plants in  Syria where they mix and made the poisonous product that were used to kill  so many Syrians, so look, they worked together before and I think they'll  work together again, particularly here. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Macron has pointed out that they're both maverick  outsiders. </p><p>BARNES:  They are. </p><p>MACDONALD:  They're both businessmen, they're not part of the classical  political system. Both were elected on the first try. It seems like these  two men have a lot in common. So we've got the D.C. media up in arms  saying, you know, this is again it's going to be problems here with the  state visit, certainly with Angela Merkel, they're raising the red flags  about it. What do you see? </p><p>BARNES:  Well, look, I'll tell you what the media really wants and they're  going to hound poor Macron while he's here. They want him to dump on Trump  and he is refusing to do it, wouldn't be smart to do it. </p><p>MACDONALD:  How are they going -- how are they going to get the French  president to dump on President Trump? </p><p>BARNES:  Well, he's going to have a press conference among other things,  they'll yell questions at him, and look, they have ways to get that  question asked, but Macron is I think not going to do it. What purpose of  his would it serve? He says he's here to deal with the president of the  United States. He doesn't have to and doesn't have to comment personally on  Trump. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what, to your point, Fred, and it's an important one.  The media again, is misreading the situation.</p><p>BARNES:  I think so.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Macron likes his relationship with Trump because it improves  his own basically rookie standing with the E.U. He's now being called the  Trump whisperer. Macron is not going to damage that. He's not going to  damage how important he is now to the E.U. given his relationship with  Trump. </p><p>BARNES:  I think you're absolutely right. It serves his purpose very well.  Now, will Macron be able to talk Trump into not getting out of the Iran  deal, will he be able to talk him to getting into Paris climate accord? I  don't think so on either one of those things, but he'll get credit for  trying. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, Fred Barnes. Great stuff. Come back soon. </p><p>BARNES:  OK.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now let's get to this fast moving stock as Google parent  Alphabet reporting strong earnings and revenue after the bell. It's been  doing that every quarter since 2010. The stock is moving after-hours.  another great quarter for Google. But now, this. A new report Google does  get more personal information about you than even Facebook, as Deirdre  Bolton just said 8 to 10 times of Facebook. We're going to show you the  details.</p><p>We're also monitoring that Senate foreign relationships vote of Mike Pompeo  as secretary of state. Rand Paul breaking news here, just putting out he  will vote for Michael Pompeo, when the vote comes we're going to bring it  to you. Liberal newspapers now supporting Pompeo. We're going to show who.</p><p>But first, we're also watching President Trump and the first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife at the White House for the  administration's first official state dinner. We're going to bring that to  you live as well, jam-packed hour, really busy hour ahead, don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Back to this breaking news. We are monitoring French President  Emmanuel Macron he's about to appear at the White House any second, but the  first lady and the president will greet the French president and Mrs.  Macron at the White House.</p><p>Let's bring in Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor Katrina Pierson. It's a  historic visit, Katrina, now even President Macron effectively saying you  know what? President is the president to the American people, he's giving  that message the American people will deal with it. He's the president. </p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISOR:  Absolutely. This truly is a  refreshing display of leadership. You have two leaders who don't agree 100  percent on all of the policy positions but who have become friends and  respect each other as leaders and now we're here having a great visit. I  fully expect President Macron to make his case, with regards to trade and  Syria and Iraq. But here, I mean, Iran.</p><p>So here is the thing. President Trump is going to consider the president of  France as counsel absolutely as a courtesy, Liz. But let's make no mistake.  The president of the United States will be making policy for the United  States so I think this is a great opportunity for many in our own country  to see how elected leaders should act.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, to your point, it's well taken. Because the thinking  in the E.U. as President Macron is the leading edge of that wedge to get  the president to step back on the Iran deal, dial back on, you know, the  tariffs, and the potential trade wars, and also climate change. But your  point is President Trump is not going to do that, right? </p><p>PIERSON:  No, I don't think so because these are things that the president  has hold very dear and we've seen it throughout the campaign. You can go  all the way back to the 80s on some of these positions. But I do think he  would consider the counsel, but at the same time the president has made a  commitment to the United States and that is to put America and its people  first. That is not going to change. And I think the president of France  respects the president's opinion as well.</p><p>And when we look at the things like Iran, for example, the president was  very adamant on making some significant changes, things that a lot of  people agree with, regardless of how we entered this deal. We have a new  leader of the United States and he wants to have input. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So again, we're monitoring this situation unfolding right now  at the White House. You're looking at a live action shot of the White  House, the president of France with the first lady of France expected to  appear momentarily to greet the president and first lady Melania Trump. </p><p>President Macron to your point, Katrina, is expected to press President  Trump on trade. Here is what he said over the weekend. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACRON:  You cannot make it through the wall with the allies, it's too  complicated. If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade war  against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against them,  come on, it doesn't work. You need ally. We are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, so here is the messaging problem right for the president?  Katrina, he's got to say listen we're not talking about trade war. We're  talking about fair trade and the E.U. needs to get that message China has  not been fair. Go ahead. </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, absolutely, and we keep hearing that the president is doing  this to everyone else when in fact, everyone else has done this to the  United States and the president is simply saying look, we need fair and  reciprocal trade. </p><p>At the end of the day that's what going to matter. Many people in our own  country have doubted his ability to make these deals and to get things  done, but if you look at ISIS and tax reform he's even been bringing North  Korea to the table. So the president is actually doing things right. It  might be different, but we're actually getting things done. </p><p>And I think President Macron is going to get to hear President Trump's  position on these things as well. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Here is an unfolding breaking news situation and it's happening  right now with Russia and Iran as it pertains to the E.U. Katrina, to your  point, record amounts of U.S. oil is now flooding into E.U. markets, that  deal with Iran that Obama struck, there's a May 12 deadline that is looming  the president could yank what he says is the worst deal ever and impose  sanctions.</p><p>Again, Iran is backed by Russia, Russia supplies a lot of oil and Nat gas  to the E.U. We are just hearing the breaking news that the U.S. is now  becoming the number one oil exporter into the E.U changing geopolitical  landscape in the favor of the U.S. right here, Katrina. </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, and that's exactly what we call making America great again,  and President Trump knows one thing and that is leverage. He wrote about  it. And he knows and the world knows that if the president was to pull out  of the Iran deal, perhaps go back to the sanctions on the Iran central bank  or oil exports it's going to be a problem. </p><p>But these are things like, you know, looking at including the long range  missiles and you know, eliminating the sunset provision on things like I  don't know, you're reaching -- enriching uranium which is a huge problem  for Iran.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>PIERSON:  And the president of France they need to understand is we don't  see the dust to France chance coming out of Iran like we see coming from  Iran to America.</p><p>MACDONALD:  To you--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PIERSON:  And President Trump takes that very seriously.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, they are now as you can see at the White House raising  the welcoming flags 15 months into his presidency, the president is finally  rolling out the red carpet for the president of France and what will happen  after Macron appears they will go for a sunset dinner on the terrace of  George Washington's home in Mount Vernon overlooking the Potomac. </p><p>Katrina, Macron is expected to, to your point, really prep the president on  the Iran deal. He is the leader, he's seen by the E.U. as the Trump whisper  that he can basically coax the president into staying in the Iran deal.  Macron, though, watch this, Katrina, admitting though that that deal as the  president has said has flaws. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MACRON:  It this as if agreement perfect and this JCPOA a perfect thing for  our relationship with Iran, no. But for nuclear, what do you have as a  better option? I don't see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  The car is now rolling up with the leader of France so Macron  says that they would finish the war against ISIS. If we leave, we leave it  open to Iran and Syria, they are going to fuel a new terrorist war. What  are your thoughts? </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, I think President Trump is also coming at this from a  different perspective. You know, we've had this, that we've been doing the  same thing over and over again expecting different results and President  Trump doesn't want to do that anymore and he's not saying end it  altogether, he wants to make revisions. </p><p>And now that we see that they're cracking down on anti-government  protesters that's a problem particularly if we're just going to sit back  and allow this to happen not really knowing what's going on. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Let me break in here. The president is just stepping  outside the White House with the first lady ready to greet the president of  France, and Mrs. Macron as well. Tomorrow night there will be a state  dinner and a break with tradition, President Trump has invited no Democrat  members of Congress or journalists. About 150 guests will take their seats  in the state ding room tomorrow night. </p><p>It's going to be a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack  Obama. Obama's guest list went into the hundreds and the president really  wants to keep this close relationship. And here he is, the president of  France greeting and a hug with the president of the United States. Let's  watch this and let this moment sink in. </p><p>OK, Katrina, what we're watching now is a warm embrace between the leader  of France and his wife is with the leader of the United States. It looks  really quite collegial; they are now turning for the official photograph. </p><p>Katrina, Trump seems, the president seems to be going all out on pomp and  circumstance. That's how much he had in Paris last July when the president  of France invited him to watch the annual Bastille Day. What's your  reaction to rolling out the red carpet for the president of France? </p><p>PIERSON:  Well, it is Donald Trump, Liz, so I think we can fully expect the  best with the president and Melania who, you know, is a class act in and of  her own. I mean, it's just an amazing opportunity for us to all see what  we're seeing right now and that is, you know, refreshing leadership,  bringing two countries together, even though they have their differences,  willing to work together for what they do agree upon. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Our allies, Katrina, for 50 years. Katrina Pierson, thank you  so much for weighing in there. I really appreciate it.</p><p>PIERSON:  Great to be here. Thank you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We're also monitoring this breaking developing situation,  we're moments away from the Senate foreign relations vote on the nomination  of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Not the final  confirmation the full chamber is expected to vote for Pompeo. A rebuke  tough, Senate foreign relations don't want him. We're going to bring you  that breaking news as it comes in. Don't go away, stay with us, more after  the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS:  At some point, Democrats have to decide whether they love this  country more than they hate this president, and they have to decide that  they want to put the safety and the security and the diplomacy of our  country ahead of their own political games, and we're very hopeful that  they will. </p><p>Mike Pompeo is a highly qualified individual. He's been one of the leading  people when it comes to the negotiations and the conversations with North  Korea, and to stop that would be a incredibly dangerous and damaging for  our country and for the world. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We're staying in breaking news mode. We've got more  developments, look at this. Republican Senator Jeff Flake now a yes on the  nomination. He will vote yes that Pompeo should be secretary of state with  Rand Paul. That means the Senate foreign relations panel is doing a 180. </p><p>Instead of rebuking this nomination it looks like the Senate foreign  relations panel will confirm Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p>Let's bring in the Daily Caller editorial director, Vince Coglianese. What  a turn around, Vince? </p><p>VINCE COGLIANESE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, DAILY CALLER:  That's quite a change of  events. Rand Paul, of course the big hold out, you mentioned Jeff Flake as  well, but Rand Paul, the president saying in public that he wanted to see  Rand come with him, and that is happening, that's a huge deal. </p><p>And it's important that the Senate foreign relations committee do this,  give him a stamp of approval given the unheard-of nature of sending out  somebody with disapproval to be voted on by the full Senate approve. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's right. Let's get to the viewer, he comes out of  Senate foreign relations, it looks like the Senate foreign relations panel  does vote yes saying, yes, Pompeo should be the next secretary of state.  Then it goes to the full Senate where Pompeo is expected to be confirmed as  secretary of state. </p><p>You know, here's the thing, initially, Vince, the storyline was that, you  know, they didn't like Pompeo's position on Iran.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  They thought he was too much of a hawk. He was supposed to be  the easy confirmation. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes</p><p>MACDONALD:  He was supposed to be the no-brainer, and all of a sudden he  was a problem that even Democrats and Republicans who voted for him as CIA  director were saying, no, we don't want him as secretary of state in the  middle of the North Korea breakthroughs. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Right. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I mean, it is a stunning, you know, revelation of what's going  on in D.C. when you have historic developments going on with North Korea.  And they're saying no to Pompeo when he's trying to strike these deals. Go  ahead.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  Yes. And it was a temper tantrum that lead them to that  conclusion, and I say that because this was a referendum on Trump. And all  of the assessments that we've heard from Democrats it was about -- it was  about Mike Pompeo's insufficient because he's not going to rein in Trump's  worth instincts. </p><p>There's no evidence for that. As the head of the CIA, he's had an  unblemished career there, he's had a good career prior to that as well. He  was, as you said, confirmed by the Senate to run the CIA before including  with Democratic support, and now he's got the opportunity to be secretary  of state. </p><p>And there's such an important resume item there for Mike Pompeo, and you  mentioned it. It's the fact that he's leading negotiations with North  Korea. This is an historic moment in terms of just having a U.S. official  leading such a high-level negotiation with North Korea. </p><p>To throw him out, to get rid of him as secretary of state would be a  preposterous exercise in politics--</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>COGLIANESE:  -- and one the Democrats should not suffer right now because  if they do, they will suffer politically in the future politically for  making such a horrendous decision. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, historians and analysts have already said if the  president gets that North Korea deal, it will be on the level of  Reagan/Gorbachev. </p><p>We have three liberal newspapers saying, you know what? Obstructionist  Democrats, stop. You have to put Pompeo in as secretary of state. The  president needs be a secretary of state. They are, USA Today, a writer at  the Washington Post, and the New York Daily News. Your final reaction,  Vince. </p><p>COGLIANESE:  Well, only that Barack Obama was given a Nobel Peace prize the  moment he came into office for doing nothing. If this is accomplished, as  you were mentioning, a peaceful North Korea of any kind, a meaningful peace  and one that draws down nuclear weapons, then I expect that Donald Trump  will receive a nomination for it, not that the Nobel Prize committee will  ever seriously consider him. </p><p>He's not exactly beloved by the globalist communist, but Mike Pompeo should  be right up there on that stage accepting the same thing. We have a long  way to go before we get there, but this is a big deal, and Mike Pompeo  should clear the bar at the United States Senate. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Great to see you, Vince. </p><p>Let's take you back to the White House. A truly lovely event is about to  be, take place right now. The two couples will plant a tree. It's a gift  from the president and president of France and Mrs. Macron they are going  to plant a tree, a sapling, a European oak on the South Lawn of the White  House about four and a half feet tall. </p><p>We're going to bring that to you live as it happens. Interesting note here,  First lady Melania Trump is really taking the lead here in organizing this  historic visit. </p><p>Quick, we're going to have more after the break. Also we're staying on the  situation in Toronto, that van plowing down pedestrians. Nine dead, 17  injured, seven critically. We're going to bring you the latest on that. A  suspect has been arrested. No motive yet. We will bring that to you live.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The nightmare, I've got to Yonge, and I've seen a lady  with her leg -- man, it was a gruesome scene. It's really bad out there. I  couldn't believe what I've seen, man. It was, man. Everybody, all these  people on the streets getting hit one by one. Post office boxes getting  crumpled up on people. And one person got dragged on and their blood is all  over Yonge. It's really bad out there, man. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We are basically are watching the president with the first  lady and the leader of France and the first lady of France now stepping out  of the portico, the White House. They're now going to enter the South Lawn. </p><p>There's first lady Melania right there. She's been organizing this historic  state visit. It is the White House's first state visit 15 months into the  Trump presidency. </p><p>They're going to plant a tree on the South Lawn. It is a gift from France  to the United States. It is a European oak sapling, four and a half feet  tall. </p><p>We have lieutenant general Thomas McInerney here. Sir, this is a developing  situation as well. General, the E.U. is look to the president of France to  coax President Donald Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. Your  reaction. </p><p>THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE:  Well, it's natural, and  they send President Macron over here to use him because he probably has the  best relationship of any of the European leaders right now, so I'm not  surprise. I do not think the president is going to change. He knows what he  wants to do. </p><p>The Europeans on the Iranian deal, it's purely a cash cow. They're ignoring  the nuclear threat per se. It's cash. They've got a huge trade surplus  going, and they're working it to their advantage. But that's not good  enough. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, it seems when you read, study what the president of  France, general, has been saying about ISIS leaving Syria and Iran's  growing presence with military bases in Syria, on the one hand the  president of France is saying as soon as -- if we leave, if we, the United  States, leave Syria, Iran will step in and cause terrorist activities to go  on the increase. </p><p>But at the same time, he wants the president to stay in the Iran nuclear  deal. Can you square this for the viewer, can you explain that and sort  that out? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Yes, I'll make it very simple. We should stay with the limited  number of people in Syria with 24/7 air power, so if they try to take over  any of the Kurdish places or the Syrian allies, then we can use that air  power to beat them down and to defeat them. </p><p>Now, as far as the nuclear deal goes, that was such a bad deal that no  agreement should ever have been made, the JCPOA, Liz. And we should back  out of that from both a military and a political point of view. Again,  remember, the European Union's interest is primarily in trade. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Let me just give you some background information about the tree  that was just planted. There is historic information about the reason that  France gave the United States and the White House this tree. </p><p>Over 9,000 American marines died in World War I in what's called the  Belleau Wood, this tree is from the area of that battle in June 1918 where  9,000 American marines died in World War I. That as far is a memorial site.  It's an important symbol of the sacrifice the United States made to insure  peace and stability in Europe.</p><p>General, your reaction to the president of France giving this oak tree to  the United States in commemoration of World War I marines dying there. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Liz, it's very, very symbolic. The Battle of Belleau Wood was a  horrendous battle. We lost, as you said, 9,000 marines. And to make this  tree come from that region really touches on our relationship. And I think  it is a very symbolic gesture by President Macron and symbolic of the  relationship between the president and President Trump. </p><p>MACDONALD:  What does this do for the psyche of the Trump administration,  to have these memorable events come up and in the ensuing days? This will  be a three-day visit, the president of Germany -- Germany, rather, Angela  Merkel will be coming on Friday. How does this set the scene for the  presidency of Donald Trump? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, I think it establishes it on a high note. People are  seeing the way the Trumps handle their visitors and the relationships  developing. The left has always wanted to deny that President Trump had  that capability. He's absolutely brilliant at it. You're seeing it today  and you'll see it at dinner tonight at Mount Vernon and the state dinner  they have. </p><p>The whole three days that the Macrons are here and how they're honored is  going to show the world and the American people what a great leader  President Trump and Mrs. Trump are. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We will be covering the Chancellor of Germany's visit, Angela  Merkel as well, coming later this week. Good to see you, general. Thanks  for coming in. I really appreciate it. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Thank, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We are moments away from that Senate foreign relations vote on  the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. Breaking  news, it looks like that Senate panel will vote for Mike Pompeo to be  secretary of state. </p><p>Jeff Flake and Rand Paul now saying they will vote for Michael Pompeo as  secretary of state. </p><p>We're going to take you back to Toronto, van mowed down nine people, and  injuring 16, killing nine in Toronto. We're going to bring you the latest  on that after the break. Don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Being confirm for you tonight, right now, we have nine  people that are dead. Sixteen that are injured. Toronto police service has  mobilized all available resources, and I can assure the public all our  available resources have been brought in to address this tragic situation. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Take you to the developments in Toronto. Driver now in custody  after plowing a van into a crowd leaving nine people dead, sixteen injured,  seven critically. Toronto authorities held the press conference just  moments ago. We still do not know the driver's identity and his motive, we  will bring that to you as soon as it comes in. </p><p>General, listen, we have seen numerous van attacks like this and vehicular  attacks, a dozen since 2006, general. We've seen them in England, we've  seen them in Germany and Spain. And, of course, in Canada, as well as the  U.S. Your reaction, sir. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, it looks like a cookie cutter, Liz. By the rental van,  the number of people -- nine dead and 16 injured -- all the makings of  radical Islam. All I need to know is the driver's name and a little more  background, but I would say there's a 90 percent chance that this is  radical Islam. It wasn't an old man that had a heart attack or a stroke. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Again, we don't know the motive just yet. But we do know the  facts about prior vehicular attacks. Let's talk about that. Again, we don't  know the motive in Toronto. </p><p>General, you know, the terror capability has shifted. It is very difficult  for terrorists -- we're not saying this is terrorism -- it's difficult for  them to get bombs and explosives. It is easy for them to do vehicular  attacks. Your reaction to that. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, that's exactly what ISIS is telling their warriors across  the world, use vehicular attacks. And you can see all the ones that they've  done in the last year rather than explosives or even weapons, although  London are getting a lot of knives over there. But the fact is that is now  their modus operandi, and it's something that we should be cognizant of,  and it's very, very difficult to stop, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, and to your point, the days of the terror cell are  over. Now I think, to your point, terrorists -- and, again, we don't know  the motives of this attack. It has the hallmark of a terrorist attack.  Again, we'll bring you the motive as soon as it breaks. </p><p>To your point, general, you have said this before, ISIS and radical  terrorist leaders are saying stay in place and do your own terrorism. This  is a form of micro terrorism, right? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Exactly. And it's the patterns of behavior that I look at,  that's my business, patterns of behavior. And this is what you're seeing  now spread across all the cities in Europe as well as the United States in  New York City, for instance, where you are. And so this is what we must  expect, and it's extremely difficult to counter this. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, it's a senseless act of violence. What do you say to  the viewer out there, you know, these are just pedestrians walking on one  of Toronto's busiest thoroughfares, it's just near downtown Toronto. Are we  supposed to be having security barricades on every major block in every  urban area, every city? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  They would like that, but we're not going to do that. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Why would they like that? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Because that means the western world is being influenced by the  radical Islamists, to their way of thinking. They are putting control on  what we do just like when we go to an airport and all the checks we go  through. They like that. </p><p>But the fact is we've got to defeat this Islamic terrorism where the  ideology comes from, Mecca and Medina from the Middle East, and that's the  Muslims themselves. They must do that. And I'm hopeful that the new crown  prince of Saudi Arabia will be the leader against the radical Islamists in  his region so that they are no longer holy warriors and will go to paradise  for killing infidels. No, we must destroy that ideology. </p><p>MACDONALD:  It should be noted too that in Toronto a group of seven  security international meeting was occurring just up -- a few blocks away  from that terror attack. If we think -- let me back up, we don't know if  it's a terror attack, it has the hallmarks of that. Sir, you know, what are  the authorities asking this suspect right now? </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Well, first of all, they want to get his name, and then you  want to get where he goes to church, what his basic beliefs are, what is  the reason he did this. If one person was killed, fine, that happens. But  not nine people. Not nine people. </p><p>MACDONALD:  General, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for coming in  and handling two stories. I really appreciate it. </p><p>MCINERNEY:  Thanks, Liz. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Again, we're going to take you back to the White House. This is  -- we're in breaking news mode. The president and first lady welcoming  French President Emmanuel Macron and the first lady of France, they're  about to leave for Mount Vernon for a dinner overlooking at the Potomac. We  will bring it to you live. That is the home of George Washington.</p><p>And we're also moments away from that vote out of the Senate panel on the  nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. It looks like  that panel will vote for Mike Pompeo. Jeff Flake and Rand Paul saying yes  to Mike Pompeo as secretary of state. </p><p>But first, after Facebook's data breach scandal, other big tech companies  like Google could be next to face scrutiny over its data privacy practices.  We're on that story for you coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  After Facebook's data breach and data mining scandal, other big  tech companies like Google they are now in the hot seat over their data  privacy practices. A new report shows Google is way worse than Facebook at  collecting and keeping your personal information. They've been  cyberstalking you all over the internet even if you're not on Google's web  site for something else. </p><p>Let's take a look at how the stock of -- the stock of Google's parent  company Alphabet did after their company reporting slide to the downside,  and falling to less than 1 percent after hours. </p><p>Let's get to the panel on this. I want to bring in Danielle McLaughlin and  Kelsey Harkness. First to you, Kelsey, you know what's the creepiest part  of the story? It's that this Silicon Valley stalks you all over the  internet even though you're not on their web sites. That's the worse part  of the story. I don't think people realize that, Kelsey. </p><p>KELSEY HARKNESS, SENIOR REPORTER, DAILY SIGNAL:  Well, the level of outrage  directed at Google and Facebook is certainly understandable, but it's  really not surprising because Google and Facebook are billion dollar  companies--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, but isn't it creepy that Silicon Valley has all of the  information about what we're doing on the internet? </p><p>HARKNESS:  It's certainly creepy which is why Americans are upset about  this, but it's not surprising because they're not providing these services  for free. But I think what's important about these stories is that we don't  direct our anger towards the government and ask the government to regulate  the tech industry because the government, too, is collecting our personal  data. </p><p>Look at the CFBP, look at OPM, both of them had big, massive breaches. So  we need to let the free market solve this, we need to demand that tech  companies take it upon themselves to solve this and not get the government  involved in an area it really doesn't belong. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I used to be kind of OK with it, Danielle, and say, OK, you  know. But now I'm thinking, wait, this isn't good. To Kelsey's point, the  IRS has also had data breaches. The IRS knows a lot about our income. And  now Silicon Valley, Danielle knows too much about what we're doing on the  internet. I think it's kind of weird. </p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST:  It is weird, and it is a little  bit creepy, to your point. I think we have to make a decision societally  about who is going to regulate this. I take Kelsey's point about the notion  of the free market solving for this, but the free market hasn't solved for  this, and that's why we're in this position in the first place. </p><p>I actually do think that more like Europe -- which has very robust privacy  laws -- we should ask your government who are elected representative to  step in and make sure that these billion, trillion dollar companies in  Silicon Valley aren't just data mining. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Guys, I'm so sorry, we've got to break away because that Senate  vote on Mike Pompeo coming in, Rand Paul just now explaining why he changed  his vote. Let's listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAND PAUL, (R) UNITED STATES SENATOR:  I decided to go ahead and vote for  Director Pompeo because he's assured me that he's learned the lesson. Now,  time will tell if those assurances are true or not. And I won't say that --  I can say with absolute certainty I know what his opinions will be and how  they will come out over time, but I do take him at his word. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So they're about to vote, Kelsey, what's your reaction to this  180 out of Senate foreign relations now after that. Now the breaking news  it will, that panel will approve Mike Pompeo as secretary of state? What's  your reaction to the 180 here? </p><p>HARKNESS:  I think it's very good news. I think that it maybe appears  normal to a lot of Americans to hear that all Democrats are opposing  Pompeo's nomination, but this is not normal. Under the Obama administration  94 senators approved both Hillary Clinton and John Kerry for the same  position and, clearly, those are very divisive figures. </p><p>Mike Pompeo is very qualified to do this job and at a time when we are  about to enter into serious negotiations with North Korea, President Trump  needs a secretary of state by his side. </p><p>MACDONALD:  What do you think, Danielle? </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I do agree that we need a secretary of state at this very  crucial time in North Korea relations. What Rand Paul asked of Mike Pompeo  was two things, do you agree that war in the Middle East, more war in the  Middle East is destabilizing, number one, and number two, do you agree that  Iraq was a mistake? He got those reassurances from Mike Pompeo, and that's  what changed his vote. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Interesting. The vote is now underway. We're staying on top of  the vote. Final thought, Kelsey. </p><p>HARKNESS:  I think that this is good news for all Americans. </p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Kelsey and Danielle, thank you so much. We're up against a  hard break. The president and the president of France about to arrive at  Mount Vernon. We're going to stay on that story for you as well. Jam-packed  hour, don't go away. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Breaking news. The Senate foreign relations committee now  voting for Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. Jeff Flake is yes, so as  Rand Paul. It goes to the full chamber for a vote where he is expected to  be confirmed as secretary of state. </p><p>We're also are waiting for President Trump and the first lady, the French  President Emmanuel Macron and his wife. They're headed to Mount Vernon, the  home of George Washington to have dinner overlooking the Potomac.</p><p>That does it for us. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Facebook gave researchers and journalists deeper access, allowing them to extract information directly from the library so they could create their own databases and tools to analyze the ads -- and ferret out disinformation that had slipped past the social network's safeguards.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''We know we can't protect elections alone,'' Facebook said when it unveiled the latest version of its Ad Library in March. ''We're committed to creating a new standard of transparency and authenticity for advertising.''</p><p>  But instead of setting a new standard, Facebook appears to have fallen short. While ordinary users can look up individual ads without a problem, access to the library's data is so plagued by bugs and technical constraints that it is effectively useless as a way to comprehensively track political advertising, according to independent researchers and two previously unreported studies on the archive's reliability, one by the French government and the other by researchers at Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox web browser.</p><p>  The problems raise new questions about Facebook's commitment to battling disinformation, and reflect the struggles of big tech firms and governments across the world to counter it.</p><p>United States officials are already grappling with Russian attempts to interfere in the 2020 presidential race, and are powerless to stop American tricksters from joining the fray, because they are protected by the First Amendment. In Europe, an ambitious effort to build an early warning system fell flat during European Parliament elections in May, producing no alerts, despite Russian disinformation campaigns that officials said were designed to sway public opinion and depress voter turnout.</p><p>  For Facebook, in particular, it is an especially challenging moment: The company was ordered to pay a record $5 billion fine by the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday for privacy violations, and it agreed to better police how it handles its users' data. The measures, though, will do little to help the company with its disinformation problem.</p><p>  The Mozilla researchers, who provided their report to The New York Times, had originally set out to track political advertising ahead of the European elections using the application program interface, or A.P.I., that Facebook set up to provide access to the library's data. They instead ended up documenting problems with Facebook's library after managing to download the information they needed on only two days in a six-week span because of bugs and technical issues, all of which they reported to Facebook.</p><p>  In one instance, Jason Chuang, a Mozilla researcher, engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with Facebook about a bug that crashed a search after 59 pages of results. Weeks later, a Facebook representative sent a message saying, ''This is unfortunately a won't fix for now.''</p><p>  The representative added, ''We wait for improvement to arrive in the long term and we'll keep tracking it internally.''</p><p>Facebook later sent a message saying that it had fixed the bug, and that the search could be done without crashing the library. But the note came from a person who had not handled the previous report and was sent to a different message chain about a separate issue the Mozilla researchers were encountering. And as recently as this week, the researchers said the library still crashed when they tried to check if the bug was fixed.</p><p>  On two other occasions, the researchers said Facebook blocked them from reporting fresh bugs. The reason? They had already reported too many.</p><p>  ''One could just call it broken,'' said Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University who has spent months trying to use the library to build her own database of political advertising in the United States.</p><p>  The library was a centerpiece of Facebook's response to the  growing anger and the prospect of government regulation it faced around the world. It was one of a number of initiatives -- including expanded fact-checking efforts and changes to how its news feed was ranked -- that executives promoted as examples of how Facebook was a responsible corporate citizen that could be trusted to fix its own problems. Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, even included the archive among the ''strong steps'' the company had taken to curb abuse on the network when she testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee in September.</p><p>  In response to questions for this article, Satwik Shukla, a Facebook product manager, said, ''We were the first to introduce this level of ads transparency, and it remains a priority.''</p><p>  He added that Facebook was working hard to address issues with access to the library's data through the A.P.I. and ''continually seeks feedback from researchers and journalists.''</p><p>  [Get the Bits newsletter for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.]</p><p>Facebook's rivals have also sought to make advertising on their platforms more transparent. Google has set up its own archive, allowing researchers to download data on ads bought through the company, including ones on its search pages, as well as ads that run on YouTube, which is owned by the same business.</p><p>Google's archive appears to be functioning better than Facebook's, the Mozilla researchers and French officials found. But critics say it is missing a crucial component: It does not include what are known as issue ads -- that is, ads that seek to sway opinion about a topic instead of a candidate. Many of the ads placed by Russian trolls in 2016, for instance, were about issues, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, and Google has said that it is looking at ways to include issue ads in the archive.</p><p>Twitter, which accounts for a tiny percentage of political advertising, has set up its own Ad Transparency Center. But the French researchers found that the initiative did not offer a comprehensive accounting of political ads on the platform. Twitter said that only a small percentage of video ads were missing, and that they would soon be incorporated into the library.</p><p>Twitter also does not allow users to download the data wholesale, though that can be done through a process the French researchers said was ''time-consuming, requires advanced programming skills and entails potential violations of Twitter's'' rules.</p><p>Facebook's critics acknowledged that the company was doing more than its competitors to open up advertising to independent scrutiny. Many also noted that paid advertising represented only a small portion of disinformation on social media.</p><p>  Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who has been pushing the Honest Ads Act, which would require tech companies to maintain online libraries of political advertising, said he appreciated Facebook's efforts.</p><p>  But ''given the resources that Facebook has available, I would like to see more,'' Mr. Warner said in response to a question from The Times.</p><p>  Providing access to tens of millions of ads through an A.P.I. is not a simple proposition, but it is also not an engineering feat for a company like Facebook. With 2.4 billion users, Facebook routinely rolls out complicated new features and products at scales that few tech firms could hope to manage.</p><p>  ''This is not like a problem that technology hasn't solved and they're really trying to do their best,'' said Ms. Edelson, the N.Y.U. researcher. ''No, that's not what is going on. These are fixable problems.''</p><p>  Ms. Edelson, who has provided data obtained from Facebook's library to The Times, is a veteran computer engineer who has spent two decades collecting and storing large amounts of data. She said she was able to extract data from Facebook's library by ''crafting an extremely careful strategy to navigate around the bumps.''</p><p>  Ms. Edelson wrote software to get around some problems, such as ''infinite loops'' -- that is, when the library gets stuck returning the same results over and over again. Many of her other fixes were jury-rigged bits of code to handle specific technical problems, she said.</p><p>  Extracting all the data from the library, she said, ''is probably impossible if you are following all the rules.''</p><p>  Reporters from The Times tried to use data from the library to analyze political advertising ahead of last year's midterm elections. But their work was thwarted by bugs and technical limits imposed by Facebook on how information could be searched and retrieved.</p><p>  The Mozilla analysts and French officials, who also provided their research to The Times, reported a slew of similar problems. They found that identical searches often returned different results, and that the library became unreliable and often crashed when they tried to extract large amounts of information. The bugs and technical limits made it functionally impossible to track political advertising in some places, the French reported, citing the United States as an example.</p><p>  In late May, Facebook reported there were 3.8 million ads in the American library. With each search limited to 2,000 results, the researchers needed to do 1,900 searches to collect all the data, ''which we found impossible to achieve in the two weeks we tried,'' they said.</p><p>  The French officials also found that Facebook sometimes removed ads without explanation. They said 31 percent of the ads in the French library were removed in the week before the European elections, including at least 11 that violated French electoral law.</p><p>  The company later told the researchers that the deletions were the result of a labeling problem. But Matti Schneider, the French foreign ministry official who oversaw the research, said it was important to see all the ads, even those that did not comply with Facebook's labeling rules.</p><p>  The deletions raise questions about ''the trust one can put in research based on such shaky ground,'' he said.</p><p>  Interested in All Things Tech?

Delrahim made the comments as the Department of Justice[2] and the Federal Trade Commission[3] are beginning to scrutinize Apple[4], Alphabet[5], Facebook[6], and Amazon[7]. He also defended the DOJ against the charge that it focuses too much on consumer prices in weighing the effects of companies' market power, acknowledging there can be other harms. Delrahim's comments come as his own role in the investigating the tech companies has come under scrutiny. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[8]. Makan Delharim thinks the current legal code is more than sufficient to safeguard competition in the tech industry. </p><p>As federal enforcement officials begin to probe Alphabet[9], Apple[10], Facebook[11], and Amazon[12] over potential antitrust violations, some policymakers and legal experts have questioned whether new laws are needed to rein in the companies. But in a speech[13] at a conference in Tel Aviv Israel Tuesday, Makan, the top antitrust official in the Justice Department, made clear he's not among them. \"We already have in our possession the tools we need to enforce the antitrust laws in cases involving digital technologies,\" Makan, an assistant attorney general, said in the speech, which CNBC previously reported[14]. \"US antitrust law is flexible enough to be applied to markets old and new.\" Pointing to the government's case 20 years ago against Microsoft and the nation's long history of challenging the power of dominant companies, he added: \"Those who say we need new or amended antitrust laws to address monopoly concerns should look to history and take heart.\" Debate has been growing over what, if anything, policymakers should do about the power wielded by the big-tech companies. Google parent Alphabet has already been fined by European regulators three times[15] for anti-competitive actions. Apple just lost a decision[16] at the US Supreme Court in an antitrust case and is the subject of a formal antitrust complaint in Europe made by Spotify[17]. Facebook has drawn intense scrutiny for all the data it's collected on its billions of users and the ways in which its immense social network has been hijacked to widely spread propaganda.Antitrust laws are old but adequateEarlier this month, the Washington Post reported that the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission have divvied up oversight over the four biggest tech companies[18], with the DOJ looking at Apple and Alphabet and the FTC taking on Amazon and Facebook. But some antitrust experts and other policymakers have argued that new laws are needed to control the companies. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president, has called for legislation[19] that would classify as \"utilities\" any tech company with more than $25 billion in revenue that runs a marketplace or has its own platform. It would also bar those tech utilities from owning companies that participate on their service. The US has two major antitrust laws \u2014 the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act. Both are more than 100 years old and were written in an earlier era of monopolies, but in Delrahim's view, they are robust enough to handle any of today's problems. \"Through their general wording, and their focus on competitive process and consumer welfare, the antitrust laws allow US courts to continue to apply legal principles and sound economic reasoning to identify harmful practices that the antitrust laws should prevent,\" he said. Read this: Top antitrust enforcer at DOJ reveals 3 ways the agency could make a case against big tech companies like Google and Apple[20]The DOJ is concerned with more than just pricesIn recent years, many antitrust experts on the left have charged that the courts and enforcement regulators have paid too much attention to consumer prices when it comes to evaluating the impact of a company's dominance over a particular market or potential mergers. But Delrahim pushed back against that view. The DOJ recognizes that monopolies sometimes lower prices and that limited competition can have harms other than just increased consumer costs, he said. Innovation and quality can also be hampered when companies have too much power or too few rivals to keep them honest. \"The Antitrust Division does not take a myopic view of competition,\" Delrahim said. \"It is well-settled ... that competition has price and non-price dimensions,\" he continued. But as the DOJ ramps of its probe of Alphabet and Apple, Delrahim himself is now facing criticism. Warren on Tuesday called for him to recuse himself from any investigations into the two companies, because of lobbying work he did for them. Delrahim lobbied on Google's behalf in 2007 for its acquisition of DoubleClick and on Apple's behalf in 2006 and 2007 on patent issues. \"Your past work as a lobbyist for two of the largest and most scrutinized tech companies in the world creates the appearance of conflict of interest,\" Warren said in a letter to Delrahim[21], which was previously reported by The Verge[22]. \"As the head of the antitrust division at the DOJ, you should not be supervising investigations into former clients who paid you tens of thousands of dollars to lobby the federal government.\" Got a tip about the tech industry?

Last year, big tech gave the stock market its largest gains.The chorus of strategists calling for caution on tech stocks keeps getting louder. Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief US equity strategist, is among those who say the sector is unlikely to repeat its role in 2017 as the stock market's leader. Strategists at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch[1], Goldman Sachs[2], and Morgan Stanley[3] have also sounded a cautious tone on big tech. </p><p> \"We're not telling you these stocks are going to crater,\" Citi's Levkovich told Business Insider in a recent interview[4]. \"We are saying they could underperform, which is a very different story.\" Some of the big tech news of the year that has added to investors' caution has come from the so-called FAANGs that propelled the market last year[5]; theNasdaq 100[6] surged 21% last year. As Facebook[7] continued to deal with election interference, the harvesting of its users' data by a quiz app and Cambridge Analytica[8] was blown into the public's view. President Donald Trump went after Amazon[9] for crushing smaller retailers. Analysts were worried about sluggish iPhone X demand[10]. Coupled with Levkovich's list of reasons why tech could underperform is a slew of longer-term trends, or what he called \"demand functions,\" that are driving the sector: mobility, the cloud, cybersecurity, automation, virtualization, and artificial intelligence. However, an investor who's counting on tech stocks to beat the market would be disappointed, if his call turns out to be prescient. \"You need new buyers to come in and you need to give them catalysts to buy,\" Levkovich said. \"Right now, I can give you a couple of reasons why they might not want to buy.\" Here are six of his reasons why: Higher bond yields[11] mean the present value of future earnings or cash-flow streams are hurt. Secular growers tend to have an issue when you have higher bond yields. If the economy is somewhat better \u2014 and that's why bond yields are going higher \u2014 then investors have other options to get growth at lower prices. They can buy cyclical alternatives to tech that can grow rapidly at a lower PE. There are concerns about more regulation, which would bring higher costs. The European Union is considering new taxes[12] for large tech companies. Projected earnings-growth rates indicate a slowdown in the second half of the year for tech \u2014 an industry that tends to be driven by growth and momentum. Many stocks, in the software and services industry for example, are not undervalued, and Citi's valuation metrics that have been the most predictive of stock price performance are suggesting these stocks can underperform. \"But what about strong earnings?\" is a reasonable retort to Levkovich's view. However, even beyond tech, he's not counting on first-quarter results to be the medicine that heals the market after a volatile start to 2018. Heading into 2018, Citi's view on equities was that it would be a year of consolidation, among other things, after the prospects of tax reform and fiscal stimulus jolted the market in 2017, sending several measures of equity valuations including the price-to-earnings multiple to eyebrow-raising levels, .  \"The move in the market in 2016 and half the move in 2017 was multiple-related, kind of anticipating a more pro-business, pro-growth agenda,\" Levkovich said. \"And as you got it, you were earning your way into it \u2014 you already paid for it, and you're not going to get paid a second time.\"NOW WATCH: Wall Street's biggest bull explains why trade war fears are way overblown[13]See Also: 'There isn't really fear out there': Citigroup's equity chief explains why investors are

I was invited there for a series of lectures at Beijing's Communication University of China (CUC) during the week of March 18. Thanks to Professor Xu Peixi[1], who organized the tour, I got a chance to meet most of the academics, researchers and policy analysts involved in Internet governance in Beijing think tanks, as well as many students. There were also some discussions with Chinese Internet businesses and a lecture at Tsinghua University's Journalism and Communication Department. By coincidence the visit occurred shortly after the conclusion of the National Peoples' Congress, and overlapped with news of the Facebook breach and President Trump's Section 301 actions against China. </p><p>As China threatened tariffs of its own, the U.S. stock market plummeted in anticipation of the damage of a US-China trade war. While most of the news was not good, it was certainly an 'interesting time' to engage in discussions of Internet governance and U.S.-China relations in cyberspace.Multistakeholder, multilateral, multipartyMany in the Chinese government are still coming to terms with the concept of multistakeholder governance. As noted above, China participates actively in institutions such as ICANN, while at the same time officially favoring multilateralism in UN forums. Asked by government officials whether it was possible to find some middle ground between multistakeholder and multilateral governance, I said that it was not; we need to recognize them as distinct and mutually exclusive forms of governance in any given sector. Any attempt to bring about a mixture of the two was likely to be messy and dysfunctional. A better approach is to confine multilateral governance to areas where it cannot be avoided, such as in military or trade negotiations, while allowing nonstate actors involved in multi-stakeholder governance the ability to function authoritatively in areas requiring global coordination, transnational operations and broader representation. Another question asked whether multistakeholder governance is unrealistic because not all stakeholders can have equal representation. I replied that nonstate actor-based governance is valuable not because it provides perfect representation of every sector in society, but because it allows anyone with knowledge and commitment to be heard. That openness better leverages the knowledge latent in the community, and does a better job of incorporating diverse views. Multilateral governance, in contrast, eliminates everyone but governments. Multistakeholder governance is therefore more likely to incorporate viewpoints and knowledge that will be needed to develop and understand the effects of policies. The idea of governance rooted in transnational non-state actors (which is a more accurate term than 'multi-stakeholder') seems to be gaining ground in China. I met the private sector founders of a new organization, the Multi-stakeholder Forum for a Better Cyberspace, which was recently incorporated in Beijing. In contrast, comments made by a member of an official think tank after one of my talks mentioned 'multi-party' governance as to suggest some kind of a synthesis or middle ground between multilateral and multi-stakeholder. To some, this may sound like official China is edging towards multistakeholderism. But a close observer of China should wince at the term 'multi-party.' As this article from one of China's external propaganda outlets shows[2], official China uses the term 'multi-party cooperation system' to describe its own political system - described as a 'cooperation system' in which the Communist Party of China holds power and eight other democratic parties participate in state affairs in a purely consultative role. 'Unlike the two-party or multi-party competition systems of Western countries, the multi-party cooperation system has endowed China with the advantages of long-term planning and the integration of resources, thus enabling it to solve complex problems and further reforms.' So in IG terms, I would guess that 'multi-party' means a state-led system in which civil society and business are present but relegated to consultative roles. Well, I must admit that in some of the darker moments of ICANN's history[3], its multistakeholder model had a lot in common with the Chinese multi-party approach.Fussing over CFIUSSome of my discussants were only vaguely aware of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) but they are beginning to hear more about it - and ask about it - after its role in blocking the Ant Financial-Moneygram and Broadcom-Qualcomm deals. It should be noted that all of the leading Internet companies in China are private enterprises. While heavily regulated they behave like competitive firms, often chafe at regulation, and are interested in expanding their markets and profits. One group inquired about a Senate bill that would broaden the scope of CFIUS reviews[4] (known as FIRMMA). I said that FIRMMA was a bad idea, and that its authors were deeply confused about the proper boundary line between national security and industrial policy. It interjects national security concerns into a much broader swath of the economy. In this case, the Chinese and I agreed readily that the bill is being proposed by representatives who want to target China for discriminatory investment barriers in a broader set of high-tech areas. It would be hypocritical for the US to continue to complain about how China erects trade barriers in the name of national security while moving the in same direction itself. Asked how we can overcome barriers to FDI between US and China, I heard repeatedly that we need to get rid of a 'cold war mentality' and a 'zero sum game approach.' Trump's Section 301 action is an example of zero sum game, they said: 'the US side ignores our voice and is unwilling to talk.' While it's true some American companies are blocked from entering the China market, Chinese civil society is said to complain that Huawei can't sell in America but Chinese can buy Apple devices here.ICANN and the DNS rootICANN and the DNS root continue to be topics of interest in China. I was asked about how China contributed to ICANN's reform, and how could China contribute in the future. I explained that China was present and well-represented during the IANA transition and ICANN reform process, and that the rest of the community appreciated this. People like Li Xiaodong (formerly head of CNNIC and now at Tsinghua University) was on the IANA Transition Coordination Group[5] with me, and we often had similar positions on specific issues. On the question of China's future contribution, I praised the efforts of Professor Xu Peixi to run lectures, workshops and schools that build up knowledge in China about the transnational environment of Internet governance and giving their people the knowledge and confidence to participate in global IG institutions. I also encouraged Chinese participants in GAC and other parts of the regime to help China send stronger signals that they accept and value Internet institutions involving nonstate actors. It would not be good faith to participate in the ICANN environment while working at cross purposes in multi-lateral institutions. Many Chinese Internet techies are still interested in whether China can get a root server. The technical barriers to integrating additional root servers into the ICANN root no longer exist. There are some valid reasons for adding such a root server, such as reduced latency in answering queries. However, the Chinese I spoke with are pessimistic about whether this will happen. They think ICANN will never agree to place a root server in China because 'they don't like China.' To be sure, China's promotion of a sovereigntist approach to internet governance is legitimate cause to be wary; as some in the Western Internet community seem to fear that a Chinese root server could become the basis for an alternate root. But it is the uniform content of the root zone file, not the presence of a root name server, that holds the DNS together. So far there is no indication that China wants to usurp ICANN's status as editor of the root zone. Indeed, if it wanted to do that it wouldn't need an official root server in the ICANN system; it could just set up an alternate root and see who else in the world would use it. A more interesting question we discussed is whether a Chinese root server would sit inside or outside the Great Firewall.Flogging FacebookChinese students and intellectuals were fascinated by the recent Facebook breach and the ongoing controversies in the U.S. about Russian influence operations via social media. Americans might want to temper their outrage at Facebook by contemplating the fact that Chinese officials use the drama as confirmation of their belief that foreign social media in particular - and the internet in general - must be banned or heavily regulated to protect users and their own national security. These prejudices are reinforced by Westerners paid to write China Daily columns, like Philip J Cunningham,[6] who provides a classic example of how seemingly progressive attacks on big tech can be used to rationalize censorship and authoritarianism. I was asked how I thought FB and other social media influence politics. I expressed the opinion that the influence of Russia on U.S. politics via Facebook was being exaggerated due to partisan shock at Trump's election. All new media affect public opinion and political expression, but in complex ways. The strongest effects come from the way new media technologies and processes redistribute relative communicative capabilities among different groups. Those who take advantage of their new capabilities first are empowered in relation to those who don't (e.g., the use of printing by Protestants in their competition with Catholics). I reminded them that not too long ago Facebook and other social media were being attacked because of liberal bias in the moderation of the newsfeed. As for the Cambridge Analytica abuse, it's bad that Facebook didn't monitor this more closely but they will suffer in the market for this. Standard liability and contract law can handle the question of who gets paid damages.Asking about AttributionThere was some interest in the issue of attribution. I was asked by a government think tank whether it was acceptable to attribute a cyberattack based primarily on who was presumed to be the primary beneficiary of the attack. I was not sure what they meant by this. Evidently China feels uncomfortable, if not threatened, by such an approach. My answer affirmed that currently attribution is primarily a political game which is not well organized or transparent because it is performed by states. This is why we are supportive of the idea of a neutral International Attribution Organization (IAO) rooted in nonstate actors. The questioner expressed some skepticism about the Microsoft IAO proposal because of its source in a U.S. company. We explained why the interests of Microsoft and the U.S. government diverge sharply when it comes to attribution, so it would be a mistake to view Microsoft as an agent of the U.S. and reject the idea for that reason. However, we also recognize that an IAO would need support and backing from a much broader constituency if it was to win trust and achieve neutrality.Cloudy skies for tradeI asked why China put foreign ownership restrictions on cloud services based in China. Recently Apple, Amazon and other American cloud companies have sold off their cloud facilities in China and entered into joint ventures with Chinese operators. Once again, the Facebook leaks were invoked. This is why we don't believe foreign companies 'could protect our data well,' they said. They trust local companies more. More generally, basic information infrastructure facilities in China must be state-owned and only value-added services can be foreign-owned. In the past, cloud was probably considered a value-added service. This has been a bedrock policy, rooted in sovereignty concerns, throughout the telecommunications liberalization of the 1990s. Post-Snowden, I inferred, data and cloud infrastructure seemingly is being re-classified (informally) as basic infrastructure. Many in U.S. industry claim that Chinese investment and trade restrictions, which require joint ventures with local partners, force them to give away valuable intellectual property to their JV partner. I asked whether this was true. The answers provided did not show an awareness of the relationship between IPR transfers and foreign investment restrictions. One think tank said that when companies come to such a huge market it will help them to innovate. They also claimed that IPR protection in China is getting better, in part because younger Chinese are IPR creators so they need to protect it.IPv6 migrationChina's level of migration to the new IPv6 protocol is near the bottom of world rankings. This is surprising because China's gigantic Internet market would seem to be one of the prime beneficiaries of an expanded IP address space. Among the people we talked with, there was general agreement that China's three big state-owned network infrastructure providers - China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom - are the reason for the lack of change. These sluggish SOEs, I was told, 'got rich on IPv4 and are not eager to change.' China's network infrastructure relies heavily on NAT (network address translation, by which a single global IPv4 address serves multiple users). Moving to IPv6 will be expensive for them and will bring no countervailing revenue enhancements. Among policy makers who are not technical experts, there was some confusion about the impact of IPv6 on surveillance. The SOEs have been telling policy makers that if China converts to v6 'resources will be lost' and that terrorists can use IPv6 because it can be encrypted. In fact, as far as we can tell there is no change in the status of encryption between v4 and v6. On the other hand, as one local expert pointed out, by eliminating NAT IPv6 permits a more granular tracking of users. If unique global addresses can be assigned to every device the network is more transparent and law enforcement can identify who is doing what on the network more easily. In November of last year, China adopted a national IPv6 migration plan initiated by the CAC and signed by President Xi Jinping. We are in the process of translating this document into English. Based on second-hand accounts, the plan will require the telecom SOEs to stop using NAT by the end of this year. Less clearly, we were told that the plan is supposed to stop buying of IPv4 addresses. If both NAT and IPv4 address acquisition are banned China will be in trouble. Migrating to IPv6 requires running both protocols until such time as there are so few IPv4 users that it can be turned off. That will take a while. In the meantime, continued use of IPv4 without NAT requires a growing number of IPv4 addresses. Either the IPv4 address space can be expanded by NAT or it can be expanded by buying additional numbers in the secondary market. There is no other alternative. Tunneling is not, as far as I know, a viable alternative.Visiting the 'Great Wall'I turned down an offer to visit the Great Wall in the countryside, but in China one cannot avoid the Great Firewall. This was my first experience of the Chinese Internet in some time. (The ICANN 2013 meeting had unrestricted Internet access.) I was able to access the Georgia TechMicrosoft cloud with all my documents via hotel WiFi, but of course Google and all its applications are blocked. So is Twitter, and so are Telegram and WhatsApp (because they encrypt messages). I had signed up for WeChat, the leading Chinese messaging service in China, to communicate with locals easily. Normally a WhatsApp user, I had to turn off Wifi to use it. It is blocked in China because it encrypts all chat messages. Georgia Tech's VPN was not blocked, however, and got me through the firewall from my laptop as needed. I noticed that while Google's search engine was blocked Microsoft's Bing was not. When I inquired why this was the case, I was told that foreign companies have to comply with local laws; Microsoft does and Google doesn't. After this I verified that Bing imposes a mandatory 'safe search' (no porn) setting when accessed from China, and a search (in English) for 'Tiananmen Square 1989' in Bing produced mainly articles from China's state media claiming the Tiananmen massacre was a myth. Searching (in English) with Bing from a VPN, on the other hand, made Wikipedia's page on the Tiananmen Square incident the top result and provided links to a number of news reports and critical accounts of the fateful 1989 clash in the center of Beijing. So Microsoft does not merely filter out articles objectionable to the Chinese state, it seems to actively elevate and promote state-approved propaganda on such topics.Concluding observationsOne overarching observation is that most of the Chinese people I met are fully acclimated to a more authoritarian, paternalistic system of government. Even when they chafe at, say, the pettiness of the Great Firewall's restrictions on this or that, none of them I met have a revolutionary or rebellious attitude towards it. A vivid example of this, unrelated to Internet governance, was provided by many of the people I dined or drank with. Without exception, anyone driving a car refused to take a single sip of alcohol, no matter how little, and regardless of how much time would pass before the driving was to take place. This was because Beijing has adopted extremely strict penalties for driving under the influence. The people I met were not making any risk-reward calculations, they were just complying fully with the law as a matter of course. Indeed, the regulations have created a small industry of guys who can be hired to drive you home if you are drunk; they hang around in clusters on street corners in uniforms and electric bikes ready to speed off to a customer at a moment's notice. I deliberately chose an example in which the effects of such obedience are obviously beneficial. But I also asked about Xi Jinping's end of term limits and found little concern about it. China needs continuity and stability at this time, I was told. At one university there were a few sardonic comments about it, but that was all. The good news is that China's students and intellectuals are eager to become more integrated into global Internet governance communities and discussions. Although language is the biggest barrier, this needs to happen, and is happening. Many thanks to my amazing hosts!

The Web browser, the navigational software key that<br/>unlocked the potential of the Internet to millions, was invented here.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The National Center\u00a0for Supercomputing Applications, which developed the<br/>browser, now leads a national consortium of 50 institutions building a<br/>prototype of a computational network for the 21st Century.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 For all this world-class inventiveness, however, the residual benefits to<br/>the local economy have been relatively modest. Local boosters are fond of<br/>waving a magazine article that describes it as one of the hottest tech locales<br/>in America, but the truth is, much of the good technology born here comes to<br/>commercial maturity elsewhere, leaving the town with a slim business<br/>portfolio.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Champaign-Urbana\u00a0is one of the last major university towns in the country<br/>that hasn't sort of gone critical in terms of spinoff businesses,\" observed<br/>Larry Smarr, since 1985 the director of the supercomputing center.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Because National Center\u00a0for Supercomputing Applications'\u00a0mission is<br/>national--it shares in $35\u00a0million a year from the National Science<br/>Foundation-- Smarr concentrates on producing a steady stream of innovations.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Where they land in the society is not my job,\" Smarr said. \"The issue is,<br/>'Did we change the world?'\u00a0Yes, we did.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 But such an allegiance to a diffuse greater good is an increasingly costly<br/>luxury to the university, which now sees itself as an economic-development<br/>engine as well as an educational institution.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, fierce competition for top academic talent means making<br/>available conditions to mix business with scholarship. \"Both faculty and<br/>students are becoming much more entrepreneurial,\" said Sharon Tipisword, who<br/>works in the U. of I. technology marketing office and handled licensing<br/>negotiations for the Mosaic browser on behalf of the university. \"They're<br/>asking, 'Could\u00a0I start a business with my technology?'\u00a0\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Over the last three years, the university has taken steps to ensure that<br/>the answer is yes.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The university has hatched plans for a pair of new incubators, one for<br/>engineering and one for biotechnology, to augment the austere barn on the<br/>agriculture campus.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, U. of I. has streamlined procedures for licensing its<br/>technology and is making land available at attractive rates to entice<br/>corporate research facilities.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"I think they realize they're not going to get the best faculty, and if<br/>they don't get the best faculty, they're not going to get the best students<br/>and their rankings will deteriorate,\" said Peter Fox, a local developer and<br/>investor and one-time director of the state's commerce department.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Fox so far has invested in three university start-ups from a $2\u00a0million<br/>venture fund he's set up. \"We need to make sure we fund at least five to 10<br/>good ideas a year,\" Fox said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 A second venture group based in Urbana-Champaign,\u00a0Open Prairie Venture<br/>Fund, is lining up $30\u00a0million to put behind science-based businesses<br/>developed in Midwestern universities.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"No one else is here,\" said Dennis Spice, one of three fund managing<br/>partners. \"There's an opportunity for us to make a difference. The major<br/>venture funds aren't wanting to come out onto the prairie.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Possible targets for Open Prairie cash include companies like EpiWorks<br/>Inc., a six-employee start-up founded by two U. of I. grad students and their<br/>professor, now laboring in the university incubator.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The founders, working at the university, developed a process to deposit<br/>ultrathin layers of specialized compounds gallium arsenide and indium<br/>phosphide on wafers used to make high-speed computer chips for wireless<br/>devices.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Co-founder\u00a0David Ahmari, 28, of Naperville, said it would be easier to<br/>raise the $12\u00a0million to $15\u00a0million EpiWorks needs in Silicon Valley.<br/>\"There's more money there and in general there's more interest in technology,\"<br/>Ahmari said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 EpiWorks shares office space with 15 other fledgling businesses in one of<br/>the plain metal barns on the agriculture portion of the U. of I. campus. Five<br/>other start-ups have been forced to find space elsewhere because of lack of<br/>space in the incubator.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 With a cement floor and inexpensive metal and plastic furniture, the place<br/>reeks of frugality. But Ahmari said that by staying in Urbana-Champaign,<br/>EpiWorks can rent university equipment to produce prototypes of their<br/>semiconductors, monitor research and, for one day per week, as stipulated in<br/>university regulations, benefit from the advice of Greg Stillman, the<br/>engineering professor who co-founded the company.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 For the moment, \"there's no compelling reason to leave,\" Ahmari said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 But a commitment to central Illinois has its limits. \"The compelling reason<br/>(to leave) could be, 'Can\u00a0you find the talent?'\u00a0'Can\u00a0you raise the money?'<br/>We'll see in a year,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 While Fox, Spice and others are addressing the question of money, there<br/>remains the issue of whether Urbana and Champaign,\u00a0with a combined population<br/>of 100,000 located two hours south of Chicago,\u00a0has enough pizazz to attract<br/>engineers and programmers with offers in hand from firms in San Francisco,<br/>Seattle or Austin.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 NCSA's Smarr argues that recruitment is \"easier than it used to be because<br/>the cost of living is getting so insane in California.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Although wooing the single, footloose, 20-something technologist may always<br/>be problematic, a smallish pair of Midwestern towns hosting a 35,000-student<br/>university will have an appeal to those who might want to nest comfortably on<br/>a single income, own a big house and enjoy the benefits of campus life.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 William Schowalter, dean of the university's highly regarded School of<br/>Engineering, said he considers beefing up the local technology business base<br/>as a matter of self-interest.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Almost every faculty member has a partner who is a professional,\"<br/>Schowalter notes, and universities competing for top-notch faculty often must<br/>cobble together incentive packages that include spousal employment.<br/>\"Champaign-Urbana\u00a0just doesn't have that much capacity to absorb those kind of<br/>people,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Although seeding and cultivating start-ups might take a decade or more to<br/>pay dividends, Schowalter is hopeful of shortcutting the process by convincing<br/>a big tech company to establish a major presence in Urbana-Champaign,\u00a0thus<br/>supplying an instant prestige boost and a magnet for similar businesses.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The real issue is one of critical mass,\" Schowalter said. \"It's not unlike<br/>a shopping center. You need an anchor tenant. Then the rest will come more or<br/>less automatically.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 University officials, trying to trade on the strengths of their engineering<br/>and computer science programs, both of which are near the top of most national<br/>rankings, have had periodic discussions with Intel Corp.\u00a0and Compaq\u00a0Computer<br/>Corp.\u00a0about establishing bases in town.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Recruitment of a major new corporate citizen almost certainly would involve<br/>state government, but Schowalter isn't convinced that Springfield appreciates<br/>the role of a major research university in job creation.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Universities such as this one have a tremendous economic importance and<br/>that goes well beyond what goes on in the classroom,\" Schowalter said.<br/>\"There's a need at the state level to plant a flag, that Illinois needs to be<br/>No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 in these fields. We ought to be more prominent than we<br/>are.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, however, Schowalter and others acknowledge that the<br/>university has to strike a balance between promoting entrepreneurship and<br/>safeguarding taxpayer funds. It's a problem that many of the most prominent<br/>technology wellsprings, like MIT and Stanford, don't have to confront because<br/>they're private schools.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We have to worry about an unfair transfer of public assets for private<br/>gain,\" said Craig\u00a0Bazzani, U. of I. vice president of business and finance.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 But with more interest in economic development, Bazzani said the university<br/>has made adjustments favoring private business, including making it easier to<br/>license U. of I.-patented technology. \"We want to be as entrepreneurial as we<br/>can,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 As it is, Urbana-Champaign's prominence on the business side of technology<br/>currently derives mainly from the entrepreneurship that didn't occur there.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 U. of I. computer-science student Marc Andreessen co-founded Netscape<br/>Communications\u00a0Corp.\u00a0in mid-1994--in Mountain View, Calif.\u00a0In a recent Tribune<br/>interview, Andreessen said he never considered setting up shop in Champaign<br/>because \"there was no culture of start-ups and there was no venture capital.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Stanford and MIT encourage people to do spinoffs and do start-ups and<br/>U.I.U.C.\u00a0at that point didn't,\" Andreessen said. \"They viewed it as a bad<br/>thing . . . they really hated to see a source of research funding leave.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 According to Smarr, Andreessen proposed working part-time as an employee<br/>and part-time on a company he wanted to start. \"I had to tell him at that time<br/>that I didn't see that the university was set up to do that,\" Smarr said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Besides inspiring Netscape's Navigator browser, Mosaic also was licensed,<br/>through Spyglass Inc., to Microsoft Corp.\u00a0and became the basis for Internet<br/>Explorer.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 According to associate vice chancellor Ann Hammersla, director of the<br/>research technology management office, the university has collected about $6<br/>million from various licensing fees for Mosaic. Hammersla said that's<br/>considered a good haul by the standards of university licensing agreements.<br/>But it pales in comparison with Netscape's economic footprint. Its public<br/>offering in August 1995 kicked off the craze in Internet stocks as much as any<br/>IPO, and earlier this year, America Online Inc. closed its purchase of<br/>Netscape for $10\u00a0billion.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 In what Hammersla said was strictly coincidence, the U. of I. began a<br/>review of its technology marketing practices shortly after the Netscape IPO,<br/>and set up an in-house technology management office to help faculty and<br/>students patent, and find markets for, inventions in 1996.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Previously, technology marketing was done by an outside firm, an<br/>arrangement that allowed businesses to cherry-pick licensing deals for<br/>well-developed technology, but which found few takers for immature but<br/>promising discoveries.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The university hopes to promote more of the latter by subsidizing start-up<br/>companies at the new engineering and biotechnology incubators, each about<br/>20,000 square feet and costing between $5\u00a0million and $10\u00a0million apiece,<br/>according to Bazzani.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The university also is offering low-cost land near engineering facilities<br/>and its Beckman Institute for multidisciplinary science research for corporate<br/>research and development. \"We want to make it easy for the private sector to<br/>lease land and build,\" Bazzani said. \"Proximity counts.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 HIGH-TECH\u00a0FIRMS IN THE U. OF I. AREA<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The Urbana-Champaign\u00a0area already is home to a number of high-tech firms,<br/>according to the Greater Champaign-Urbana\u00a0Economic Partnership.

Not only have none of the predicted negative consequences occurred since Pai's more free-market version of net neutrality was enacted, but to the contrary data speeds have risen sharply, investment is up, and there have been no notable episodes of discrimination by ISPs.</p><p> The heart of the Pai order is a transparency rule, which replaces heavy-handed regulation with market discipline \u2013 in effect, if you want to treat traffic in a non-neutral fashion you can, but you have to explain what you're doing to your customers.</p><p> Ironically, the Big Tech companies continue to pursue reimposition of the heavy-handed Obama neutrality regulations on ISPs even as they fend off efforts to similarly regulate themselves or limit their liability protections.</p><p> But the success of the Pai order suggests a much more elegant solution: Big Tech should be subject to a transparency rule and, if they do in fact discriminate against certain content, they should explain how to their customers.</p><p> Such a rule could require clear disclosure of how traffic is treated, and clear specification of the standards used for limiting speech, including any possible viewpoint discrimination. Platforms that represent themselves to the public as neutral could be subject to civil complaints if they violate those representations.</p><p> A transparency rule would avoid the perils of more heavy-handed government regulation, dissipate the distrust toward Big Tech from the left and right, and harmonize the rules for ISPs with the rules for the edge giants they are increasingly competing with in the advertising market.</p><p> Crafting a transparency rule for Big Tech is easier said than done, of course. But just as with regulation of ISPs, it could be the least-bad option.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-d3dfbddee585f2bf336ae4535ee0e3b2547ba64</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898A8998B11D5 NWBKCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XK0-B401-JBCN-42VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bristol Press<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Not only have none of the predicted negative consequences occurred since Pai's more free-market version of net neutrality was enacted, but to the contrary data speeds have risen sharply, investment is up, and there have been no notable episodes of discrimination by ISPs.</p><p> The heart of the Pai order is a transparency rule, which replaces heavy-handed regulation with market discipline \u2013 in effect, if you want to treat traffic in a non-neutral fashion you can, but you have to explain what you're doing to your customers.</p><p> Ironically, the Big Tech companies continue to pursue reimposition of the heavy-handed Obama neutrality regulations on ISPs even as they fend off efforts to similarly regulate themselves or limit their liability protections.</p><p> But the success of the Pai order suggests a much more elegant solution: Big Tech should be subject to a transparency rule and, if they do in fact discriminate against certain content, they should explain how to their customers.</p><p> Such a rule could require clear disclosure of how traffic is treated, and clear specification of the standards used for limiting speech, including any possible viewpoint discrimination. Platforms that represent themselves to the public as neutral could be subject to civil complaints if they violate those representations.</p><p> A transparency rule would avoid the perils of more heavy-handed government regulation, dissipate the distrust toward Big Tech from the left and right, and harmonize the rules for ISPs with the rules for the edge giants they are increasingly competing with in the advertising market.</p><p> Crafting a transparency rule for Big Tech is easier said than done, of course. But just as with regulation of ISPs, it could be the least-bad option.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-89825e8808a2572dae35cf2ba352c119c52c96</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289AA4B3D4F011 NWBKCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XK0-B401-JBCN-44T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Herald<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The medium of money through which modern treasurers move is not as elementary as it appears, it cannot be taken for granted.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Treasurers generally operate in only one of the monetary slipstreams \"\" the commercial bank money layer of the fiat currency system. The modern age of fiat currency only dates from Bretton Woods, when Nixon suspended convertibility of USD to gold. In the past we have had many different forms of money \"\" commodity money, representative money, managed money and other flavours. One constant that goes back to Babylonian times is the sovereign's prerogative to decide what should count as money.\u00a0</p><p>New technology has brought us to the point where there are many possible futures of money, each of which will impact treasurers, as much as changing the nature of the liquid in a goldfish bowl. It is time to question our surroundings and participate in the debate about the future of money.</p><p>Criticisms of the fiat currency system predate the emergence of cryptocurrencies, but the publication of the bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 was a watershed moment. In solving the \"~double-spend' problem of digital currencies, the bitcoin whitepaper showed that there could be a global currency without a sovereign issuer.</p><p>2008 also started an era of \"~experimental' monetary policy as a result of the financial crisis, the origins of which some would trace back to the nature of our modern fiat currency system. Quantitative easing and negative interest rates created the impression that at some point central banks would run out of tools to prop up a debt-fuelled economic model. Inequalities in societal wealth and incomes, denominated in fiat currency, have driven the rise of populist politics across the globe. Some would argue that these outcomes are not bugs of the fiat currency system but inherent features of it.</p><p>In 1976 Hayek wrote a treatise called \"The De-nationalization of Money\", in which he argued for the sovereign's monopoly on money to be overthrown by competing private issuers of \"~stable' money. In particular, he argued for private money to be based on a basket of commodities, and gave step-by-step instructions for how such a system would be formed and implemented. Gresham's law says that bad money drives out good \"\" if you have two coins and one of them is \"~clipped' then that is the one that you spend. Hayek argued to the contrary that \"~good' stable privately issued currency would drive out \"~bad' depreciative fiat currency. Little did Hayek know that he would become the darling of the cryptocurrency community over 40 years later as major players looked to the development of \"~stablecoins' as the next iteration of money.\u00a0</p><p>Stablecoins seek to overcome the volatility that first-generation cryptocurrencies suffered from, which prevented them from being used as money. There are two primary methods to achieve this: one is through algorithmic management of supply on cryptocurrency exchanges, the other is by pegging a token to some defined collateral, e.g. gold, the USD, US treasuries or a basket of currencies. Some of these proposals look like \"~electronic money' that we have become familiar with and are well regulated \"\" Paypal, PayTM, Alipay, WeChat Pay, etc. Others are more radical and bring Hayek's vision to life \"\" private stable currencies that will compete with national fiat currency systems.</p><p>So far regulators and governments are relatively sanguine about the threat to the monopoly over money that they have enjoyed for thousands of years. Mass market adoption of a stablecoin issued by Big Tech firms may change that calculus quickly. We may need to mint new terminology to discuss these potential futures \"\" \"~cryptonization' (compare with \"~dollarization') may be a useful term for the process by which the sovereign's ability to conduct monetary policy is challenged by a private stablecoin.</p><p>Cryptonization, the emergence of stablecoins operating as global digital money in competition with national currencies, may stimulate some central banks to release their own innovations \"\" central bank digital currencies (CBDC). CBDC is equivalent to enabling individuals and corporates to have the ability to open accounts directly with central banks, giving access to a form of money with only sovereign counterparty risk. CBDC may well be interest-bearing, giving central banks a new lever over the economy and banking system. Transfers through CBDC would bypass all existing clearing systems, commercial banks and e-money institutions.</p><p>The commercial banking system and fintechs could be caught in the crossfire of a battle between CDBCs and privately issued stablecoins for monetary supremacy. This competition for deposits and payment services from two entirely new fronts could seriously impact the financial stability of the banking system and the process of credit creation.</p><p>There is an alternative future of money, based on less evident changes happening in fiat currency systems around the world. Modernization of the \"~fiat currency stack' \"\" including RTGS, ACH, Faster Payments, Open Banking and other innovations \"\" may deliver \"~Fiat Currency 2.0' which is fit for purpose in the 21st century; more real time, transparent, traceable, cost effective and responsive to the needs of the digital economy.</p><p>In conclusion, treasurers work within the fiat currency system \"\" that is their element. Some have learned the hard way that the crypto and fiat worlds are tricky to synthesize \"\" for example, it is an absolutely terrible idea to try to free trapped cash from FX/capital controlled countries through bitcoin! If the nature of money changes, so will the role of the treasurer \"\" this is true whether the future belongs to CBDC, cryptocurrencies or a fiat currency system that is hyper-connected and always on.</p><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1fsjzhmlk8rp9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG1-SCT1-JD1P-T4J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1017\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

This is what FDR hoped for when he proclaimed the four freedoms and asked the question of \"whether individual men and women will have to serve some system of government or economics or whether a system of government and economics existed to serve individual men and women?\" His answer was to promote freedom of speech and expression, freedom to worship God in one's way, freedom from fear and freedom from want, the four freedoms which can be seen as beacons for a tri-sectoral society. Freedom of speech and freedom of worship and belief are calls to foster individual freedom in cultural life through a quality, accessible, and diverse educational system and through protections from the manipulation of governments and corporations. The third freedom, freedom from fear, expresses our need to live in a society governed by democracy and equal rights before the law and not subject to discrimination, systemic racism, nor the corruption and the power of special interest groups.</p><p>Business Economic Solidarity</p><p>Let us create a responsible form of Stakeholder Capitalism which serves people's true needs and those of the earth.</p><p>We can amend and renew our economy by:</p><p>* Chartering corporations as proposed in the Responsible Capitalism Act, now before the Senate, and requiring all large corporations with over $1 billion in revenue annually to seek a renewable charter from a Federal Commission made up of citizen representatives from government, civil society, and business life. We now charter schools and colleges as well as non-profit organizations, so why not corporations who also benefit from our nation and its culture. The criteria for receiving and renewing a charter would be to meet the triple bottom line requirements: profitability, sustainability, and community support. Smaller corporations would receive a similar state charter, and all corporations would undergo a regular charter review process. Boards of corporations would consist of 55% civil society and public sector representatives as well as employees, thereby balancing the interests of shareholders and capital, the remaining 45%.</p><p>* Taxing the use of environmental inputs and emissions through a land tax, a water tax, and a carbon pollution tax, supporting the principles of natural capitalism.</p><p>* Taxing the profits of all corporations at 10 percent with no deductions and exemptions for the public benefits they use: roads, infrastructure, education, and culture. Such revenue could be used to support education and infrastructure at local and state levels in which corporations conduct their activity.</p><p>* Having the goal of a carbon-neutral economy in ten years and adopting the Green New Deal proposed to Congress by Senator Markey and Congresswoman Octavio-Cortez. Funding such initiatives though public banking initiatives and an Automatic Payments Tax (APT).</p><p>* Supporting the cooperative, B Corp, and Public Benefit Corporation movements by stopping the tax breaks and subsidies presently provided to large and politically powerful corporations and industries such as those in the oil and nuclear sectors. B Corporations and Public Benefit Corporations have similar aims but slightly different legal forms. Both exist to serve the communities in which they are located.</p><p>* Creating producer-consumer-trader associations to guide and stimulate local and regional economic life.</p><p>* Paying for these societal benefits and a Green New Deal by gradually introducing an Automatic Payments Transaction Tax (APT) of 0.35 percent on all economic transactions from buying groceries or leasing a car to trading stocks and commodities. While the real economy generates about $20 trillion a year, the financial economy--stock trades, derivatives, bonds, commodities, Treasury bills, and capital transfers--is estimated to be between $750 and $1,000 trillion a year in the U.S. It is estimated that a tax of 0.35 percent could replace all other taxes except for a portion of local property taxes and some corporate taxes for local services. It was proposed by President Bush's Tax Reform Commission in 2005. See apttax.com for more detailed information.</p><p>Government Civil Equality</p><p>Let us fix a broken democracy by recognizing the truth of Supreme Court Justice Brandeis's statement:</p><p>We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cannot have both.</p><p>We can reform our politics by:</p><p>* Limiting all political donations by individuals to political campaigns and parties to $5,000 per year per person and prohibiting corporate and institutional campaign donations.</p><p>* Getting rid of the electoral college and providing for term limits for the House and the Senate.</p><p>* Providing for multi-party redistricting commissions for all state and federal offices following a national census.</p><p>* Prohibiting federal and state elected officials and appointed officials from lobbying activities for five years after leaving their office.</p><p>* Creating an official election day on a Saturday to allow working people to vote without loss of pay.</p><p>* Mandating ranked-choice voting for state and federal elections, which California and Maine now have for state elections, to limit the power and influence of political parties who tend to polarize the electorate and block the will of the people.</p><p>* Fighting voter suppression and restrictive voting laws.</p><p>* Passing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), giving women equal rights in all sectors of public life.</p><p>* Reforming the criminal justice system so that its targeting of African American communities is stopped.</p><p>* Eliminating systemic racism and discrimination against minority communities.</p><p>* Reducing and reallocating police budgets so that the homeless, the mentally ill, and the poor have better access to mental health and other social services.</p><p>* Eliminating systemic racism and discrimination against minority communities, including individuals belonging to the LGBTQ+ and disabled population.</p><p>* Establishing citizen councils of representatives from civil society, government, and business at local, regional, and state levels to review and to propose legislation to legislative bodies to foster the public good. To be elected every two years.</p><p>* Passing comprehensive immigration reform for refugees, asylum seekers, immigrants, Dreamers, and long-term undocumented immigrants, remembering that most American citizens are immigrants, descendants of immigrants, or enslaved people brought here against their will.</p><p>* Initiating a universal year-long program of national service for everyone.</p><p>* And because quality health care and the right to a dignified existence are human rights, let us adopt a single-payer health system accessible to all, regardless of immigration status.</p><p>* Let us also provide a guaranteed basic income of $12,500 per year for every child and adult to meet basic human needs. Contrary to much popular sentiment, we can afford this if we adopt a fair tax system, which an Automatic Payments Transaction Tax would be.</p><p>Education, Arts, and Sciences Cultural Freedom</p><p>We can extend and deepen cultural freedom in our society by:</p><p>* Honoring and protecting freedom of speech, the free exercise of one's religion, the right of free assembly, trial by jury, and the unhindered right to vote, all established by the Constitution.</p><p>* Providing for educational choice and equality of access by publicly funding diverse educational institutions with competing educational philosophies at comparable levels--daycare, schools, colleges, and universities--taking into account the regional differences in living costs and the nature of the institutions in question. All educational institutions need to be nonprofit organizations and chartered by local educational associations consisting of parents, teachers, and educational administrators. The National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) is a good model to work from. The state's role would be limited to assuring safety and health requirements, non-discrimination, and equality of access.</p><p>* Regulating and limiting the power of Big Tech-Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft--to spy on us, manipulate our opinions, foster hate speech, undermine elections and determine educational goals and programs.</p><p>* Recognizing that corporations and the state seek to control education and cultural and religious/spiritual choices, all of which properly belong to individuals and families. Therefore let teachers and parents determine educational priorities and options through local and regional school boards while keeping corporations, such as media and computer-learning companies, out of kindergartens and schools.</p><p>* Funding arts and cultural life at much higher levels, which many European nations now do, through supporting local and regional arts councils to foster greater cultural activity and choice in a region. We need to recognize that our democracy--the American experiment in self-government--rests on a diverse, excellent, and affordable educational system.</p><p>International Obligations</p><p>Let us honor our international responsibilities by taking the lead on climate change, overcoming racism, dealing with mass-migrations, poverty, and war in the more impoverished regions of the world. We must also recognize that the dangers of Artificial Intelligence (Al) of machines escaping human control and human values are real and require a global effort to adequately ensure safety in the development and application of new technology.</p><p>Let us renew the American Dream and honor freedom in cultural life; equality in democratic, state life, and mutuality and service in economic life. And let us finally tackle the scourge of systemic racism, which has been such a blight on our history. If we can appeal to the fully human in each of us, then it is possible to transform racism, corruption, egotism, and exploitation into a new American Covenant between the American people and its government. In doing so, let us remember the insight of Jacob Needleman:</p><p>America is the fact, the symbol, and the promise of a new beginning.</p><p>Christopher Schaefer, PhD, is a lecturer, writer, and researcher living in the Berkshires.

Last winter it was bonds. Now this summer foreign exchange, by far the largest market, finally embraces e-commerce. Single-dealer platforms will still be needed, but might only account for 25 % of the volume. The seven-bank consortium behind FXall.com has grabbed all the headlines this month, but it is already a year or more behind two independent ventures, and years behind State Street's FX Connect, which since April has allowed other dealers on to the system. Why has it taken so long for forex bankers to accept the multi-bank approach, and what are the consequences of leaving it this late? Antony Currie investigates Josh Levy never intended to be part of an uprising. He left his job as a currency trader at Goldman Sachs early last year to join Valhalla Forex, based just a few minutes' walk from his former employer, on the 15th floor of a building on downtown Broadway in New York. The grandeur of its Wagnerian name belies its size: it is a small organization, specializing in proprietary trading in the forex spot markets, although it also dabbles in forwards.</p><p>Within weeks he had become exasperated with his dealers and market-makers. \"We had good price discovery brokers so we knew within three pips where the price was,\" says Levy. \"But the bid-ask quotes we were getting from the dealers were often quite far off the fair-market value. If the price was really 90-93 sometimes, especially in fast markets, wed get prices which were four or five pips off the market, sometimes more.\"</p><p>Having worked at a broker-dealer, he ought, one might think, to have been better prepared. For a start, Levy does not include Goldman in the group which so frustrated him. \"I've been on the other side, but I also didn't think things should be as bad as they are. We saw widespread acute and chronic lack of service. It was eating into our P&amp;L.\"</p><p>Only equities investors tend to get much publicity with such complaints, although the execution costs of trading bonds is also coming under greater scrutiny. Somehow the foreign exchange market tends to be forgotten,which is surprising given that it is by far the largest of the three. On average $1.5 trillion is traded in foreign currency each day, which some estimates put at seven times the combined size of the debt and equity markets. Quoted prices can change 20 times in the space of a minute, the most active rates up to 18,000 times a day.</p><p>And yet the telephone and human intervention are the primary tools for doing business. Despite the introduction of systems such as Reuters and the electronic broker system (EBS) into the inter-dealer market in the early 1990s, the broker-client relationship saw virtually no technological advances and had to rely on the inefficient method of telephone trading in a fragmented, unregulated, rapidlychanging market until very recently.</p><p>Furthermore, despite having the word \"exchange\" in its title, the foreign exchange market bears none of the hallmarks of an exchange-trading environment. It is the least regulated and policed market, even by overthe-counter market standards, and lacks a coherent fee structure, which leaves customers at the whim of their liquidity providers. \"Making money off the customer is the name of the game,\" says Levy. \"Reading and anticipating customer strategies before they deal, front running orders, using customer limit orders as free options for the market-maker, and running stop-loss orders prematurely for profit, all are commonplace to a dealer/market-maker in forex trading. The SEC and CFTC have put exchange-traded futures brokers and equity broker-dealers in jail for less.\"</p><p>In their more candid moments the bankers will admit this, although only off the record. \"We'd be more than happy to have formal fee structure put in place,\" says a banker who works in e-forex at one of the leading banks. \"We do have a fee structure of sorts, and that is to lie to our clients,\" he continues with a wry smile.</p><p>And the foreign exchange desks can be big money spinners for the banks: in the mid1990s, for example, Citibank was making 30% or more of its profits from that division. [Check] .</p><p>Little wonder, then, that the banks have hardly been quick off the mark to extend the transparency and greater efficiency afforded by EBS to their clients. Not even JP Morgan, one of the more active of banks in the e-commerce arena, has forged ahead in the forex market. LabMorgan has been the incubator of several of the more innovative ideas, such as the multi-bank bond platform MarketAxess, but not in forex, even though the second-incommand (and the man who has run it since last year, before Nick Rohatyn was put in charge) is Thorkild Juncker, previously the JP Morgan's head of foreign exchange.</p><p>The banks will provide reasons for forex lagging behind in adopting e-commerce solutions. One of the more cogent arguments is put forward by Paul Thrush, head of foreign exchange at Barclays Capital. \"Banks have followed a huge range of different strategies with foreign exchange. Some regard it as an extension of research, some as a more efficient clearing and settlement process that sharpens price discovery. There's never been a common view on how to use the product.\"</p><p>Most banks had in any case been concentrating on developing their own platforms, whether closed-system or web-based. Again, though, this is on the whole more beneficial to the banks, allowing them to cut costs by transferring on-line what they have done over the phone for years.Few try to address fee structures or market manipulation.</p><p>Another reason is that the overall service structure of foreign exchange is so different to other markets. \"Fixed income has been driven heavily by competition over research,\" says Lars Olesen, e-commerce manager for Citigroup's global foreign exchange group. \"The idea of co-mingling the research and the pricing on a multi-bank site fits well in that market where pricing is more transparent. It's just not been a theme in forex.\"</p><p>Then the arguments get more flimsy - it was a Y2K issue, say some, despite the fact that several initiatives in debt and equity were announced last year, and a slew of debt initiatives early this year. Or they claim that clients don't want it. Internet delivery only ranks eighth in order of priority for customers in Euromoney's forex survey last May. True, but clients consistently demand good pricing, execution and processing from their brokers, something which the Internet and other electronically-provided systems can, if done well, improve upon. What is true, of course, is that for many investors and traders the Internet is still not fast enough, and security worries still persist.</p><p>Gary Craft, the e-finance analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex Brown in California, puts it another way. He produces a piece of research called E-finance Weekly, which offers an overview of the major e-finance developments. In his May 12th edition he looked at foreign exchange, calling the section 'Mr Money Center, do you really want to give up those valuable FX economics?'</p><p>The news that week was that a major money center bank [which one??] had struck an agreement with Intellisys to offer foreign exchange content. Craft's response: \"Where is the competition for FX trade execution? Spreads in the FX market are incredibly rich and they will not fall without a true marketplace that facilitates FX trade execution competition. Content itself is wonderful...but the electronic commerce community needs a marketplace where the price can be improved.\"</p><p>That, he says, is unlikely to come from the incumbents. \"Money center banks are not likely to build FX marketplaces - they are likely to be forced into them. Look for innovation in FX trading, transacting and settling to come from outside the dealer cartel. No dealer today wants to price improve and arguably must be forced into any market efficiency developments.\"</p><p>It's the pricing argument again: why overturn that which has brought you such good fortune in the past? The answer is that if you don't someone else will, and as the equities market in the US has proved so effectively that someone is more than likely to be a new entrant with much less or nothing to lose.</p><p>And, as in the equities market, the banks have brought it on themselves. Stuck with the old phone system which brought in such good revenues while also knowing that technology was bound to change the model, the vast majority spent their efforts on single-dealer platforms. This was by no means an illogical thing to do, first because that's how business was traditionally done, each bank competing against all the others. But also, says Peter Gerhard, managing director, foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs, \"we all need to have the proprietary platforms as they form the basis for the multi-bank offerings. The multi-bank site is just the common portal.\"</p><p>But the banks' over-concentration on the single-dealer platforms for so long could have set them back against the insurgents. These multi-bank sites are not simply about showing several dealers' prices at once to a client. Just as important, and a huge way of saving time and money and avoiding confusion is to merge as much of the middle and back office as possible. \"Clients want to have ubiquitous, inexpensive access to the markets they work in,\" says Lars Loesen, e-commerce manager for Citigroup's global foreign exchange group. \"And what they have been telling all of us for the last two years is that they don't want to have 15 different systems and have to in-put 15 different log-in passwords.\"</p><p>As a result, much of the investment in the single-dealer platforms has, thus far, gone without reward. \"In general, clients have been reluctant to sign on to many single-dealer platforms because they want to avoid the hassle. They want multi-bank sites, and seem prepared to wait for them and continue using the phones for now\"</p><p>Longer-term of course it is not a waste. As Gerhard points out, each bank needs its own system to route the customer to and from the common platform, and there will always be customers who want or need to stay on the proprietary platform along. \"I'd guess that maybe 75% of volume will go through multibank sites, and 25% directly to the bank's site,\" says Gerhard. \"And that's probably the midpoint of what my peers at the other firms think. But it is just a guess.\" But by ignoring the multi-bank offering until very recently the large dealers may have lost valuable time to start-ups, and to the only bank-run multibank platform in operation, State Street's FX Connext.</p><p>Valhalla Forex became one of the start-ups. \"We were frustrated, but rather than banging the phones on the desk and breaking headsets out of frustration we decided to do something about it,\" says Levy.</p><p>In late spring the firm took the decision to change its business completely, moving out of proprietary trading as its core concern and into an online trading venue. The result was MatchbookFX.com, an electronic system for institutional and qualified individual investors to trade foreign exchange. It's not a revolutionary model, at least not by broader market standards, but Levy, who.is an executive vicepresident at the new firm, states that it is a big departure from the norm for foreign currency trading. \"Broker-dealers generally don't charge commission for forex trades, so the only way to make money is to trade against your clients. What we've done is to shift the balance of power back to the end users, making them price makers rather than price takers.\"</p><p>To do so MatchbookFX has taken a leaf out of the US equities market. One of the main backers, and software providers, is NexTrade, one of the second-tier electronic commission networks for trading in US equities. And as in the ECN world, and as the name of the company suggests, the business is based on matching buy and sell side orders. Price discovery is provided by feeding in data from the major providers, be it Reuters, Globex , EBS or others. Buyers and sellers then agree on a price with no other middleman than MatchbookFX's online marketplace.</p><p>The time from frustration to pro-action to going live was very short, in part because MatchbookFX adapted NexTrade's existing technology rather than building a new platform. The first deal went through in September last year, and now the company handles roughly $100 million in trades each day. \"They can be as little as $200,000 in size,\" says Levy. \"But the standard is $1 million, and we have had trades executed of $5 million in one clip, and more\".</p><p>So it's no behemoth, and on those terms not an immediate threat to the incumbent dealers - the big institutions only do such small tickets as a favour. But the forex bankers at the majority of these firms are more than aware that even a small operation such as this is a potential threat; they've had three years to watch and learn from the huge shifts in the market structure of the equities market, especially in the US.</p><p>Nor is it the only model out there which has developed independently of the brokerdealers. On the other side of America in California, Lori Mirek is running another forex-trading insurgent, Currenex, whose trading product is called FXtrades.</p><p>Her path to challenging the established forex hierarchy is even stranger than Levy's. She had never worked in foreign exchange before - her last job was as head of America Online's business-to-business e-commerce division, following a career which has taken her through some of the big tech companies in the US, such as Ameritech, Sun Microsystems and Oracle. \"Part of my job at AOL was to seek out enormous markets with huge inefficiencies and therefore huge opportunities for a B2B exchange,\" says Mirek. \"The forex markets fit the bill perfectly.\"</p><p>And the vehicle chosen was a small company which for four years had been examining forex processes and cashflows, and had a small trading operation and a small customer base. Currenex was formed as a holding company last year after buying the company in the fourth quarter (strangely, Currenex won't release the name of the company), and started to build an infrastructure and develop a more comprehensive web-based service. Staffing the firm are a number of forex traders from some of the major buy and sell side firms, such as Citigroup, JP Morgan, CSFB and Barclays Global Investors.</p><p>Mirek officially took over as president and CEO at the end of April, at the same time as the firm announced strategic investment from firms including TH Lee.Putnam Internet Partners, DLJ's venture-capital arm and WR Hambrecht and Company, which has been developing a web-based Dutch auction model for bringing IPOs to the market.</p><p>In the course of her work there, Mirek has come across conflicts similar to Levy's. She has, she says, seen forex basis-point mark-up sheets for different currencies at different times of the day at one firm. In another incident she was making a pitch to a major forex user, and one of the people at the meeting was a woman who sat there smiling throughout as Mirek described how her platform ought to help cut costs by giving the user more power. \"After a while I started wondering whether I had a piece of spinach in my tooth or something,\" says Mirek, recalling the ever-present smile on the other side of the table. But at the end of her pitch, the corporate's CEO turned to the woman, who as it turned out happened to be the former senior FX trader for a bank, and asked her opinion. \"She told him that everything we had said was true,\" says Mirek. \"That her job as a dealer was to maximise the bank's profits at the expense of the corporates and funds and that she had been hired by the corporate to prevent that happening there.\"</p><p>Currenex's business model is similar to MatchbookFX's in just one respect, and that is that it is not particularly radical. It matches the neutral third-party role in trades you would associate with equities or derivatives exchanges with a multi-bank platform such as seen in the bond markets with either EuroMTS or TradeWeb.</p><p>The big difference between Currenex and TradeWeb - the main multi-bank electronic platform success story in any product thus far, now accounting for roughly 30% of all trades in US government bonds - is that the banks do not own a stake in it, nor do they sit on the board.</p><p>This, says Mirek, solves two big problems. \"First it gives the end users peace of mind that a group of banks won't be in a position to use the data to trade against them. We are the dragon guarding the castle containing the data. Second, a lot of smaller banks don't want the big banks controlling the development of and access to this market.\"</p><p>So the banks - there are at least 20 signed up now, although no names are being released - act merely as liquidity providers in a reverse auction process. They are alerted to provide a price when a client on the system wants to make a trade, and have 25 seconds to do so, depending on the complexity of the transaction. The client then has five seconds to make a decision on which price, if any, to accept. \"The added transparency this brings to the client can bring considerable cost savings,\" claims Mirek. \"One client saved anywhere between 3.4 basis points and 6.2bp on major currencies over six months depending on the size of the trade. Another monitored the pricing relative to Reuters, and FXtrades beat it 80% of the time.\"</p><p>One of Currenex's most obvious advantages is that it is already up and running. There is only one other multi-bank site in operation, and that's FX Connect, formerly the proprietary system developed by Boston-based State Street. But the two, at least as yet, are hardly competitors. Currenex's clients are mainly corporates - Intel and Mastercard are fully signed-up users, the latter, according to Mirek, transacting 97% of its volume over FXtrades. State Street's system, on the other hand, focuses exclusively on the buy-side institutional market, and only opened its doors to other dealers in April, when Deutsche Bank, and then Societe Generale and one other bank that prefers to remain nameless, were invited to come on board.</p><p>Mark Snyder, State Street's head of foreign exchange, says that they are also in discussion with 15 other financial institutions about using the system, and that FX Connect was always envisioned as a multi-bank platform. \"This was always the plan, and in 1998 and 1999 there were clients who signed up mainly because they knew we were going to open it up to more counterparties.\" But the real decision-makers were the clients. \"Our mutual clients wanted more banks on it, and some even said that they might not do business with the banks if they didn't jump on board,\" continues Snyder. \"One of the major lessons of the B2B world is that the buyers win.\"</p><p>For State Street it has been very successful witness their rise up the Euromoney rankings this year to 14th place up from 44th position in 1999. \"We had 90 clients trading on it last year, and now over 250 buy-side firms are signed up,\" says Snyder. \"We have roughly 40% of the top 500 institutional investors using the system.\" At present, FX Connect is only available through a private network. \"It is internet ready, but clients still prefer a highspeed, reliable closed system.\"</p><p>The real competition to Currenex ought in theory at least to be provided as a consequence of an announcement at the start of June. Seven of the larger forex dealers are banding together to form FXall.com, namely Bank of America, Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman Sacks, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and UBS Warburg. \"We'd all been having bilateral conversations for a year or more on the impact of e-commerce on our industry,\" says Paul Kimball, co-head of foreign exchange at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and chairman of FXall.com. \"Our clients had all been telling us the same thing: that they wanted to have a multi-bank electronic platform. It's a response to client complaints and desires. Finally, about six weeks before the announcement, we decided to get together as a group to discuss options.\"</p><p>That would put the start of the group discussions at about the time that State Street had opened its platform up to other banks and that Currenex was launching. It does sound as if it is a defensive move. The head of foreign exchange at one of the member banks admits that to a degree the banks' hands had been forced. \"There was a general reluctance to avoid taking this kind of step for as long as possible, in part because we were all concentrating on developing our own internal web sites. But that allowed some non-bank platforms to develop in our absence.\" And there are those who still question the need for it, although a declining number. \"Clients have been demanding this for some time, and in some cases have been reluctant to sign on to single-dealer platforms to avoid the hassle of having to do 15 different installations of straight through processing,\" says Philip Vasan, head of e-commerce for CSFB. \"Dealers meanwhile thought the market was so vast that there was plenty of room for stand-alone systems. That view is changing rapidly.\"</p><p>It's not just defensive, however. While all in the group are loath either to grant or to claim the honours for starting the discussions, it's more than coincidence that Vasan was only appointed head of e-commerce towards the end of April (the public confirmation was 25th April); before that he had been head of foreign exchange. Several of the initial meet- I ings took place at CSFB's headquarters on New York's Madison Avenue.</p><p>The inspiration for Fxall.com came in part, says Gerhard at Goldman Sachs, from the success of TradeWeb. \"It really grew out of discussions we were having at board meetings at TradeWeb. Obviously that's a very UScentric model which wouldn't suit the foreign exchange market. We needed a more geographically diverse consortium.\" In part, he says, that need also played a role in determining the size of the group. \"For a product as global as foreign exchange we had to have a broad array of banks to be able to represent the major markets effectively.\"</p><p>Given that the foreign exchange activities of the seven are so much broader and diverse than the US Treasuries strategies of those in TradeWeb, how did they all manage to agree on what to do? \"We tried to focus on where we had common ground,\" says CSFB's Vasan. \"So we're concentrating on bringing down the cost of dealing, of straight through processing and increasing transparency for clients in spot markets, forwards, options and research.\" Which seems to cover a fair amount, rather than concentrating on a specific area. \"We're avoiding the more contentious areas, such as retail, which don't affect us uniformly\" says Vasan. \"We're staying purely institutionally focused.\"</p><p>For the next three months or so the group will work under what Kimball calls a swat team, under himself and interim CEO Philip Weisberg, from LabMorgan. Then longerterm management structures will be put into place. Those outside the group wonder whether seven board members might be too unwieldy For effective governance, although Gerhard counters that \"it's no surprise that there's an odd number in the group. For most decisions we'll need a simple majority, and reserve the 5-2 majority for the really big votes. And the spirit behind it is important. We all expect this to succeed, are investing a lot of resources in it, and have shown over the previous two months that we can work together.\"</p><p>According to Kimball, seven was a good mean figure. \"Having just two or three was too small, 12 or more too unwieldy. We think this is just right to begin with.\" But from the start all participants are stressing that Fxall.com is so named because it is open to all. So what happens if they are called on to prove that if and when others join? \"We're thinking about non-voting equity stakes as one option that seems to have worked elsewhere, and possibly introduce a revolving board seat for new members,\" says Kimball. \"But we do want as many as possible to participate in using the system. That's the great irony of the new economy, that the more who work together, the greater the rewards.\"</p><p>Other than that, not much else is being revealed, more a sign that not much else has been decided. \"We have no rigid set of rules, and intend to be very open-minded going forward,\" says Gerhard.</p><p>It's no reason for Currenex to quake in its boots just yet. As with most start-ups in the efinance space, all that's been announced is that the entity exists, that there are seven banks on the board, and that they are open to all players to join in some fashion or other.</p><p>But this is the honeymoon period, when the polygamists still revel in the knowledge that they all share the same basic idea. They have yet to announce a technology provider, and decisions have to be made by seven banks still busy dealing with telephone broking and perfecting their proprietary systems. Going live won't be an issue until this time next year, if the example of Brokertec is anything to go by. This inter-dealer electronic broker was set up last June to offer cash and futures trading in government bonds, run initially.by seven banks, increased to 12, and still not out yet. \"It's a wonder they ever managed to get together for the meetings there's so many of them,\" says a senior forex banker not in the syndicate. Kimball isn't shrinking from the challenge. \"Working together with competitors will be as hard a task as it was to get the technology to a point where we could consider doing this. It needs resolve, focus and singlemindedness from all of us.\"</p><p>The battleground preparations for the multi-bank forex platform are not yet complete, however. The announcement of FXall.com is as important for who has been left out as much for who has been included. Conspicuous by their absence are the three largest forex banks, Deutsche Bank, Chase Manhattan, and Citigroup, all of whom were invited to the discussions.</p><p>Kimball sounds genuinely disappointed, but realistic, that none of the big three joined up. \"We have to start somewhere. Clients don't want us to wait, and in Internet time each week we wait is a month, each month a quarter. And what we have is a diverse, broad group with a lot of liquidity behind them.\"</p><p>It's not that they are against multi-bank sites. All three, to varying degrees, are involved already. Deutsche is a founding member of Brokertec, has signed up for State Street's system and is even going on joint calls to clients. One of the first acts Simon Lack took after becoming head of e-commerce for the investment-banking businesses of Chase was to start negotiations with Bear Stearns and instigator JP Morgan to set up MarketAxess, a joint fixed-income platform. Citi has been less open, if we excluded SalomonSmith Barney's strategy, although Citi is one of the founder members of Volbroker.com, an on-line interdealer currency options trading system announced in March. And, says Citi's ecommerce manager for global foreign exchange Lars Olesen, \"we decided back in February that we needed to do something in this space. Citi is prepared for the right opportunity and will participate fully in the multibank market as it develops.\"</p><p>As for Chase, says Lack, \"we didn't think that it quite met our needs. We believe that smaller is better from a governance point of view, say three or four participants, at least to begin with. And we want to be part of something more substantive rather than just announcing intentions. Attention spans can only be measured in weeks, so you can't afford to have a slow start.\"</p><p>Joe Norena, head of e-forex at Deutsche Bank, echoes the view: \"We want to take a leading role in developing this market, whether in dealer-client offerings or the interdealer space such as Volbroker.com. We want to be involved in intiatives that have concrete plans and milestones to head for, not just good intentions:\"</p><p>Which means we can expect at least one other multi-bank offering involving the top three. That has to be more of a worry for Mirek at Currenex. \"We see these announcements as a direct competitive response to us, so it totally validates our approach\" she says. \"At the end of last year there was hardly a noise out of the e-forex corner, then come January they all rushed out their single-dealer systems, version I.OI. These multi-bank offerings won't be live for at least a year, and customer: get better pricing and operational efficiencies today with Currenex.\"</p><p>It looks as if there will be at least twc medium-term consequences of this e-fore, arms race. First, that as with equine: exchanges before, the path to greater efficiency must first pass through a village called fragmentation. Single-dealer platforms will still be with us, and there may be as many as si multi-dealer platforms serving clients whether independent or bank-run.</p><p>Clients may demand choice, but having to log on to half a-dozen different sites hardly solves their stated desires over the last two years to reduce the number of systems and processes they have to deal with. But it appears that this course is inevitable. \"I guess we have to accept the process of other markets,\" says Kimball. \"Where they first went through fragmentation and then a mixture of consolidation and withering.\"</p><p>Second, it will create a battle to win liquidity, and this could be a very bloody, drawn-out affair (drawn out in Internet time, of course). And for the first time the banks will not have as much control. Certainly forex services are often linked to other financial provision, which might help drag clients from one site to another. And it would make sense for banks to promote the use of their own investments. \"Clearly if we're going to have to cannibalize our own business we'd prefer to own a piece of whatever platform is going to carry it out,\" says an e-forex banker at one of the big dealers. \"We've said no to a number of offerings, including Currenex, as a result of not being able to take a stake.\" Mirek seems to be fixed on remaining third-party neutral, although a clever membership or ownership structure which avoids the messy conflicts on some of the existing US equities and derivatives exchanges might be found, especially if it's a matter of continuing the business or shutting up shop.</p><p>But Currenex has a year or more to develop a customer base on a system which empowers the customer more than the banks have done in the past, and a system which, says Mirek, a majority of the FXall.com investors have signed up to participate in. How banks will deal with watching a platform they invested in - and it will need significant investment, Brokertec has spent over $120 million on technology alone - fail because clients have the power to force them to trade on one they have no stake in, will be one of the defining stories of the e-finance revolution.</p><p>But if the battle goes on too long, it might be irrelevant. \"Who knows, maybe five years from now deals could be getting done which are so huge that no bank will be willing to accept the risk-reward,\" says State Street's Snyder. \"Institutions might find a way of pooling their own liquidity.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">57317445 ABI</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:418X-XCP0-00T3-C21M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">148636</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5292\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Bell &amp;

A discussion of why it has taken so long for forex bankers to accept the multi-bank approach, and what the consequences are of leaving it this late is presented.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Josh Levy never intended to be part of an uprising. He left his job as a currency trader at Goldman Sachs early last year to join Valhalla Forex, based just a few minutes' walk from his former employer, on the 15th floor of a building on downtown Broadway in New York. The grandeur of its Wagnerian name belies its size: it is a small organization, specializing in proprietary trading in the forex spot markets, although it also dabbles in forwards.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Within weeks he had become exasperated with his dealers and market-makers. \"We had good price discovery brokers so we knew within three pips where the price was,\" says Levy. \"But the bid-ask quotes we were getting from the dealers were often quite far off the fair-market value. If the price was really 90-93 sometimes, especially in fast markets, we'd get prices which were four or five pips off the market, sometimes more.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Having worked at a broker-dealer, he ought, one might think, to have been better prepared. For a start, Levy does not include Goldman in the group which so frustrated him. \"I've been on the other side, but I also didn't think things should be as bad as they are. We saw widespread acute and chronic lack of service. It was eating into our P&amp;L.\"</p><p>Only equities investors tend to get much publicity with such complaints, although the execution costs of trading bonds is also coming under greater scrutiny. Somehow the foreign exchange market tends to be forgotten,which is surprising given that it is by far the largest of the three. On average $I.5 trillion is traded in foreign currency each day, which some estimates put at seven times the combined size of the debt and equity markets. Quoted prices can change 20 times in the space of a minute, the most active rates up to 18,000 times a day.</p><p>And yet the telephone and human intervention are the primary tools for doing business. Despite the introduction of systems such as Reuters and the electronic broker system (EBS) into the inter-dealer market in the early 1990s, the broker-client relationship saw virtually no technological advances and had to rely on the inefficient method of telephone trading in a fragmented, unregulated, rapidly-changing market until very recently.</p><p>Furthermore, despite having the word \"exchange\" in its title, the foreign exchange market bears none of the hallmarks of an exchange-trading environment. It is the least regulated and policed market, even by overthe-counter market standards, and lacks a coherent fee structure, which leaves customers at the whim of their liquidity providers. \"Making money off the customer is the name of the game,\" says Levy. \"Reading and anticipating customer strategies before they deal, front running orders, using customer limit orders as free options for the market-maker, and Punning stop-loss orders prematurely for profit, all are commonplace to a dealer/market-maker in forex trading. The SEC and CFTC have put exchange-traded futures brokers and equity broker-dealers in jail for less.\"</p><p>In their more candid moments the bankers will admit this, although only off the record. \"We'd be more than happy to have formal fee structure put in place,\" says a banker who works in e-forex at one of the leading banks. \"We do have a fee structure of sorts, and that is to lie to our clients,\" he continues with a wry smile.</p><p>And the foreign exchange desks can be big money spinners for the banks: in the mid1990s, for example, Citibank was making 30% or more of its profits from that division.</p><p>Little wonder, then, that the banks have hardly been quick off the mark to extend the tranSparency and greater efficiency afforded by EBS to their clients. Not even JP Morgan, one of the more active of banks in the e-commerce arena, has forged ahead in the forex market. LabMorgan has been the incubator of several of the more innovative ideas, such as the multi-bank bond platform MarketAxess, but not in forex, even though the second-incommand (and the man who has run it since last year, before Nick Rohatyn was put in charge) is Thorkild Juncker, previously the JP Morgan's head of foreign exchange.</p><p>The banks will provide reasons for forex lagging behind in adopting e-commerce solutions. One of the more cogent arguments is put forward by Paul Thrush, head of foreign exchange at Barclays Capital. \"Banks have followed a huge range of different strategies with foreign exchange. Some regard it as an extension of research, some as a more efficient clearing and settlement process that sharpens price discovery. There's never been a common view on how to use the product.\"</p><p>Most banks had in any case been concentrating on developing their own platforms, whether closed-system or web-based. Again, though, this is on the whole more beneficial to the banks, allowing them to cut costs by transferring on-line what they have done over the phone for years.Few try to address fee structures or market manipulation.</p><p>Another reason is that the overall service structure of foreign exchange is so different to other markets. \"Fixed income has been driven heavily by competition over research,\" says Lars Olesen, e-commerce manager for Citigroup's global foreign exchange group. \"The idea of co-mingling the research and the pricing on a multi-bank site fits well in that market where pricing is more transparent. It's just not been a theme in forex.\"</p><p>Then the arguments get more flimsy -- it was a Y2K issue, say some, despite the fact that several initiatives in debt and equity were announced last year, and a slew of debt initiatives early this year. Or they claim that clients don't want it. Internet delivery only ranks eighth in order of priority for customers in Euromoney's forex survey last May. True, but clients consistently demand good pricing, execution and processing from their brokers, something which the internet and other electronically-provided systems can, if done well, improve upon. What is true, of course, is that for many investors and traders the internet is still not fast enough, and security worries still persist.</p><p>Gary Craft, the e-finance analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex Brown in California, puts it another way. He produces a piece of research called E-finance Weekly, which offers an overview of the major e-finance developments. In his May 12th edition he looked at foreign exchange, calling the section \"Mr Money Center do you really want to give up those valuable FX economics?'</p><p>The news that week was that a major money center bank had struck an agreement with Intellisys to offer foreign exchange content. Crafts response: \"Where is the competition for FX trade execution? Spreads in the FX market are incredibly rich and they will not fall without a true marketplace that facilitates FX trade execution competition. Content itself is wonderful.. but the electronic commerce community needs a marketplace where the price can be improved.\"</p><p>That, he says, is unlikely to come from the incumbents. \"Money center banks are not likely to build FX marketplaces - they are likely to be forced into them. Look for innovation in FX trading, transacting and settling to come from outside the dealer cartel. No dealer today wants to price improve and arguably must be forced into any market efficiency developments.\"</p><p>It's the pricing argument again: why overturn that which has brought you such good fortune in the past? The answer is that if you don't someone else will, and as the equities market in the US has proved so effectively, that someone is more than likely to be a new entrant with much less or nothing to lose.</p><p>And, as in the equities market, the banks have brought it on themselves. Stuck with the old phone system which brought in such good revenues while also knowing that technology was bound to change the model, the vast majority spent their efforts on single-dealer platforms. This was by no means an illogical thing to do, first because that's how business was traditionally done, each bank competing against all the others. But also, says Peter Gerhard, managing director, foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs, \"we all need to have a proprietary platform which will form the basis for the multi-bank offerings. The multi-bank site is just the common portal.\"</p><p>But the banks' over-concentration on the single-dealer platforms for so long could have set them back against the insurgents. These multi-bank sites are not simply about showing several dealers' prices at once to a client. Just as important, and a huge way of saving time and money and avoiding confusion is to merge as much of the middle and back office as possible. \"Clients want to have ubiquitous, inexpensive access to the markets they work in,\" says Lars Loesen, e-commerce manager for Citigroup's global foreign exchange group. \"And what they have been telling all of us for the last two years is that they don't want to have 15 different systems and have to in-put 15 different log-in passwords.\"</p><p>As a result, much of the investment in the single-dealer platforms has, thus far, gone without reward. \"In general, clients have been reluctant to sign on to many single-dealer platforms because they want to avoid the hassle. They want multi-bank sites, and seem prepared to wait for them and continue using the phones for now.\"</p><p>Longer-term of course it is not a waste. As Gerhard points out, each bank needs its own system to route the customer to and from the common platform, and there will always be customers who want or need to stay on the proprietary platform along. \"I estimate that perhaps 75% of electronic volume will go through multi-bank sites, and 25% directly to the individual bank's site,\" says Gerhard. \"That's probably the midpoint of what my peers at the other firms think.\"</p><p>But by ignoring the multi-bank offering ,intil very recently the large dealers may have lost valuable time to start-ups, and to the only bank-run multi-bank platform in operation, State Street's FX Connext.</p><p>Valhalla Forex became one of the start-ups. \"We were frustrated, but rather than banging the phones on the desk and breaking headsets out of frustration we decided to do something about it,\" says Levy.</p><p>In late spring the firm took the decision to change its business completely, moving out of proprietary trading as its core concern and into an online trading venue. The result was MatchbookFX.com, an electronic system for Institutional and qualified individual investors to trade foreign exchange. It's not a revolutionary model, at least not by broader market Standards, but Levy, who is an executive vicepresident at the new firm, states that it is a big departure from the norm for foreign currency trading. \"Broker-dealers generally don't charge commission for forex trades, so the only way to make money is to trade against your clients. What we've done is to shift the balance of power back to the end users, making them price makers rather than price takers.\"</p><p>To do so MatchbookFX has taken a leaf out of the US equities market. One of the main backers, and software providers, is NexTrade, one of the second-tier electronic commission networks for trading in US equities. And as in the ECN world, and as the name of the company suggests, the business is based on matching buy and sell side orders. Price discovery is provided by feeding in data from the major providers, be it Reuters, Globex , EBS or others. Buyers and sellers then agree on a price with no other middleman than MatchbookFX's online marketplace.</p><p>The time from frustration to pro-action to going live was very short, in part because MatchbookFX adapted NexTrade's existing technology rather than building a new platform. The first deal went through in September last year, and now the company handles roughly $100 million in trades each day. \"They can be as little as $200,000 in size,\" says Levy. \"But the standard is $1 million, and we have had trades executed of $5 million in one clip, and more\".</p><p>So it's no behemoth, and on those terms not an immediate threat to the incumbent dealers - the big institutions only do such small tickets as a favour. But the forex bankers at the majority of these firms are more than aware that even a small operation such as this is a potential threat; they've had three years to watch and learn from the huge shifts in the market structure of the equities market, especially in the US.</p><p>Nor is it the only model out there which has developed independently of the brokerdealers. On the other side of America in California, Lori Mirek is running another forex-trading insurgent, Currenex, whose trading product is called FXtrades.</p><p>Her path to challenging the established forex hierarchy is even stranger than Levy's. She had never worked in foreign exchange before - her last job was as head of America Online's business-to-business e-commerce division, following a career which has taken her through some of the big tech companies in the US, such as Ameritech, Sun Microsystems and Oracle. \"Part of my job at AOL was to seek out enormous markets with huge inefficiencies and therefore huge opportunities for a B2B exchange,\" says Mirek. \"The forex markets fit the bill perfectly.\"</p><p>And the vehicle chosen was a small company which for four years had been examining forex processes and cashflows, and had a small trading operation and a small customer base. Currenex was formed as a holding company last year after buying the company in the fourth quarter (strangely, Currenex won't release the name of the company), and started to build an infrastructure and develop a more comprehensive web-based service. Staffing the firm are a number of forex traders from some of the major buy and sell side firms, such as Citigroup, JP Morgan, CSFB and Barclays Global Investors.</p><p>Mirek officially took over as president and CEO at the end of April, at the same time as the firm announced strategic investment from firms including TH Lee.Putnam Internet Partners, DLJ's venture-capital arm and WR Hambrecht and Company, which has been developing a web-based Dutch auction model for bringing IPOs to the market.</p><p>In the course of her work there, Mirek has come across conflicts similar to Levy's. She has, she says, seen forex basis-point mark-up sheets for different currencies at different times of the day at one firm. In another incident she was making a pitch to a major forex user, and one of the people at the meeting was a woman who sat there smiling throughout as Mirek described how her platform ought to help cut costs by giving the user more power. \"After a while I started wondering whether I had apiece of spinach in my tooth or something,\" says Mirek, recalling the ever-present smile an the other side of the table. But at the end of her pitch, the corporate's CEO turned to the woman, who as it turned out happened to be the former senior FX trader for a bank, and asked her opinion. \"She told him that everything we had said was true,\" says Mirek. \"That her job as a dealer was to maximize the bank's profits at the expense of the corporates and funds and that she had been hired by the corporate to prevent that happening there.\"</p><p>Currenex's business model is similar to MatchbookFX's in just one respect, and that is that it is not particularly radical. It matches the neutral third-party role in trades you would associate with equities or derivatives exchanges with a multi-bank platform such as seen in the bond markets with either EuroMTS or TradeWeb.</p><p>The big difference between Currenex and TradeWeb - the main multi-bank electronic platform success story in any product thus far, now accounting for roughly 30% of all trades in US government bonds - is that the banks do not own a stake in it, nor do they sit on the board.</p><p>This, says Mirek, solves two big problems. \"First it gives the end users peace of mind that a group of banks won't be in a position to use the data to trade against them. We are the dragon guarding the castle containing the data. Second, a lot of smaller banks don't want the big banks controlling the development of and access to this market.\"</p><p>So the banks - there are at least 20 signed up now, although no names are being released - act merely as liquidity providers in a reverse auction process. They are alerted to provide a price when a client on the system wants to make a trade, and have 25 seconds to do so, depending on the complexity of the transaction. The client then has five seconds to make a decision on which price, if any, to accept. \"The added transparency this brings to the client can bring considerable cost savings,\" claims Mirek. \"One client saved anywhere between 3.4 basis points and 6.2bp on major currencies over six months depending on the size ofi!the trade. Another monitored the pricing relative to Reuters, and FXtrades beat it 80% of the time.\"</p><p>One of Currenex's most obvious advantages is that it is already up and running. There is only one other multi-bank site in operation, and that's FX Connect, formerly the proprietary system developed by Boston-based State Street. But the two, at least as yet, are hardly competitors. Currenex's clients are mainly corporates - Intel and Mastercard are fully signed-up users, the latter, according to Mirek, transacting 97% of its volume over FXtrades. State Street's system, on the other hand, focuses exclusively on the buy-side institutional market, and only opened its doors to other dealers in April, when Deutsche Bank, and then Society Generate and one other bank that prefers to remain nameless, were invited to come on board.</p><p>Mark Snyder, State Street's head of foreign exchange, says that they are also in discussion with 15 other financial institutions about using the system, and that FX Connect was always envisioned as a multi-bank platform. \"This was always the plan, and in 1998 and1999 there were clients who signed up mainly because they knew we were going to open it up to more counterparties.\" But the real decision-makers were the clients. \"Our mutual clients wanted more banks on it, and some even said that they might not do business with the banks if they didn't jump on board,\" continues Snyder. \"One of the major lessons of the B2B world is that the buyers win.\"</p><p>For State Street it has been very successful witness their rise up the Euromoney rankings this year to 14th place up from 44th position in1999 \"We had go clients trading on it last year, and now over 250 buy-side firms are signed up,\" says Snyder. \"We have roughly 40% of the top 500 institutional investors using the system.\" At present, FX Connect is only available through a private network. \"It is internet ready, but clients still prefer a highspeed, reliable closed system.\"</p><p>The real competition to Currenex ought in theory at least to be provided as a consequence of an announcement at the start of June. Seven of the larger forex dealers are banding together to form FXall.com, namely Bank of America, Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and UBS Warburg. \"We'd all been having bilateral conversations for a year or more on the impact of e-commerce on our industry,\" says Paul Kimball, co-head of foreign exchange at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and chairman of FXall.com. \"Our clients had all been telling us the same thing: that they wanted to have a multi-bank electronic platform. It's a response to client complaints and desires. Finally, about six weeks before the announcement, we decided to get together as a group to discuss options.\"</p><p>That would put the start of the group discussions at about the time that State Street had opened its platform up to other banks and that Currenex was launching. It does sound as if it is a defensive move. The head of foreign exchange at one of the member banks admits that to a degree the banks' hands had been forced. \"There was a general reluctance to avoid taking this kind of step for as long as possible, in part because we were all concentrating on developing our own internal web sites. But that allowed some non-bank platforms to develop in our absence.\" And there are those who still question the need for it, although a declining number. \"Clients have been demanding this for some time, and in some cases have been reluctant to sign on to single-dealer platforms to avoid the hassle of having to do 15 different installations of straight through processing,\" says Philip Vasan, head of e-commerce for CSFB. \"Dealers meanwhile thought the market was so vast that there was plenty of room for stand-alone systems. That view is changing rapidly.\"</p><p>It's not just defensive, however. While all in the group are loath either to grant or to claim the honours for starting the discussions, it's more than coincidence that Vasan was only appointed head of e-commerce towards the end of April (the public confirmation was 25th April); before that he had been head of foreign exchange. Several of the initial meetings took lace at CSFB's headquarters on New York's Madison Avenue.</p><p>The inspiration for Fxall.com came in part, ays Gerhard at Goldman Sachs, from the @uccess of TradeWeb. \"It really grew out of Discussions we were having at board meetings TradeWeb. Obviously that's a very USentric model which wouldn't suit the foreign exchange market. We needed a more geographically diverse consortium.\" In part, ie says, that need also played a role in determining the size of the group. \"For a product as global as foreign exchange we had to have a geographically broad array of banks to be able to represent the major markets effectively.\" </p><p>Given that the foreign exchange activities of Ihe seven are so much broader and diverse than the US Treasuries strategies of those in TradeWeb, how did they all manage to agree bn what to do? \"We tried to focus on where we had common ground,\" says CSFB's Vasan.</p><p>\"So we're concentrating on bringing down the cost of dealing, of straight through processing and increasing transparency for clients in spot markets, for-wards, options and research.\" Which seems to cover a fair amount, rather than concentrating on a specific area. \"We're Avoiding the more contentious areas, such as retail, which don't affect us uniformly,\" says Vasan. \"We're staying purely institutionally focused.\"</p><p>For the next three months or so the group will work under what Kimball calls a swat team, under himself and interim CEO Philip Weisberg, from LabMorgan. Then longerterm management structures will be put into place. Those outside the group wonder whether seven board members might be too unwieldy for effective governance, although Gerhard counters that \"it's no surprise that there's an odd number in the group. For most decisions we'll need a simple majority, and reserve the 5-2 majority for those critical issues where a supermajority becomes necessary. We all expect this to succeed, we are investing a lot of resources in it, and have demonstrated over the last few months that we can work together.\"</p><p>According to Kimball, seven was a good mean figure. \"Having just two or three was too small, 12 or more too unwieldy. We think this is just right to begin with.\" But from the start all participants are stressing that Fxall.com is so named because it is open to all. So what happens if they are called on to prove that if and when others join? \"We're thinking about non-voting equity stakes as one option that seems to have worked elsewhere, and possibly introduce a revolving board seat for new members,\" says Kimball. \"But we do want as many as possible to participate in using the system. That's the great irony of the new economy, that the more who work together, the greater the rewards.\"</p><p>Other than that, not much else is being revealed, more a sign that not much else has been decided. \"We have no rigid set of rules, and intend to be very open-minded going forward,\" says Gerhard. \"Our client advisory board will be very influential in the implementation and subsequent development of this site.\"</p><p>It's no reason for Currenex to quake in its boots just yet. As with most start-ups in the efinance space, all that's been announced is that the entity exists, that there are seven banks on the board, and that they are open to all players to join in some fashion or other.</p><p>But this is the honeymoon period, when the polygamists still revel in the knowledge that they all share the same basic idea. They have yet to announce a technology provider, and decisions have to be made by seven banks still busy dealing with telephone broking and perfecting their proprietary systems. Going live won't be an issue until this time next year, if the example of Brokertec is anything to go by. This inter-dealer electronic broker was set up last June to offer cash and futures trading in government bonds, run initially by seven banks, increased to 12, and still not out yet. \"It's a wonder they ever managed to get together for the meetings there's so many of them,\" says a senior forex banker not in the syndicate. Kimball isn't shrinking from the challenge. \"Working together with competitors will be as hard a task as it was to get the technology to a point where we could consider doing this. It needs resolve, focus and singlemindedness from all of us.\"</p><p>The battleground preparations for the multi-bank forex platform are not yet complete, however. The announcement of FXall.com is as important for who has been left out as much for who has been included. Conspicuous by their absence are the three largest forex banks, Deutsche Bank, Chase Manhattan, and Citigroup, all of whom were invited to the discussions.</p><p>Kimball sounds genuinely disappointed, but realistic, that none of the big three joined up. \"We have to start somewhere. Clients don't want us to wait, and in internet time each week we wait is a month, each month a quarter. And what we have is a diverse, broad group with a lot of liquidity behind them.\"</p><p>It's not that they are against multi-bank sites. All three, to varying degrees, are involved already. Deutsche is a founding member of Brokertec, has signed up for State Street's system and is even going on joint calls to clients. One of the first acts Simon Lack took after becoming head of e-commerce for the investment-banking businesses of Chase was to start negotiations with Bear Stearns and instigator JP Morgan to set up MarketAxess, a joint fixed-income platform. Citi has been less open, if we excluded SalomonSmith Barney's strategy, although Citi is one of the founder members of Volbroker.com, an on-line interdealer currency options trading system announced in March. And, says Citi's ecommerce manager for global foreign exchange Lars Olesen, \"we decided back in February that we needed to do something in this space. Citi is prepared for the right opportunity and will participate fully in the multibank market as it develops.\"</p><p>As for Chase, says Lack, \"we didn't think that it quite met our needs. We believe that smaller is better from a governance point of view, say three or four participants, at least to begin with. And we want to be part of something more substantive rather than just announcing intentions. Attention spans can only be measured in weeks, so you can't afford to have a slow start.\"</p><p>Joe Norena, head of e-forex at Deutsche Bank, echoes the view: \"We want to take a leading role in developing this market, whether in dealer-client offerings or the interdealer space such as Volbroker.com. We want to be involved in initiatives that have concrete plans and milestones to head for, not just good intentions.\"</p><p>Which means we can expect at least one other multi-bank offering involving the top three. That has to be more of a worry for Mirek at Currenex. \"We see these announcements as a direct competitive response to us, so it totally validates our approach\" she says. \"At the end of last year there was hardly a noise out of the e-forex corner, then come January they all rushed out their single-dealer systems, version 1.01. These multi-bank offerings won't be live for at least a year, and customers get better pricing and operational efficiencies today with Currenex.\"</p><p>It looks as if there will be at least two medium-term consequences of this e-forex arms race. First, that as with equities exchanges before, the path to greater efficiency must first pass through a village called fragmentation. Single-dealer platforms will still be with us, and there may be as many as six multi-dealer platforms serving clients, whether independent or bank-run.</p><p>Clients may demand choice, but having to log on to half-a-dozen different sites hardly solves their stated desires over the last two years to reduce the number of systems and processes they have to deal with. But it appears that this course is inevitable. \"I guess we have to accept the process of other markets,\" says Kimball. \"Where they first went through fragmentation and then a mixture of consolidation and withering.\"</p><p>Second, it will create a battle to win liquid-- ity, and this could be a very bloody, drawn-out affair (drawn out in internet time, of course). And for the first time the banks will not have as much control. Certainly forex services are often linked to other financial provision, which might help drag clients from one site to another. And it would make sense for banks to promote the use of their own investments. Clearly if we're going to have to cannibalize our own business we'd prefer to own a piece of whatever platform is going to carry it out,\" says an e-forex banker at one of the big dealers. \"We've said no to a number of offerings, including Currenex, as a result of not being able to take a stake.\" Mirek seems to be fixed On remaining third-party neutral, although a Clever membership or ownership structure which avoids the messy conflicts on some of the existing US equities and derivatives exchanges might be found, especially if it's a matter of continuing the business or shutting up shop.</p><p>But Currenex has a year or more to develop a customer base on a system which empowers the customer more than the banks have done in the past, and a system which, says Mirek, a majority' of the FYall.com investors have signed up to participate in. How banks will deal with watching a platform they invested in - and it will need significant investment, trokertec has spent over $120 million on technology alone - fail because clients have the lower to force them to trade on one they have rio stake in, will be one of the defining stories of the e-finance revolution.</p><p>But if the battle goes on too long, it might be irrelevant. \"Who knows, maybe five years from now deals could be getting done which are so huge that no bank will be willing to accept the risk-reward,\" says State Street's Snyder. \"Institutions might find a way of pooling their own liquidity.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">56802412 ABI</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:418X-XCC0-00T3-C1YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">148636</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5203\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Bell &amp;

Last winter it was bonds. Now this summer foreign exchange, by far the largest market, finally embraces e-commerce. Single-dealer platforms will still be needed, but might only account for 25% of the volume. The seven-bank consortium behind FXall.com has grabbed all the headlines this month, but it is already a year or more behind two independent ventures, and years behind State Street's FX Connect, which since April has allowed other dealers on to the system. Why has it taken so long for forex bankers to accept the multi-bank approach, and what are the consequences of leaving it this late? Antony Currie investigates</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Josh Levy never intended to be part of an uprising. He left his job as a currency trader at Goldman Sachsearly last year to join Valhalla Forex, based just a few minutes' walk from his former employer, on the 15th floor of a building on downtown Broadway in New York. The grandeur of its Wagnerian name belies its size: it is a small organization, specializing in proprietary trading in the forex spot markets, although it also dabbles in forwards.</p><p>Within weeks he had become exasperated with his dealers and market-makers. \"We had good price discovery brokers so we knew within three pips where the price was,\" says Levy. \"But the bid-ask quotes we were getting from the dealers were often quite far off the fair-market value. If the price was really 90-93 sometimes, especially in fast markets, we'd get prices which were four or five pips off the market, sometimes more.\"</p><p>Having worked at a broker-dealer, he ought, one might think, to have been better prepared. For a start, Levy does not include Goldman in the group which so frustrated him. \"I've been on the other side, but I also didn't think things should be as bad as they are. We saw widespread acute and chronic lack of service. It was eating into our P&amp;L.\"</p><p>Only equities investors tend to get much publicity with such complaints, although the execution costs of trading bonds is also coming under greater scrutiny. Somehow the foreign exchange market tends to be forgotten, which is surprising given that it is by far the largest of the three. On average $1.5 trillion is traded in foreign currency each day, which some estimates put at seven times the combined size of the debt and equity markets. Quoted prices can change 20 times in the space of a minute, the most active rates up to 18,000 times a day.</p><p>photo omitted</p><p>And yet the telephone and human intervention are the primary tools for doing business. Despite the introduction of systems such as Reuters and the electronic broker system (EBS) into the inter-dealer market in the early 1990s, the broker-client relationship saw virtually no technological advances and had to rely on the inefficient method of telephone trading in a fragmented, unregulated, rapidly-changing market until very recently.</p><p>Furthermore, despite having the word \"exchange\" in its title, the foreign exchange market bears none of the hallmarks of an exchange-trading environment. It is the least regulated and policed market, even by over-the-counter market standards, and lacks a coherent fee structure, which leaves customers at the whim of their liquidity providers. \"Making money off the customer is the name of the game,\" says Levy. \"Reading and anticipating customer strategies before they deal, front running orders, using customer limit orders as free options for the market-maker, and running stop-loss orders prematurely for profit, all are commonplace to a dealer/market-maker in forex trading. The SEC and CFTC have put exchange-traded futures brokers and equity broker-dealers in jail for less.\"</p><p>In their more candid moments the bankers will admit this, although only off the record. \"We'd be more than happy to have formal fee structure put in place,\" says a banker who works in e-forex at one of the leading banks. \"We do have a fee structure of sorts, and that is to lie to our clients,\" he continues with a wry smile.</p><p>And the foreign exchange desks can be big money spinners for the banks: in the mid-1990s, for example, Citibank was making 30% or more of its profits from that division.</p><p>Little wonder, then, that the banks have hardly been quick off the mark to extend the transparency and greater efficiency afforded by EBS to their clients. Not even JP Morgan, one of the more active of banks in the e-commerce arena, has forged ahead in the forex market. LabMorgan has been the incubator of several of the more innovative ideas, such as the multi-bank bond platform MarketAxess, but not in forex, even though the second-in-command (and the man who has run it since last year, before Nick Rohatyn was put in charge) is Thorkild Juncker, previously the JP Morgan's head of foreign exchange.</p><p>The banks will provide reasons for forex lagging behind in adopting e-commerce solutions. One of the more cogent arguments is put forward by Paul Thrush, head of foreign exchange at Barclays Capital. \"Banks have followed a huge range of different strategies with foreign exchange. Some regard it as an extension of research, some as a more efficient clearing and settlement process that sharpens price discovery. There's never been a common view on how to use the product.\"</p><p>Most banks had in any case been concentrating on developing their own platforms, whether closed-system or web-based. Again, though, this is on the whole more beneficial to the banks, allowing them to cut costs by transferring on-line what they have done over the phone for years. Few try to address fee structures or market manipulation.</p><p>photo omitted</p><p>Another reason is that the overall service structure of foreign exchange is so different to other markets. \"Fixed income has been driven heavily by competition over research,\" says Lars Olesen, e-commerce manager for Citigroup's global foreign exchange group. \"The idea of co-mingling the research and the pricing on a multi-bank site fits well in that market where pricing is more transparent. It's just not been a theme in forex.\"</p><p>Then the arguments get more flimsy -- it was a Y2K issue, say some, despite the fact that several initiatives in debt and equity were announced last year, and a slew of debt initiatives early this year. Or they claim that clients don't want it. Internet delivery only ranks eighth in order of priority for customers in Euromoney's forex survey last May. True, but clients consistently demand good pricing, execution and processing from their brokers, something which the internet and other electronically-provided systems can, if done well, improve upon. What is true, of course, is that for many investors and traders the internet is still not fast enough, and security worries still persist.</p><p>Gary Craft, the e-finance analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex Brown in California, puts it another way. He produces a piece of research called E-finance Weekly, which offers an overview of the major e-finance developments. In his May 12th edition he looked at foreign exchange, calling the section \"Mr Money Center, do you really want to give up those valuable FX economics?\"</p><p>The news that week was that a major money center bank had struck an agreement with Intellisys to offer foreign exchange content. Craft's response: \"Where is the competition for FX trade execution? Spreads in the FX market are incredibly rich and they will not fall without a true marketplace that facilitates FX trade execution competition. Content itself is wonderful...but the electronic commerce community needs a marketplace where the price can be improved.\"</p><p>That, he says, is unlikely to come from the incumbents. \"Money center banks are not likely to build FX marketplaces -- they are likely to be forced into them. Look for innovation in FX trading, transacting and settling to come from outside the dealer cartel. No dealer today wants to price improve and arguably must be forced into any market efficiency developments.\"</p><p>It's the pricing argument again: why overturn that which has brought you such good fortune in the past? The answer is that if you don't someone else will, and as the equities market in the US has proved so effectively, that someone is more than likely to be a new entrant with much less or nothing to lose.</p><p>And, as in the equities market, the banks have brought it on themselves. Stuck with the old phone system which brought in such good revenues while also knowing that technology was bound to change the model, the vast majority spent their efforts on single-dealer platforms. This was by no means an illogical thing to do, first because that's how business was traditionally done, each bank competing against all the others. But also, says Peter Gerhard, managing director, foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs, \"we all need to have a proprietary platform which will form the basis for the multi-bank offerings. The multi-bank site is just the common portal.\"</p><p>But the banks' over-concentration on the single-dealer platforms for so long could have set them back against the insurgents. These multi-bank sites are not simply about showing several dealers' prices at once to a client. Just as important, and a huge way of saving time and money and avoiding confusion is to merge as much of the middle and back office as possible. \"Clients want to have ubiquitous, inexpensive access to the markets they work in,\" says Lars Loesen, e-commerce manager for Citigroup's global foreign exchange group. \"And what they have been telling all of us for the last two years is that they don't want to have 15 different systems and have to in-put 15 different log-in passwords.\"</p><p>As a result, much of the investment in the single-dealer platforms has, thus far, gone without reward. \"In general, clients have been reluctant to sign on to many single-dealer platforms because they want to avoid the hassle. They want multi-bank sites, and seem prepared to wait for them and continue using the phones for now.\"</p><p>Longer-term of course it is not a waste. As Gerhard points out, each bank needs its own system to route the customer to and from the common platform, and there will always be customers who want or need to stay on the proprietary platform along. \"I estimate that perhaps 75% of electronic volume will go through multi-bank sites, and 25% directly to the individual bank's site,\" says Gerhard. \"That's probably the midpoint of what my peers at the other firms think.\"</p><p>But by ignoring the multi-bank offering until very recently the large dealers may have lost valuable time to start-ups, and to the only bank-run multi-bank platform in operation, State Street's FX Connext.</p><p>Valhalla Forex became one of the start-ups. \"We were frustrated, but rather than banging the phones on the desk and breaking headsets out of frustration we decided to do something about it,\" says Levy.</p><p>In late spring the firm took the decision to change its business completely, moving out of proprietary trading as its core concern and into an online trading venue. The result was MatchbookFX.com, an electronic system for institutional and qualified individual investors to trade foreign exchange. It's not a revolutionary model, at least not by broader market standards, but Levy, who is an executive vice-president at the new firm, states that it is a big departure from the norm for foreign currency trading. \"Broker-dealers generally don't charge commission for forex trades, so the only way to make money is to trade against your clients. What we've done is to shift the balance of power back to the end users, making them price makers rather than price takers.\"</p><p>photo omitted</p><p>To do so MatchbookFX has taken a leaf out of the US equities market. One of the main backers, and software providers, is NexTrade, one of the second-tier electronic commission networks for trading in US equities. And as in the ECN world, and as the name of the company suggests, the business is based on matching buy and sell side orders. Price discovery is provided by feeding in data from the major providers, be it Reuters, Globex, EBS or others. Buyers and sellers then agree on a price with no other middleman than MatchbookFX's online marketplace.</p><p>The time from frustration to pro-action to going live was very short, in part because MatchbookFX adapted NexTrade's existing technology rather than building a new platform. The first deal went through in September last year, and now the company handles roughly $100 million in trades each day. \"They can be as little as $200,000 in size,\" says Levy. \"But the standard is $1 million, and we have had trades executed of $5 million in one clip, and more\".</p><p>So it's no behemoth, and on those terms not an immediate threat to the incumbent dealers -- the big institutions only do such small tickets as a favour. But the forex bankers at the majority of these firms are more than aware that even a small operation such as this is a potential threat they've had three years to watch and learn from the huge shifts in the market structure of the equities market, especially in the US.</p><p>Nor is it the only model out there which has developed independently of the broker-dealers. On the other side of America in California, Lori Mirek is running another forex-trading insurgent, Currenex, whose trading product is called FXtrades.</p><p>Her path to challenging the established forex hierarchy is even stranger than Levy's. She had never worked in foreign exchange before -- her last job was as head of America Online's business-to-business e-commerce division, following a career which has taken her through some of the big tech companies in the US, such as Ameritech, Sun Microsystems and Oracle. \"Part of my job at AOL was to seek out enormous markets with huge inefficiencies and therefore huge opportunities for a B2B exchange,\" says Mirek. \"The forex markets fit the bill perfectly.\"</p><p>And the vehicle chosen was a small company which for four years had been examining forex processes and cashflows, and had a small trading operation and a small customer base. Currenex was formed as a holding company last year after buying the company in the fourth quarter (strangely, Currenex won't release the name of the company), and started to build an infrastructure and develop a more comprehensive web-based service. Staffing the firm are a number of forex traders from some of the major buy and sell side firms, such as Citigroup, JP Morgan, CSFB andBarclays Global Investors.</p><p>Mirek officially took over as president and CEO at the end of April, at the same time as the firm announced strategic investment from firms including TH Lee. Putnam Internet Partners, DLJ's venture-capital arm and WR Hambrecht and Company, which has been developing a web-based Dutch auction model for bringing IPOs to the market.</p><p>In the course of her work there, Mirek has come across conflicts similar to Levy's. She has, she says, seen forex basis-point mark-up sheets for different currencies at different times of the day at one firm. In another incident she was making a pitch to a major forex user, and one of the people at the meeting was a woman who sat there smiling throughout as Mirek described how her platform ought to help cut costs by giving the user more power. \"After a while I started wondering whether I had a piece of spinach in my tooth or something,\" says Mirek, recalling the ever-present smile on the other side of the table. But at the end of her pitch, the corporate's CEO turned to the woman, who as it turned out happened to be the former senior FX trader for a bank, and asked her opinion. \"She told him that everything we had said was true,\" says Mirek. \"That her job as a dealer was to maximize the bank's profits at the expense of the corporates and funds and that she had been hired by the corporate to prevent that happening there.\"</p><p>photo omitted</p><p>Currenex's business model is similar to MatchbookFX's in just one respect, and that is that it is not particularly radical. It matches the neutral third-party role in trades you would associate with equities or derivatives exchanges with a multi-bank platform such as seen in the bond markets with either EuroMTS or TradeWeb.</p><p>The big difference between Currenex and TradeWeb -- the main multi-bank electronic platform success story in any product thus far, now accounting for roughly 30% of all trades in US government, bonds -- is that the banks do not own a stake in it, nor do they sit on the board.</p><p>This, says Mirek, solves two big problems. \"First it gives the end users peace of mind that a group of banks won't be in a position to use the data to trade against them. We are the dragon guarding the castle containing the data. Second, a lot of smaller banks don't want the big banks controlling the development of and access to this market.\"</p><p>So the banks -- there are at least 20 signed up now, although no names are being released -- act merely as liquidity providers in a reverse auction process. They are alerted to provide a price when a client on the system wants to make a trade, and have 25 seconds to do so, depending on the complexity of the transaction. The client then has five seconds to make a decision on which price, if any, to accept. \"The added transparency this brings to the client can bring considerable cost savings,\" claims Mirek. \"One client saved anywhere between 3.4 basis points and 6.2bp on major currencies over six months depending on the size of the trade. Another monitored the pricing relative to Reuters, and FXtrades beat it 80% of the time.\"</p><p>One of Currenex's most obvious advantages is that it is already up and running. There is only one other multi-bank site in operation, and that's FX Connect, formerly the proprietary system developed by Boston-based State Street. But the two, at least as yet, are hardly competitors. Currenex's clients are mainly corporates -- Intel and Mastercard are fully signed-up users, the latter, according to Mirek, transacting 97% of its volume over FXtrades. State Street's system, on the other hand, focuses exclusively on the buy-side institutional market, and only opened its doors to other dealers in April, when Deutsche Bank, and then Societe Generale and one other bank that prefers to remain nameless, were invited to come on board.</p><p>Mark Snyder, State Street's head of foreign exchange, says that they are also in discussion with 15 other financial institutions about using the system, and that FX Connect was always envisioned as a multi-bank platform. \"This was always the plan, and in 1998 and 1999 there were clients who signed up mainly because they knew we were going to open it up to more counterparties.\" But the real decision-makers were the clients. \"Our mutual clients wanted more banks on it, and some even said that they might not do business with the banks if they didn't jump on board,\" continues Snyder. \"One of the major lessons of the B2B world is that the buyers win.\"</p><p>For State Street it has been very successful -- witness their rise up the Euromoney rankings this year to 14th place up from 44th position in 1999. \"We had 90 clients trading on it last year, and now over 250 buy-side firms are signed up,\" says Snyder. \"We have roughly 40% of the top 500 institutional investors using the system.\" At present, FX Connect is only available through a private network. \"It is internet ready, but clients still prefer a high-speed, reliable closed system.\"</p><p>The real competition to Currenex ought in theory at least to be provided as a consequence of an announcement at the start of June. Seven of the larger forex dealers are banding together to form FXall.com, namely Bank of America, Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and UBS Warburg. \"We'd all been having bilateral conversations for a year or more on the impact of e-commerce on our industry,\" says Paul Kimball, co-head of foreign exchange at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and chairman of FXall.com. \"Our clients had all been telling us the same thing: that they wanted to have a multi-bank electronic platform. It's a response to client complaints and desires. Finally, about six weeks before the announcement, we decided to get together as a group to discuss options.\"</p><p>photo omitted</p><p>That would put the start of the group discussions at about the time that State Street had opened its platform up to other banks and that Currenex was launching. It does sound as if it is a defensive move. The head of foreign exchange at one of the member banks admits that to a degree the banks' hands had been forced. \"There was a general reluctance to avoid taking this kind of step for as long as possible, in part because we were all concentrating on developing our own internal web sites. But that allowed some non-bank platforms to develop in our absence.\" And there are those who still question the need for it, although a declining number. \"Clients have been demanding this for some time, and in some cases have been reluctant to sign on to single-dealer platforms to avoid the hassle of having to do 15 different installations of straight through processing,\" says Philip Vasan, head of e-commerce for CSFB. \"Dealers meanwhile thought the market was so vast that there was plenty of room for stand-alone systems. That view is changing rapidly.\"</p><p>It's not just defensive, however. While all in the group are loath either to grant or to claim the honours for starting the discussions, it's more than coincidence that Vasan was only appointed head of e-commerce towards the end of April (the public confirmation was 25th April) before that he had been head of foreign exchange. Several of the initial meetings took place at CSFB's headquarters on New York's Madison Avenue.</p><p>The inspiration for Fxall.com came in part, says Gerhard at Goldman Sachs, from the success of TradeWeb. \"It really grew out of discussions we were having at board meetings at TradeWeb. Obviously that's a very US-centric model which wouldn't suit the foreign exchange market. We needed a more geographically diverse consortium.\" In part, he says, that need also played a role in determining the size of the group. \"For a product as global as foreign exchange we had to have a geographically broad array of banks to be able to represent the major markets effectively.\"</p><p>Given that the foreign exchange activities of the seven are so much broader and diverse than the US Treasuries strategies of those in TradeWeb, how did they all manage to agree on what to do? \"We tried to focus on where we had common ground,\" says CSFB's Vasan. \"So we're concentrating on bringing down the cost of dealing, of straight through processing and increasing transparency for clients in spot markets, forwards, options and research.\" Which seems to cover a fair amount, rather than concentrating on a specific area. \"We're avoiding the more contentious areas, such as retail, which don't affect us uniformly,\" says Vasan. \"We're staying purely institutionally focused.\"</p><p>For the next three months or so the group will work under what Kimball calls a swat team, under himself and interim CEO Philip Weisberg, from LabMorgan. Then longer-term management structures will be put into place. Those outside the group wonder whether seven board members might be too unwieldy for effective governance, although Gerhard counters that \"it's no surprise that there's an odd number in the group. For most decisions we'll need a simple majority, and reserve the 5-2 majority for those critical issues where a supermajority becomes necessary. We all expect this to succeed, we are investing a lot of resources in it, and have demonstrated over the last few months that we can work together.\"</p><p>According to Kimball, seven was a good mean figure. \"Having just two or three was too small, 12 or more too unwieldy. We think this is just right to begin with.\" But from the start all participants are stressing that Fxall.com is so named because it is open to all. So what happens if they are called on to prove that if and when others join? \"We're thinking about non-voting equity stakes as one option that seems to have worked elsewhere, and possibly introduce a revolving board seat for new members,\" says Kimball. \"But we do want as many as possible to participate in using the system. That's the great irony of the new economy, that the more who work together, the greater the rewards.\"</p><p>Other than that, not much else is being revealed, more a sign that not much else has been decided. \"We have no rigid set of rules, and intend to be very open-minded going forward,\" says Gerhard. \"Our client advisory board will be very influential in the implementation and subsequent development of this site.\"</p><p>It's no reason for Currenex to quake in its boots just yet. As with most start-ups in the e-finance space, all that's been announced is that the entity exists, that there are seven banks on the board, and that they are open to all players to join in some fashion or other.</p><p>But this is the honeymoon period, when the polygamists still revel in the knowledge that they all share the same basic idea. They have yet to announce a technology provider, and decisions have to be made by seven banks still busy dealing with telephone broking and perfecting their proprietary systems. Going live won't be an issue until this time next year, if the example of Brokertec is anything to go by. This inter-dealer electronic broker was set up last June to offer cash and futures trading in government bonds, run initially by seven banks, increased to 12, and still not out yet. \"It's a wonder they ever managed to get together for the meetings there's so many of them,\" says a senior forex banker not in the syndicate. Kimball isn't shrinking from the challenge. \"Working together with competitors will be as hard a task as it was to get the technology to a point where we could consider doing this. It needs resolve, focus and single-mindedness from all of us.\"</p><p>The battleground preparations for the multi-bank forex platform are not yet complete, however. The announcement of FXall.com is as important for who has been left out as much for who has been included. Conspicuous by their absence are the three largest forex banks, Deutsche Bank, Chase Manhattan, and Citigroup, all of whom were invited to the discussions.</p><p>Kimball sounds genuinely disappointed, but realistic, that none of the big three joined up. \"We have to start somewhere. Clients don't want us to wait, and in internet time each week we wait is a month, each month a quarter. And what we have is a diverse, broad group with a lot of liquidity behind them.\"</p><p>It's not that they are against multi-bank sites. All three, to varying degrees, are involved already. Deutsche is a founding member of Brokertec, has signed up for State Street's system and is even going on joint calls to clients. One of the first acts Simon Lack took after becoming head of e-commerce for the investment-banking businesses of Chase was to start negotiations with Bear Stearns and instigator JP Morgan to set up MarketAxess, a joint fixed-income platform. Citi has been less open, if we excluded SalomonSmith Barney's strategy, although Citi is one of the founder members of Volbroker.com, an on-line inter-dealer currency options trading system announced in March. And, says Citi's e-commerce manager for global foreign exchange Lars Olesen, \"we decided back in February that we needed to do something in this space. Citi is prepared for the right opportunity and will participate fully in the multi-bank market as it develops.\"</p><p>As for Chase, says Lack, \"we didn't think that it quite met our needs. We believe that smaller is better from a governance point of view, say three or four participants, at least to begin with. And we want to be part of something more substantive rather than just announcing intentions. Attention spans can only be measured in weeks, so you can't afford to have a slow start.\"</p><p>Joe Norena, head of e-forex at Deutsche Bank, echoes the view: \"We want to take a leading role in developing this market, whether in dealer-client offerings or the inter-dealer space such as Volbroker.com. We want to be involved in initiatives that have concrete plans and milestones to head for, not just good intentions.\"</p><p>Which means we can expect at least one other multi-bank offering involving the top three. That has to be more of a worry for Mirek at Currenex. \"We see these announcements as a direct competitive response to us, so it totally validates our approach\" she says. \"At the end of last year there was hardly a noise out of the e-forex corner, then come January they all rushed out their single-dealer systems, version 1.01. These multi-bank offerings won't be live for at least a year, and customers get better pricing and operational efficiencies today with Currenex.\"</p><p>It looks as if there will be at least two medium-term consequences of this e-forex arms race. First, that as with equities exchanges before, the path to greater efficiency must first pass through a village called fragmentation. Single-dealer platforms will still be with us, and there may be as many as six multi-dealer platforms serving clients, whether independent or bank-run.</p><p>Clients may demand choice, but having to log on to half-a-dozen different sites hardly solves their stated desires over the last two years to reduce the number of systems and processes they have to deal with. But it appears that this course is inevitable. \"I guess we have to accept the process of other markets,\" says Kimball. \"Where they first went through fragmentation and then a mixture of consolidation and withering.\"</p><p>Second, it will create a battle to win liquidity, and this could be a very bloody, drawn-out affair (drawn out in internet time, of course). And for the first time the banks will not have as much control. Certainly forex services are often linked to other financial provision, which might help drag clients from one site to another. And it would make sense for banks to promote the use of their own investments. \"Clearly if we're going to have to cannibalize our own business we'd prefer to own a piece of whatever platform is going to carry it out,\" says an e-forex banker at one of the big dealers. \"We've said no to a number of offerings, including Currenex, as a result of not being able to take a stake.\" Mirek seems to be fixed on remaining third-party neutral, although a clever membership or ownership structure which avoids the messy conflicts on some of the existing US equities and derivatives exchanges might be found, especially if it's a matter of continuing the business or shutting up shop.</p><p>But Currenex has a year or more to develop a customer base on a system which empowers the customer more than the banks have done in the past, and a system which, says Mirek, a majority of the FXall.com investors have signed up to participate in. How banks will deal with watching a platform they invested in -- and it will need significant investment, Brokertec has spent over $120 million on technology alone -- fail because clients have the power to force them to trade on one they have no stake in, will be one of the defining stories of the e-finance revolution.</p><p>But if the battle goes on too long, it might be irrelevant. \"Who knows, maybe five years from now deals could be getting done which are so huge that no bank will be willing to accept the risk-reward,\" says State Street's Snyder. \"Institutions might find a way of pooling their own liquidity.\"(c) Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC This material must be used for the customer's internal business use only and a maximum of ten (10) hard copy print-outs may be made.

Above the picture shows Mask compliance but no seatbelt. Getting to Hong Kong levels of 99% mask-wearing and other new hand and surface hygiene levels will require technology, ergonomics, policy and other levers. </p><p>Marc Benioff supports mask-wearing and says if we can get US mask-wearing to 80% then this would be enough to suppress COVID-19 spread in a month. 67% of all Americans now wear masks\u2014up since May by over 13%! If we make it to 80% the virus could be extinguished in less than a month. If 80% of a population is protected, 4 out of every 5 people won't spread it further. We can do this! \ufe0f pic.twitter.com/cdvxBpSMOx[1] \u2014 Marc Benioff (@Benioff) July 27, 2020[2]This issue is unfortunately a highly political matter in the USA. Democrats have about 80% mask compliance while Republicans have about 45%. Wearing more masks will help, but Singapore has 90-92% mask-wearing and still has significant spread of COVID-19.[3] This is also in spite of Singapore having a very hot climate. Singapore had 8650 diagnosed cases per million while the US has 13000 diagnosed cases per million.[4] Singapore has 500 cases per day with a population that is about 60 times less than the US. This would be 30,000 cases per day which is better than the US 60,000 cases per day. Singapore has much higher population density but population density does not have tight correlation with the disease spread. Correlation is with how many people are in the same house or apartment. What is a truly effective public mask-wearing level? The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine has an article that shows Hong Kong has 98.8% mask-wearing compliance.[5] The countries with effective hygiene have populations that fully have lives with face mask use, hand washing and social distancing. Those are all important components of the non-pharmaceutical measures against COVID-19. This means 19 out of 20 Democratic Americans also need to shift to mask-wearing compliance and 54 out of 55 Republican Americans need to shift to mask-wearing compliance. I personally know people who live in the high compliance countries of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand. I can tell you that the behaviors and culture go beyond mask-wearing. There is also frequent hand cleaning, cleaning of frequently touched surfaces. Twenty-five years ago in 1995, I worked in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The office cleaning crews would thoroughly wipe down keyboards and phones with Lysol. This was before SARS in 2003. After SARS, the public mask-wearing in many Asian countries became standard practice. The 99% level of public mask-wearing will not happen in the USA based upon public service messages and tweeting.  Seat belt usage in the USA ranges from 70-97%.[6] The Nationwide average is 90.7%. This is in spite of seat belt fines in the $500 range, significant enforcement and cars that will sound alarms when there is no seat belt being worn. US businesses have about 90-95% compliance with workplace safety.[7] Occupational Safety and Health Administration had about 50,000 inspections and there were 524 willful violations, 3100 repeat violations, 43,000 serious violations etc The extensive business regulations and fines have cut the number of workplace fatalities by about 65% over decades. This is too slow and not a good enough standard. All stores in Northern California were denying entry and service to customers that did not wear masks. However, this is no longer strictly enforced even in the SF Bay Area.  There is an Asian supermarket in Oakland, KP Asian Market, they do not allow entry without mask-wearing and gloves. The store gives ALL customers disposable masks and gloves if the customers do not have their own. Customers are provided cleaner to wipe down the carts and items. This is the level of behavior needed at every office, factory and retail outlet. American restaurants give out napkins and ketchup packets for free. Fried chicken restaurants give sanitary wipes. There needs to be completely subsidized PPE. $200 of PPE per person in the US is $66 billion per year. This is vastly less than the trillions being spent on financial bailouts. Also, the CDC reports that the US has and average of $87 billion in business losses each year from flu and $40 billion from other respiratory diseases. Face masks, face shields, personal and group sanitizer, wipes and gloves needs to be more abundant than free napkins and ketchup packets. Also, forget about saying that people are just not educated enough. US Hospitals have not had over 90% hand cleaning compliance. It cannot be said that doctors and nurses are not educated about disease spread. A University of Zurich Hospital study indicated that the ergonomics of personal sanitizer bottle caps discouraged the compliance with hand cleaning. Achieving 99% compliance means e everything about masks, shields, hand cleaning, cleaning surfaces and distancing has to be easy and completely friction-free. It needs to be free for the end-users. It has to be as ergonomic and easy as possible. Every checkpoint and entry needs to reinforce or require compliance. People know how much effort and product (car) adjustment has gone into seatbelt compliance. This is still at 91% US-wide. 99% compliance is beyond almost any prior US behavior and cultural norm. We need to use the best technology, ergonomics and policy. McDonald's hands out as many free ketchup packets and napkins as customers want. KFC gives out free alcohol wipes for customers who get greasy fingers. But both do not give masks or sanitizer to customers. All governments, offices and retail need to give out masks, face masks, gloves, sanitizer, and wearable sanitizer that is fully subsidized for the world.

Above the picture shows Mask compliance but no seatbelt. Getting to Hong Kong levels of 99% mask-wearing and other new hand and surface hygiene levels will require technology, ergonomics, policy and other levers.    Marc Benioff supports mask-wearing and says if we can get US mask-wearing to 80% then this would be enough to suppress COVID-19 spread in a month.       67% of all Americans now wear masks\u2014up since May by over 13%! If we make it to 80% the virus could be extinguished in less than a month. If 80% of a population is protected, 4 out of every 5 people won\u2019t spread it further. We can do this!  \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/cdvxBpSMOx    \u2014 Marc Benioff (@Benioff) July 27, 2020    This issue is unfortunately a highly political matter in the USA. Democrats have about 80% mask compliance while Republicans have about 45%.    Wearing more masks will help, but Singapore has 90-92% mask-wearing and still has significant spread of COVID-19. This is also in spite of Singapore having a very hot climate.    Singapore had 8650 diagnosed cases per million while the US has 13000 diagnosed cases per million. Singapore has 500 cases per day with a population that is about 60 times less than the US. This would be 30,000 cases per day which is better than the US 60,000 cases per day. Singapore has much higher population density but population density does not have tight correlation with the disease spread. Correlation is with how many people are in the same house or apartment.    What is a truly effective public mask-wearing level?    The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine has an article that shows Hong Kong has 98.8% mask-wearing compliance. The countries with effective hygiene have populations that fully have lives with face mask use, hand washing and social distancing. Those are all important components of the non-pharmaceutical measures against COVID-19.    This means 19 out of 20 Democratic Americans also need to shift to mask-wearing compliance and 54 out of 55 Republican Americans need to shift to mask-wearing compliance.    I personally know people who live in the high compliance countries of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand. I can tell you that the behaviors and culture go beyond mask-wearing. There is also frequent hand cleaning, cleaning of frequently touched surfaces.    Twenty-five years ago in 1995, I worked in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The office cleaning crews would thoroughly wipe down keyboards and phones with Lysol. This was before SARS in 2003.    After SARS, the public mask-wearing in many Asian countries became standard practice.    The 99% level of public mask-wearing will not happen in the USA based upon public service messages and tweeting.    Seat belt usage in the USA ranges from 70-97%. The Nationwide average is 90.7%. This is in spite of seat belt fines in the $500 range, significant enforcement and cars that will sound alarms when there is no seat belt being worn.    US businesses have about 90-95% compliance with workplace safety. Occupational Safety and Health Administration had about 50,000 inspections and there were 524 willful violations, 3100 repeat violations, 43,000 serious violations etc\u2026 The extensive business regulations and fines have cut the number of workplace fatalities by about 65% over decades. This is too slow and not a good enough standard.    All stores in Northern California were denying entry and service to customers that did not wear masks. However, this is no longer strictly enforced even in the SF Bay Area.    There is an Asian supermarket in Oakland, KP Asian Market, they do not allow entry without mask-wearing and gloves. The store gives ALL customers disposable masks and gloves if the customers do not have their own. Customers are provided cleaner to wipe down the carts and items. This is the level of behavior needed at every office, factory and retail outlet.    American restaurants give out napkins and ketchup packets for free. Fried chicken restaurants give sanitary wipes.

President Trump has repeatedly accused tech giants and social media companies of anti-Trump and anti-Conservative bias[1]. The Executive Order \"remains in flux,\" according to several anonymous sources speaking with Politico[2]. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] The White House is reportedly floating several drafts of an Executive Order aimed directly at tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Twitter. The Executive Order, which was first reported on by Politico[4], is said to be \"in flux,\" but its objective is clear: To address the allegations of anti-Trump and anti-Conservative bias that President Trump has repeatedly made regarding social media companies[5]. \"There's no doubt in my mind that I should have millions and millions of people,\" Trump said in mid-July at an event billed as a White House Social Media Summit. </p><p>\"But I know that we've been blocked. People come up to me and say, 'Sir I cannot follow you' They make it absolutely impossible.\" Trump has yet to present any evidence to back up these claims. It's not clear if the Executive Order would address those allegations directly, or how it would address alleged bias in services owned and operated by private corporations. Sources with knowledge of the Executive Order's drafting told Politico that such an order shouldn't be expected \"imminently.\"When reached for comment, White House press representative Judd Deere told Business Insider, \"The President announced at this month's social media summit that we were going to address this and the administration is exploring all policy solutions.\" He wouldn't confirm the report, but did point to Trump's quotes at the Social Media Summit. \"Today, I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans,\" Trump said in July. \"Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people.\"NOW WATCH: Jeff Bezos is worth over $160 billion \u2014 here's how the world's richest man makes and spends his money[6]See Also: Trump and other politicians keep blaming violent video games for mass shootings.

In his proudest moments, he resembles something like a theorist of transformation, decline and creation. In his lowest, he is more like a speaking canary, prone to prophecy, a game with losing odds. His attempts at optimism are framed as counterintuitive, faring little better, in predictive terms, than his lapses into pessimism. He teeters hazardously between implicating his audience and merely giving their anxieties a name. He \u2014 and it is almost always a he \u2014 is the critical equivalent of an unreliable narrator, unable to write about technology without also writing about himself. Occasionally, he is right: about what is happening, about what should happen, and about what it means. And so he carries on, and his audience with him.</p><p>Franklin Foer, thankfully, recognizes these pitfalls even if he can\u2019t always avoid them. Who can? The melodramatically titled \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d Foer\u2019s compact attempt at a broad technological polemic \u2014 which identifies the stupendous successes of Amazon, Google and Facebook, among others, as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the individual and to society \u2014 begins with a disclaimer. Foer\u2019s tumultuous stint editing The New Republic under the ownership of the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes ended with mass resignations and public acrimony. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this experience informs the argument of this book,\u201d he writes. He is likewise entangled through his proximity to publishing: The author\u2019s friends, colleagues and immediate family members \u2014 including his brother, the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer \u2014 depend to different degrees on the industry Amazon consumed first. The book is dedicated to his father, Bert, a crusading antitrust lawyer.</p><p>In this slightly crouched posture, and with a hint of healthy self-doubt, Foer proceeds quickly. We, the consuming public, have failed to properly understand the new tech superpowers, he suggests, leaving little hope for stodgy and reluctant American regulators. The scope of their influence is obscured by the sheer number of things they do and sell, or problems they purport to be solving, and by our outdated sense of what constitutes a monopoly. To that end, Foer promotes the concept of the \u201cknowledge monopoly,\u201d which he qualifies with a mischievous grin. \u201cMy hope is that we revive \u2018monopoly\u2019 as a core piece of political rhetoric that broadly denotes dominant firms with pernicious powers,\u201d he says, rather than as a \u201ctechnical\u201d term referring to one company cornerning a market. (His new monopolists, after all, aren\u2019t raising prices. They\u2019re giving things away free).</p><p>For much of the book, readers are parachuted into various moments in the history of computing, the internet, media and philosophy. Character introductions arrive rapidly, with a casualness that can slip into absurdity: Descartes \u201cenjoyed his sleep\u201d; Mark Zuckerberg \u201cis a good boy, but he wanted to be bad, or maybe just a little bit naughty\u201d; Alan Turing was an \u201catheist and a loner,\u201d while Ray Kurzweil, the prophet of an artificial-intelligence-driven singularity, is driven by his inability to escape \u201cthe biggest fear of them all.\u201d (Death.) The effect is slightly delirious but genuinely enjoyable. Readers are flung through a highly selective history of the philosophy of mind, landing squarely on their feet in Google\u2019s A.I. laboratories. The 17th-century philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\u2019s stubborn and total belief that knowledge could be reduced to mathematical computation leads surprisingly seamlessly into a perceptive assessment of Zuckerberg\u2019s fraught and inconsistent public relationship with the concept of the algorithm, his mission to connect the world and the billions of meaningful decisions made by Facebook\u2019s software every day.</p><p>As Foer\u2019s book veers into advocacy, readers are treated to a similarly energetic and cleareyed view of the modern \u201cknowledge monopoly\u201d giants. Jeff Bezos\u2019 techno-populist suggestion that he can \u201csee the elimination of gatekeepers everywhere\u201d is contrasted with his personal purchase of The Washington Post and his stewardship over Amazon, which is a massive, diverse and participatory marketplace, but one under the control of a single private company with a reputation for ruthlessness and strong-arm negotiation tactics. \u201cOld gatekeepers might not always have been worthy of praise,\u201d Foer writes, \u201cbut at least there were a lot of them.\u201d</p><p>His best assessment of what has happened to media in general in the last decade is tucked in an aside about what Facebook, Google and Amazon all offer, or threaten: They are the \u201cprimary bundlers\u201d of commercial media, whether it\u2019s books, articles or video. \u201cThey are the ones that create a usable, coherent product from its disparate parts. Their business model is infinitely better than the one it displaced.\u201d More broadly, truly ambitious tech companies are in the business of creating markets, not competing in them; of wrapping themselves around industries, not merely disrupting them.</p><p>The New Republic, of which Foer was editor twice \u2014 Hughes invited him back in 2012 partly as a demonstration of good faith for a skeptical staff \u2014 appears intermittently in \u201cWorld Without Mind.\u201d Foer doesn\u2019t share gossip or indulge much in the way of bitterness. He is generous in his only slightly condescending description of the magazine\u2019s young tech-rich owner and in his minimally insulting account of working with the company\u2019s data-obsessed C.E.O., whose arrival plainly portended Foer\u2019s departure and the subsequent resignation of a majority of its masthead. What happened at The New Republic is more useful to Foer as an entry point for describing the news media\u2019s state of utter upheaval at the time. Here, again, he becomes the knowingly unreliable narrator: His obvious loathing of the social-media-driven news coverage pursued in recent years by most media organizations does capture the fatalistic mood of the industry, but betrays a sense of nostalgia for a better era that can be hard to locate anywhere outside of Foer\u2019s own memory. He also reveals a lack of interest in new modes of media production that were rising as his magazine fell.</p><p>Foer\u2019s other concession to nostalgia, in the form of an inoffensive command to return to the \u201csustaining nourishment of the contemplative life and the deep commitment to text,\u201d is overshadowed by a vigorous and novel call for regulatory intervention. He reminds us that the issue of monopoly dominated our politics for generations, even as the companies in the crosshairs changed in form and ambition. Though he makes no radical or provocative case to, say, nationalize Facebook, or to break up Google, he does suggest creating a Data Protection Authority, in the mold of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s post-financial-crisis Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and calling for government to protect privacy as it (in theory) protects the environment.</p><p>Is this idealistic, plain crazy, or just impotent?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who had just rolled out a plan to break up the largest tech companies, set the tone for everyone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We want to keep the marketplace competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage have a\u00a0manipulative advantage,\" Warren said at a Saturday afternoon Q&amp;A at South by Southwest (SXSW). \"When someone gets market dominance, they then start to destroy competition in the very world that gave them birth.\" Her talk was the only one by a presidential candidate that filled its venue. (Sens. Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, who have drawn the largest crowds of the Democratic field, did not attend this year.)</p><p>SXSW was not an obvious place for Warren's argument to work. The conference, a place where start-ups such as Twitter and Uber\u00a0broke\u00a0through to mass audiences, is among other things a celebration of unfettered markets. Four years ago, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) made\u00a0a buzzy\u00a0trip to Austin, stopping into panels and\u00a0tech incubators. Libertarian-minded Republicans wanted to set innovators free, he argued, while Democrats wanted to lock them in chains.</p><p>But this year's conference, coming after weeks of debate about capitalism,\u00a0socialism\u00a0and the Democratic Party, became a place for Democrats to talk about all the rules capitalism was missing. Ignoring the jargon, they talked about the inevitable clash with big tech\u00a0and the role for government regulation. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who has pitched herself as a moderate who could win back skeptical conservatives, found herself talking about the need for more antitrust law. Asked by tech journalist Kara Swisher\u00a0whether \"Facebook and Google should be allowed to buy anything big right now,\" Klobuchar did not say yes.</p><p>\"We've got to look carefully at all of these deals,\" she said. Then, she talked\u00a0up her own legislation to crack down on monopolies, \"to supercharge the agencies\" and apply rules normally reserved for companies that charge consumers to companies that sell to advertisers after collecting data. Rather than differing with Warren, Klobuchar wanted to do \"stuff Elizabeth is trying to get at in a different way.\"</p><p>No\u00a0Democrat proposed an idea quite as big as Warren's. She\u00a0would define companies that run marketplaces of their own and are valued at more than $25 billion as \"platform utilities,\" with new restraints. If implemented, tech giants that have absorbed smaller companies and used them to advertise and sell their own products would have to be broken apart. While announcing the plan in New York, she congratulated the city for the collapse of a deal to bring Amazon jobs to Queens with a tax incentive package.</p><p>When asked about this, the eight other\u00a0candidates who traveled to Austin this weekend tended to agree with Warren, at least on the basics.</p><p>\"Is that worth considering? Sure,\" said Juli\u00e1n Castro of Warren's antitrust plan. \"I agree that we have to be much stronger in terms of antitrust enforcement. I believe that we need to ask a lot more of people at the top in this country, and of wealthy corporations. I don't understand how Amazon made $11 billion in profit last year, paid no federal taxes, and at the same time, New York was about to offer them a $3 billion package to locate their second headquarters.\" (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Castro has positioned himself on the left of the Democratic field. But former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, who has embraced his depiction as a centrist, also said it was time to think about cracking down on monopolies and mergers.</p><p>\"There was a period 40 or 50 years ago when large companies would try to merge together, and there was a strong feeling that the public was better served by having more competitors,\" Hickenlooper\u00a0said in an interview.\u00a0\"Right now it seems like we say, well, if we get down to two of these other two or three competitors, that's a competitive system. That's probably nonsense. What are the benefits to society when you have mergers of really large companies like these? Not just tech companies, but banks? It's in what we call 'value capture.' It's the companies saying: Well, we don't need two HR teams, we'll lay these people off.\"</p><p>Before he arrived at the conference, Hickenlooper had been the unwilling participant in an argument with Howard Schultz, who's considering a presidential run as an independent. The former Starbucks chief executive, perturbed by Hickenlooper's answer to a question about whether he would call himself a \"capitalist,\" tweeted that \"if\u00a0even a successful businessman and entrepreneur like Governor Hickenlooper can't\u00a0openly support capitalism in the Democratic primary, it's clear this is Senator Sanders' party now.\"</p><p>But Schultz, who took questions at a Saturday morning session at the conference, struggled to define what he was arguing against. Asked to define \"socialism,\" he invoked the crisis in Venezuela; then, after some boos, he said capitalism was a force for good that needed to be rethought a little.\u00a0</p><p>\"We want our free enterprise to be sustainable,\" Schultz said. \"Is it perfect? No. Does it need to be refined? Yes. Do businesses have a moral obligation, in addition to making money? Yes.\"</p><p>Across the conference, the only full-bore critique of capitalism came from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who said capitalism as practiced in 2019 meant that \"any human and environmental cost was written off in the quest for profit. \"</p><p>\"That ideology is not sustainable, and cannot be redeemed,\" she said.</p><p>But among the Democrats running for president\u00a0- even Schultz, who argued that he has been rendered politically homeless\u00a0- there's neither a call for capitalism to be dismantled nor\u00a0one for it to be kept as is. Over the weekend, while they hashed this out, most of SXSW's attendees were in other rooms. But the debate is coming to them eventually.\u00a0</p><p>Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses (Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom, 401 likely caucusgoers)          </p><p>Joe Biden - 27%Bernie Sanders - 25%Elizabeth Warren - 9%Kamala Harris - 7%Beto O'Rourke - 5%Cory Booker - 3%Amy Klobuchar\u00a0- 3%Julian Castro - 1%Michael Bennet - 1%Pete Buttigieg - 1%Steve Bullock - 1%John Delaney - 1%Jay Inslee - 1%</p><p>There are lots of semi-useless national polls\u00a0and only a handful of standard-setting state polls. This is one of the latter. It's also the first to come back from the field twice, having\u00a0tracked Democratic sentiment in December. Since then, there's been big movement for only the three top white male candidates (or potential candidates); support for Biden down five, support for Sanders up six, and support for O'Rourke down six. Warren and Harris gained support within the margin of error, while Booker and Klobuchar\u00a0lost it.</p><p>At this same point in 2015, the Iowa poll found Hillary Clinton more than 50 points ahead of Sanders\u00a0and then-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at the front\u00a0of a crowded GOP lineup. So the pure horse race is interesting\u00a0but hardly determinative. Two other questions are more interesting. First, a full 43 percent of voters say that Sanders's\u00a0\"time as a candidate has passed,\" while\u00a031 percent of voters say that of Biden. That goes a ways toward explaining why the crowded second tier of campaigns think voters will peel away as they become familiar with younger candidates.</p><p>Second, the state's Democratic electorate is all in on two ideas that are being pegged as far left, but\u00a0have fairly broad support. Ninety-one percent of Iowa Democrats want a candidate who favors a \"Green New Deal,\" either in full or in steps; 89 percent favor a wealth tax, as proposed by Warren and embraced by some other front-runners. This is something to watch out for: Democrats want to win, and they do not see ideas such as these as impediments to winning.</p><p>AUSTIN - William Weld, the first and so far only Republican primary challenger to President Trump, will sometimes drive from Massachusetts to New Hampshire and see who wants to talk. He'll schedule some town hall meetings\u00a0and, like any other person running for president, will answer questions from whoever shows up.</p><p>\"They're very good,\" Weld said Saturday, polishing off a sandwich in a restaurant near Austin's lanyard-strewn convention center.\u00a0\"They're almost as good as an ed board.\"</p><p>Not many presidential candidate would consider an \"ed board,\" a newspaper editorial board interview, to be an experience worth reliving every day. Not many candidates are like Weld, a two-term governor of Massachusetts who left the Republican Party in 2016, ran as the\u00a0libertarian nominee for vice president\u00a0and then decided that he was in a good position to save the Republicans from the person he calls the \"malignant narcissist\" in the White House.</p><p>\"I didn't want to dribble around the court; I wanted to go right for the hoop,\" Weld said. \"That means going right at the president, and that means running as an 'R.' No one's ever going to say to the president: 'Sir, you must debate the Libertarian candidate.' \"</p><p>In four weeks as a Trump challenger, Weld has clocked national TV interviews, sit-downs with major magazines, a segment on Cheddar\u00a0- \"a channel for millennials\"\u00a0- and a spot on the same South by Southwest stage as\u00a0Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. The only poll that tested him against Trump in New Hampshire put him 64 points behind. Other polls continue to add the name of former Ohio governor\u00a0John Kasich, a better-known Trump critic who is noncommittal on running in 2020.</p><p>Weld is happily uninterested in the horse race, because he doesn't know how events will change Trump's fortunes\u00a0and because he has tried everything else. \"In 2016, Gary Johnson and I ran on what I thought was a very viable message,\" he said, referring to his libertarian running mate. \"The two parties were offering fear of the other guy, and we were two former Republican governors,\u00a0offering a six-lane highway up the middle. We got 3\u00a0percent of the vote.\"</p><p>It's not likely that Republicans would put Weld on a debate stage with the president; they have been reworking party rules to prevent it, and no president in the TV era has debated a primary challenger. So Weld has been taking shots from the side of the stage. \"For the last 15 years, I've really thought that I could start this job on Monday,\" he explained, sketching out a busy first-week agenda of bringing America back into the Paris climate accords and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p><p>Like other frustrated politicians running outside the Democratic Party, Weld thinks the Democratic shift to the left has opened some space for him. Weld watched Michael\u00a0Capuano, the longtime Democratic congressman from Boston's liberal suburbs, lose by double digits to now-Rep. Ayanna Pressley, one of the few real left-wing coups of 2018. \"I almost endorsed Mike,\" Weld said,\u00a0\"not that anyone would have cared.\" What this meant in 2020, he said, was that the many primaries that let independents pick a party\u00a0- New Hampshire is a big one\u00a0- could be reshaped.</p><p>That would be a titanic effort, and nothing about Weld's exploratory bid could be called \"big\" right now. He has a skeletal staff and a nearly ad hoc schedule. He has not raised much money. He also spares much of the Republican Party in his critique of Trump. Both of his Supreme Court picks, Weld says, were \"first-rate,\" a decision he came to after reading up on every shortlisted nominee. Trump's strategy of trying force Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro out of power, said Weld, was also smart. The problem was just that Trump didn't have a problem with more dictators.</p><p>\"I don't think you'd need to give him sodium Pentothal to get him to say that he preferred not to have an election,\" Weld said.</p><p>After lunch, Weld walked the three short blocks to the site of his big SXSW interview. \"You're not going to hear any Abraham Lincoln speeches,\" he warned. He was recognized immediately by fans\u00a0and talked to them briefly about what brought them to Austin without saying that he was a candidate for president. No one else was walking these streets in a pinstripe suit.</p><p>Weld was stopped a few more times for photographs, as he talked about the stakes of the race. Kasich, who also appeared at the conference, and Howard Schultz, another speaker and the\u00a0potential independent candidate, both talked about the Trump-led shift in the Republican Party in apocalyptic terms. But only Weld was running, and Weld had a light touch on every topic except for Trump. If Mike Pence led the GOP ticket, he said, he might not run. If Elizabeth Warren became the Democratic nominee, she was certainly equipped to be president. \"She's got a good head on her shoulders.\"</p><p>The big interview, at the same theater where \"Austin City Limits\" is filmed, was framed more seriously. Robert S. Mueller III had been an assistant in Weld's office when the future candidate was a U.S. attorney; Mueller, Weld said, was \"the straightest guy I'd ever met in my life.\" The crimes the president's associates has been convicted of were serious. Asked whether he would pardon Trump on the way out of office, Weld scoffed.</p><p>\"At that point, I would hope that enough truth had filtered through and people understood that the emperor didn't have new clothes on, so\u00a0people wouldn't take it,\" he said. How high were the stakes? \"It's not unthinkable that our democracy could perish.\"</p><p>             Bernie Sanders. He's holding his first South Carolina rally Thursday, in the same North Charleston gym that Kamala Harris filled on her first visit to the state.</p><p>             Elizabeth Warren. She's building a southern tour around her March 18 CNN town hall, visiting some states that no Democrat has stopped in yet.</p><p>             Jay Inslee. He's heading from SXSW to southern California, continuing his climate tour by visiting places damaged by forest fires.</p><p>             Kirsten Gillibrand. She's spending the weekend in California for fundraisers, once a pretty common way for Democrats to spend time\u00a0but made more controversial by the Democrats refusing to do it.</p><p>             John Hickenlooper. He became the first Democratic candidate to mock independent quasi-candidate Howard Schultz on Twitter (though Sanders had done so in a TV interview), after Schultz accused him of being afraid to defend capitalism.</p><p>             Juli\u00e1n Castro. He picked one of the first fights of the Democratic primary over reparations for the descendants of slaves, saying of Sanders\u00a0on CNN, and then at SXSW, that the senator had no problem \"cutting a check\" for other causes. Sanders surrogate Nina Turner quickly responded, on Twitter, to say that Castro \"exacerbate[d] the racial wealth gap\" at HUD.</p><p>             What it's called: Iron PAC</p><p>             What it is: A new project from Randy \"Ironstache\" Bryce, the unsuccessful Democratic nominee in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District last year.</p><p>             What it does: Leverages Bryce's donor list, which topped 450,000 by the end of the campaign, to help working-class candidates. \"We're not going to be going out to help any millionaires or billionaires - just people that work, whether you're a bartender, school bus driver, construction worker - somebody who works for a living,\" he told Daniel Marans in HuffPost.</p><p>             What it's spending: Nothing yet, but Bryce was one of the best fundraisers in the country, for a campaign that broke the traditional Democratic recruitment pattern. He raised nearly $9 million, much of it\u00a0off the strength of a viral campaign ad in which he offered to switch jobs with Paul Ryan, who ended up deciding not to seek reelection.</p><p>             What it's up against: The entire Democratic theory of who can win tough elections. Bryce, who polled well at some points in the campaign, fell back as Republicans pummeled him with ads about past DUIs and a brief lapse in his child support. A similar PAC, Krystal Ball's People's House Project, had a few star 2018 candidates who fell similarly short.</p><p>             The ACLU's big 2020 plans. One of the most important developments in liberal politics since 2016 was the transformation of the American Civil Liberties Union, which turned\u00a0a post-election flood of donations and membership applications into an expansive electoral strategy. In 2018, the ACLU helped pass a Florida amendment that is restoring voting rights to felons; last month Faiz Shakir, the operative who led the ACLU's political operation, became the campaign manager for Bernie Sanders.</p><p>With Shakir\u00a0gone, the ACLU is stepping up its campaign efforts. In an interview, ACLU President Anthony Romero said that the group will spend $20 million to $30 million on its largest election plan.</p><p>\"We want to make sure we turn out low-propensity voters,\" Romero said. \"Our membership includes some people who have been low-propensity voters, who skipped the last midterm or the last presidential election. We're going to exhort our members to engage, and engage other people, because this is not a time for anyone to stay on the sidelines.\"</p><p>In 2018, the ACLU's main \"people power\" project was the Florida initiative, which put it at the head of a nonpartisan coalition. (To pass, Florida constitutional amendments need support from more than 60 percent of voters.)\u00a0That sort of work would continue in 2020, Romero said, and the group was looking at Colorado, Arizona and Washington, all states with ballot initiative processes, to pass new \"criminal justice reform and voting rights\" measures.</p><p>But the ACLU wants\u00a0to play a real role in the Democratic primary, too. It will be holding candidate forums\u00a0and sending each candidate a questionnaire. Members of the ACLU in early states, Romero said, were encouraged to \"document what the responses are\" when candidates take questions on civil liberties, including abortion rights and prison reform. A new website for the \"Rights for All\" campaign encourages ACLU members to get candidates on the record on the toughest issues, and gives them some tips on how.</p><p>\"The risk in a field with a lot of progressives is that they all\u00a0begin to sound like each other and they mumble through the details,\" Romero said.\u00a0\"Our job is to make sure that we are able to articulate what [are] the distinct differences in how each candidate is looking at the issues. We want them to get precise.\"</p><p>             \"Presidential candidate Andrew Yang has a meme problem,\" by Russell Brandom          </p><p>How an only-in-2019 sequence of events, starting with an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, turned a presidential candidate focused on universal basic income into an ironic hero for the alt-right.</p><p>             \"As Bernie Sanders launches his second presidential campaign, big crowds but some doubt in early states,\" by Sean Sullivan          </p><p>On the trail, Sanders is attracting the largest crowds of any Democrat.

We then pick a threat from leftfield that banks, start-ups, and big tech companies are ignoring - perhaps at their peril.Tech giantsAs the WEF report notes, banks are becoming increasingly reliant on tech giants for services such as building customer interfaces, cloud storage, or even marketing. Amazon's cloud computing platform, for example, is being used by firms such as Carlyle, and its voice-activated system, 'Alexa', has been picked up by Capital One. Banks are using social media and Google as ad platforms to acquire new customers, but in other, product-driven ways too, with Brazil's Banco Bradesco letting its customers conduct their daily banking through social media apps.At the same time, many of these tech giants have begun to show an increasing interest in providing elements of financial services to their own retail customers. </p><p>Could this be a Trojan horse situation?Such change is being played out with particular intensity in China where WeChat, the dominant social media app with multiple utilities, is giving prominence to its own WePay payments product over incumbent financial services companies.Unlike a fintech firm, these technology companies wouldn't have to build a brand from scratch; they could hand-pick their points of entry into financial services and capitalise on financial institutions' dependence on them. With cyber security likely to become an increasing determinant of customer trust in financial services brands, the tech-driven reputation of companies like Google and Amazon could be a major advantage.For now, the relatively low return on equity offered by banks differs significantly from the highly scalable, operationally streamlined models of most tech companies. However the introduction of open banking[2] regulations could make it possible for tech companies to finally bring their high return on equity business models to bear on the financial services industry. Return on equity may also not be the primary objective for tech companies entering the financial services arena. Owning the end-to-end customer relationship provides unprecedented understanding of customer behaviour, wants and needs and would allow the tech giants to expand the range of services they provide in a very targeted and efficient fashion.There is another side of the coin however.Banking and financial services are not easy sectors to enter. They carry complex regulatory procedures that need to be managed nationally as well as internationally. They can be capital intensive, susceptible to large-scale frauds, and ultimately pose a major risk to the broader reputation of a multi-sector business. Cool, respected, tech execs might not be keen on their reputations being dragged through the mud should customers feel mistreated. These businesses might decide that the regulatory burden of entering the market is just too heavy to bear.Whilst new open data initiatives should lower some of these barriers to entry, it is not a certainty that tech giants will shift their gaze toward financial services.Start-upsStart-ups have gained huge amounts of consumer trust and loyalty within early-adopter networks by providing more transparent and user-friendly services than those of many of the banks. If these trusted start-ups broaden their offerings to mimic the holistic nature of banks, they could leverage their hard-won reputations and entice customers away from their banks. TransferWise, for example, might be an app for transferring money abroad, but you only have to read their job descriptions[3] to see that they have their eye on a bigger prize. They claim their goal is to be the UK's most popular, most loved and most trusted financial brand.But it's a tough slog scaling to be a major, mass-market business. The report from WEF and Deloitte points out that start-ups did not grab as much market share this year as expected. Acquiring customers for traditional financial services products is hard, and convincing them to switch is even harder. Historically, persuading customers to switch over has been a sticking point, even within the industry, with banks often resorting to buying their customers with expensive inducements. Whilst the early-adopter audience might love a better price and user experience, the general public aren't sure if they can trust unknown brands, and are maybe happy to pay a little more to stick with what they know.The old adage is that companies need to create a 10x improvement in services for people to switch. Early adopters might move for less, but the bar is pretty high when it comes to convincing mass-market consumers to change their deep-rooted behaviours. Creating a 10x better experience in banking will not be as easy as some start-up founders like to claim.A leftfield threatDespite all the buzz around tech giants and start-ups, there is another threat to banks that has been conspicuously absent from this debate.Price comparison sites.These companies have done a lot of the hard work already. Brands like Compare The Market and Moneysupermarket have invested heavily in building a reputation amongst the general public. They've gathered the regulatory expertise to navigate the complex financial services landscape. And they've developed partnerships with a huge range of product providers.Price is only one reason why customers might choose a financial services product however, and price comparison websites would have to learn how to create the right products, brand and user experience to win the day. Price alone might not be enough.\u00a0German company Raisin's recent acquisition of Manchester-based PBF solutions suggests they might be preparing to make the move from intelligent price comparison website to something closer to a banking service in the UK.In the open banking universe, price comparison sites could be uniquely positioned to take advantage of increased competition as they gain further access to valuable customer data. In the future, the Moneysupermarkets of the world could own the customer relationship and sit in front of the banks, with the bank relegated to something akin to a financial services utility.Watch this space for meerkats.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

For the tech giant's supporters it was recognition of how awesomely successful it has become; for its detractors, it is just another reminder of the power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Founded by the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos, Amazon has grown with not one but two businesses that now reach across the globe with mighty muscle.</p><p>The first business, online retail, surely reaches into every home. The second, Amazon Web Services, is the rapidly expanding cloud computing services business, which incredibly is now the bigger driver of its free cash flow. Indeed, well over half of the trillion-dollar value of Amazon is AWS.</p><p>All of this makes Amazon a target. And that's one reason why a new research report by Citi in the US proposes splitting Amazon into separate businesses, AWS and retail, to avoid anti-trust scrutiny and potentially damaging intervention. \"There has been greater noise of late regarding the desire to investigate and potentially regulate the company,\" the report's author, Citi's senior internet analyst Mark May, argues. \"By separating the retail and AWS businesses, Amazon could minimise or avoid the risk of increased regulatory pressure.\" Citi sees more pros than cons to splitting Amazon; they include creating a purer play for investors, better aligning incentives for management and minimising any conflicts of interest.</p><p>There's no doubt Amazon is in the crosshairs of regulators in the US, in Europe and in Australia, with ACCC chief Rod Sim's review into FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) big tech.</p><p>What is more, no one seems to dislike Amazon more than Donald Trump, who has made Jeff Bezos his nemesis. Is nemesis too strong? No. The war of words between these two world leaders has been raging for almost three years, and is worthy of a Marvel comic. Even before he was elected, Trump tweeted with typical invective that Amazon shares would crash if it paid its fair share in taxes. The tweet prompted Bezos to return fire, offering up a new hashtag \"#sendDonaldtospace\".</p><p>Why does Trump hate Amazon so much? Yes it's taxes, but in the eyes of the President, it's also screwing the US Postal Service that employs good Americans.</p><p>Worst of all, Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post which Donald Trump claims is a lobbying toy for the Amazon chief, being used to smear him with fake news. \u00e2\u20ac\u0192Mark May's idea follows last week's short-listing of 20 final cities for Amazon's second headquarters. It's hotly contested because of the $5 billion in Amazon investment and 50,000 jobs that will come with it. A hot favourite is Washington DC, not far from the White House.</p><p>Bezos was quizzed by the media about the unrelenting presidential attacks, including on his Washington Post.</p><p>\"It is really dangerous to demonise the media,\" he said. \"It is dangerous to call the media lowlifes, it is dangerous to say that they are the enemy of the people.\" And he implied that, perhaps unlike the President, the media would be just fine.</p><p>Amazon's HQ2 is another reason for an Amazon split. It's likely that Citi's research resonated enough on Wall Street to help pull Amazon's stock back off the trillion-dollar valuation, although the news on Monday that the tech giant was itself investigating possible leaks of confidential data by staff, accepting bribes from sellers on the website, might have made a dent too.</p><p>Amazon is an amazing business as its name implies.

The office is expected to issue an enforcement notice by the end of this month - Doherty has said the department will appeal against this.</p><p>The DPC is carrying out two further investigations into the department. Sources say both are likely to lead to more negative findings.</p><p>S</p><p>One is the second module of the public services card inquiry that is examining the data kept by the department in relation to the card, including whether officials are processing biometric data on each cardholder. Biometrics refers to an individual's body measurements.</p><p>The department says each card contains a photograph, but insists that no biometric data is stored. It uses facialmatching software and a database to check for fraudulent duplicate claimants and says this is kept to its \"own secure data centres\".</p><p>Separately, the department is under investigation over allegations that it interfered with the independence of its own data protection officer, when it changed an official online data declaration to remove a reference to processing biometric data. The office has issued the department with a draft report indicating that it believes there was a breach of data protection rules through the interference with its data protection officer. The commissioner is considering the department's response.</p><p>Some data protection officials in Europe are concerned that the DPC's high-profile actions against the Irish government may distract the regulator from investigations into Facebook and Google.</p><p>Graham Doyle, the DPC's head of communications, said the commission was experienced at running multiple investigations and had dedicated teams working on the big-tech investigations and public sector cases.</p><p>\"We have grown significantly since 2014, when we had about 30 staff compared with the 140 today,\" said Doyle. \"However, this expansion must continue to ensure we can continue to regulate effectively.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-153161270</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3P-VNV1-DYTY-C40Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"390\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 22, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The invitation-only event, called the Summit, featured George W. Bush, Mark Cuban and Aerosmith.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it was supposed to be all about AT&amp;T\u2019s business customers. They may feel overlooked as AT&amp;T pushes deeper into entertainment and focuses on winning approval to buy Time Warner.</p><p>That pending combination could face regulatory resistance, but AT&amp;T still brought in the iron throne from the set of Game of Thrones . It also recruited CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper to lead a keynote with three CEOs.</p><p>Show business is clearly part of the event business, and Cooper helped drive home one of the themes of the conference.</p><p>\u201cReady or not, destruction is coming for everyone in this room, including the news business,\u201d Cooper told the crowd in the large ballroom of the Gaylord Texan. \u201cAnd it\u2019s already here.\u201d</p><p>He promptly headed off what could have been an awkward moment for a top journalist interviewing a prospective employer. With AT&amp;T hopefully taking over CNN, he said, maybe he could get a pair of the AT&amp;T socks that executive Thaddeus Arroyo was wearing on-stage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good branding,\u201d Anderson said, and the audience laughed.</p><p>Everyone seemed to get the joke. The well-orchestrated production was part of a larger marketing dance \u2014 and it was effective, if obvious.</p><p>The conference, with ticket prices of $2,495, allowed clients to learn about the latest trends and network with potential partners. It also gave AT&amp;T a chance to boost its reputation with about 1,500 business customers, including 300 top executives.</p><p>Increasingly, AT&amp;T measures itself against the country\u2019s tech leaders, and it competes against them for talent and business. Microsoft, Cisco and others have been holding big tech confabs for years, so AT&amp;T asked some outside advisers about launching a flagship conference.</p><p>\u201cThey said you\u2019re big enough to pull off your own show,\u201d John Donovan, CEO of AT&amp;T Communications, said in an interview. He wanted to wow people so they\u2019d see that AT&amp;T was an elite tech company, he said.</p><p>It worked, according to one analyst: \u201cTo see a service provider do a show like this and see the attendance is really impressive,\u201d said Courtney Munroe, vice president of Worldwide Telecommunications Research.</p><p>Software-driven</p><p>AT&amp;T has a history of innovation, and it\u2019s touting a recent move into software-driven networks. They add speed, capacity, flexibility and cost-savings, and they are crucial to AT&amp;T\u2019s long-term strategy.</p><p>By the end of the year, over half of AT&amp;T\u2019s networks will be software-driven and virtualized, and the goal is to be at 75 percent by 2020, the company said. That will help AT&amp;T meet the surging demand for data and video from businesses as well as consumers.</p><p>AT&amp;T\u2019s business solutions segment, often called the enterprise business, accounted for over 40 percent of revenue in the third quarter and 70 percent of operating profit. It\u2019s also a growth area.</p><p>From 2014 to 2016, revenue in AT&amp;T\u2019s most advanced business services increased by over $2 billion, a gain of 22 percent. And the growth has been even faster in connected devices, which include connected cars and wireless devices in retailing, health care and other industries.</p><p>At the end of September, AT&amp;T had almost 36 million connected devices on its network. That\u2019s up from 14 million in 2012, and AT&amp;T added 6.6 million connected devices in the last 12 months. That\u2019s a proxy for AT&amp;T\u2019s progress in the so-called internet of things. Connected devices send signals to the cloud and give companies real-time insights into their assets.</p><p>Red Bull plans to put the devices on 1 million refrigerated coolers in bars and stores. The company can track shopper traffic and temperature changes in the units, and use the information to schedule worker visits.</p><p>AT&amp;T is using connected devices to track its fleet of over 80,000 vehicles. In the next five years, it expects to save over $40 million through improved efficiency.</p><p>5G boost</p><p>Many digital advances are in the pipeline, and they\u2019re expected to be unleashed as faster 5G service becomes more widely available. Experts talked about self-driving cars, drones and remote-controlled robots, along with more responsive streetlights and traffic signals.</p><p>While the digital shift offers great potential for new business markets, companies must deal with rising security threats, talent shortages and fast-growing competitors that are disrupting industries.</p><p>Meg Whitman, who once led eBay and helped turn around Hewlett Packard Enterprise, compared the changes from digital technology to the impact of mainframe computers decades ago.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s happening much faster,\u201d she told the audience.</p><p>HP was broken into four companies so it could respond better, she said. Her advice to companies: Break the digital transformation into pieces, starting with improving the employee experience. Then build quickly from there.</p><p>Doug Parker, CEO of American Airlines, reminded everyone that \u201cour physical product can\u2019t be digitized,\u201d and if someone\u2019s working on that, he said, he hopes they slow down.</p><p>But technology is expanding rapidly at American. He said travelers can now be alerted about lost luggage before they go to the carousel \u2014 and can use their phone to ship the bag to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cMakes me almost wanna lose it,\u201d Anderson said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Parker said, as the crowd laughed again. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t find \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Twitter: @mitchschnurman</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DALNWS-59658630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DALNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PX5-NWM1-JBKB-W42Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11802</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"926\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS</copyright><publicationName>THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15041\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>1 EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 5, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0008RSB</classCode><className>AT &amp;

According to the daily, longtime AT...xecutive John Stankey would be placed in charge of the Time Warner business while <person><nameText>Randall Stephenson, </nameText></person>the current chairman and chief executive at AT...would keep the title of chairman of the merged entity. </p><p>Asked about the report, AT...aid no decisions have been finalized on the management structure of the group after the merger, which remains subject to regulatory approval. AT...aid Stephenson \"will remain chairman[1] and chief executive officer[2] of AT...fter we close the Time Warner deal.\" The tie-up still faces considerable opposition from some lawmakers and consumer groups, who contend it would give too much control to a single entity in the field of broadband and raise potential conflicts of interest for online services. President Donald Trump said during his 2016 campaign that he opposed the pending merger, which was announced in October. But he has been mum on it since the election. Some analysts argue, however, that the deal would create an entity sizeable enough to compete with tech industry giants who are now the \"gatekeepers\" for content on the internet, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook.

But the move would also seem to offer tacit approval for a hard-to-breed strain of media-industry M&amp;A.For decades,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/scripps-discovery-viacom-media-merger-advertising-1202499761/\">as technology giants have gained more scale, content companies have hoped to rival them.</url> That's why Discovery Communications recently snatched up Scripps Networks, why Lionsgate and Starz merged their assets; and why Shari Redstone has pushed not once but twice for the two companies her family controls -\u00a0\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/t/cbs/\">CBS</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/t/viacom/\">Viacom</url> - to join anew what her father, Sumner Redstone, split apart in 2006. Now, there's a new path: marrying content with technology.The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/att-time-warner-stocks-doj-antitrust-ruling-1202843216/\">AT&amp;T</url> merger suggests regulators won't stand in the way of companies that want to combine producers of intellectual properties like the DC Comics superheroes, CNN news, Samantha Bee's comedy and \"Game of Thrones\" with a company better able to distribute it through broadband and digital channels - and use data and targeting technology to wring more out of the process. </p><p>The argument, of course, is that many other companies that do this very thing already exists, whether they be Google's YouTube or Amazon's Prime video service.Already, <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/att-advertising-time-warner-kirk-mcdonald-1202611333/\">AT&amp;T has launched an advertising and analytics unit</url> led by Brian Lesser, formerly the chief executive of the North American operations of WPP's large GroupM consortium of media-buying agencies.. Lesser reports directly to AT&amp;T Chairman and Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, and is charged with building and leading \"an advertising and analytics business using the company's unique customer data and growing content assets.\" In the past, Stephenson has articulated a strategy to \"build an automated advertising platform that can do for premium video and TV advertising what the search and social media companies have done for digital advertising.\"To be sure, the idea of mixing content and distribution has been tried before. Comcast took over a controlling interest in NBCUniversal from General Electric in 2011 for cash and assets valued at $13.75 billion (and then bought the rest of the company in 2013). But there have been limits. When Comcast tried to expand its influence with a purchase of Time Warner Cable, the Department of Justice balked, and the Philadelphia cable giant backed down.Would it have to do so today? The approval for AT&amp;T suggests that these marriages of technology and content might have a new chance. After all, given a clear consumer desire for so-called \"skinny bundles,\" eroding linear-TV viewership and softer advertiser demand for cable, it's clear more companies involved with the creation or distribution of content need greater scale.There are many potential candidates. Might Charter Communications want to add content assets to its distribution power, which was widened by its acquisition of Time Warner Cable in May 2016 for approximately $65 billion? Might Verizon want to add other types of content to its ranks after it formed its Oath unit out of its acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo (the company's recent decision to name a technology-focused executive as CEO suggests that it sees its future more strongly in other lines of business). Comcast, which is likely to make a rival bid for the 21st\u00a0Century Fox assets slated to be sold to Walt Disney Co., has made no secret of its growing desire for more scale.And then there are the content players, many of whom seem smaller every time a new merger involving the tech giants takes place.\u00a0\u00a0Despite its recent purchase of Scripps, Discovery Inc. could make sense for a distributor - or it could be rolled up with other companies that are controlled to various degrees by media executive John Malone, who has stakes in both Lionsgate and Discovery. Many analysts see both       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/global/viacom-paramount-network-uk-1202837211/\">Viacom</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/beth-behrs-the-neighborhood-cbs-1202841494/\">CBS</url> as too small to exist independently for much longer. Could they rethink a merger or seek an end game elsewhere?\u00a0AMC Networks, which distributes \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Better Call Saul,\" could also help the aims of a larger player.The Comcast-NBCU tie-up seems to prove the value of getting bigger. Since buying that minority stake in NBCU from General Electric, Comcast has become an impossible-to-ignore presence. It now controls a bevy of must-see properties, including U.S. broadcasts of the Olympics; \"Sunday Night Football\"; and \"This Is Us.\" It has extended its reach into the world of sports rights and kids' programming. In TV's 2017 upfront\" marketplace for advance advertising sales, the company secured a little under $6.5 billion in ad commitments, compared with around $6 billion in 2016.Related stories      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/att-time-warner-stocks-doj-antitrust-ruling-1202843216/\">Time Warner Stock Jumps, AT&amp;T Falls After Ruling Clears Path to Merger</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/time-warner-att-employees-judge-decision-1202842453/\">AT&amp;T-Time Warner Merger: Insiders Await Judge's Ruling With Nervous Anticipation After Long Period of Limbo</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/beth-behrs-the-neighborhood-cbs-1202841494/\">Beth Behrs Joins 'The Neighborhood' at CBS in Show's Second Major Recasting</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VARETY-1202843249</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VARTY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJ7-72R1-JC3V-61T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Variety</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26328\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 12, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001VM7</classCode><className>VIACOM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002925</classCode><className>DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00038XO</classCode><className>DC ENTERTAINMENT INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002H12</classCode><className>TIME WARNER CABLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

AT&amp;T had underestimated the opposition it would face from government regulators and from competitors who feared what would become of the highly competitive wireless industry if the merger went through. The deal would have created the nation's largest carrier.</p><p>AT&amp;T's decision to scrap its merger plan leaves T-Mobilein limbo. T-MobileUSA's parent, Deutsche Telekom, is getting <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2011/12/details-of-breakup-fee-in-t-mobile-att.html\">$3 billion in cash by the end of the year</url>. And T-MobileUSA will get what Deutsche Telekomcalls a \"large package of advanced wireless solutions spectrum\" and a seven-year national roaming agreement that will allow T-Mobileto bring faster service to Seattle and other big cities.</p><p>The deal gives T-Mobilemore time to figure out its future, including upgrading its network and finding a new partner.</p><p>Microsoftsays that <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2011/12/microsoft-novell-lacks-evidence.html\">Novell Inc. has insufficient evidence</url> to reasonably support its antitrust lawsuit against the Redmond software giant now that a jury has failed to reach a verdict in the case.</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsofthas used the annual Consumer Electronics Show as a platform for CEO Steve Ballmer to showcase his company's latest hardware and software offerings.</p><p>But times are changing, and apparently Ballmer and Microsoftno longer need the exposure from the big tech trade show that it has dominated in the past with presentations and exhibits. Microsoft<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2011/12/microsoft-says-upcoming-ces-its-last.html\">will make the upcoming 2012 CES show its last</url> because it is relying more heavily on its own marketing campaigns and retail stores to reach its customers.</p><p>Here are a few things I am catching up on this week:</p><p>The Seattle Mariners are valued at $641 million, according to a Seattle divorce trial judge handling the case of Mariners minority owner Chris Larson, who made his fortune as a programmer at Microsoft</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/mariners/2016430165_larson07.html\">The Seattle Times reports</url> that based on the $593 million sale of the Texas Rangers and $610 million sale of the Houston Astros this year, King Count Superior Court Judge William Downing estimated the Mariners were worth $641 million, considerably higher than the $449 million estimate by Forbes earlier this year.</p><p>Amazon's Lovefilm division and Sony Pictures Television<url normalizedValue=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1641803&amp;highlight=\">inked a content arrangement</url> giving Lovefilm members in the UK exclusive streaming access to new and upcoming Sony Pictures titles like \"The Social Network\" and \"Salt.\"</p><p>The deal between Lovefilm and Sony is the latest in a series of content deals in the UK.
