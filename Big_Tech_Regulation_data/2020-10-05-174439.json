A supposedly staid organization like INET is broadcasting that rule by our new tech overlords is less than benign. Quite a change in their image in a fairly short time. By Lynn Parramore, Senior Research Analyst at the Institute for New Economic Thinking. </p><p>Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website[1] Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin famously launched their search engine with the mantra: 'Don't Be Evil.' Yet soon enough, their ambitions would lead them to talk publicly about doing good while stealthily refining business models based on exploiting, deceiving, and spying on their fellow humans. Maybe they harbored an adolescent notion of being good. As if nice intentions were enough - like their early aim to steer clear of ad-based business models \u2014 without the responsibility, wisdom, and judgment that guide them to reality. Or maybe they had soaked up too much of the Ayn Rand-ethos of the '80s. In any case, Page and Brin tossed their youthful idealism overboard to make superyacht-loads of money grabbing your personal data to sell to the highest advertising bidder. Together with other once-idealistic Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, they created gigantic, Gilded Age-style companies that can bully or buy off anyone who stands in their way, sucking up public resources and shredding the democratic fabric as they go. Page and Brin, who recently stepped down[2] from Google, are now the sixth and seventh richest people in the world. Amid a rising public outcry against Big Tech's alarming surveillance practices, monopolistic business practices, and growing threats to democracy, America needs guidance on how to reign in these behemoths. Enter the clear-eyed Financial Times columnist Rana Foroohar, who investigates how we ended up in this mess and proposes some practical ways to get back on track. In the following conversation, she discusses her penetrating new book, Don't be Evil: How Big Tech Betrayed Its Founding Principles \u2014 and All of Us[3], with the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Lynn Parramore: As global business correspondent, you write on a wide array of topics for the Financial Times. Why a book-length dive on this particular subject at this moment?  Rana Foroohar: Two things. First, I was trolling for some focus in terms of where to throw my reporting energy, and I came across an amazing McKinsey Global Institute stat showing that 80 percent of corporate value was being held by just 10 percent of firms - those with the most IP [networking software] and data. Most were big tech companies, like the FAANGs[4] [Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google]. At the same time, I came home one day and opened a credit card bill and started scrolling down it and noticed all these tiny charges in increments of $1.99, 3 bucks, etc. I noticed they were all from the App store. At first, I thought I'd been hacked, but it turns out that my 10-year-old son had become addicted to an online soccer game and racked up all these charges in 'in app' purchases. I was horrified as a mother, but fascinated as a journalist, and felt I needed to learn all about this insidious business model. LP: You mention that Silicon Valley was heavily influenced by 60s counterculture and that many people involved in its rise started out wanting world a better place for everyone. How did the tune go from 'We are the World' to 'Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap'? RF: I think that over the decades, the 'connect the world' ethos morphed from something beautiful into something that was really just about supra-national companies offshoring capital, data, and profits to wherever they could. Many of the people running the platform tech firms today are very young; they came of age in the 80s when you had a neoliberal ethos, a greed is good culture, and a sense that the only thing that the government can do is cut taxes. They don't think about the largest public/private ecosystem, or citizens - only consumers. That's a larger shift in the economy and society of course, but Big Tech represents it's apex - if capital can fly 35,000 feet over the problems of the nation state, data has been able go even further and faster. LP: We're used to throwing around the word 'big' in association with certain industries: Big Ag, Big Pharma, etc. But the bigness of Big Tech feels like something new. You mention, for example, that the market capitalizations of the FAANG companies is bigger than the economy of France. What does this bigness mean to the rest of the economy?  RF: Platform companies enjoy a super-star effect to the nth degree. Their model has been to move fast, break things, ring fence as much data as possible and then use that position to establish monopoly power. That was always the aim, and the possibility with such firms - you can go back to economists like Hal Varian[5] and look at their early writings and see that data economists understood that potential. So, that's one reason that I don't buy it when tech titans come to Capitol Hill to testify and say 'oh, we had no idea.' Of course you did. That was the plan - to become the operating system for people's lives, in every aspect of their lives. LP: The issues surrounding Big Tech are incredibly complex. What is something you learned while writing this book that you might not have been aware of or fully understood before?  RF: Per my point above, one thing that really amazed me was reading the first academic paper on search that Larry Page and Sergei Brin did while they were grad students at Stanford. It has a section in the appendix that admits that if you try to monetize a search engine via targeted advertising, as Google today does, you'll likely end up in a position where the interests of the users and the advertisers aren't in alignment. Which is, of course, exactly where we are today. In the beginning, the pair considered targeted advertising 'evil,' but as they got closer to IPO (and folks like former chair and CEO Eric Schmidt came into the picture) they loosened those principles. LP: How might we realign the interests of tech firms and interests of customers and citizens? Where do you stand on breaking these companies up v. regulating them more effectively?  RF: I would like to see 4 things - first, public data banks in which democratically elected governments can decide which companies and which parts of the public sector get access to consider data and under what terms (rather like what Toronto is doing with the Google Sidewalk project). Data being considered a resource of value, like labor, with an appropriate portion of the corporate value extracted from it going back to the individual (this might be done via a sovereign wealth fund for data, or a digital dividend program - both are being considered in California). I think network and commerce should be separated, a la the 19th century railroad model or bank holding company model - a firm like Amazon, for example, shouldn't be able to own the entire ecommerce network, and compete against its own clients in commerce (particularly with no algorithmic transparency). And finally, we need a digital bill of rights that enshrines basic civil liberties in the digital space, and an FDA of technology to study the cognitive effects and regulate digital tech properly.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/12/evil-is-baked-into-big-techs-business-plan-now-what.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/12/evil-is-baked-into-big-techs-business-plan-now-what.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Banana republic[6], Free markets and their discontents[7], Guest Post[8], Legal[9], Regulations and regulators[10], Social policy[11], Surveillance state[12], Technology and innovation[13], The dismal science[14] on December 14, 2019[15] by Yves Smith[16].

Last year, a committee headed by Justice B.N. Srikrishna proposed a data protection bill, which is still under consultation with multiple stakeholders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As hundreds of millions of Indians come online with budget smartphones and the world's lowest mobile data rates, Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to data as the \"new gold\" at the recent Howdy Modi event in Houston. US President Donald Trump, on his part, hailed Indian Americans for helping revolutionize technology to improve lives around the world.</p><p>And Google CEO Sundar Pichai pitched in by acknowledging concerns over privacy while pointing out the need to balance that with the benefits of a shared internet.</p><p>The big question is, 'Whose data is it, anyway?' What if tech companies were forced to compensate customers for using their data to derive profits?</p><p>Entrepreneurs and investors are thinking of new paradigms beyond government regulation.</p><p>Tim Berners-Lee, for example, wants to restore the original intent of his creation-the World Wide Web, which he feels big tech companies have taken over. His startup Inrupt is creating virtual personal online data stores (PODs) where users can \"create, manage and secure\" their data. They can then trade their data for services.PRIVACY 3.0</p><p>In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has created a new entity called \"account aggregator\", backed by technocrat Nandan Nilekani who was also behind Aadhaar and UPI. Approved account aggregators will act as intermediaries between companies seeking customer data and institutions like banks that can provide the data.</p><p>Aggregators will take consent of customers on what data can be shared for how long and for what purpose. The framework will make it easier for customers and small businesses to access their financial data from multiple sources for things like access to credit.</p><p>Currently, although tech companies routinely take a user's consent to access their data-such as identity or location, before providing a product or service, it's so convoluted that most people have to acquiesce blindly. Companies harvest all the data they can and use it in ways that customers can't even imagine. New frameworks aim to hand control back to users.</p><p>Entrepreneurs and investors are also thinking of ways in which privacy can evolve from just ticking the boxes for compliance.</p><p>\"Privacy 2.0 should focus on trust,\" says Govind Shivkumar, principal at Omidyar Network India. \"If consumers begin to trust some players more than others, companies will want that as a differentiating factor and competitive advantage.\"</p><p>This would make privacy a strategic priority instead of a compliance headache.</p><p>The trust-based framework would eventually evolve into Privacy 3.0 where it would be embedded into businesses.</p><p>An Omidyar Network India and Monitor Deloitte India paper that Shivkumar helped prepare sees the emergence of new business models, including personal data stores like Tim Berners-Lee envisages, tools for users to manage their preferences, and so on.</p><p>There would also be new B2B (business-to-business) models such as privacy services for enterprises, some of which could be artificial intelligence-led. Privacy certification agencies would come up to close the loop.</p><p>\"We're looking at investment opportunities in startups across all three levels of privacy, from compliance to trust and Privacy 3.0 models,\" says Shivkumar.</p><p>\"Our notion of privacy is rooted in individuals' control over what they share and how they manage their lives on digital platforms,\" adds Sushant Kumar of Omidyar Network India, who works on \"responsible tech investments.\"AI WORLD</p><p>What complicates it is that technologies are fast-evolving, especially with the application of AI in virtually every sphere. \"Technology should be publicly managed,\" says Anupam Guha, assistant professor at Centre for Policy Studies, IIT Bombay. \"But it can't be a simplistic state-controlled thing because you can't trust the state.\"</p><p>His view is that public or community-led models, which are pro-people rather than pro-corporate or pro-state, can form. \"If you want to forestall the problems we're seeing with monopolies, privacy or job losses from automation, you can choose to incentivise models that produce better results for the common man.\"</p><p>Proclaiming that data is the \"new oil\" or \"new gold\" suggests wealth creation. The question is for whom wealth is being created. Public discourse is veering towards a consumer-centric view.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

And also with us is Yves Bonzon, Bank Julius Baer co-CIO.    </p><p>      Mr. Nowotny, so delighted to have you with us on set.  Thank you for joining us.  So my first question to you is, should the ECB be downsizing more quickly, given the state of the Eurozone economy, even though inflation is still below target?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOWOTNY</emphasis>:  Well, we have just made a decision last week.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  You have?  Was it the right one?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOWOTNY</emphasis>:  Yes, I think it is the right one.  And we are having the volume we are buying starting this January of next -- next year for nine months.  This reflects that we see that the economy is improving substantially.  But we're not yet there where we want to be.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  So you're not yet there, but do you think that there should be a more clear end date set for the stimulus or you think it's better to keep that open-ended at this point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOWOTNY</emphasis>:  Frankly speaking, there had been a discussion about -- about this.  There was a clear majority few that one should be flexible, which doesn't mean in my view that we have to go on forever. I think at some time, there will be, of course, reducing and then some kind of -- of an end date.  But it's too early now to have this discussion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  But the issue of scarcity is a big one there, do you see any risk of scarcity in the bonds that you're buying?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOWOTNY</emphasis>:  Not really because we are buying quite a strong variety of -- of bonds, not only government bonds, also from the private -- from the private sector.  We -- we -- we look the risk directly at this.  So we are aware that this something that we have to be careful. But we have seen and -- in fact, we have had this discussion quite many times before (inaudible) I have nothing to buy any longer.  We managed to do this.  And I'm pretty sure at this lower -- at this lower volume that we have decided.  We will be able to fulfil our task.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  With reinvestment as well, do you see this as in some way upsetting the downsizing of stimulus?  Or at least sort of moderating it somewhat?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOWOTNY</emphasis>:  We have declared last week that we have two aspects that are important, the one is the flows, this -- this what they're buying, but increasingly, it is also the stock.  So that means we have, of course, quite a strong and increasing stock.  And we have decided that we will reinvest these bonds when they become due.  So this does have an (inaudible) effect on the markets.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  How much could those reinvestments be?  Could you put a number on it?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOWOTNY</emphasis>:  We will give numbers, but it's too early to tell now.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  In your view, do you have any estimation of -- of -- of what you personally   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOWOTNY</emphasis>:  It is, it is.  It will be quite a substantial number.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Now, I did mention inflation earlier, the fact that it continues to disappoint.  And this, of course, is the key thing that the ECB is targeting.  This is a problem facing central bankers globally, but specifically in the Eurozone, why do you think we're not seeing inflation picking up?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOWOTNY</emphasis>:  Well, in fact, one has to be quite honest.  For next -- for next year, for 2018, our forecasts are that we have even a lower inflation rate than we have 2017.  This is mainly due to effects from the energy policy side.  Our core inflation, that means inflation without energy, is going up.  And here we have kind of a steady development towards high inflation rate in the -- in the range that we want to achieve.  So I think we -- we are moving in the right direction.  But we have to observe these things going on next year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes.  I mean, the ECB as a whole doesn't see inflation returning to target before the end of 2019, when do you see it getting to that target, and what's going to drive it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOWOTNY</emphasis>:  I think that inflation rates in 2018 might be higher than anticipated now because what we see is that energy prices are moving up.  So this is one element with regards to core inflation. For core inflation, the most important element are wage developments. Here we have had, not only in Europe but also in the U.S., a rather strange development that it takes a long time for wages to react to the lower unemployment.  So this is the famous Phillips curve conundrum that -- that we have.  But I think this is just a matter of lags.  So after some time, wages will keep up.  If we look at the developments just for instance in Germany, where we have just now wage negotiations wages that are quite substantial (inaudible), we will have the same also in my country in Austria.  </p><p>      So I think with -- I'm not sure that these are really, let's say, structural changes, that it might just mean that it takes longer for wages to react to lower unemployment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  OK.  So you do see that wage growth coming at some point, but we do hear this from a lot of people that it's coming, that it's coming, but then we're not there yet.  So I'm wondering, is the ECB's mandate sits a purpose?  Because there's been a lot of discussion about whether that inflation target, not just for the ECB but in general with central banks should actually be modified somewhat.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOWOTNY</emphasis>:  I think central banks should be very, very cautious in modifying their targets.  This is also a matter of long-term credibility.  On the other hand, we should not reduce this to say it has to be exactly 1.9.  So we said from the start on that one has to see this as a medium-term perspective.  So I think the most important element is to see what is the direction.  And I think the direction is going the right way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Well, Mr. Nowotny, visiting our London studios here to meet with Bloomberg News, we're thrilled that he's with us today on \"Bloomberg Surveillance.\"  Yves Bonzon with us with Julius Baer.  We will continue our discussion, and I really want to talk about the challenges of investment going forward into 2018.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yves Bonzon, Bank Julius Baer CIO, is still with us. Yves, we're seeing sterling steady today after the drop yesterday, that dovish hike from the BOE.  Just very simply, where do you see the rate hike path going in 2018?  The market pushed back its expectations after the decision in the press conference from Mark Carney.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BONZON</emphasis>:  I think there was a clear desire by the central banks to reassure everyone that this is not the beginning of a hard and fast, I think, campaign.  The central bank is struggling to explain the wage puzzle, absence of wage growth despite of significant tightening of the labor market.  And there's so much uncertainty going on in this country with the Brexit negotiation process being still quite unclear. I think it's prudent for the central banks to actually kind of reload the monetary gun, meaning, by hiking interest rates a little bit, they are making room for accommodation, losing -- if needed, down the road, if eventually worse comes to worst with regards to the Brexit impact.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes.  And speaking of Brexit, you know, one way that could have interpreted that press conference was that the Bank of England was really tying its forward guidance to Brexit in a way, but of course, that's one of the most uncertain things here.  So is there any point in the forward guidance?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BONZON</emphasis>:  Well, I guess, they are very pragmatic, you know.  I think they are very concerned about communicating well and not surprising investors.  And I think it's fair to mention that Brexit is an important unknown, non-unknown but unknown.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes.  But going back to the wage puzzle then, so one thing that people have said to me is, look, this is about supply side deterioration, and that's where we might eventually get that upward pressure on wages, the Bank of England has used that argument as well itself.  Not everyone is convinced by that, though, are you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BONZON</emphasis>:  I'm not actually because I think we have an absence of wage pressure across the skill set spectrum, you know, from low skill and medium skill to even higher skill labor.  It's a combination of several things.  Technology trends, you know, replacing labor, and sometime labor of the quite skilled kind with automated processes.  In -- in the meantime, at the lower end of the skill spectrum, if you think about industry like retailing, these companies are so -- under so much margin pressure, they don't have much room to increase wages actually.  So I think the pricing power on the labor side in spite of a relatively tight labor market, is not that great.  </p><p>      Furthermore, I understand social benefit access have been tightened in the U.K., so the -- the relative competition of social benefits, as opposed to low wages, you know, is also (inaudible).  So there are so many factor at work, including the gig economy.  It's very hard to predict what will happen with wage growth.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yves, I want to go to one of the things of the week that maybe was (inaudible) under the economics, finance, and investment that we do.  And that was a remarkable idea of the tech troops showing up at -- in Washington, putting their hands up and testifying and all that.  In the summary of -- of this was the power of the European Union to maybe rein in American tech might.  I mean, I thought there was a real sea change here.  How does it look the prism of Julius Baer as the E.U. tries to regulate the new technology we're all dealing with?  Is that a good thing, and will -- will it increase, will Brussels' effort increase in the coming years?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BONZON</emphasis>:  There's a very clear and a strong desire by the European Union to intervene in these sectors, on these big tech platforms. They're divided in two group in the world today.  You have basically China, which has ringfenced its market and allowed for the development of local giants, and you have the American giants that have invaded the world ex-China.  One of the problems, of course, is also in a globalized world the taxation of corporate profits.  There seems to be a growing effort in the European Union to find a way to tax these tech platforms.  So I think the pressure, the regulatory pressure on them will keep on increasing, but it's a slow process.  You see in the European Union, they are struggling to agree because some countries actually benefit from these companies.  So it's a -- it's a very long process, I think, but definitely pressure is mounting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  But this is really fascinating, folks, and particularly the idea of a European model of entrepreneurship and technology versus an Anglo-American model.  Which will win out, Yves, five years out?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BONZON</emphasis>:  It's hard to say on the five-year ...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Agreed, agreed, agreed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BONZON</emphasis>:  ... on a five-year view who's going to win that, so ...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  It's Friday.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BONZON</emphasis>:  That -- that the -- the U.S. technology platform has such a head start to begin with.  When you account for the networking effect, you know, the amount of users that they have managed to gather, give them a head start that which will be hard to overcome. So I think most -- most likely, the -- the main risk for them is regulatory action also on the U.S. side.  We have all these discussions with regards to what happened during the election.  So again, there -- there -- there is mounting pressure.  But on the other end, this is a very strategic industry the United States.  And I don't want -- I don't think they want to damage their chances.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yves, I want to ask you about another piece of regulation, which is PSD2.  We talked a lot about MiFID II, but one thing about PSD2 and Europe is that some people are saying, you know, it really could pit European banks against FinTech rivals because of the data issue.  And then if we look more globally, you know, there's a lot of talk about whether Amazon could be a challenger for big banks either in the U.S. or globally.  How much of a risk are banks in Europe and the U.S. from FinTech rivals because of regulation in Europe?  And are they at -- they at more risk than their U.S. rivals?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BONZON</emphasis>:  Yes.  The extent to which Fintech will compete with traditional finance models is suddenly strongly influenced by regulatory trends and decisions.  No question.  By the way, one of the problem in Europe is you don't have a (inaudible) regulation across the 27 countries, you know.  And that makes the development of start up in Europe far more difficult than it is in the U.S.  Now, at the end of the day, finance is about managing a balance sheet, you know, it's balance sheet business.  There's a systemic risk involved.  So yes, I think there will be venture into the financial industry from FinTech startup.  I think still the winners are most likely going to be those of the legacy business model that adapt and leverage on FinTech breakthrough.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes.  So is it more about then adapting rather than try to find loopholes in the regulation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BONZON</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Thank you so much.  Yves Bonzon of Julius Baer, where he is a CIO, great to have you with us.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes, thank you so much, Mr. Bonzon, for joining us on this Friday.     </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

And also with us is Yves Bonzon, Bank Julius Baer co-CIO.</p><p> Mr. Nowotny, so delighted to have you with us on set.  Thank you for  joining us.  So my first question to you is, should the ECB be downsizing  more quickly, given the state of the Eurozone economy, even though  inflation is still below target?</p><p> EWALD NOWOTNY, GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER, EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK:  Well, we  have just made a decision last week.</p><p> CEHIC:  You have?  Was it the right one?</p><p> NOWOTNY:  Yes, I think it is the right one.  And we are having the volume  we are buying starting this January of next -- next year for nine months.   This reflects that we see that the economy is improving substantially.  But  we're not yet there where we want to be.</p><p> CEHIC:  So you're not yet there, but do you think that there should be a  more clear end date set for the stimulus or you think it's better to keep  that open-ended at this point?</p><p> NOWOTNY:  Frankly speaking, there had been a discussion about -- about  this.  There was a clear majority few that one should be flexible, which  doesn't mean in my view that we have to go on forever.  I think at some  time, there will be, of course, reducing and then some kind of -- of an end  date.  But it's too early now to have this discussion.</p><p> CEHIC:  But the issue of scarcity is a big one there, do you see any risk  of scarcity in the bonds that you're buying?</p><p> NOWOTNY:  Not really because we are buying quite a strong variety of -- of  bonds, not only government bonds, also from the private -- from the private  sector.  We -- we -- we look the risk directly at this.  So we are aware  that this something that we have to be careful.  But we have seen and -- in  fact, we have had this discussion quite many times before (inaudible) I  have nothing to buy any longer.  We managed to do this.  And I'm pretty  sure at this lower -- at this lower volume that we have decided.  We will  be able to fulfil our task.</p><p> CEHIC:  With reinvestment as well, do you see this as in some way upsetting  the downsizing of stimulus?  Or at least sort of moderating it somewhat?</p><p> NOWOTNY:  We have declared last week that we have two aspects that are  important, the one is the flows, this -- this what they're buying, but  increasingly, it is also the stock.  So that means we have, of course,  quite a strong and increasing stock.  And we have decided that we will  reinvest these bonds when they become due.  So this does have an  (inaudible) effect on the markets.</p><p> CEHIC:  How much could those reinvestments be?  Could you put a number on  it?</p><p> NOWOTNY:  We will give numbers, but it's too early to tell now.</p><p> CEHIC:  In your view, do you have any estimation of -- of -- of what you  personally ...</p><p> NOWOTNY:  It is, it is.  It will be quite a substantial number.</p><p> CEHIC:  Now, I did mention inflation earlier, the fact that it continues to  disappoint.  And this, of course, is the key thing that the ECB is  targeting.  This is a problem facing central bankers globally, but  specifically in the Eurozone, why do you think we're not seeing inflation  picking up?</p><p> NOWOTNY:  Well, in fact, one has to be quite honest.  For next -- for next  year, for 2018, our forecasts are that we have even a lower inflation rate  than we have 2017.  This is mainly due to effects from the energy policy  side.  Our core inflation, that means inflation without energy, is going  up.  And here we have kind of a steady development towards high inflation  rate in the -- in the range that we want to achieve.  So I think we -- we  are moving in the right direction.  But we have to observe these things  going on next year.</p><p> CEHIC:  Yes.  I mean, the ECB as a whole doesn't see inflation returning to  target before the end of 2019, when do you see it getting to that target,  and what's going to drive it?</p><p> NOWOTNY:  I think that inflation rates in 2018 might be higher than  anticipated now because what we see is that energy prices are moving up.   So this is one element with regards to core inflation.  For core inflation,  the most important element are wage developments.  Here we have had, not  only in Europe but also in the U.S., a rather strange development that it  takes a long time for wages to react to the lower unemployment.  So this is  the famous Phillips curve conundrum that -- that we have.  But I think this  is just a matter of lags.  So after some time, wages will keep up.  If we  look at the developments just for instance in Germany, where we have just  now wage negotiations wages that are quite substantial (inaudible), we will  have the same also in my country in Austria.</p><p> So I think with -- I'm not sure that these are really, let's say,  structural changes, that it might just mean that it takes longer for wages  to react to lower unemployment.</p><p> CEHIC:  OK.  So you do see that wage growth coming at some point, but we do  hear this from a lot of people that it's coming, that it's coming, but then  we're not there yet.  So I'm wondering, is the ECB's mandate sits a  purpose?  Because there's been a lot of discussion about whether that  inflation target, not just for the ECB but in general with central banks  should actually be modified somewhat.</p><p> NOWOTNY:  I think central banks should be very, very cautious in modifying  their targets.  This is also a matter of long-term credibility.  On the  other hand, we should not reduce this to say it has to be exactly 1.9.  So  we said from the start on that one has to see this as a medium-term  perspective.  So I think the most important element is to see what is the  direction.  And I think the direction is going the right way.</p><p> TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Well, Mr. Nowotny, visiting our London  studios here to meet with Bloomberg News, we're thrilled that he's with us  today on \"Bloomberg Surveillance.\"  Yves Bonzon with us with Julius Baer.   We will continue our discussion, and I really want to talk about the  challenges of investment going forward into 2018.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> CEHIC:  Yves Bonzon, Bank Julius Baer CIO, is still with us.  Yves, we're  seeing sterling steady today after the drop yesterday, that dovish hike  from the BOE.  Just very simply, where do you see the rate hike path going  in 2018?  The market pushed back its expectations after the decision in the  press conference from Mark Carney.</p><p> YVES BONZON, CIO, JULIUS BAER:  I think there was a clear desire by the  central banks to reassure everyone that this is not the beginning of a hard  and fast, I think, campaign.  The central bank is struggling to explain the  wage puzzle, absence of wage growth despite of significant tightening of  the labor market.  And there's so much uncertainty going on in this country  with the Brexit negotiation process being still quite unclear.  I think  it's prudent for the central banks to actually kind of reload the monetary  gun, meaning, by hiking interest rates a little bit, they are making room  for accommodation, losing -- if needed, down the road, if eventually worse  comes to worst with regards to the Brexit impact.</p><p> CEHIC:  Yes.  And speaking of Brexit, you know, one way that could have  interpreted that press conference was that the Bank of England was really  tying its forward guidance to Brexit in a way, but of course, that's one of  the most uncertain things here.  So is there any point in the forward  guidance?</p><p> BONZON:  Well, I guess, they are very pragmatic, you know.  I think they  are very concerned about communicating well and not surprising investors.   And I think it's fair to mention that Brexit is an important unknown, non- unknown but unknown.</p><p> CEHIC:  Yes.  But going back to the wage puzzle then, so one thing that  people have said to me is, look, this is about supply side deterioration,  and that's where we might eventually get that upward pressure on wages, the  Bank of England has used that argument as well itself.  Not everyone is  convinced by that, though, are you?</p><p> BONZON:  I'm not actually because I think we have an absence of wage  pressure across the skill set spectrum, you know, from low skill and medium  skill to even higher skill labor.  It's a combination of several things.   Technology trends, you know, replacing labor, and sometime labor of the  quite skilled kind with automated processes.  In -- in the meantime, at the  lower end of the skill spectrum, if you think about industry like  retailing, these companies are so -- under so much margin pressure, they  don't have much room to increase wages actually.  So I think the pricing  power on the labor side in spite of a relatively tight labor market, is not  that great.</p><p> Furthermore, I understand social benefit access have been tightened in the  U.K., so the -- the relative competition of social benefits, as opposed to  low wages, you know, is also (inaudible).  So there are so many factor at  work, including the gig economy.  It's very hard to predict what will  happen with wage growth.</p><p> KEENE:  Yves, I want to go to one of the things of the week that maybe was  (inaudible) under the economics, finance, and investment that we do.  And  that was a remarkable idea of the tech troops showing up at -- in  Washington, putting their hands up and testifying and all that.  In the  summary of -- of this was the power of the European Union to maybe rein in  American tech might.  I mean, I thought there was a real sea change here.   How does it look the prism of Julius Baer as the E.U. tries to regulate the  new technology we're all dealing with?  Is that a good thing, and will --  will it increase, will Brussels' effort increase in the coming years?</p><p> BONZON:  There's a very clear and a strong desire by the European Union to  intervene in these sectors, on these big tech platforms.  They're divided  in two group in the world today.  You have basically China, which has  ringfenced its market and allowed for the development of local giants, and  you have the American giants that have invaded the world ex-China.  One of  the problems, of course, is also in a globalized world the taxation of  corporate profits.  There seems to be a growing effort in the European  Union to find a way to tax these tech platforms.  So I think the pressure,  the regulatory pressure on them will keep on increasing, but it's a slow  process.  You see in the European Union, they are struggling to agree  because some countries actually benefit from these companies.  So it's a --  it's a very long process, I think, but definitely pressure is mounting.</p><p> KEENE:  But this is really fascinating, folks, and particularly the idea of  a European model of entrepreneurship and technology versus an Anglo- American model.  Which will win out, Yves, five years out?</p><p> BONZON:  It's hard to say on the five-year ...</p><p> KEENE:  Agreed, agreed, agreed.</p><p> BONZON:  ... on a five-year view who's going to win that, so ...</p><p> KEENE:  It's Friday.</p><p> BONZON:  That -- that the -- the U.S. technology platform has such a head  start to begin with.  When you account for the networking effect, you know,  the amount of users that they have managed to gather, give them a head  start that which will be hard to overcome.  So I think most -- most likely,  the -- the main risk for them is regulatory action also on the U.S. side.   We have all these discussions with regards to what happened during the  election.  So again, there -- there -- there is mounting pressure.  But on  the other end, this is a very strategic industry the United States.  And I  don't want -- I don't think they want to damage their chances.</p><p> CEHIC:  Yves, I want to ask you about another piece of regulation, which is  PSD2.  We talked a lot about MiFID II, but one thing about PSD2 and Europe  is that some people are saying, you know, it really could pit European  banks against FinTech rivals because of the data issue.  And then if we  look more globally, you know, there's a lot of talk about whether Amazon  could be a challenger for big banks either in the U.S. or globally.  How  much of a risk are banks in Europe and the U.S. from FinTech rivals because  of regulation in Europe?  And are they at -- they at more risk than their  U.S. rivals?</p><p> BONZON:  Yes.  The extent to which Fintech will compete with traditional  finance models is suddenly strongly influenced by regulatory trends and  decisions.  No question.  By the way, one of the problem in Europe is you  don't have a (inaudible) regulation across the 27 countries, you know.  And  that makes the development of start up in Europe far more difficult than it  is in the U.S.  Now, at the end of the day, finance is about managing a  balance sheet, you know, it's balance sheet business.  There's a systemic  risk involved.  So yes, I think there will be venture into the financial  industry from FinTech startup.  I think still the winners are most likely  going to be those of the legacy business model that adapt and leverage on  FinTech breakthrough.</p><p> CEHIC:  Yes.  So is it more about then adapting rather than try to find  loopholes in the regulation?</p><p> BONZON:  Absolutely.  Yes.</p><p> CEHIC:  Thank you so much.  Yves Bonzon of Julius Baer, where he is a CIO,  great to have you with us.</p><p> KEENE:  Yes, thank you so much, Mr. Bonzon, for joining us on this Friday.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

And also with us is Yves Bonzon, Bank Julius Baer co-CIO.</p><p>Mr. Nowotny, so delighted to have you with us on set.  Thank you for  joining us.  So my first question to you is, should the ECB be downsizing  more quickly, given the state of the Eurozone economy, even though  inflation is still below target?</p><p>EWALD NOWOTNY, GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER, EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK:  Well, we  have just made a decision last week.</p><p>CEHIC:  You have?  Was it the right one?</p><p>NOWOTNY:  Yes, I think it is the right one.  And we are having the volume  we are buying starting this January of next -- next year for nine months.   This reflects that we see that the economy is improving substantially.  But  we're not yet there where we want to be.</p><p>CEHIC:  So you're not yet there, but do you think that there should be a  more clear end date set for the stimulus or you think it's better to keep  that open-ended at this point?</p><p>NOWOTNY:  Frankly speaking, there had been a discussion about -- about  this.  There was a clear majority few that one should be flexible, which  doesn't mean in my view that we have to go on forever.  I think at some  time, there will be, of course, reducing and then some kind of -- of an end  date.  But it's too early now to have this discussion.</p><p>CEHIC:  But the issue of scarcity is a big one there, do you see any risk  of scarcity in the bonds that you're buying?</p><p>NOWOTNY:  Not really because we are buying quite a strong variety of -- of  bonds, not only government bonds, also from the private -- from the private  sector.  We -- we -- we look the risk directly at this.  So we are aware  that this something that we have to be careful.  But we have seen and -- in  fact, we have had this discussion quite many times before (inaudible) I  have nothing to buy any longer.  We managed to do this.  And I'm pretty  sure at this lower -- at this lower volume that we have decided.  We will  be able to fulfil our task.</p><p>CEHIC:  With reinvestment as well, do you see this as in some way upsetting  the downsizing of stimulus?  Or at least sort of moderating it somewhat?</p><p>NOWOTNY:  We have declared last week that we have two aspects that are  important, the one is the flows, this -- this what they're buying, but  increasingly, it is also the stock.  So that means we have, of course,  quite a strong and increasing stock.  And we have decided that we will  reinvest these bonds when they become due.  So this does have an  (inaudible) effect on the markets.</p><p>CEHIC:  How much could those reinvestments be?  Could you put a number on  it?</p><p>NOWOTNY:  We will give numbers, but it's too early to tell now.</p><p>CEHIC:  In your view, do you have any estimation of -- of -- of what you  personally ...</p><p>NOWOTNY:  It is, it is.  It will be quite a substantial number.</p><p>CEHIC:  Now, I did mention inflation earlier, the fact that it continues to  disappoint.  And this, of course, is the key thing that the ECB is  targeting.  This is a problem facing central bankers globally, but  specifically in the Eurozone, why do you think we're not seeing inflation  picking up?</p><p>NOWOTNY:  Well, in fact, one has to be quite honest.  For next -- for next  year, for 2018, our forecasts are that we have even a lower inflation rate  than we have 2017.  This is mainly due to effects from the energy policy  side.  Our core inflation, that means inflation without energy, is going  up.  And here we have kind of a steady development towards high inflation  rate in the -- in the range that we want to achieve.  So I think we -- we  are moving in the right direction.  But we have to observe these things  going on next year.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.  I mean, the ECB as a whole doesn't see inflation returning to  target before the end of 2019, when do you see it getting to that target,  and what's going to drive it?</p><p>NOWOTNY:  I think that inflation rates in 2018 might be higher than  anticipated now because what we see is that energy prices are moving up.   So this is one element with regards to core inflation.  For core inflation,  the most important element are wage developments.  Here we have had, not  only in Europe but also in the U.S., a rather strange development that it  takes a long time for wages to react to the lower unemployment.  So this is  the famous Phillips curve conundrum that -- that we have.  But I think this  is just a matter of lags.  So after some time, wages will keep up.  If we  look at the developments just for instance in Germany, where we have just  now wage negotiations wages that are quite substantial (inaudible), we will  have the same also in my country in Austria.</p><p>So I think with -- I'm not sure that these are really, let's say,  structural changes, that it might just mean that it takes longer for wages  to react to lower unemployment.</p><p>CEHIC:  OK.  So you do see that wage growth coming at some point, but we do  hear this from a lot of people that it's coming, that it's coming, but then  we're not there yet.  So I'm wondering, is the ECB's mandate sits a  purpose?  Because there's been a lot of discussion about whether that  inflation target, not just for the ECB but in general with central banks  should actually be modified somewhat.</p><p>NOWOTNY:  I think central banks should be very, very cautious in modifying  their targets.  This is also a matter of long-term credibility.  On the  other hand, we should not reduce this to say it has to be exactly 1.9.  So  we said from the start on that one has to see this as a medium-term  perspective.  So I think the most important element is to see what is the  direction.  And I think the direction is going the right way.</p><p>TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Well, Mr. Nowotny, visiting our London  studios here to meet with Bloomberg News, we're thrilled that he's with us  today on \"Bloomberg Surveillance.\"  Yves Bonzon with us with Julius Baer.   We will continue our discussion, and I really want to talk about the  challenges of investment going forward into 2018.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CEHIC:  Yves Bonzon, Bank Julius Baer CIO, is still with us.  Yves, we're  seeing sterling steady today after the drop yesterday, that dovish hike  from the BOE.  Just very simply, where do you see the rate hike path going  in 2018?  The market pushed back its expectations after the decision in the  press conference from Mark Carney.</p><p>YVES BONZON, CIO, JULIUS BAER:  I think there was a clear desire by the  central banks to reassure everyone that this is not the beginning of a hard  and fast, I think, campaign.  The central bank is struggling to explain the  wage puzzle, absence of wage growth despite of significant tightening of  the labor market.  And there's so much uncertainty going on in this country  with the Brexit negotiation process being still quite unclear.  I think  it's prudent for the central banks to actually kind of reload the monetary  gun, meaning, by hiking interest rates a little bit, they are making room  for accommodation, losing -- if needed, down the road, if eventually worse  comes to worst with regards to the Brexit impact.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.  And speaking of Brexit, you know, one way that could have  interpreted that press conference was that the Bank of England was really  tying its forward guidance to Brexit in a way, but of course, that's one of  the most uncertain things here.  So is there any point in the forward  guidance?</p><p>BONZON:  Well, I guess, they are very pragmatic, you know.  I think they  are very concerned about communicating well and not surprising investors.   And I think it's fair to mention that Brexit is an important unknown, non- unknown but unknown.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.  But going back to the wage puzzle then, so one thing that  people have said to me is, look, this is about supply side deterioration,  and that's where we might eventually get that upward pressure on wages, the  Bank of England has used that argument as well itself.  Not everyone is  convinced by that, though, are you?</p><p>BONZON:  I'm not actually because I think we have an absence of wage  pressure across the skill set spectrum, you know, from low skill and medium  skill to even higher skill labor.  It's a combination of several things.   Technology trends, you know, replacing labor, and sometime labor of the  quite skilled kind with automated processes.  In -- in the meantime, at the  lower end of the skill spectrum, if you think about industry like  retailing, these companies are so -- under so much margin pressure, they  don't have much room to increase wages actually.  So I think the pricing  power on the labor side in spite of a relatively tight labor market, is not  that great.</p><p>Furthermore, I understand social benefit access have been tightened in the  U.K., so the -- the relative competition of social benefits, as opposed to  low wages, you know, is also (inaudible).  So there are so many factor at  work, including the gig economy.  It's very hard to predict what will  happen with wage growth.</p><p>KEENE:  Yves, I want to go to one of the things of the week that maybe was  (inaudible) under the economics, finance, and investment that we do.  And  that was a remarkable idea of the tech troops showing up at -- in  Washington, putting their hands up and testifying and all that.  In the  summary of -- of this was the power of the European Union to maybe rein in  American tech might.  I mean, I thought there was a real sea change here.   How does it look the prism of Julius Baer as the E.U. tries to regulate the  new technology we're all dealing with?  Is that a good thing, and will --  will it increase, will Brussels' effort increase in the coming years?</p><p>BONZON:  There's a very clear and a strong desire by the European Union to  intervene in these sectors, on these big tech platforms.  They're divided  in two group in the world today.  You have basically China, which has  ringfenced its market and allowed for the development of local giants, and  you have the American giants that have invaded the world ex-China.  One of  the problems, of course, is also in a globalized world the taxation of  corporate profits.  There seems to be a growing effort in the European  Union to find a way to tax these tech platforms.  So I think the pressure,  the regulatory pressure on them will keep on increasing, but it's a slow  process.  You see in the European Union, they are struggling to agree  because some countries actually benefit from these companies.  So it's a --  it's a very long process, I think, but definitely pressure is mounting.</p><p>KEENE:  But this is really fascinating, folks, and particularly the idea of  a European model of entrepreneurship and technology versus an Anglo- American model.  Which will win out, Yves, five years out?</p><p>BONZON:  It's hard to say on the five-year ...</p><p>KEENE:  Agreed, agreed, agreed.</p><p>BONZON:  ... on a five-year view who's going to win that, so ...</p><p>KEENE:  It's Friday.</p><p>BONZON:  That -- that the -- the U.S. technology platform has such a head  start to begin with.  When you account for the networking effect, you know,  the amount of users that they have managed to gather, give them a head  start that which will be hard to overcome.  So I think most -- most likely,  the -- the main risk for them is regulatory action also on the U.S. side.   We have all these discussions with regards to what happened during the  election.  So again, there -- there -- there is mounting pressure.  But on  the other end, this is a very strategic industry the United States.  And I  don't want -- I don't think they want to damage their chances.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yves, I want to ask you about another piece of regulation, which is  PSD2.  We talked a lot about MiFID II, but one thing about PSD2 and Europe  is that some people are saying, you know, it really could pit European  banks against FinTech rivals because of the data issue.  And then if we  look more globally, you know, there's a lot of talk about whether Amazon  could be a challenger for big banks either in the U.S. or globally.  How  much of a risk are banks in Europe and the U.S. from FinTech rivals because  of regulation in Europe?  And are they at -- they at more risk than their  U.S. rivals?</p><p>BONZON:  Yes.  The extent to which Fintech will compete with traditional  finance models is suddenly strongly influenced by regulatory trends and  decisions.  No question.  By the way, one of the problem in Europe is you  don't have a (inaudible) regulation across the 27 countries, you know.  And  that makes the development of start up in Europe far more difficult than it  is in the U.S.  Now, at the end of the day, finance is about managing a  balance sheet, you know, it's balance sheet business.  There's a systemic  risk involved.  So yes, I think there will be venture into the financial  industry from FinTech startup.  I think still the winners are most likely  going to be those of the legacy business model that adapt and leverage on  FinTech breakthrough.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.  So is it more about then adapting rather than try to find  loopholes in the regulation?</p><p>BONZON:  Absolutely.  Yes.</p><p>CEHIC:  Thank you so much.  Yves Bonzon of Julius Baer, where he is a CIO,  great to have you with us.</p><p>KEENE:  Yes, thank you so much, Mr. Bonzon, for joining us on this Friday.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

And also with us is Yves Bonzon, Bank Julius Baer co-CIO.</p><p>Mr. Nowotny, so delighted to have you with us on set. Thank you for joining us. So my first question to you is, should the ECB be downsizing more quickly, given the state of the Eurozone economy, even though inflation is still below target?</p><p>EWALD NOWOTNY, GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER, EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK: Well, we have just made a decision last week.</p><p>CEHIC: You have? Was it the right one?</p><p>NOWOTNY: Yes, I think it is the right one. And we are having the volume we are buying starting this January of next -- next year for nine months. This reflects that we see that the economy is improving substantially. But we're not yet there where we want to be.</p><p>CEHIC: So you're not yet there, but do you think that there should be a more clear end date set for the stimulus or you think it's better to keep that open-ended at this point?</p><p>NOWOTNY: Frankly speaking, there had been a discussion about -- about this. There was a clear majority few that one should be flexible, which doesn't mean in my view that we have to go on forever. I think at some time, there will be, of course, reducing and then some kind of -- of an end date. But it's too early now to have this discussion.</p><p>CEHIC: But the issue of scarcity is a big one there, do you see any risk of scarcity in the bonds that you're buying?</p><p>NOWOTNY: Not really because we are buying quite a strong variety of -- of bonds, not only government bonds, also from the private -- from the private sector. We -- we -- we look the risk directly at this. So we are aware that this something that we have to be careful. But we have seen and -- in fact, we have had this discussion quite many times before (inaudible) I have nothing to buy any longer. We managed to do this. And I'm pretty sure at this lower -- at this lower volume that we have decided. We will be able to fulfil our task.</p><p>CEHIC: With reinvestment as well, do you see this as in some way upsetting the downsizing of stimulus? Or at least sort of moderating it somewhat?</p><p>NOWOTNY: We have declared last week that we have two aspects that are important, the one is the flows, this -- this what they're buying, but increasingly, it is also the stock. So that means we have, of course, quite a strong and increasing stock. And we have decided that we will reinvest these bonds when they become due. So this does have an (inaudible) effect on the markets.</p><p>CEHIC: How much could those reinvestments be? Could you put a number on it?</p><p>NOWOTNY: We will give numbers, but it's too early to tell now.</p><p>CEHIC: In your view, do you have any estimation of -- of -- of what you personally ...</p><p>NOWOTNY: It is, it is. It will be quite a substantial number.</p><p>CEHIC: Now, I did mention inflation earlier, the fact that it continues to disappoint. And this, of course, is the key thing that the ECB is targeting. This is a problem facing central bankers globally, but specifically in the Eurozone, why do you think we're not seeing inflation picking up?</p><p>NOWOTNY: Well, in fact, one has to be quite honest. For next -- for next year, for 2018, our forecasts are that we have even a lower inflation rate than we have 2017. This is mainly due to effects from the energy policy side. Our core inflation, that means inflation without energy, is going up. And here we have kind of a steady development towards high inflation rate in the -- in the range that we want to achieve. So I think we -- we are moving in the right direction. But we have to observe these things going on next year.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. I mean, the ECB as a whole doesn't see inflation returning to target before the end of 2019, when do you see it getting to that target, and what's going to drive it?</p><p>NOWOTNY: I think that inflation rates in 2018 might be higher than anticipated now because what we see is that energy prices are moving up. So this is one element with regards to core inflation. For core inflation, the most important element are wage developments. Here we have had, not only in Europe but also in the U.S., a rather strange development that it takes a long time for wages to react to the lower unemployment. So this is the famous Phillips curve conundrum that -- that we have. But I think this is just a matter of lags. So after some time, wages will keep up. If we look at the developments just for instance in Germany, where we have just now wage negotiations wages that are quite substantial (inaudible), we will have the same also in my country in Austria.</p><p>So I think with -- I'm not sure that these are really, let's say, structural changes, that it might just mean that it takes longer for wages to react to lower unemployment.</p><p>CEHIC: OK. So you do see that wage growth coming at some point, but we do hear this from a lot of people that it's coming, that it's coming, but then we're not there yet. So I'm wondering, is the ECB's mandate sits a purpose? Because there's been a lot of discussion about whether that inflation target, not just for the ECB but in general with central banks should actually be modified somewhat.</p><p>NOWOTNY: I think central banks should be very, very cautious in modifying their targets. This is also a matter of long-term credibility. On the other hand, we should not reduce this to say it has to be exactly 1.9. So we said from the start on that one has to see this as a medium-term perspective. So I think the most important element is to see what is the direction. And I think the direction is going the right way.</p><p>TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Well, Mr. Nowotny, visiting our London studios here to meet with Bloomberg News, we're thrilled that he's with us today on \"Bloomberg Surveillance.\" Yves Bonzon with us with Julius Baer. We will continue our discussion, and I really want to talk about the challenges of investment going forward into 2018.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CEHIC: Yves Bonzon, Bank Julius Baer CIO, is still with us. Yves, we're seeing sterling steady today after the drop yesterday, that dovish hike from the BOE. Just very simply, where do you see the rate hike path going in 2018? The market pushed back its expectations after the decision in the press conference from Mark Carney.</p><p>YVES BONZON, CIO, JULIUS BAER: I think there was a clear desire by the central banks to reassure everyone that this is not the beginning of a hard and fast, I think, campaign. The central bank is struggling to explain the wage puzzle, absence of wage growth despite of significant tightening of the labor market. And there's so much uncertainty going on in this country with the Brexit negotiation process being still quite unclear. I think it's prudent for the central banks to actually kind of reload the monetary gun, meaning, by hiking interest rates a little bit, they are making room for accommodation, losing -- if needed, down the road, if eventually worse comes to worst with regards to the Brexit impact.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. And speaking of Brexit, you know, one way that could have interpreted that press conference was that the Bank of England was really tying its forward guidance to Brexit in a way, but of course, that's one of the most uncertain things here. So is there any point in the forward guidance?</p><p>BONZON: Well, I guess, they are very pragmatic, you know. I think they are very concerned about communicating well and not surprising investors. And I think it's fair to mention that Brexit is an important unknown, non- unknown but unknown.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. But going back to the wage puzzle then, so one thing that people have said to me is, look, this is about supply side deterioration, and that's where we might eventually get that upward pressure on wages, the Bank of England has used that argument as well itself. Not everyone is convinced by that, though, are you?</p><p>BONZON: I'm not actually because I think we have an absence of wage pressure across the skill set spectrum, you know, from low skill and medium skill to even higher skill labor. It's a combination of several things. Technology trends, you know, replacing labor, and sometime labor of the quite skilled kind with automated processes. In -- in the meantime, at the lower end of the skill spectrum, if you think about industry like retailing, these companies are so -- under so much margin pressure, they don't have much room to increase wages actually. So I think the pricing power on the labor side in spite of a relatively tight labor market, is not that great.</p><p>Furthermore, I understand social benefit access have been tightened in the U.K., so the -- the relative competition of social benefits, as opposed to low wages, you know, is also (inaudible). So there are so many factor at work, including the gig economy. It's very hard to predict what will happen with wage growth.</p><p>KEENE: Yves, I want to go to one of the things of the week that maybe was (inaudible) under the economics, finance, and investment that we do. And that was a remarkable idea of the tech troops showing up at -- in Washington, putting their hands up and testifying and all that. In the summary of -- of this was the power of the European Union to maybe rein in American tech might. I mean, I thought there was a real sea change here. How does it look the prism of Julius Baer as the E.U. tries to regulate the new technology we're all dealing with? Is that a good thing, and will -- will it increase, will Brussels' effort increase in the coming years?</p><p>BONZON: There's a very clear and a strong desire by the European Union to intervene in these sectors, on these big tech platforms. They're divided in two group in the world today. You have basically China, which has ringfenced its market and allowed for the development of local giants, and you have the American giants that have invaded the world ex-China. One of the problems, of course, is also in a globalized world the taxation of corporate profits. There seems to be a growing effort in the European Union to find a way to tax these tech platforms. So I think the pressure, the regulatory pressure on them will keep on increasing, but it's a slow process. You see in the European Union, they are struggling to agree because some countries actually benefit from these companies. So it's a -- it's a very long process, I think, but definitely pressure is mounting.</p><p>KEENE: But this is really fascinating, folks, and particularly the idea of a European model of entrepreneurship and technology versus an Anglo- American model. Which will win out, Yves, five years out?</p><p>BONZON: It's hard to say on the five-year ...</p><p>KEENE: Agreed, agreed, agreed.</p><p>BONZON: ... on a five-year view who's going to win that, so ...</p><p>KEENE: It's Friday.</p><p>BONZON: That -- that the -- the U.S. technology platform has such a head start to begin with. When you account for the networking effect, you know, the amount of users that they have managed to gather, give them a head start that which will be hard to overcome. So I think most -- most likely, the -- the main risk for them is regulatory action also on the U.S. side. We have all these discussions with regards to what happened during the election. So again, there -- there -- there is mounting pressure. But on the other end, this is a very strategic industry the United States. And I don't want -- I don't think they want to damage their chances.</p><p>CEHIC: Yves, I want to ask you about another piece of regulation, which is PSD2. We talked a lot about MiFID II, but one thing about PSD2 and Europe is that some people are saying, you know, it really could pit European banks against FinTech rivals because of the data issue. And then if we look more globally, you know, there's a lot of talk about whether Amazon could be a challenger for big banks either in the U.S. or globally. How much of a risk are banks in Europe and the U.S. from FinTech rivals because of regulation in Europe? And are they at -- they at more risk than their U.S. rivals?</p><p>BONZON: Yes. The extent to which Fintech will compete with traditional finance models is suddenly strongly influenced by regulatory trends and decisions. No question. By the way, one of the problem in Europe is you don't have a (inaudible) regulation across the 27 countries, you know. And that makes the development of start up in Europe far more difficult than it is in the U.S. Now, at the end of the day, finance is about managing a balance sheet, you know, it's balance sheet business. There's a systemic risk involved. So yes, I think there will be venture into the financial industry from FinTech startup. I think still the winners are most likely going to be those of the legacy business model that adapt and leverage on FinTech breakthrough.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. So is it more about then adapting rather than try to find loopholes in the regulation?</p><p>BONZON: Absolutely. Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: Thank you so much. Yves Bonzon of Julius Baer, where he is a CIO, great to have you with us.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, thank you so much, Mr. Bonzon, for joining us on this Friday.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

And also with us is Yves Bonzon, Bank Julius Baer co-CIO.</p><p>Mr. Nowotny, so delighted to have you with us on set. Thank you for joining us. So my first question to you is, should the ECB be downsizing more quickly, given the state of the Eurozone economy, even though inflation is still below target?</p><p>EWALD NOWOTNY, GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER, EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK: Well, we have just made a decision last week.</p><p>CEHIC: You have? Was it the right one?</p><p>NOWOTNY: Yes, I think it is the right one. And we are having the volume we are buying starting this January of next -- next year for nine months. This reflects that we see that the economy is improving substantially. But we're not yet there where we want to be.</p><p>CEHIC: So you're not yet there, but do you think that there should be a more clear end date set for the stimulus or you think it's better to keep that open-ended at this point?</p><p>NOWOTNY: Frankly speaking, there had been a discussion about -- about this. There was a clear majority few that one should be flexible, which doesn't mean in my view that we have to go on forever. I think at some time, there will be, of course, reducing and then some kind of -- of an end date. But it's too early now to have this discussion.</p><p>CEHIC: But the issue of scarcity is a big one there, do you see any risk of scarcity in the bonds that you're buying?</p><p>NOWOTNY: Not really because we are buying quite a strong variety of -- of bonds, not only government bonds, also from the private -- from the private sector. We -- we -- we look the risk directly at this. So we are aware that this something that we have to be careful. But we have seen and -- in fact, we have had this discussion quite many times before (inaudible) I have nothing to buy any longer. We managed to do this. And I'm pretty sure at this lower -- at this lower volume that we have decided. We will be able to fulfil our task.</p><p>CEHIC: With reinvestment as well, do you see this as in some way upsetting the downsizing of stimulus? Or at least sort of moderating it somewhat?</p><p>NOWOTNY: We have declared last week that we have two aspects that are important, the one is the flows, this -- this what they're buying, but increasingly, it is also the stock. So that means we have, of course, quite a strong and increasing stock. And we have decided that we will reinvest these bonds when they become due. So this does have an (inaudible) effect on the markets.</p><p>CEHIC: How much could those reinvestments be? Could you put a number on it?</p><p>NOWOTNY: We will give numbers, but it's too early to tell now.</p><p>CEHIC: In your view, do you have any estimation of -- of -- of what you personally ...</p><p>NOWOTNY: It is, it is. It will be quite a substantial number.</p><p>CEHIC: Now, I did mention inflation earlier, the fact that it continues to disappoint. And this, of course, is the key thing that the ECB is targeting. This is a problem facing central bankers globally, but specifically in the Eurozone, why do you think we're not seeing inflation picking up?</p><p>NOWOTNY: Well, in fact, one has to be quite honest. For next -- for next year, for 2018, our forecasts are that we have even a lower inflation rate than we have 2017. This is mainly due to effects from the energy policy side. Our core inflation, that means inflation without energy, is going up. And here we have kind of a steady development towards high inflation rate in the -- in the range that we want to achieve. So I think we -- we are moving in the right direction. But we have to observe these things going on next year.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. I mean, the ECB as a whole doesn't see inflation returning to target before the end of 2019, when do you see it getting to that target, and what's going to drive it?</p><p>NOWOTNY: I think that inflation rates in 2018 might be higher than anticipated now because what we see is that energy prices are moving up. So this is one element with regards to core inflation. For core inflation, the most important element are wage developments. Here we have had, not only in Europe but also in the U.S., a rather strange development that it takes a long time for wages to react to the lower unemployment. So this is the famous Phillips curve conundrum that -- that we have. But I think this is just a matter of lags. So after some time, wages will keep up. If we look at the developments just for instance in Germany, where we have just now wage negotiations wages that are quite substantial (inaudible), we will have the same also in my country in Austria.</p><p>So I think with -- I'm not sure that these are really, let's say, structural changes, that it might just mean that it takes longer for wages to react to lower unemployment.</p><p>CEHIC: OK. So you do see that wage growth coming at some point, but we do hear this from a lot of people that it's coming, that it's coming, but then we're not there yet. So I'm wondering, is the ECB's mandate sits a purpose? Because there's been a lot of discussion about whether that inflation target, not just for the ECB but in general with central banks should actually be modified somewhat.</p><p>NOWOTNY: I think central banks should be very, very cautious in modifying their targets. This is also a matter of long-term credibility. On the other hand, we should not reduce this to say it has to be exactly 1.9. So we said from the start on that one has to see this as a medium-term perspective. So I think the most important element is to see what is the direction. And I think the direction is going the right way.</p><p>TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Well, Mr. Nowotny, visiting our London studios here to meet with Bloomberg News, we're thrilled that he's with us today on \"Bloomberg Surveillance.\" Yves Bonzon with us with Julius Baer. We will continue our discussion, and I really want to talk about the challenges of investment going forward into 2018.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CEHIC: Yves Bonzon, Bank Julius Baer CIO, is still with us. Yves, we're seeing sterling steady today after the drop yesterday, that dovish hike from the BOE. Just very simply, where do you see the rate hike path going in 2018? The market pushed back its expectations after the decision in the press conference from Mark Carney.</p><p>YVES BONZON, CIO, JULIUS BAER: I think there was a clear desire by the central banks to reassure everyone that this is not the beginning of a hard and fast, I think, campaign. The central bank is struggling to explain the wage puzzle, absence of wage growth despite of significant tightening of the labor market. And there's so much uncertainty going on in this country with the Brexit negotiation process being still quite unclear. I think it's prudent for the central banks to actually kind of reload the monetary gun, meaning, by hiking interest rates a little bit, they are making room for accommodation, losing -- if needed, down the road, if eventually worse comes to worst with regards to the Brexit impact.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. And speaking of Brexit, you know, one way that could have interpreted that press conference was that the Bank of England was really tying its forward guidance to Brexit in a way, but of course, that's one of the most uncertain things here. So is there any point in the forward guidance?</p><p>BONZON: Well, I guess, they are very pragmatic, you know. I think they are very concerned about communicating well and not surprising investors. And I think it's fair to mention that Brexit is an important unknown, non- unknown but unknown.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. But going back to the wage puzzle then, so one thing that people have said to me is, look, this is about supply side deterioration, and that's where we might eventually get that upward pressure on wages, the Bank of England has used that argument as well itself. Not everyone is convinced by that, though, are you?</p><p>BONZON: I'm not actually because I think we have an absence of wage pressure across the skill set spectrum, you know, from low skill and medium skill to even higher skill labor. It's a combination of several things. Technology trends, you know, replacing labor, and sometime labor of the quite skilled kind with automated processes. In -- in the meantime, at the lower end of the skill spectrum, if you think about industry like retailing, these companies are so -- under so much margin pressure, they don't have much room to increase wages actually. So I think the pricing power on the labor side in spite of a relatively tight labor market, is not that great.</p><p>Furthermore, I understand social benefit access have been tightened in the U.K., so the -- the relative competition of social benefits, as opposed to low wages, you know, is also (inaudible). So there are so many factor at work, including the gig economy. It's very hard to predict what will happen with wage growth.</p><p>KEENE: Yves, I want to go to one of the things of the week that maybe was (inaudible) under the economics, finance, and investment that we do. And that was a remarkable idea of the tech troops showing up at -- in Washington, putting their hands up and testifying and all that. In the summary of -- of this was the power of the European Union to maybe rein in American tech might. I mean, I thought there was a real sea change here. How does it look the prism of Julius Baer as the E.U. tries to regulate the new technology we're all dealing with? Is that a good thing, and will -- will it increase, will Brussels' effort increase in the coming years?</p><p>BONZON: There's a very clear and a strong desire by the European Union to intervene in these sectors, on these big tech platforms. They're divided in two group in the world today. You have basically China, which has ringfenced its market and allowed for the development of local giants, and you have the American giants that have invaded the world ex-China. One of the problems, of course, is also in a globalized world the taxation of corporate profits. There seems to be a growing effort in the European Union to find a way to tax these tech platforms. So I think the pressure, the regulatory pressure on them will keep on increasing, but it's a slow process. You see in the European Union, they are struggling to agree because some countries actually benefit from these companies. So it's a -- it's a very long process, I think, but definitely pressure is mounting.</p><p>KEENE: But this is really fascinating, folks, and particularly the idea of a European model of entrepreneurship and technology versus an Anglo- American model. Which will win out, Yves, five years out?</p><p>BONZON: It's hard to say on the five-year ...</p><p>KEENE: Agreed, agreed, agreed.</p><p>BONZON: ... on a five-year view who's going to win that, so ...</p><p>KEENE: It's Friday.</p><p>BONZON: That -- that the -- the U.S. technology platform has such a head start to begin with. When you account for the networking effect, you know, the amount of users that they have managed to gather, give them a head start that which will be hard to overcome. So I think most -- most likely, the -- the main risk for them is regulatory action also on the U.S. side. We have all these discussions with regards to what happened during the election. So again, there -- there -- there is mounting pressure. But on the other end, this is a very strategic industry the United States. And I don't want -- I don't think they want to damage their chances.</p><p>CEHIC: Yves, I want to ask you about another piece of regulation, which is PSD2. We talked a lot about MiFID II, but one thing about PSD2 and Europe is that some people are saying, you know, it really could pit European banks against FinTech rivals because of the data issue. And then if we look more globally, you know, there's a lot of talk about whether Amazon could be a challenger for big banks either in the U.S. or globally. How much of a risk are banks in Europe and the U.S. from FinTech rivals because of regulation in Europe? And are they at -- they at more risk than their U.S. rivals?</p><p>BONZON: Yes. The extent to which Fintech will compete with traditional finance models is suddenly strongly influenced by regulatory trends and decisions. No question. By the way, one of the problem in Europe is you don't have a (inaudible) regulation across the 27 countries, you know. And that makes the development of start up in Europe far more difficult than it is in the U.S. Now, at the end of the day, finance is about managing a balance sheet, you know, it's balance sheet business. There's a systemic risk involved. So yes, I think there will be venture into the financial industry from FinTech startup. I think still the winners are most likely going to be those of the legacy business model that adapt and leverage on FinTech breakthrough.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. So is it more about then adapting rather than try to find loopholes in the regulation?</p><p>BONZON: Absolutely. Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: Thank you so much. Yves Bonzon of Julius Baer, where he is a CIO, great to have you with us.</p><p>KEENE: Yes, thank you so much, Mr. Bonzon, for joining us on this Friday.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Regulation is not the only thing on the table: the end of Facebook is being discussed.In light of the emails being released, European officials found that Facebook knew that the site was compromising users' data and engaging in behavior of a monopoly. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NBST107778154422049108225176900042</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBST-6588</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TX9-F631-F03R-N1W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"283\"/><timeReceived>10:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newsbusters.org</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 7, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Quand j'\u00e9tais \u00e0 Harvard, m\u00eame si je n'y suis pas rest\u00e9 longtemps [sourires], j'ai suivi une majeure en psychologie. Ce qui m'a toujours int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dans la psychologie, c'est la fa\u00e7on dont fonctionne le cortex c\u00e9r\u00e9bral pour \u00eatre orient\u00e9 vers la communication avec les autres. </p><p>Il y a une partie consacr\u00e9e au langage qui est propre \u00e0 l'homme. Le cortex visuel est principalement vou\u00e9 \u00e0 la lecture des \u00e9motions et des connexions entre les humains. Si votre sourcil bouge d'un millim\u00e8tre, je le verrai tout de suite, c'est comme d\u00e9tecter une nouvelle \u00e9motion. Si je change mon souffle, vous le verrez. Et puis il y a les neurones miroirs, qui essaient de cr\u00e9er de l'empathie, en s'int\u00e9ressant \u00e0 ce qu'il se passe avec les gens autour de nous. Nous sommes faits pour interagir avec notre entourage. Mais la technologie aujourd'hui ne fonctionne pas comme cela. Elle s'appuie sur notre smartphone et est principalement organis\u00e9e autour des applications et des t\u00e2ches que remplit le smartphone. C'est ce que je veux am\u00e9liorer.   Pourquoi <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/tags/facebook\">Facebook</url>peut-il faire la diff\u00e9rence dans cette aventure ? D'autres entreprises, comme l'am\u00e9ricain Magic Leap ou le chinois Nreal, ont de grandes ambitions dans le secteur.   La mission de Facebook est de donner une voix aux gens, de fournir \u00e0 tous le pouvoir de fonder des communaut\u00e9s ou encore de rapprocher les gens entre eux. Notre mission est de cr\u00e9er une technologie qui r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 ces besoins. Jusqu'ici, nous avons fait cela \u00e0 travers des applications qui sont les plus utilis\u00e9es dans le monde. Et ces applications [Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, NDLR], qu'ont-elles en commun ? Elles rapprochent les gens. Il est temps de passer \u00e0 la nouvelle \u00e9tape.   <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr#\">Cliquez ici pour Image, Audio ou Vid\u00e9o</url>Sommit\u00e9s. \u00ab\u00a0Bonne rencontre avec Mark Zuckerberg de Facebook dans le Bureau ovale aujourd'hui [le\u00a019\u00a0septembre]\u00a0\u00bb, a tweett\u00e9 Donald Trump.                                                              C'est-\u00e0-dire ?   Tous les quinze ans appara\u00eet une nouvelle mani\u00e8re d'utiliser l'informatique. Souvenez-vous de l'arriv\u00e9e des ordinateurs personnels, qui consistaient principalement en des <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/tags/pc\">PC</url>permettant d'utiliser Windows. Puis ce fut le cas des navigateurs, avec lesquels on pouvait aller sur Internet depuis un ordinateur portable. Maintenant, on a le Web sur mobile. Et bient\u00f4t, ce sera l'\u00e8re de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e et de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle. Et ce qui distingue ces technologies, c'est qu'elles vous permettent d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 un endroit et d'interagir avec votre entourage. Quand vous \u00eates face \u00e0 quelqu'un qui a le nez sur un smartphone, vous ne ressentez pas sa pr\u00e9sence. Avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle et augment\u00e9e, vous pouvez interagir avec vos proches.   Vous venez d'annoncer l'achat de CTRL-Labs, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 new-yorkaise qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un bracelet capable d'interpr\u00e9ter les signaux c\u00e9r\u00e9braux.   Cela permettra de traiter de mani\u00e8re naturelle davantage d'informations. Notre cerveau peut produire un t\u00e9rabit de donn\u00e9es par seconde, soit l'\u00e9quivalent de 40 films en tr\u00e8s haute d\u00e9finition. L'enjeu est de cr\u00e9er une plateforme qui permette \u00e0 l'humain de s'exprimer de mani\u00e8re plus fluide.  Rep\u00e8res14 mai 1984 Naissance de Mark Elliot Zuckerberg \u00e0 White Plains, pr\u00e8s de New York.   2003 A 18 ans, il entre \u00e0 Harvard.   4 f\u00e9vrier 2004 Lancement de la premi\u00e8re version de The Facebook.   Fin 2004 Fort de 1 million d'utilisateurs, il abandonne Harvard.   D\u00e9cembre 2010 Elu personnalit\u00e9 de l'ann\u00e9e et personnalit\u00e9 la plus influente du monde par <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/tags/time-magazine\">Time Magazine</url>.\u00a0   18 mai 2012 Entr\u00e9e en Bourse de Facebook.   19 mai 2012 Mariage surprise avec Priscilla Chan.   2013 A 28 ans, il est le plus jeune patron du classement Fortune 500.\u00a0   Octobre 2014 Il ach\u00e8te 144 hectares sur l'\u00eele de Kauai (Hawaii) pour 65 millions de dollars.   30 novembre 2015 Naissance de sa fille Maxima. Il annonce qu'il fera don de 99 % de ses actions \u00e0 des oeuvres caritatives par le biais d'une fondation, la Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.   28 ao\u00fbt 2017 Naissance de sa deuxi\u00e8me fille, August.   2017 Doctorat en droit honoris causa de Harvard.   Un des probl\u00e8mes dans notre monde fragment\u00e9 est la croissance des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s. Cela est bien relat\u00e9 dans un de vos livres de chevet : \u00ab Portfolios of the Poor : How the World's Poor Live on $2 a Day \u00bb, o\u00f9 les chercheurs de Princeton expliquent que la moiti\u00e9 de la plan\u00e8te vit avec moins de 2 dollars par jour. La technologie peut-elle rebattre les cartes ?   Un des grands probl\u00e8mes de notre monde est que le talent est r\u00e9parti de mani\u00e8re \u00e9gale dans le monde, mais pas les opportunit\u00e9s. Il y a aussi des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s entre les personnes qui habitent dans les villes et celles qui vivent \u00e0 la campagne. Et dans la plupart des pays du monde, pour trouver un bon boulot, il faut d\u00e9m\u00e9nager dans une grande ville, ce qui cr\u00e9e des tensions dans l'immobilier. Alors, bien s\u00fbr, on va r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 des moyens de transport innovants, mais, aujourd'hui encore, les \u00ab bits \u00bb bougent plus vite que les \u00ab atomes \u00bb [une allusion au livre \u00ab Being Digital \u00bb, de <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/tags/nicholas-negroponte\">Nicholas Negroponte</url>, dans lequel le professeur du MIT fait la distinction entre la mati\u00e8re informationnelle, les bits, et la mati\u00e8re physique, les atomes, NDLR]. Sur le plan \u00e9conomique, vous devriez pouvoir travailler o\u00f9 vous voulez et les casques que nous mettons au point, comme Oculus Quest, permettent la \"t\u00e9l\u00e9portation\". Voici le monde dans lequel je veux vivre : un monde o\u00f9 chacun d'entre nous a les m\u00eames possibilit\u00e9s, sans \u00eatre p\u00e9nalis\u00e9 par l'endroit d'o\u00f9 il vient.   Les Big Tech sont accus\u00e9es d'avoir trop de pouvoir. On vous a reproch\u00e9 de ne pas suffisamment vous battre pour endiguer les discours haineux, les manipulations vid\u00e9o que sont les \u00ab deepfakes \u00bb, ou encore les ing\u00e9rences \u00e9lectorales de pays \u00e9trangers. Trouvez-vous ces craintes l\u00e9gitimes ?   Je pense que nous avons d\u00e9pass\u00e9 certains de ces probl\u00e8mes. Sur beaucoup, nous avons fait des progr\u00e8s. Mais il va falloir un peu de temps avant que le grand public nous refasse confiance. Et je trouve que c'est juste. Nous comprenons que nous avons d'\u00e9normes responsabilit\u00e9s. Nous cr\u00e9ons des services qui sont tr\u00e8s utilis\u00e9s et nous voulons \u00eatre s\u00fbrs que nous faisons un bon boulot. Mais j'ai compris que sur beaucoup de ces sujets nous devions prendre nos responsabilit\u00e9s. Mon espoir est que dans cinq ans les gens puissent dire que nous avons d\u00e9frich\u00e9 des voies et que nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 en avance pour r\u00e9gler ces probl\u00e8mes.   Il y a deux ans, vous avez pass\u00e9 vos vacances d'\u00e9t\u00e9 en Alaska, o\u00f9 vous vous \u00eates prononc\u00e9 pour une allocation universelle, qui doit permettre \u00e0 tous de vivre \u00e0 l'\u00e8re de l'intelligence artificielle et aider ceux qui en ont besoin \u00e0 se former \u00e0 un nouveau travail. Que devez-vous apprendre aux enfants aujourd'hui ?   La curiosit\u00e9. Car le monde change de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s rapide et de nouvelles choses sortent tout le temps.   1,16  million d'eurosC'est le faible montant d'imp\u00f4ts pay\u00e9s par Facebook en France en 2016.   C'est tout ?   Ma femme, Priscilla, et moi investissons par le biais d'un projet \u00e0 but non lucratif dans l'\u00e9ducation de demain. Et nous valorisons l'\u00e9ducation personnalis\u00e9e, tout comme l'apprentissage autonome, ou self-directed learning. Et il faut distinguer les \u00e9tudiants qui s'assoient dans une classe pour suivre un cours de ceux qui vont pouvoir jouer, exp\u00e9rimenter, prendre les choses en main. C'est une diff\u00e9rence de taille qui, je l'esp\u00e8re, sera valoris\u00e9e par les syst\u00e8mes scolaires du monde entier. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle, vous n'avez pas besoin d'un programmeur ultracomp\u00e9tent pour cr\u00e9er des programmes accessibles \u00e0 tous, comme des jeux de lasers, de ping-pong, ou encore les fl\u00e9chettes. Vous pouvez ensuite inviter des amis \u00e0 venir jouer avec vous. C'est excitant !   Vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9 durant vos \u00e9tudes par la lecture de \u00ab L'En\u00e9ide \u00bb de Virgile et par le parcours de l'empereur romain Auguste. La technologie peut-elle transmettre la connaissance et l'Histoire ?   La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle vous permet de vous rendre dans un endroit o\u00f9 il est difficile, voire impossible, d'aller. Cela va d'un happening artistique \u00e0 une plong\u00e9e dans un sc\u00e9nario imaginaire en passant par une reconstitution historique. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle peut \u00eatre extr\u00eamement utile pour former des chirurgiens ou pour comprendre ce que peut \u00eatre le quotidien d'un r\u00e9fugi\u00e9. Et ce sera la m\u00eame chose pour vivre la vie d'un personnage historique.   Hao Li, un professeur d'informatique \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de Californie du Sud, pr\u00e9voit une explosion de \u00ab deepfakes \u00bb dans les six mois. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle, qui est une arme d'immersion massive, ne risque-t-elle pas de voir se multiplier ces manipulations ?   C'est au contraire une meilleure valorisation de l'humain. Permettre \u00e0 tout le monde de s'exprimer est un formidable apport d'Internet, mais donner \u00e0 voir quelqu'un en face est encore mieux. C'est bien d'\u00eatre en ligne avec une personne, d'\u00e9changer, mais c'est encore mieux de voir le visage et les gestes de son interlocuteur. Par ailleurs, plus les gens peuvent avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des opportunit\u00e9s partout, pas forc\u00e9ment dans des villes, plus les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s sont stables.   Pourquoi ne pas aller directement vers la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e ? C'est tout de m\u00eame beaucoup plus riche que la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle...   La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e est plus mobile. Vous ne marchez pas dans la rue avec un casque de r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle sur les yeux. Je dirais que la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e est le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du futur quand la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle est la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision du futur. Et les deux sont importantes. OK, on ne transporte pas la t\u00e9l\u00e9 dans la rue, mais celle-ci compte pour la moiti\u00e9 du temps que nous passons devant nos \u00e9crans. Je parierais que la part de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle sera beaucoup plus importante que vous ne le pensez.   <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr#\">Cliquez ici pour Image, Audio ou Vid\u00e9o</url>Op\u00e9ration s\u00e9duction. Le\u00a0patron de Facebook fait son jogging place Tienanmen, \u00e0 P\u00e9kin, le 18\u00a0mars\u00a02016. Soumis \u00e0 la censure, Facebook est interdit en Chine.                                                              Mais plus grand-monde ne regarde la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision !   Si, vous la regardez sur votre mobile !   C'est vrai... Revenons au mat\u00e9riel. Google vient de faire la preuve de la supr\u00e9matie quantique avec un prototype de processeur capable d'effectuer en moins de quatre minutes une op\u00e9ration qui n\u00e9cessitait  dix mille ans \u00e0 un de nos supercalculateurs actuels. Faut-il se lancer dans cette course ?   Oui, cela pourra \u00eatre utile pour certains algorithmes.   Facebook a quinze ans. Peut-on esp\u00e9rer avoir des lentilles connect\u00e9es dans moins de quinze ans ?   Oui !   Moins de cinq ans ?   J'esp\u00e8re ! [Rires.] Mais regardez tout ce \u00e0 quoi nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 acc\u00e8s aujourd'hui. Nous faisons plus d'investissements dans le secteur que n'importe quelle entreprise du monde. Et les progr\u00e8s sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 stup\u00e9fiants. Il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, pour le m\u00eame type d'exp\u00e9rience, vous deviez mettre sur la table un casque de 600 dollars, un PC de quelques milliers de dollars, des \u00e9couteurs sp\u00e9cifiques et toute une connectique encombrante. Aujourd'hui, un seul casque \u00e0 400 dollars permet de voyager dans le temps et dans l'espace. Nous voulons rendre cette technologie accessible \u00e0 tous. C'est pour cette raison que nous avons investi l'an dernier 10,2 milliards de dollars, soit 20 % de notre chiffre d'affaires, en recherche dans le domaine de l'intelligence artificielle, de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle, de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e et pour mettre au point des centres de donn\u00e9es plus \u00e9cologiques.   Et la France dans tout cela ? Beaucoup de Fran\u00e7ais, comme Fidji Simo qui dirige l'application Facebook, Yann Le Cun, charg\u00e9 de l'IA, Julien Codorniou, responsable de Facebook at Work, ou encore David Marcus pour le projet libra, exercent des responsabilit\u00e9s au sein de l'entreprise. Pourquoi notre pays n'a-t-il pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se doter de son propre Facebook ?   Je pense que la France, et Paris en particulier, peut se distinguer dans le domaine de l'intelligence artificielle. Il faut vous focaliser sur vos domaines d'excellence. Si on compare la France au reste de l'Europe, vous \u00eates leader dans beaucoup de secteurs. Vous pouvez vous appuyer sur de bonnes universit\u00e9s, une forte comp\u00e9tence en math\u00e9matiques, des instituts de recherche de haut rang comme l'Inria, de tr\u00e8s belles start-up et des entreprises telles que Ubisoft.   Oui, c'est vrai. Mais pourquoi avons-nous peu de champions de la technologie compar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Chine et aux Etats-Unis ? En 1984, quand on a pos\u00e9 la question \u00e0 Steve Jobs, il a expliqu\u00e9 que c'est parce que l'Europe et la France, tout particuli\u00e8rement, avaient peur de l'\u00e9chec...  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lepoint.fr#\">Cliquez ici pour Image, Audio ou Vid\u00e9o</url>Le groupe Facebook, c'est55,8  milliards de dollarsde chiffre d'affaires 2018   22,1  milliards de dollarsen r\u00e9sultat net 2018   Le gouvernement a fait les bons choix en intelligence artificielle. C'est vrai, Steve l'a bien dit, il a longtemps \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile de d\u00e9marrer des entreprises en Europe. Mais nous avons \u00e0 coeur de soutenir l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me d'innovation en France et en Europe. Lorsque nous avons pris la d\u00e9cision de concevoir un centre consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intelligence artificielle \u00e0 Paris [pr\u00e8s de 100 chercheurs aujourd'hui \u00e0 Paris, NDLR], nous voulions vraiment que ce soit pour du long terme, pour au moins quinze ou vingt ans.   Concernant libra, la cryptomonnaie de Facebook (lire p. 90), comprenez-vous les r\u00e9ticences de certains gouvernements, dont celui de la France ?   Je pense que les personnes qui vont le plus b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de ce service sont celles qui n'ont pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me financier aujourd'hui. Aux Etats-Unis ou en Europe, nous avons acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me mon\u00e9taire stable, \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de paiement qui fonctionne bien. Sans doute libra apportera-t-elle des fonctions qui ne sont pas d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es comme le micropaiement, mais elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiera essentiellement aux pays en d\u00e9veloppement, o\u00f9 la population a difficilement acc\u00e8s aux services bancaires. Ou, dans le cas o\u00f9 il existe une monnaie, lorsque le gouvernement risque de vous la prendre ou de jouer sur l'inflation en lui faisant perdre de la valeur. Donc, je pense que des centaines de millions - sans doute m\u00eame des milliards - de personnes dans le monde ont besoin d'un service comme libra. J'ai bien conscience que la blockchain est une technologie \u00e9mergente. Nous ne lancerons pas les services relatifs \u00e0 la cryptomonnaie libra tant que nous n'aurons pas eu les accords du r\u00e9gulateur de chaque pays.   20  bureaux aux Etats-Unis et47  \u00e0 l'international(au 30 juin 2019).   15  data centers39 651  employ\u00e9sEtudiant, vous saviez parler fran\u00e7ais, h\u00e9breu, latin, grec ancien...   Je ne dirais pas que je les parlais couramment, mais j'ai appris ces langues [rires].   Aujourd'hui, vous apprenez le mandarin pour entrer un jour sur le march\u00e9 chinois, o\u00f9 vous devez affronter la concurrence de WeChat. Si vous refaisiez votre vie, quelles erreurs \u00e9viteriez-vous de commettre ?   Je ne sais pas [silence]. C'est une question stimulante mais difficile.   Imaginiez-vous qu'un jour vous vous retrouveriez face \u00e0 des membres du Congr\u00e8s qui appellent \u00e0 d\u00e9manteler votre entreprise ?   Je ne savais pas encore que j'allais cr\u00e9er mon entreprise. C'est vrai que je voulais mener quelques chantiers. Et il est apparu que monter une entreprise \u00e9tait le meilleur moyen de r\u00e9aliser cela. Car vous pouvez embaucher des gens exceptionnels, vous pouvez bien les payer tout en mettant au point des choses qui comptent et qui changent la vie. Pour ce qui concerne le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement, je ne vois pas en quoi cela r\u00e9soudrait les questions essentielles de l'industrie, comme la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e, la gestion des \u00e9lections et la lutte contre les contenus offensants. J'appelle de mes voeux une r\u00e9gulation juste et identique pour toutes les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de la technologie. D'ailleurs, si nous venions \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9mantel\u00e9s, cela se traduirait par moins de ressources pour relever ces d\u00e9fis.   Vous avez mis entre parenth\u00e8ses le projet Aquila d'un drone solaire qui devait fournir un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet aux r\u00e9gions du monde mal desservies. Ce n'est plus d'actualit\u00e9 ?   Si, au contraire ! Nous reviendrons sans doute avec un projet Aquila modifi\u00e9.

The proposal, which includes reining in big online platforms and could still be tweaked ahead of their presentation on Feb. 19, underlines the EU's determination to break U.S. tech giants' stranglehold on vast troves of data and better compete with Chinese rivals. </p><p>\"Currently a small number of big tech firms hold a large part of the world's data. This is a major weakness for data-driven businesses to emerge, grow and innovate today, including in Europe, but huge opportunities lie ahead,\" a paper laying out the proposal said. The 25-page document also underlined the urgency of the task ahead. \"Competitors such as China and the U.S. are already innovating quickly and projecting their concepts of data access and use across the globe,\" it said. By capitalizing on Europe's vast quantities of industrial and professional data and technological innovation, the bloc can surge ahead, the document said. \"The winners of today will not necessarily be the winners of tomorrow,\" according to the paper. It said the objective is \"to create a single European data space, a genuine single market for data\". Measures to achieve that goal include an array of new rules covering cross-border data use, data interoperability and standards related to manufacturing, climate change, the auto industry, healthcare, financial services, agriculture and energy. Other rules in the coming months will open up more public data on geospatial, the environment, meteorology, statistics and companies' data across the bloc for companies to use for free. The document also proposed scraping relevant competition rules which hinder data sharing and possibly introducing rules to prevent large online platforms from unilaterally imposing conditions for access and use of data or benefiting in a disproportionate manner. The European Commission and an expert group set up last year to assist it are now looking into the vast amount of data collected by big tech companies and the way they use and share the data. \"On the basis of this fact finding, the Commission will consider how best to address more systemic issues, including by ex ante regulation if appropriate, to ensure that markets stay open and fair,\" the paper said.

(OTCQX: WEYL) is eyeing many opportunities and has already outperformed its 2018 revenue numbers, company CEO, Brent Suen stated in a recent interview with Investorideas.com[2].Listen to the podcast       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorideas.com/Audio/Podcasts/2019/103119-CEO-OTCQXWEYL.mp3\">https://www.investorideas.com/Audio/Podcasts/2019/103119-CEO-OTCQXWEYL.mp3</url>[3]\"For 2018 we had top line revenues of $22.6 million,\" he said. </p><p>\"This year, in the first nine months of operations based on our preliminary announcement we're already exceeding last year's entire full-year numbers in the first nine months of this year. That is due to distribution partners, or what we call white label partnerships, who are seeing considerably higher growth from the additional functionality that we added in over this past nine months.\"Weyland, a developer and global provider of mobile business software applications, operates its CreateApp\u2122 platform-as-a-service (PaaS) across three continents and 10 countries, including some of the fastest-growing emerging markets in Southeast Asia. Suen indicated that a top priority of the company is an uplisting, which would enhance the company's profile and opportunities.\"The biggest one is the uplisting to Nasdaq, and that's key to expanding a much higher level of visibility which in turn would enable, or certainly imply, a higher market cap,\" he said. \"And subsequently the ability to fund a more exponential expansion plan.\"\"We believe that, upon gaining shareholder approval for management's discretion on a reverse split, we will be able to exercise a modest reverse split and immediately qualify for Nasdaq,\" he continued. \"We expect that to happen before the end of the year. And we're also, alongside that, evaluating merger and acquisition opportunities that would not only increase our scale, but would also increase the pipeline for products and services and also geographic expansion.\"Weyland typically enters markets with its CreateApp\u2122 platform-as-a-service (PaaS) application, which allows micro and small businesses to design apps themselves, and market and promote their goods and services to their end customers much more affordably than having a third party designer.\"Our app, CreateApp\u2122, enables the business owner to do a number of things, but the four primary ones are: a) to market and promote their goods and services, b) to enable them to sell online through the phone, c) to pay for them through the phone, and then d) have them delivered through logistics delivery or courier if it's nearby.What's interesting about ours is that it can be created by our customer within one to two hours at a maximum, and that's with zero technical skills,\" he said. \"It's extremely important because most micro to small business owners typically wouldn't have the time, expertise or resources available to build their own app. So what we provide is a very simple and streamlined toolkit to do so. Further, [for] the app itself, what we price to our clients at an average of $20 to $25 per month. And that compared to having a native app custom built by a professional services firm is actually quite inexpensive.\"The company is taking a different approach to the Indonesian market, where roughly 70 percent of the population is unbanked, according to Suen, and therefore rely on alternatives such as e-wallets. Because of this, Weyland has entered the Indonesian market via its subsidiary, WeylandIndonesia Perkasa (WIP), and its ewallet Atozpay.\"When you don't have bank accounts or credit cards trying to sell things through the phone - e-commerce and m-commerce - is extraordinarily difficult to do in that type of environment,\" he said. \"So what has ended up happening is that the prevalence of mobile payments or e-wallets, of which Atozpay is, has gained tremendous traction in Indonesia.\"On the subject of Indonesia, with it being the fourth-most populous country in the world and boasting a growing confluence of big tech players and equity funds, Suen posits that it holds tremendous potential for investors.\"What I've found in the past two years of being back [in the U.S.], when I talk to potential investors about Indonesia, most of the response, very naturally is, 'that's an entire world away',\" he said.\"There are currently over 15 tech companies based in Indonesia that have what are called unicorn valuations,\" he said. \"So, anything valued at a billion dollars or more would imply that it's a Unicorn valuation. Several are actually higher than ten billion and this is notable because every major global tech giant has investments in these 15.\"\"Not only are the big strategic tech companies making investments in these 15, we are also seeing the world's leading private equity funds investing as well,\" he added. \"What you have is a landscape that's a who's who of global tech companies, a who's who of private equity funds and venture capital funds, and what we're going to see very soon is an impending wave of IPOs here in the US.\"Suen said that the company's activities in Indonesia, coupled with its other developments, position it favorably for strategic investments or possibly acquisition.\"It puts us on the path for potential strategic investment in or an acquisition of, our Indonesian subsidiary by one of these larger companies,\" he said. \"What we believe will happen, is someone like Grab[4] - which is currently a $16 billion valued company operating in Southeast Asia in its entirety - we believe that they will be a strategic investor in Weyland Indonesia Perkasa, or potentially acquire us.\"The Investorideas.com podcasts are also available on iTunes, Spotify, Tunein, Stitcher, Spreaker.com, iHeartRadio and Google Play Music.Visit the Podcast page at Investorideas.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorideas.com/Audio\">https://www.investorideas.com/Audio</url>/[5]About Investorideas.com - News that Inspires Big Investing Ideas Investorideas.com is a recognized news source publishing third party news, research and original financial content.

(OTCQX: WEYL) is eyeing many opportunities and has already outperformed its 2018 revenue numbers, company CEO, Brent Suen stated in a recent interview with Investorideas.com.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Listen to the podcast</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorideas.com/Audio/Podcasts/2019/103119-CEO-OTCQXWEYL.mp3\">https://www.investorideas.com/Audio/Podcasts/2019/103119-CEO-OTCQXWEYL.mp3</url></p><p>\"For 2018 we had top line revenues of $22.6 million,\" he said. \"This year, in the first nine months of operations \u2026 based on our preliminary announcement \u2026 we're already exceeding last year's entire full-year numbers in the first nine months of this year. That is due to distribution partners, or what we call white label partnerships, who are seeing considerably higher growth from the additional functionality that we added in over this past nine months.\"</p><p>Weyland, a developer and global provider of mobile business software applications, operates its CreateApp\u2122 platform-as-a-service (PaaS) across three continents and 10 countries, including some of the fastest-growing emerging markets in Southeast Asia. Suen indicated that a top priority of the company is an uplisting, which would enhance the company's profile and opportunities.</p><p>\"The biggest one is the uplisting to Nasdaq, and that's key to expanding a much higher level of visibility which in turn would enable, or certainly imply, a higher market cap,\" he said. \"And subsequently the ability to fund a more exponential expansion plan.\"</p><p>\"We believe that, upon gaining shareholder approval for management's discretion on a reverse split, we will be able to exercise a modest reverse split and immediately qualify for Nasdaq,\" he continued. \"We expect that to happen before the end of the year. And we're also, alongside that, evaluating merger and acquisition opportunities that would not only increase our scale, but would also increase the pipeline for products and services and also geographic expansion.\"</p><p>Weyland typically enters markets with its CreateApp\u2122 platform-as-a-service (PaaS) application, which allows micro and small businesses to design apps themselves, and market and promote their goods and services to their end customers much more affordably than having a third party designer.</p><p>\"Our app, CreateApp\u2122, enables the business owner to do a number of things, but the four primary ones are: a) to market and promote their goods and services, b) to enable them to sell online through the phone, c) to pay for them through the phone, and then d) have them delivered through logistics delivery or courier if it's nearby.</p><p>What's interesting about ours is that it can be created by our customer within one to two hours at a maximum, and that's with zero technical skills,\" he said. \"It's extremely important because most micro to small business owners \u2026 typically wouldn't have the time, expertise or resources available to build their own app. So what we provide is a very simple and streamlined toolkit to do so. Further, [for] the app itself, what we price to our clients at an average of $20 to $25 per month. And that compared to having a native app custom built by a professional services firm is actually quite inexpensive.\"</p><p>The company is taking a different approach to the Indonesian market, where roughly 70 percent of the population is unbanked, according to Suen, and therefore rely on alternatives such as e-wallets. Because of this, Weyland has entered the Indonesian market via its subsidiary, WeylandIndonesia Perkasa (WIP), and its ewallet Atozpay.</p><p>\"When you don't have bank accounts or credit cards \u2026 trying to sell things through the phone - e-commerce and m-commerce - is extraordinarily difficult to do in that type of environment,\" he said. \"So what has ended up happening is that the prevalence of mobile payments or e-wallets, of which Atozpay is, has gained tremendous traction in Indonesia.\"</p><p>On the subject of Indonesia, with it being the fourth-most populous country in the world and boasting a growing confluence of big tech players and equity funds, Suen posits that it holds tremendous potential for investors.</p><p>\"What I've found in the past two years of being back [in the U.S.], when I talk to potential investors \u2026 about Indonesia, most of the response, very naturally is, 'that's an entire world away',\" he said.</p><p>\"There are currently over 15 tech companies based in Indonesia that have what are called unicorn valuations,\" he said. \"So, anything valued at a billion dollars or more would imply that it's a Unicorn valuation. Several are actually higher than ten billion and this is notable because every major global tech giant has investments in these 15.\"</p><p>\"Not only are the big strategic tech companies making investments in these 15, we are also seeing the world's leading private equity funds investing as well,\" he added. \"What you have is a landscape that's a who's who of global tech companies, a who's who of private equity funds and venture capital funds, and what we're going to see very soon is an impending wave of IPOs here in the US.\"</p><p>Suen said that the company's activities in Indonesia, coupled with its other developments, position it favorably for strategic investments or possibly acquisition.</p><p>\"It puts us on the path for potential strategic investment in or an acquisition of, our Indonesian subsidiary by one of these larger companies,\" he said. \"What we believe will happen, is someone like Grab - which is currently a $16 billion valued company operating in Southeast Asia in its entirety - we believe that they will be a strategic investor in Weyland Indonesia Perkasa, or potentially acquire us.\"</p><p>The Investorideas.com podcasts are also available on iTunes, Spotify, Tunein, Stitcher, Spreaker.com, iHeartRadio and Google Play Music.</p><p>Visit the Podcast page at Investorideas.com:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorideas.com/Audio\">https://www.investorideas.com/Audio</url>/</p><p>About Investorideas.com - News that Inspires Big Investing Ideas Investorideas.com is a recognized news source publishing third party news, research and original financial content.

(OTCQX: WEYL) is eyeing many opportunities and has already outperformed its 2018 revenue numbers, company CEO, Brent Suen stated in a recent interview with Investorideas.com[2].Listen to the podcast       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorideas.com/Audio/Podcasts/2019/103119-CEO-OTCQXWEYL.mp3\">https://www.investorideas.com/Audio/Podcasts/2019/103119-CEO-OTCQXWEYL.mp3</url>[3]\"For 2018 we had top line revenues of $22.6 million,\" he said. </p><p>\"This year, in the first nine months of operations based on our preliminary announcement we're already exceeding last year's entire full-year numbers in the first nine months of this year. That is due to distribution partners, or what we call white label partnerships, who are seeing considerably higher growth from the additional functionality that we added in over this past nine months.\"Weyland, a developer and global provider of mobile business software applications, operates its CreateApp\u2122 platform-as-a-service (PaaS) across three continents and 10 countries, including some of the fastest-growing emerging markets in Southeast Asia. Suen indicated that a top priority of the company is an uplisting, which would enhance the company's profile and opportunities.\"The biggest one is the uplisting to Nasdaq, and that's key to expanding a much higher level of visibility which in turn would enable, or certainly imply, a higher market cap,\" he said. \"And subsequently the ability to fund a more exponential expansion plan.\"\"We believe that, upon gaining shareholder approval for management's discretion on a reverse split, we will be able to exercise a modest reverse split and immediately qualify for Nasdaq,\" he continued. \"We expect that to happen before the end of the year. And we're also, alongside that, evaluating merger and acquisition opportunities that would not only increase our scale, but would also increase the pipeline for products and services and also geographic expansion.\"Weyland typically enters markets with its CreateApp\u2122 platform-as-a-service (PaaS) application, which allows micro and small businesses to design apps themselves, and market and promote their goods and services to their end customers much more affordably than having a third party designer.\"Our app, CreateApp\u2122, enables the business owner to do a number of things, but the four primary ones are: a) to market and promote their goods and services, b) to enable them to sell online through the phone, c) to pay for them through the phone, and then d) have them delivered through logistics delivery or courier if it's nearby.What's interesting about ours is that it can be created by our customer within one to two hours at a maximum, and that's with zero technical skills,\" he said. \"It's extremely important because most micro to small business owners typically wouldn't have the time, expertise or resources available to build their own app. So what we provide is a very simple and streamlined toolkit to do so. Further, [for] the app itself, what we price to our clients at an average of $20 to $25 per month. And that compared to having a native app custom built by a professional services firm is actually quite inexpensive.\"The company is taking a different approach to the Indonesian market, where roughly 70 percent of the population is unbanked, according to Suen, and therefore rely on alternatives such as e-wallets. Because of this, Weyland has entered the Indonesian market via its subsidiary, WeylandIndonesia Perkasa (WIP), and its ewallet Atozpay.\"When you don't have bank accounts or credit cards trying to sell things through the phone - e-commerce and m-commerce - is extraordinarily difficult to do in that type of environment,\" he said. \"So what has ended up happening is that the prevalence of mobile payments or e-wallets, of which Atozpay is, has gained tremendous traction in Indonesia.\"On the subject of Indonesia, with it being the fourth-most populous country in the world and boasting a growing confluence of big tech players and equity funds, Suen posits that it holds tremendous potential for investors.\"What I've found in the past two years of being back [in the U.S.], when I talk to potential investors about Indonesia, most of the response, very naturally is, 'that's an entire world away',\" he said.\"There are currently over 15 tech companies based in Indonesia that have what are called unicorn valuations,\" he said. \"So, anything valued at a billion dollars or more would imply that it's a Unicorn valuation. Several are actually higher than ten billion and this is notable because every major global tech giant has investments in these 15.\"\"Not only are the big strategic tech companies making investments in these 15, we are also seeing the world's leading private equity funds investing as well,\" he added. \"What you have is a landscape that's a who's who of global tech companies, a who's who of private equity funds and venture capital funds, and what we're going to see very soon is an impending wave of IPOs here in the US.\"Suen said that the company's activities in Indonesia, coupled with its other developments, position it favorably for strategic investments or possibly acquisition.\"It puts us on the path for potential strategic investment in or an acquisition of, our Indonesian subsidiary by one of these larger companies,\" he said. \"What we believe will happen, is someone like Grab[4] - which is currently a $16 billion valued company operating in Southeast Asia in its entirety - we believe that they will be a strategic investor in Weyland Indonesia Perkasa, or potentially acquire us.\"The Investorideas.com podcasts are also available on iTunes, Spotify, Tunein, Stitcher, Spreaker.com, iHeartRadio and Google Play Music.Visit the Podcast page at Investorideas.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorideas.com/Audio\">https://www.investorideas.com/Audio</url>/[5]About Investorideas.com - News that Inspires Big Investing Ideas Investorideas.com is a recognized news source publishing third party news, research and original financial content.

O, whose father is South Korean, is one of French President Emmanuel Macron's earliest followers, and has been influential in shaping the president's thinking on Big Tech as an advisor at the Elysee palace in the first two years of Macron's presidency. The decision by the world's biggest social media network comes after successive meetings between Zuckerberg and Macron, who wants to take a leading role globally on the regulation of hate speech and the spread of false information online. So far, Facebook has cooperated with French justice on matters related to terrorist attacks and violent acts by transferring the IP addresses and other identification data of suspected individuals to French judges who formally demanded it. </p><p>Following a meeting between Nick Clegg, Facebook's head of global affairs, and O last week, the social media company has extended this cooperation to hate speech. \"This is huge news, it means that the judicial process will be able to run normally,\" O told Reuters in an interview. \"It's really very important, they're only doing it for France.\" O, who said he had been in close contact with Clegg over the last few days on the issue, said Facebook's decision was the result of an ongoing conversation between the internet giant and the French administration. Since his nomination as minister in March, O has made the fight against hate speech online a key priority through regular contacts with Facebook's top executives, including founder Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook declined to comment. STRONG SIGNAL \"It is a strong signal in terms of regulation,\" said Sonia Cisse, a counsel at law firm Linklaters, adding that it was a world first. \"Hate speech is no longer considered part of freedom of speech, it's now on the same level as terrorism.\" With Facebook's latest move, France is now a clear frontrunner in the quest to regulate big social media outlets, and other platforms might follow suite, Cisse said. The discussions on how to best regulate tech giants began with a Zuckerberg-Macron meeting last year, followed by a report on tech regulation last month that Facebook's founder considered could be a blueprint for wider EU regulation. Facebook had refrained from handing over identification data of people suspected of hate speech because it was not compelled to do so under U.S.-French legal conventions and because it was worried countries without an independent judiciary could abuse it. France's parliament, where Macron's ruling party has a comfortable majority, is debating legislation that would give the new regulator the power to fine tech companies up to 4per cent of their global revenue if they don't do enough to remove hateful content from their network. O also signaled his openness to seeing French startups being snapped up by larger U.S. companies, in a spite of recent measures taken by Macron's government to bolster anti-takeover rules to protect the country's strategic companies. \"My only goal is to spur the creation of a lot of companies,\" he said. \"I have no problem with the fact that some of them are bought by U.S. companies, as long as they don't have critical technology.\" TOO BIG The minister is also reluctant to support the idea of breaking up companies like Facebook or Google, whose size, weight on the Internet and financial firepower have turned them into systemic players just as much as big banks. Facebook has been called a social media monopoly by co-founder Chris Hughes, and calls for a break-up of the group have intensified. \"We cannot impose very tough obligations on Western companies and dismantle them because they are very big, and not do the same thing with Chinese companies that enter the Western market,\" he said, referring to groups like Alibaba and Tencent. A graduate of France's top business school, HEC, O combines political experience - he was an aide to Dominique Strauss-Khan, like many of the tight group of \"Macron Boys\" who propelled him to power - and a stint in the private sector, at engine maker Safran. At the Elysee, he was in charge of advising Macron on the French government's vast portfolio of stakes in French companies, having to deal with hot corporate sagas such as Renault-Nissan, as well as handling relations with Big Tech.

Samsung may be the best example of this, as over the past few years it has expanded its offerings to include even high-end ultrasound machines. We had a chance to sit down with Dr. David Rhew, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Healthcare and Fitness at Samsung Electronics America, and ask him a bunch of questions about how contemporary technology can improve medical care, help individuals monitor their health, and improve clinical outcomes while lowering overall costs. Here's the audio of the interview followed by the transcript: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/samsung-mp3cut.net_.mp3\">https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/samsung-mp3cut.net_.mp3</url>\u00a0 Medgadget: Thank you for having us. When did Samsung create the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) position? David Rhew, MD: About five years ago. A little background on myself. I'm a physician. I've been in healthcare technology for the past 20 years. I've spent a large part of my time thinking about how technology can be used to improve outcomes, so access to care, quality of care, thinking of ways you can improve the efficiency of care and reduce cost and improve that overall patient experience. My semi-early research was around how you could build technology solutions that could inform individuals. I started really in the provider space looking at something which today is now known as clinical decision support but back then in 1990s, no one really knew what CDSS was. It was just about alerts, medication alerts, but what we realized was that there was a huge opportunity to build this into the electronic health record. I really started spending a lot of time. I have a computer science background. I do a lot of programming and artificial intelligence and essentially created a startup that was owned by Cedars-Sinai. That startup started doing pretty well, started integrating to the EHRs. I should say we started doing well outside of the EHRs and then Cedars acquired us. Next thing I knew I'm in the whole health IT space and really building these technology solutions that are well integrated into the clinician workflow. As you know healthcare is really moving outside of the hospital and so much of what we're seeing today is the need to engage patients and consumers' families, so the opportunity to apply that same approach, providing the right information at the right time, we need to have a different type of infrastructure. It's not about an EHR or even the patient portal, it's about use of technologies that patients and consumers and families would use every single day. Smartphone, wearable, TV, home appliance, sensors around the home, newer things, things that are embedded in you, all that. That is a really exciting new area and Samsung was very interested. Obviously it has a very strong footprint in the consumer space and they had been looking for quite some time to really help understand this a little better.\u00a0I'd say over the past five years we've been looking at how a lot of the Samsung technologies could be used to really address and improve these outcomes. We were looking at it in two fronts. One was from a pure consumer perspective. If we launch a new product, how can consumers readily use this and take advantage of the benefits? But also on the enterprise side, which is where I sit, which is looking at how can enterprise organizations like hospitals, health systems, payers, medical device companies use these to deliver on their specific business objectives, which in many cases are the exact same things. It is improving the quality, reducing cost, but at the same time growing the business around it. We work with both groups. We have solutions that I have really been spending a lot of time looking to make sure they're vetted because we really want to make sure these are validated and things that work well. We look to launch them and we launch them with small, medium, and large-size companies.  Medgadget: Have you acquired any start ups that help you in this? David: There has been some M...ctivity. We have I would say for the most part a bit been doing more partnerships and I would say we've also been doing a lot internal development, so there's a lot of innovation that occurs on the device itself. As we look at wearable, we have talked quite acceptedly about what are the features on the wearable that need to be improved upon to make this a much more marketable device not just for the broader consumer, but also for healthcare. If we look at the phone and what are the features on that, what are the capabilities and how does one address security in all of this? It's interesting because a lot of the same things that we see in other industries, the same challenges, are really the same challenges we have in healthcare, a special issue with to deploy it. Is this device secure? Can you do mobile device management around it? Can you customize the user experience on this? How do you rapidly deploy it? Things like that so we've been thinking a bit about enterprise and then specifically around healthcare.  Medgadget: You mentioned security but also there is a regulatory process. Do you have any concerns about the FDA regulatory process in terms of I remember 10 years ago, there was concern among companies who were developing for example software for a cell phone to process glucometry readings. There was no clear guidance from the FDA at the time, whether it falls under their jurisdiction or not and what the regulatory requirements are. Are you working with FDA? David: Absolutely. In fact, I just met with Bakul Patel who leads the digital health component of the FDA yesterday. We engage with the FDA regularly on several initiatives. I'm not sure if you heard that there was a program that was launched. It's a pre-certification program with start-up companies we selected. I have a pool of [unintelligible] that we're looking to basically do sort of a TSA Precheck, where you go and get this vetting and then all of the solutions that we launch are fast-tracked through the FDA. We really want to find ways to work with the FDA to be able to bring some of these really highly innovative solutions to market. I think the FDA has also signaled in many different ways their eagerness to be able to do that as well.  Medgadget: Are you working with other big tech companies on strategy? David: Absolutely, yes. It's funny again, just yesterday, I've had meetings with some of the big-time tech players as well as small, medium, and large. We have found that a lot of innovation occurs in players that are a little more niche specific, so if you want a specific type of solution that will address readmissions in the home, there's a great solution provider named Vivify Health. Vivify Health has a very broad market share in terms of that and they've created a wonderful opportunity to be able to use that. We work with large payers, United Health Group. We just launched a major initiative using our wearables within their corporate wellness program. Across the board, we work with different size companies and different partners.  Medgadget: What are the areas you see the most growth in in terms of just the tech itself and then also in the EHR healthcare clinical side? David: If you look at the industry as a whole, there's been a lot of innovation that's occurring on the sensor side for whether it's the phone, the wearable, or even other types of devices. We're going to continue to see a lot of really interesting things come out there and some of which blend over into some of what we call the medical space, so a lot of these medical devices that are classically FDA certified devices. We're already seeing today that you can show the data but where we're actually heading, this is a large part of what we think a lot about, is how could you actually change the entire consumer experience or the patient experience so that it's not just watching it on it but actually managing it on your smartphone or your watch? That's going to be really transformative when you really have the ability to control all the things in your body, outside your body, and around your environment with your smartphone or with your smartwatch. I think we're getting there. One of the reasons why this has been top of mind to a lot of folks at Samsung as well as the device companies ties into security, because right now security is not adequately addressed in many industries. In healthcare, if you look at the number of cyber attacks that occur, 84% of them are occurring at the app layer, so it's not about having a device that you can brick which is the current solution. It's about being able to have that protective layer. It's almost like a super antivirus that protects the applications as they're functioning. What we have recognized is that if you're going to do that, you're going to need to create a hardware-software protective layer called Knox, which is what we call it, I should say. `We've created one and it enables the data to be secured both at rest and in transit. It's been rated by Gartner over the past two years as the most secure enterprise platform. It's being used by government agencies extensively and it's also being used by the financial organizations, the large, big ones JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs. What we recognize is that this security platform is on a Samsung device so most people historically have figured Android has got a lot of vulnerabilities, this has actually turned that weakness into one of our greatest strengths because now we actually have something that is vibrated by Gartner, even more secure than BlackBerry devices which is pretty remarkable when you think about how we have evolved in terms of our thoughts, in terms of what these devices can do. At the same time as we think about where healthcare is going, a lot of as you start integrating some medical devices and the data on there, that has to be secured.Whether it's on the watch, whether it's on the phone and so we've leveraged the Knox platform with all our Galaxy phones, our wearables, tablets and we continue to push that. That's the reason why for us we think that there's a great opportunity to be able to leverage some of the things that we've got here on the Samsung side.  Medgadget: In terms of the wearables, is there anything large that you guys are working on? I read about this Simband a couple years ago in 2014, that's kind of died down and the rumors that is coming back is that because of the sensor functionality. David: Yes it never died. That's good news. The funny thing is as we look to build this out and we actually had fully functional models that were working. It worked great, the only problem was it was just too darn expensive. There was a non-market viable solution. What we realized is we're going to really have to think not just through the sensors but what makes sense in terms of putting it onto a device and how do you position or market that device because, as you all know, there's a balance, there's a trade-off between all the great things that you can do on a SmartWatch and the battery. It drains the battery, the more you do all these different things and so we've really been thinking about target specific use cases for which things and how do we leverage that. You'll see either components or sets of components from the Simband and other types of things that we've been working on being brought into our product roadmap as we launch new products. The quick answer is 'yes' there's a lot of some really exciting stuff, probably stuff that were related to Simband and other things because we've been thinking a lot about sensor technology. We will probably start seeing that come out in some of the later version things of the different wearables.  Medgadget: How about the data that you collect from the sensors and stuff? Do you have a system similar to some of the studies going on like the Baseline study with Google and then NIH has also has one where they're trying to collect all the patient data and Samsung trying to partner with one of those? David: Yes we've been talking to healthcare organizations. We talked pretty extensively to a lot of organizations that are interested in this from data collection, population health management of assessing trends, assessing a detection of unusual activity, arrhythmias and things like that. A lot of interest in and all of that because we think that there's really great potential for that, and I would say that is one path that we're looking at. The other path that we're looking at is how can you use a wearable, like consumer grade wearable to improve the health of a specific individual. This isn't just about, oh you help me diagnose Afib or whatever and I didn't know. I'm talking about I just had a heart attack, I'm in the hospital, I've been asked to undergo cardiac rehabilitation. Cardiac rehabilitation is a six to eight week program. The doctor is telling me that I have to come in three times a week, spend 30 to 45 minutes there. I've got kids, I've got a job, I live far away, I live in cold weather, it's icy. How am I going to be able to make this and what we see traditionally is that people will start off because this has been recommended, and then they'll just drop off. The completion rates for these programs are really low. I mean 10-40% or so nationwide. We digitized that whole cardiac rehab program on the smartwatch and we tested this at clinical facility and we've actually had incredible results. We doubled, we went from 40% to over 80%. We nearly double that. When we asked the cardiologist what that meant, the clinicians that were involved they said according to the systematic reviews and med analysis on cardiac rehab, for every four patients that complete this program, one, you're saving a life. We're recognizing that the opportunity is real in terms of true clinical practice. You can virtualize care on a smartwatch, put it into a program, deploy it, and have tremendous help, improvements in care and obviously in terms of quality and cost as well.  Medgadget: I think wearables have been around long enough now that there's a wearable fatigue and things like that. When you put a smartwatch on someone they might be compliant for the amount of time it takes to do this study but after that do you have any methods that you're trying to push for it? David: Yes that's the big challenge today. I think if you look at wearables, there's a certain group of people that will take wearables and readily use them and get good health benefits from it, but the majority of folks will either not use it or they'll use it very briefly and then give up. For those you really do need a mechanism to incentivize them and to keep them well supported. We've been looking at both angles. United Health Group incentivizes their employees to use this through the fit program, which they basically get paid to achieve certain activity goals both in terms of frequency, the intensity, and the total number of steps they do. When they achieve those they get more money. I mean it's a great program, but it is one that obviously is tied into the financial incentive. There is also an element around support and social support, and we see this and this ties into that cardiac rehab program I talked about. A large part of the reason why that works, no one was getting paid for it, the reason they're doing is because on the back end you've got the clinician, you got the groups basically saying, 'Hey I noticed that you're really not tracking your activity today.' Give them a phone call and they know that there's somebody there supporting them, or in other cases somebody needs help and then you push your button and then you guide a back end. You'll be hearing today, if you're able to attend, we launched a new product with mobile health, it is a wearable that is specifically designed for seniors. What we wanted to do was, back to the earlier point about wearables and adoption, if you take a wearable and give it to a senior and you say that this is your new purse device. It's got 4G connectivity, well they'll be like it's got so many apps, they're so small, what do I do? So you have to simplify it. We made it real simple, there's a big button there that says help. And the other thing that we learned is that when somebody calls, when you answer it you have to go and swipe it, that's another step. We reconfigured the watch so that when the emergency call comes in it automatically answers after this sequence of help because that's a sequence that we know you do not need to have them answer. We had to reconfigure using Knox and a variety of other tools for the device to be able to do that. That's the commitment that we're making and we have great consumer devices that can be used for a lot of fun and exciting things, but if you're going to look at specific conditions in certain scenarios we're going to need to think about the security, the customization, the mobile device management, all of this and that's the type of stuff that we spend a lot of time working on.  Medgadget: Do you think Samsung will be moving into implantables one day? David: We are working very closely with medical device companies that are doing implantables. So through partnerships, the answer will be yes. Whether we ourselves do that I guess that's TBD. I would say for the time being much of our focus is on focusing on specifically how we can change the consumer experience outside of the implantable, whether it's a continuous glucose monitoring or neuromodulation, all of those things today require a certain amount of FDA approval to go through as well as surgery and all the other things. There are many groups that do that very, very well. It's not our goal to be able to change that but at the same time as we think about how that experience extends outside of the body, we're kind of now when we tie to the hip to create a solution that works well. I think it's not just about sending it to a smartwatch and watching it. It's really now about the entire work flow so that's the reason why we spend a lot of time thinking about it. It's more than just simply viewing the data.  Medgadget: We\u00a0know that Samsung is a big company in terms of semiconductors. Do you know how to improve some of the implantables from that perspective, their functionalities from inside? David: It could be. It's not an area that we've been spending too much time looking at. Mostly through partnerships, we're relying very heavily on the established medical device companies. They could be medium or large sized ones, they don't necessarily have to be all the big ones.  Medgadget: How does Samsung as such a large company manage all these things. Do you have incubation teams or a lot of different teams focusing on different targeted areas of healthcare and fitness? David: Yes, we do. I would say there's really two groups that are spending time thinking a lot about healthcare. I manage the group that is the Samsung Electronics America. We're more of a commercial arm. We look at solutions that are already vetted or need to be vetted. And we figure out ways that we can work together and make those adjustments to make this a market viable solution. We go to market and plan that. On the other side, there is a large number of, again, R...abs. We're constantly doing innovation with other partners, we're learning more about what needs to be done and we're trying to think of what's the next great innovation? You're going to probably hear more about this in the coming months because there's been a lot of-exciting stuff being done. I would say, the third, which is really becoming a big area of focus for us is around the overall platform that allows us to be able to capture consumer/patient health data that will then allow the patient or consumer to share that with certain individuals to do virtual care. Samsung Health, aka S-health, is an application that used to be just on smart phones and that would allow you to be able to track your own fitness. We added it to the watch, its about you taking care of yourself. Then you could share it with your family, then you could share it with your physician. What we realised is that if we go to the point where we actually want this to be meaningful, we had to go beyond simply just creating a little portal where people can send it. We had to create a way that the physician could help provide the guidance of what needs to be done. That initial consultation should be done through that platform as well. We partnered with American Well to essentially create that first opportunity for interaction, whether it's urgent care visit or it's part of a chronic disease management or a specialty care. As part of that we started to define these programs through this platform, Samsung Health, so that consumers can capture data and then share it with a third party which could be your healthcare provider, it could be maybe a yoga specialist, it could be someone who really provides this. It's exciting because right now we have about 240 million users globally with Samsung Health. In the United States, it's much lower like tens of millions, so what we found is that we have really some work to do here in the United States to be able to help create a marketplace and a platform that allows the people to be able to access it. We're also getting good traction, like New York Presbyterian, we have a clinic, Anthem they've all been eager and are signing up. We're starting to create opportunities for the consumers to be able to access the care and other services.  Medgadget: I guess the final question, you are a clinician and now you are working in business, basically. I see a lot of clinicians interested in start ups or being involved in business. Do you have any recommendations for them, or ideas, how they can contribute too? David: Yes, One, I'm excited to see that there are more clinicians that are getting more involved in this because we absolutely do need the clinical input. Many folks have said that that's the missing ingredient because we have a lot of technology, but it's not done in the context of how it fits into our existing work flow. Specifically the clinical work flow. I'm excited to see that. I think that many of the folks- it's rather unfortunate, by the time they realize they want to do this, they've already down a path so far along, that they have to go back and do some retraining or they literally start from scratch. I would really like to see this starting earlier where people in college, or even high school start thinking about this as a career path. In order to do that, you're going to have to think about a few things. It's not just about the clinical side, there's obviously a technology piece to it. There's also a business side to it and that's where I think a lot of folks have- especially if you're looking to be an entrepreneur and start that, they don't have as much experience and knowledge around how that works. I was rather fortunate because when I started out, I was able to experiment in the time in which I was still under faculty. I was able to do things. Nowadays, it's a little risky. You're basically dropping out and doing all the stuff and doing it on your own. You're placing the big bet. I know it's a little challenging nowadays, but if you want to do something that's really rewarding you sometimes need to take that leap of faith. Don't be afraid to do what you feel is really the thing that you see your passion. If you love it, do it, but make sure that you not only think about the clinical side, which I know most of them aren't really strong. I know people are thinking about the tech, and also think about the business side. How would you actually build a company? What's the business model? Who's going to pay for it? Prove it. Start with a reference client, build that, and continue to grow it. From there, depending on a lot of factors, you might get the next great company or product. A lot of people think that the digital health opportunity is so large that it is going to transform the way that we think about healthcare because it will be about all of the stuff we're seeing here at CES, and all the different things that people could be doing at home. Wearing things that's going to help a lot of them self manage it but support it through clinical care. Virtual care will be a big part of it. I'm excited. I think that there are a lot of things that Samsung can do to contribute to it and hopefully, we can get more young recruits, a lot of good talent, especially on the clinical side, into this space.

Its MD, Sam Tanskul, believes it can now help prope...</p><p>News  \u00bb Posted on Sep 15, 2020   Krungsri Bank made a shrewd decision four years ago to get to the head of the queue when it came to acquiring and investing in new technology, by creating Krungsri Finnovate. Its MD, Sam Tanskul,   believes it can now help propel Thailand towards an AI-enabled future.   It\u2019s no coincidence that the biggest second-quarter financial deal in Southeast Asia involved Thai bank Krungsri and its Japanese superpower parent Mitsubishi  UFJ Financial Group (MUFG).   The $706million investment in Singapore-based Grab Holdings, the ride-hailing-turned-super app, which now includes food delivery and financial services, was a shrewd one from a shareholder\u2019s perspective. Grab is, after all, South East Asia\u2019s first decacom, valued at more than $10billion. But Krungsri is more interested in what it can learn from Grab\u2019s mission to become an \u2018AI everywhere operation\u2019.   To put this in perspective, every day Grab generates about 40 terabytes of data, which is analysed using artificial intelligence (AI) to bring improvements for customers and the nations it operates in. And it\u2019s in no mood to stand still, with its AI development budget, encompassing infrastructure, talent, technology and strategic partnerships, totalling more than $100million in 2019 and expected     to increase by 50 per cent in 2020.   The vital importance of AI to future prosperity is well understood by Krungsri (the common name for Bank of Ayudhya, Thailand\u2019s fourth largest bank), and the country as a whole. Thailand has put AI at the centre of national policy with its Digital Economy and Society Development Plan, and is testing a biometrics-based digital identity scheme for all citizens which will be a foundation stone for the digitisation of infrastructure that touches every aspect of their lives.   Based on blockchain, the biometrically-supercharged Smart ID system will provide near-instant, secure verification of individuals and a gateway to the future for Thais, be it remotely opening a bank account using e-KYC (know your customer) or accessing medical help through telemedicine. Indeed, according to a Thai government-commissioned survey by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), \u2018without an effective industrial policy that harnesses AI, Thailand risks losing six per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) in 2035 due to losses in export competitiveness and declines in foreign direct investment\u2019. But by introducing the right interventions to harness AI and associated automation tools to boost skills, strengthen international competitiveness and improve public services, \u2018Thailand could keep unemployment levels low and see an increase in GDP to more than US$1trilllion by 2035, up from US$544billion today\u2019.   For its part, Krungsri recognised the value of technology investment back in 2016, when it set up Krungsri Finnovate, a venture capital fund for fintechs which also runs its fintech accelerator programme.   It has a two-pronged strategy: to use the accelerator programme, Krungsri Rise, and a graduate contest called Krungsri Uni Startup, to expand Thailand\u2019s fintech ecosystem; and a $30million fund aimed at growth startups at Series A funding stage or later to make sure they succeed. `It\u2019s aiming to be the best banking corporate venture capital business in ASEAN (the association of Southeast Asian Nations) by channelling investment specifically into AI and data analytics innovation.   Sam Tanskul, MD of Krungsri Finnovate, says its RISE project was developed from a model successfully used by its parent bank MUFG. Collaboration is at its core.   \u201cThe first year was 2016 and, at that time, there were only 20 fintechs in Thailand, so we invited everyone to join our accelerator, in order to learn and see how the fintech startups work,\u201d says Tanskul. \u201cThe main objective of Krungsri RISE is to create a fintech ecosystem in Thailand.\u201d   Now entering its fourth year of running the accelerator, the Krungsri Finnovate fund has invested in the winning fintechs from each of the previous RISE rounds. The fintechs spent three months on campus and had to prove that they could work with the bank\u2019s business units on demo day.   \u201cThey have been used from that year until now,\u201d says Tanskul. \u201cWe believe that fintechs will be successful if they have synergy projects with the bank, and we are open to working with them.\u201d     Among its AI investment successes so far are wealth management platform Finnomena, and Baania, which uses machine learning of real estate and consumer housing data to improve efficiencies in buying, selling, investing or building real-estate projects.   In January 2020, Krungsri Finnovate was also among a group of investors which helped Finnomena, which has rapidly become one of the biggest wealth management platforms in Southeast Asia, raise a further $10million in a Series B funding round.   But perhaps a more significant investment was the one it made in 2018, when Krungsri Finnovate went beyond the Thai border to become part of leading Japanese fintech and venture capital firm SBI Holdings\u2019 AI &amp; Blockchain Fund. That started it on a journey to help identify global startup players to further its mission to leverage the best AI and blockchain technologies and partnerships that benefit the bank\u2019s own operations and achieve the imperative to cut operating costs while improving customer satisfaction.   The move led to it being be part of an SBI-led consortium of investors who, in March last year, ploughed $8million in Series A funding into Silot, a Singaporean fintech company that helps banks improve their decision-making processes using AI.   Tanskul points to what he perceives to be a different attitude to partnership working in the ASEAN region compared to the UK and Europe.   \u201cIn the UK or Europe, most of the fintechs are banks\u2019 competitors,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we have a different business objective. In Southeast Asia, currently, most of the startups are not the banks\u2019 competitors; most of the fintech startups are banks\u2019 companions. The fintechs have the technology, banks have the customers, so we look at how can we collaborate with each other, not compete.\u201d   One of the bank\u2019s objectives in using AI is to create what Tanskul calls hyper-personalisation. \u201cMore than personalised, it means we have to know and understand customers, offer the right products, at the right time, in the right place. This is the motto of the bank,\u201d he says.   \u201cMost of the big banks in Thailand have a \u2018super app\u2019 mobile banking application. We are not only offering banking products to customers: you can make a hotel booking on our mobile app, or book an Uber or Grab, because we want to capture the data around customer lifestyle. We need to understand more, if we are to present the right product to the right customer.\u201d   There is a strict development structure in place within Krungsri to ensure that the developers don\u2019t produce something the bank can\u2019t work with.   Tanskul explains: \u201cThe external fintech team source the technology, my innovation lab work with the new technology, either from a startup or bigger tech company, running proofs of concepts to test whether this technology is matched to a bank\u2019s business unit. If it tests well and if we want to roll it out, then we remove it from the innovation lab team and give it to the business unit, where we have another team working to run the project with them.   \u201cIn that way, we became the first bank in Thailand to launch a chatbot, with voice and non-voice. Right now we are working on a project called AI Voice with a big tech team from Asia and a local Thai team. Our innovation lab tested whether the voice \u2013 Thai voice and Thai language \u2013 using natural language understanding (NLU) was acceptable for our banking product. We tested it for a year and it was proven to work, so then we handed it to our call centre team, to roll out. So this has been end-to-end.\u201d   Banks in Thailand have no alternative but to embrace the most advanced digital ways of working.   \u201cThe interest rates and fees have been capped by regulation, so we have to see how we can reduce operational expenses,\u201d says Tanskul. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that digital products are key. Right now, every sale is online, we don\u2019t print documents, and things that might have taken seven days and 10 staff can now be done within half an hour.\u201d   When it comes to eKYC, for which most Thai banks have, for the most part, adopted Chinese facial recognition technology, Tanskul says, they are also under pressure. \u201cThe government of Thailand has said it doesn\u2019t want any fraudulent cases of e-KYC \u2013 not a single person,\u201d he says.   For that reason, banks came together under a National ID initiative to use blockchain to automatically cross-reference the identity of a new customer. As Thailand heads towards an AI-enabled future, Krungsri won\u2019t be alone in using the most intelligent technology\u2026 but it hopes to lead rather than follow.

Chipmakers Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc, mobile research firm InterDigital Wireless Inc and South Korean carrier LG Uplus have restricted employees from informal conversations with Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, the sources said. Such discussions are a routine part of international meetings where engineers gather to set technical standards for communications technologies, including the next generation of mobile networks known as 5G. The U.S. Department of Commerce has not banned contact between companies and Huawei. On May 16, the agency put Huawei on a blacklist, barring it from doing business with U.S. companies without government approval, then a few days later it authorized U.S. companies to interact with Huawei in standards bodies through August \"as necessary for the development of 5G standards.\" </p><p>The Commerce Department reiterated that position on Friday in response to a question from Reuters. Nevertheless, at least a handful of major U.S. and overseas tech companies are telling their employees to limit some forms of direct interaction, the people said, as they seek to avoid any potential issues with the U.S. government. Intel and Qualcomm said they have provided compliance instructions to employees, but declined to comment on them further. A spokesman for InterDigital said it has provided guidance to engineers to ensure the company is in compliance with U.S. regulations. An official with LG Uplus said the company is \"voluntarily refraining from interacting with Huawei workers, other than meeting for network equipment installation or maintenance issues.\" Huawei did not provide comment. 5G SLOWDOWN The new restrictions could slow the rollout of 5G, which is expected to power everything from high-speed video transmissions to self-driving cars, according to several industry experts. At a 5G standards meeting last week in Newport Beach, California, participants privately expressed alarm to Reuters that the long-standing cooperation among engineers that is needed for phones and networks to connect globally could fall victim to what one participant described as a \"tech war\" between the U.S. and China. A representative of a European company that has instituted rules against interaction with Huawei described people involved in 5G development as \"shaken.\" \"This could push everyone to their own corners, and we need cooperation to get to 5G. It should be a global market,\" the person said. To be sure, several workers at smaller telecoms firms said they had not been told to avoid discussions with Huawei at standards meetings, and many vendors continue to support existing deals with Huawei. It is unclear how much further communications with Huawei have been curtailed in the tech industry, if at all. \"There's been a lot of misunderstanding from what I'm seeing and hearing from clients and colleagues, as far as what the (Commerce Department) restrictions actually entail,\" said Doug Jacobson, a Washington-based export controls lawyer. He said that companies prohibiting their employees contacting Huawei was \"excessive, because the restrictions don't preclude communication, only the transfer of technology.\" Huawei, whose equipment the U.S. has alleged could be used by China to spy, has emerged as a central figure in the trade war between the world's two largest economies. Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services. China, U.S, and European companies have split before on standards for Wi-Fi, cell networks and other technologies, and the tit-for-tat over tariffs between Beijing and Washington has increased fears of another bifurcation. Huawei is a top player at various global organizations that set technical specifications. As one of the world's biggest manufacturers of devices like smartphones, and the vital parts of networks such as routers and switches, Huawei will need to be at the standards-setting table to ensure a seamless customer experience when 5G networks become prevalent, engineers and experts said. NO MORE INFORMAL CHATS Engineers and system architects representing their employers at meetings of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a global consortium of industry associations that aims to set 5G specifications by March 2020, often take formal, general discussions into smaller, less documented sessions as they try to find agreement with rivals. But at 3GPP's meeting last week in California, one of the group's three chairmen, Balazs Bertenyi of Nokia, told attendees that more of those so-called \"offline\" conversations than usual would be documented by the standards body with notes and other publicly available records. It was the \"practical implication\" of the new U.S. Commerce Department rules given industry-wide caution despite the exemption for 5G talks, he said. Companies want to limit informal exchanges, in which their engineers feel more comfortable discussing proprietary technology with rivals to persuade them why their research or innovations are more sound, the sources said. A separate standards body, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), put restrictions on Huawei engineers' ability to participate in peer reviews for its publications, drawing criticism from some in China's industry and elsewhere. The organization, which declined to comment beyond generic statements on its website, then backtracked days later after saying it had received the all-clear from the U.S. Commerce Department with respect to the peer review issue. It did not respond to requests for comment on this story. \"Huawei isn't just some company. They, by many accounts, are the leader in 5G technology. Excluding them is very hard to work around, so it does stand to disrupt the entire project,\" said Jorge Contreras, a law professor at the University of Utah and an IEEE member. \"If the idea is to create a non-Chinese 5G, I'm not sure that's possible. Even if it is, would it be as good?\" (Reporting by Paresh Dave in Newport Beach, California and Chris Prentice in New York; Additional reporting by Ju-min Park in Seoul; Editing by Chris Sanders and Bill Rigby) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11610856</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9H-9PK1-JCDN-1028-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1083\"/><timeReceived>11:50 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Open banking is rede...</p><p>News  \u00bb Posted on Sep 4, 2020    As Head of Investments at Banco Sabadell\u2019s digital innovation hub InnoCells, Paula Blazquez Solano understands that banking\u2019s role has fundamentally changed\u2026 her job is to make the most of that opportunity. Open banking is redefining the role of institutional banks and, with it, comes the realisation that they can no longer automatically control the end-to-end customer journey. Sometimes they can only hope to be a cog in the system.   Accepting that is core to Banco Sabadell\u2019s attitude to digital innovation, says Paula Blazquez Solano, head of investments at its corporate venture arm and digital innovation hub, InnoCells.   Tasked with leading the bank\u2019s strategic digital agenda, it invests in startups related to its core business. And, as elsewhere in the financial services sector, open banking and the EU\u2019s revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) have been key drivers of change and innovation at Banco Sabadell. But how they are leveraged varies between partnerships, says Blazquez, and the role the bank plays in the customer-facing relationship is no longer guaranteed to be the main component.   \u201cYou stay ahead of the curve by staying relevant to your clients, and you have to understand you\u2019re just a piece within the user experience or the customer journey,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll be an important piece, sometimes you\u2019ll be just a smaller one. But you have to make sure that you stay greased and engaged with the other pieces, that you function within that customer experience, and you match or exceed expectations in order not to be replaced.\u201d   Investment strategy   Among InnoCells\u2019 recent launches is Nomo, a financial management tool aimed at freelancers that enables them to digitise and manage expenses and sales, create and send invoices, and has recently added an invoice financing service using a third party to alleviate cash flow problems through the pandemic. Since the end of 2018, Nomo has gained some 60,000 users \u2013 40,000 of them over the past eight months \u2013 as freelancers continued to pay their bills and meet tax obligations during the crisis.   While Nomo was born and developed at InnoCells\u2019 innovation hub, it operates as an autonomous subsidiary, targeting its own users as well as being promoted as a tool through the bank\u2019s website Nomo is 100 per cent owned by the bank, but in the past year InnoCells has invested in, among others, the Singapore-based artificial intelligence (AI) fintech Active.Ai, which has developed a sophisticated conversational AI platform, and Kovrr, an Israel-based cyber risk modelling company.   Blazquez says that every six months or so InnoCells works out the verticals of interest for the bank. It then goes to the market to understand what\u2019s going on  in terms of trends, and to the business units within Banco Sabadell to understand their needs. InnoCells then also considers short-term and long-term demands before scouting appropriate startups.   Commenting on the changing role of the bank in the customer relationship, Blazquez says: \u201cPeople see their financial service provider as part of a solution to achieve their goals. These could be material ones \u2013 such as buying a house, a car, a TV \u2013 or non-material ones, such as financial stability, which goes along with pension plans or investment solutions, things of that sort.\u201d   However, thanks to the potential disintermediation caused by open banking, the problem a bank can be left with is that it remains relevant on the backend, or manufacturing side, but loses interaction with the end client, precisely the type of engagement that most challengers to incumbent banks champion.   Blazquez says it\u2019s not a case of open banking narrowing a bank\u2019s options, but rather broadening them \u2013 so long as the institution builds out its platform.   \u201cYou have the option to just purely comply [with the regulations] or [you can] build products and services alongside the new regulation and with a new strategy and data positioning, which gives you access to aggregation, data enrichment techniques and customer personalisation \u2013 and therefore a more enriched kind of experience with the client,\u201d she says.   In other words, banks can decide on what grade of openness they want to adopt, says Blazquez \u2018from a platform-based approach to distributor, or even just as a provider of services\u2019. In scouting for innovation \u2013 be it for Banco Sabadell\u2019s corporate or retail business \u2013 InnoCells has to work out if the bank wants to be a cog or the engine driving any particular process.   \u201cThere are times when it would make more sense to partner with a startup or with a technological corporation that is already developing the product, or where you have access to specific information, or where they have already built that interaction with the client. This gives you a better or more agile time to market,\u201d says Blazquez.   \u201cThere will be other situations where there is a more interesting build approach and you can do it through partnering with a startup, or on your own.   \u201cBut you definitely have to do it on a squad basis, so having teams in place that have the knowledge \u2013 both from the business side and also from a tech perspective \u2013 and are able to understand where the client is coming from,\u201d she adds. The result, says Blazquez, is building a product offering that is client-centric and is able to be tested within the market, in an agile way.   \u201cIt\u2019s a lot about speed,\u201d she adds.     Deciding on what strategic position a bank takes has, in her view, much to do with the internal culture of the organisation   \u2013 how upper management can seize an opportunity and is able to transfer that knowledge into mid-management, so they can propose use cases, product offerings or partner with startups to create them.   \u201cThen, there is also a big question around being able to develop a strategy that allows for collaboration with startups, but also with other big techs or corporations,\u201d says Blazquez. \u201cOpen banking allows for that because you can have access to the data pools that are sitting within other corporations or big techs.\u201d   InnoCells does have a natural bias towards geographies in which it operates \u2013 such as Spain, the UK and Mexico \u2013 but it collaborates with startups the world over.   Going forward, open banking regulations will allow for different kinds of revenue for a bank, Blazquez believes, but it needs to have a strategy in place to launch the resulting products. Again, this means institutions need to decide where they want to be in the value chain \u2013 at the anonymous backend is not sustainable for every bank.   \u201cI think, in general, financial institutions will evolve towards a more platform-based model, with revenue-sharing propositions \u2013 a lot of them through collaboration and a partnerships approach,\u201d she predicts. \u201cIn terms of the drivers, what we\u2019re seeing is the financial services industry turning its focus towards a more innovation-led approach, mainly driven by technology.\u201d   Chief among those, InnoCells predicts, will be increased use of AI and robotics in order to lower costs and increase margins, and blockchain, to speed up underlying processes through smart contracts. By facilitating the creation of an end-to-end customer journey \u2013 at times created through or with other products and services \u2013 Blazquez agrees that open banking will undoubtedly help improve customers\u2019 financial health.   \u201cPersonalisation through data aggregation and enrichment techniques allows for more tailored products and services, which can be even less costly for clients and more intelligently made for them,\u201d she says, adding that the focus on customer experience will benefit enterprise and retail clients alike.   However, one thing Blazquez would like to see is the creation of an equivalent of open banking regulation for big techs, which would force them, like banks, to share the vast amount of data they hold on customers if those customers give them permission. While the Googles and Apples of this world have stressed they are more likely to partner with banks than challenge them directly, she feels there needs to be more of a two-way street from which everyone could benefit.   \u201cI think there is a need for a level playing field, yes, but there is also a need to access and aggregate the data, so that analysis of the client is even more extensive and therefore the customisation and relationship are even better.   \u201cThat\u2019s for everyone \u2013 banks, corporations, big tech, but, most importantly, for the client themselves.\u201d    This article was published in  The Fintech Magazine : Issue #17, Page 22-23 Featured in this Article:  Banco Sabadell  Paula Blazquez Solano    Author: Lauren Towner</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42999462734</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S0-DB61-F07F-81J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1493\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Fintech Finance</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 4, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Affiliates &amp;

What to do in the era of \"Big Tech?\" Living in 2019, we know more than ever before about how Big Tech, particularly in the shape of Facebook, Twitter and Google - as the prime arbiters of information and social media online - have shaped and affected politics today. At the same time, we're about to face several huge sea-changes in the global system, not least of which will be the next U.S. election, Brexit, the rise of China and challenges of the climate crisis.</p><p><br/>Speaking at Web Summit in Lisbon this week, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair brought out a new report from the Institute which bears his name to address the turmoil of Western politics from the prism of the backlash against globalisation after the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the rise of populist movements and the effects technology is having on society, politicians and policymakers.<br/>A policy framework designed for the offline world may have served many people well for many decades, but in an age of exponential technology, is it fit for purpose?<br/>Platform companies like Facebook, aggregators like Google, Amazon and Uber have, says the Institute, stripped traditional gatekeepers of their power, delivered real progress for consumers and businesses and increased many freedoms. But they have also brought significant economic upheaval and heightened cultural pressures, along with huge unknowns about the future. The tech wolf has also now concentrated power in the hands of a relatively small number of companies that \"all too often wield it clumsily and without sufficient legitimacy.\"<br/>This comes at a time when the West's lead on technology is \"facing a clear and present challenge from determined Russian aggression and a concerted push from China to take a global lead in AI.\"<br/>Blair's Institute makes it plain in its new report (\"A New Deal for Big Tech: Next-Generation Regulation Fit for the Internet Age\") that the current set of regulations designed for legacy industries is \"a poor fit for the pace and scale of the Internet\" and a new approach, based on stronger accountability coupled with more freedom to innovate, might be the best way to align private incentives with the public interest.<br/>Blair is calling for a \"new generation of regulator\" that can take an international outlook, have technical expertise comparable with the big tech companies and be fluent in the same fundamentals of \"Big Tech.\"<br/>But how? How is all this going to operate? What are Blair's views on Russia, disinformation on Facebook and Twitter, and whether tech will have an effect on the outcome of Brexit?<br/>TechCrunch sat down with Mr Blair for the following, exclusive, interview.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Mike Butcher (MB): You've released this new report into regulating Big Tech. Do you want to outline its main thrust?<br/>Tony Blair (TB): Essentially what we're saying is: there's no way \"big tech\" is going to avoid regulation, and regulation that will treat them almost like public utilities because of their power, their reach and their impact. But the question is about getting the right form of regulation. So what we're trying to do is to make sure that it's the kind of regulation of big tech that recognizes that [big tech has] actually brought enormous benefits to people, but at the same time protects people, whether it's on issues around privacy, competition [and] making sure that consumers get adequate access - all of those types of things - and translate this into a set of proper principles. What I say to the big tech companies is that even though you may not want to have a lot to do with politics, as you can see - and I've been saying this for several years to them - it's going to come your way. Because you're just too powerful not to be under some system of objective regulation, and you can't just regulate yourselves.<br/>MB: On that note, many big tech companies have actually called for regulation, but do you think that's a \"sop\" to governments in order to allow them to build even bigger monopolies? Because then everybody will have to be regulated, including smaller companies?<br/>TB: I think the whole point about regulation is that it can be bad or it can be good. So you really want to make sure that the regulation you're introducing is not an imposition on the companies for providing the service they do, but it is giving people proper protection and it's recognizing, as I say, the power that these companies have. People won't find it acceptable that things continue without proper regulation. The fact that Mark Zuckerberg comes out in favor of regulation... I mean, I think that's good. But the question is what type of regulation. And there, obviously, he and Facebook should have an input. But they can't decide that. That's - in the end - got to be decided by policymakers. And one thing my institute - which Chris [Chris Yiu, executive director, Technology and Public Policy] heads up, which is based in London but has strong links in Silicon Valley and elsewhere in the world - is to say there needs to be a dialogue between what I call the \"change-makers\" and the policy-makers that leads to good policy.<br/>MB: But national governments making policy on their own surely isn't going to address the issue, given Big Tech is global? What institutions can address this? Some sort of supranational body?<br/>TB: Well, I think, ultimately, on certain issues you'll need a global agreement. For example cybersecurity, I think we'll, for sure, need that.<br/>MB: There's no \"United Nations Declaration\" for arms control on cybersecurity for instance.<br/>TB: The one thing I'm noticing about cyber, even in the last year... the number of people I meet whose companies have been subject to actual attacks... In the end, if every country is going to want to protect its business and every country will recognize ultimately that if the big players don't come together and agree some rules then... I mean, it's just anarchy.<br/>In regards to regulation, I would like to see Europe and America create a new transatlantic partnership around regulation. This is one of the reasons I'm so opposed to Brexit... You are taking Britain out of that conversation with Europe at the very time that it needs to be in it.<br/>MB: The pace of change at this point is now exponential. The rise of AI, quantum computing etc. Politicians have known about the rapid, changing nature of technology for a number of years. What do you think has been stopping them from grappling with the subject?<br/>TB: It's partly generational. It's partly because politicians don't often understand the technology. It is actually technical. It requires hard work. Some of it is like rocket science. It's not easy. So that's part of the problem. And the other problem is that I think the change-makers - the tech developers - their basic attitude, often, to government, is just to just \"keep away from it.\" And I completely get it. But it's not sensible. They've got to engage with government today, and that's why we're trying, through the Institute, to establish that dialogue. And you know, if that doesn't happen, you'll find, as we did during the 19th-century industrial revolution, how long it took politics to catch up with the fact that the world was being revolutionized. It took decades to catch up. For a long time, society was subject to one change, and politics was still debating things that were from a different era. I mean, if you look at British politics today, with this debate where, on one side is Brexit, one on the other side is - basically - who spends more money in the next Parliament... we could have had this debate at any point in the last 30 years. It's got no relevance, really, to how the world's changing.<br/>MB: Are you concerned about how social media has enabled populism?<br/>TB: Yes, I think social media is a revolutionary phenomenon and it's revolutionized everything, including politics. And we've got to work out ways of dealing with that because it is rupturing politics in a serious way.<br/>The problem is that political leaders are always trying to \"step out in front,\" but not so much that they lose touch with their people. So that's a calibration, all the time, between leadership and listening. If the \"listening\" part of it becomes \"instrumentalized\" through social media, then the risk is that politicians just lose their compass. They don't know where they're going, they are just buffeted by waves of opinion. And then, if you're not careful, what happens is that the people who rise to the top in those circumstances are the people who ride that.<br/>MB: Should Twitter shut down Trump's account?<br/>TB: Well how's that going to help? I mean, honestly, I don't think that's relevant.<br/>MB: Facebook has said it's going to be changing its policy on political advertising, and won't be regulating disinformation on political ads. What's your opinion on that?<br/>TB: My opinion is that it's very hard, if you're Facebook, to stop people having political ads. But, to me, the the whole concept that Facebook is \"self patrolling\" as to what should come on the internet or not, is an indication of why you need proper regulation. The decision as to whether something's fit for consumption or not shouldn't be left to a few thousand people employed by Facebook, you know, sitting and looking at crazy stuff on Facebook all day. I mean, this is to me just a further indication of why you've got to put everything within a proper system of regulation. Otherwise, it's not actually fair to ask the company to do that. How can they decide what is a political ad or not? But someone should.<br/>MB: What do you think of Twitter's decision not to take any political advertising?<br/>TB: In some ways I understand that, and in some ways I welcome that, but I think Facebook's in a slightly different position just in terms of scale, right?<br/>MB: China is deploying technology in its society at a huge, exponential rate, in terms of things like facial recognition and the surveillance of its population. Its ability to hoover-up all this data is effectively giving it enormous power to create, possibly, the next, powerful AI, because the more data you have the more you can improve an AI. Do you think that the Western approach, with its tradition of more democratic institutions that have moved more slowly than a command-and-control system, means that we are effectively going to be left behind by political systems that err towards the more dictatorial?<br/>TB: Well I think there's a huge debate that's going to go on about China, more generally, in the West, which is what I call the debate about whether you \"decouple.\" Do you accept that there's two systems that are going to remain very distinct, also in technology? This is part of what underpins the Huawei debate regarding 5G. Or do you try to get to what Henry Kissinger calls a form of \"cooperative competition?\" Now, I prefer the latter, not the former course, because I think decoupling is very difficult. But, what that means, in my view, is that the West has got to get its act together, because otherwise China will achieve superiority in AI and, in some regards, it already is. If you think of all the devices that we use in the West that are Chinese... You can see this with [the rise of] TikTok, for instance.<br/>MB: The U.K. general election is now on and people are using technology to \"get out the vote.\" There is a lot of talk about \"tactical voting\" and lots of tactical voting recommendation websites appearing. Do you favour any particular approach?<br/>TB: So, here's where technology obviously has a beneficial purpose. If people decide that they want to vote tactically - and I completely understand that because of Brexit being mixed up [in the election], and frankly, dissatisfaction with both main parties - then web sites that tell you how to do that intelligently and provide the information, then... great. You've got ones from Best For Britain, People's Vote, Gina Miller has one and there are others. Yeah, fine, people should look at them I think.<br/>MB: Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee has been prevented by Number 10 from releasing its intelligence report and it allegedly contains information about how Russia affected British politics and society using technological means in the last few years. What are your concerns about Russia's incursion into U.K. politics using technology?<br/>TB: I think this is not just a Russian question, although there's been a lot of focus on what Russia has done. You've got to put all of this out on the table and I think, again, Western governments should be cooperating together to say... if there is outside interference - and I don't really know the scale of it because you've got to go into the detail - how people are influencing media, how people are using techniques to try and influence voters, from the outside, trying to destabilize your politics... all of it should be out in the open. Because that's the best way of stopping it, and then you can take action against people who are doing it. But this is another reason why I think this is a slightly different form of cybersecurity, if you like, but it's somewhat akin to it. Because, in the end, if you've got people, for example, changing their votes - particularly in tight-run elections - changing their votes on the basis of misinformation that's coming from a foreign government that's deliberately trying to destabilize your politics, then at least you should know about it. Now, this is going to be a big big issue for the future.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-266616</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFK-5HJ1-DYDW-712W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2257\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and Twitter Inc. It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump's directive. Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. </p><p>Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users. The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump's social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online. The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act. \"The EO challenged here imposes no obligations on any private party,\" said the motion filed by the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was seen by Reuters. \"It directs executive officials to take steps that could lead various agencies to examine ... allegations that large social media online platforms have displayed political bias in moderating content,\" the motion said. The lawsuit reflects long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and social media companies that have become key tools in Trump's political arsenal. Avery Gardiner, CDT's general counsel, called Trump's executive order \"unconstitutional.\" CDT's lawsuit argues that the White House ran afoul of the First Amendment, which prohibits government officials from retaliating against an individual or entity for engaging in protected speech. \"Instead of actually trying to address the merits of the issues, and to engage in litigation that will show the severe constitutional deformities of the executive order, it is resorting to legal maneuvering,\" Gardiner said on Wednesday, referring to the Trump administration's move. The CDT has negotiated a briefing schedule with the DOJ. CDT will be filing its response by the end of August and the government is likely to respond by Sept. 21, she said. White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration moved to dismiss the case because \"it is not a valid legal argument.\" \"The left-wing lobbying organization's brief seems to suggest it doesn't understand how administrative action works or possibly that it doesn't understand the nature of the judicial system,\" he told Reuters on Wednesday. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. Twitter called the executive order a \"reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.\" It declined comment on the CDT lawsuit. Google and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment. Trump's order seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission. At a recent Senate hearing, the agency's chairman, Joseph Simons, said the FTC has not taken any action to enforce the order. The U.S. Commerce Department has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content after Trump's executive order directed the action. Earlier this month FCC Chairman Ajit Pai agreed to open the petition to public comment for 45 days.

WASHINGTO...</p><p>The Trump administration has filed a motion asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit against the president's executive order targeting social media companies, calling it a \"profound misunderstanding,\" according to a copy of the motion seen by Reuters.      WASHINGTON  The Trump administration has filed a motion asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit against the president\u2019s executive order targeting social media companies, calling it a \u201cprofound misunderstanding,\u201d according to a copy of the motion seen by Reuters.   The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google  and Twitter Inc . It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump\u2019s directive.    Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users.   The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump\u2019s social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online.   The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act.   \u201cThe EO challenged here imposes no obligations on any private party,\u201d said the motion filed by the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was seen by Reuters.    \u201cIt directs executive officials to take steps that could lead various agencies to examine \u2026 allegations that large social media online platforms have displayed political bias in moderating content,\u201d the motion said.   The lawsuit reflects long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and social media companies that have become key tools in Trump\u2019s political arsenal.   Avery Gardiner, CDT\u2019s general counsel, called Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d CDT\u2019s lawsuit argues that the White House ran afoul of the First Amendment, which prohibits government officials from retaliating against an individual or entity for engaging in protected speech.   \u201cInstead of actually trying to address the merits of the issues, and to engage in litigation that will show the severe constitutional deformities of the executive order, it is resorting to legal maneuvering,\u201d Gardiner said on Wednesday, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s move.    The CDT has negotiated a briefing schedule with the DOJ. CDT will be filing its response by the end of August and the government is likely to respond by Sept. 21, she said.   White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration moved to dismiss the case because \u201cit is not a valid legal argument.\u201d   \u201cThe left-wing lobbying organization\u2019s brief seems to suggest it doesn\u2019t understand how administrative action works or possibly that it doesn\u2019t understand the nature of the judicial system,\u201d he told Reuters on Wednesday.   The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.    Twitter called the executive order a \u201creactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.\u201d It declined comment on the CDT lawsuit. Google and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.   Trump\u2019s order seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission. At a recent Senate hearing, the agency\u2019s chairman, Joseph Simons, said the FTC has not taken any action to enforce the order.  .youTubeVideoPlayer{  height: 520px; }  @media only screen and (max-width:480px){  .youTubeVideoPlayer{   height: 220px;  } }    Also Watch   Sushant Singh Rajput's Dairy Reveals The Actor's Career Goals For 2020 | CNN News18     The U.S. Commerce Department has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content after Trump\u2019s executive order directed the action. Earlier this month FCC Chairman Ajit Pai agreed to open the petition to public comment for 45 days.

The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Twitter Inc . It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump\u2019s directive.   Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users.   The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump\u2019s social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online.   The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act.   \u201cThe EO challenged here imposes no obligations on any private party,\u201d said the motion filed by the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was seen by Reuters.   \u201cIt directs executive officials to take steps that could lead various agencies to examine \u2026 allegations that large social media online platforms have displayed political bias in moderating content,\u201d the motion said.   The lawsuit reflects long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and social media companies that have become key tools in Trump\u2019s political arsenal.   Avery Gardiner, CDT\u2019s general counsel, called Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d CDT\u2019s lawsuit argues that the White House ran afoul of the First Amendment, which prohibits government officials from retaliating against an individual or entity for engaging in protected speech.   \u201cInstead of actually trying to address the merits of the issues, and to engage in litigation that will show the severe constitutional deformities of the executive order, it is resorting to legal maneuvering,\u201d Gardiner said on Wednesday, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s move.   The CDT has negotiated a briefing schedule with the DOJ. CDT will be filing its response by the end of August and the government is likely to respond by Sept. 21, she said.   White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration moved to dismiss the case because \u201cit is not a valid legal argument.\u201d   \u201cThe left-wing lobbying organization\u2019s brief seems to suggest it doesn\u2019t understand how administrative action works or possibly that it doesn\u2019t understand the nature of the judicial system,\u201d he told Reuters on Wednesday.   The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.   Twitter called the executive order a \u201creactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.\u201d It declined comment on the CDT lawsuit. Google and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.   Trump\u2019s order seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission. At a recent Senate hearing, the agency\u2019s chairman, Joseph Simons, said the FTC has not taken any action to enforce the order.   The U.S. Commerce Department has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content after Trump\u2019s executive order directed the action. Earlier this month FCC Chairman Ajit Pai agreed to open the petition to public comment for 45 days.

FILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are seen in a combination photo from Reuters files.    REUTERS/File Photo   The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Twitter Inc. It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump\u2019s directive.   Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users.   The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump\u2019s social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online.   The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act.   \u201cThe EO challenged here imposes no obligations on any private party,\u201d said the motion filed by the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was seen by Reuters.   \u201cIt directs executive officials to take steps that could lead various agencies to examine ... allegations that large social media online platforms have displayed political bias in moderating content,\u201d the motion said.   The lawsuit reflects long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and social media companies that have become key tools in Trump\u2019s political arsenal.   Avery Gardiner, CDT\u2019s general counsel, called Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d CDT\u2019s lawsuit argues that the White House ran afoul of the First Amendment, which prohibits government officials from retaliating against an individual or entity for engaging in protected speech.   \u201cInstead of actually trying to address the merits of the issues, and to engage in litigation that will show the severe constitutional deformities of the executive order, it is resorting to legal maneuvering,\u201d Gardiner said on Wednesday, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s move.   The CDT has negotiated a briefing schedule with the DOJ. CDT will be filing its response by the end of August and the government is likely to respond by Sept. 21, she said.   White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration moved to dismiss the case because \u201cit is not a valid legal argument.\u201d   \u201cThe left-wing lobbying organization\u2019s brief seems to suggest it doesn\u2019t understand how administrative action works or possibly that it doesn\u2019t understand the nature of the judicial system,\u201d he told Reuters on Wednesday.   The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.   Twitter called the executive order a \u201creactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.\u201d It declined comment on the CDT lawsuit. Google and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.   Trump\u2019s order seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission. At a recent Senate hearing, the agency\u2019s chairman, Joseph Simons, said the FTC has not taken any action to enforce the order.   The U.S. Commerce Department has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content after Trump\u2019s executive order directed the action. Earlier this month FCC Chairman Ajit Pai agreed to open the petition to public comment for 45 days.

The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by Facebook Inc ( FB.O ), Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google ( GOOGL.O ) and Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ). It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump\u2019s directive.   Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users.   The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump\u2019s social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online.   The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act.   \u201cThe EO challenged here imposes no obligations on any private party,\u201d said the motion filed by the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was seen by Reuters.   \u201cIt directs executive officials to take steps that could lead various agencies to examine ... allegations that large social media online platforms have displayed political bias in moderating content,\u201d the motion said.   The lawsuit reflects long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and social media companies that have become key tools in Trump\u2019s political arsenal.   Avery Gardiner, CDT\u2019s general counsel, called Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d CDT\u2019s lawsuit argues that the White House ran afoul of the First Amendment, which prohibits government officials from retaliating against an individual or entity for engaging in protected speech.   \u201cInstead of actually trying to address the merits of the issues, and to engage in litigation that will show the severe constitutional deformities of the executive order, it is resorting to legal maneuvering,\u201d Gardiner said on Wednesday, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s move.   The CDT has negotiated a briefing schedule with the DOJ. CDT will be filing its response by the end of August and the government is likely to respond by Sept. 21, she said.   White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration moved to dismiss the case because \u201cit is not a valid legal argument.\u201d   \u201cThe left-wing lobbying organization\u2019s brief seems to suggest it doesn\u2019t understand how administrative action works or possibly that it doesn\u2019t understand the nature of the judicial system,\u201d he told Reuters on Wednesday.   The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.   Twitter called the executive order a \u201creactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.\u201d It declined comment on the CDT lawsuit. Google and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.   Trump\u2019s order seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission. At a recent Senate hearing, the agency\u2019s chairman, Joseph Simons, said the FTC has not taken any action to enforce the order.   The U.S. Commerce Department has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content after Trump\u2019s executive order directed the action. Earlier this month FCC Chairman Ajit Pai agreed to open the petition to public comment for 45 days.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

And we think it's going to get to 96 per cent over the next four to five years.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That migration has prompted some changes. Dodig said CIBC is \"retooling\" its bank branches to focus more on advice. It is also handing customers more control, such as with the lender's recent move to allow clients to shut down their credit card via their phone if they suspect it is lost.</p><p>\"More and more is being pushed out to the client, that they can do on their own, and other resources are being diverted into building relationships and advice with those clients,\" he added.</p><p>The CEO's predictions are just the latest sign of the changing times in the banking business, as lenders try to strike the right balance of brickand-mortar branches and digital offerings.</p><p>\"We tend to look at what the consumer wants,\" Dodig said. \"And what the consumer wants is more convenience on their smart tablet or on their smartphone or on their laptop.\"</p><p>At the same time, banks face challenges from fintech companies, as well as the looming threat that Silicon Valley might get serious about financial services.</p><p>There is some serious thought being given to the potential Big Tech menace. And a report from Moody's Investors Service this week warned that the \"greatest risk\" to incumbent banks posed by Big Tech is giving up control of customer relationships.</p><p>\"In most regions, big tech firms will likely avoid manufacturing financial products given a high regulatory burden on financial institutions,\" noted Moody's. \"Still, higher price transparency and less customer interaction when customer relationships are 'owned'by providers of digital ecosystems could translate to margin pressure for incumbents.\"</p><p>Those comments are in line with concerns voiced by the head of Royal Bank of Canada, Dave McKay, who told reporters earlier this year that \"we don't want to be buying back our clients through someone else's channel because they're living their lives there.\"</p><p>With that threat in mind, RBC has launched a Ventures unit that aims to reach prospective clients through a variety of apps. McKay said during the bank's third-quarter conference call in August that the lender has launched nine ventures and already registered more than 200,000 users, \"even with limited marketing in early stages.\"</p><p>RBC's head of technology and operations was asked about big tech during Wednesday's CIBC investor conference.</p><p>\"I'm a big believer in the best defence is a really strong offence,\" said Bruce Ross, RBC's head of tech. \"We believe that we have to follow where our clients want to go.\"</p><p>Ross also said the bank has a threepronged approach to fintechs: it invests in some, acquires some and partners with some (as the bank does with RBC Ventures).</p><p>When it comes to bigger tech companies, such as Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., he said a clear line has to be drawn.</p><p>\"Those players, you have to be very specific on, OK, where are you going to work with them and where are you going to compete with them,\" Ross added. \"But ultimately it comes down to following the client, and we look at all of our businesses and say, 'OK, let's cause the disruption ourselves, versus having someone disrupt us.'\" Also speaking at the conference on Wednesday was Teri Currie, the head of Canadian personal banking at Toronto-Dominion Bank.</p><p>Currie told the audience that TD's tech spending has shifted since around 2012 and 2013 today, going from 75 per cent of the expenses geared towards \"run-the-bank\" outlays and 25 per cent for \"change the bank\" moves, to now 40 per cent of the tech dollars going towards the latter.</p><p>\"So a significant change in a small period of time,\" she noted. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

And we think it's going to get to 96 per cent over the next four to five years.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That migration has prompted some changes. Dodig said CIBC is \"retooling\" its bank branches to focus more on advice. It is also handing customers more control, such as with the lender's recent move to allow clients to shut down their credit card via their phone if they suspect it is lost.</p><p>\"More and more is being pushed out to the client, that they can do on their own, and other resources are being diverted into building relationships and advice with those clients,\" he added.</p><p>The CEO's predictions are just the latest sign of the changing times in the banking business, as lenders try to strike the right balance of brick-and-mortar branches and digital offerings.</p><p>\"We tend to look at what the consumer wants,\" Dodig said. \"And what the consumer wants is more convenience on their smart tablet or on their smartphone or on their laptop.\"</p><p>At the same time, banks face challenges from fintech companies, as well as the looming threat that Silicon Valley might get serious about financial services.</p><p>There is some serious thought being given to the potential Big Tech menace. And a report from Moody's Investors Service this week warned that the \"greatest risk\" to incumbent banks posed by Big Tech is giving up control of customer relationships.</p><p>\"In most regions, big tech firms will likely avoid manufacturing financial products given a high regulatory burden on financial institutions,\" noted Moody's. \"Still, higher price transparency and less customer interaction when customer relationships are 'owned'by providers of digital ecosystems could translate to margin pressure for incumbents.\"</p><p>Those comments are in line with concerns voiced by the head of Royal Bank of Canada, Dave McKay, who told reporters earlier this year that \"we don't want to be buying back our clients through someone else's channel because they're living their lives there.\"</p><p>With that threat in mind, RBC has launched a Ventures unit that aims to reach prospective clients through a variety of apps. McKay said during the bank's third-quarter conference call in August that the lender has launched nine ventures and already registered more than 200,000 users, \"even with limited marketing in early stages.\"</p><p>RBC's head of technology and operations was asked about big tech during Wednesday's CIBC investor conference.</p><p>\"I'm a big believer in the best defence is a really strong offence,\" said Bruce Ross, RBC's head of tech. \"We believe that we have to follow where our clients want to go.\"</p><p>Ross also said the bank has a three-pronged approach to fintechs: it invests in some, acquires some and partners with some (as the bank does with RBC Ventures). When it comes to bigger tech companies, such as Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., he said a clear line has to be drawn.</p><p>\"Those players, you have to be very specific on, OK, where are you going to work with them and where are you going to compete with them,\" Ross added. \"But ultimately it comes down to following the client, and we look at all of our businesses and say, 'OK, let's cause the disruption ourselves, versus having someone disrupt us.'\" Also speaking at the conference on Wednesday was Teri Currie, the head of Canadian personal banking at Toronto-Dominion Bank.</p><p>Currie told the audience that TD's tech spending has shifted since around 2012 and 2013 today, going from 75 per cent of the expenses geared towards \"runthe-bank\" outlays and 25 per cent for \"change the bank\" moves, to now 40 per cent of the tech dollars going towards the latter.</p><p>\"So a significant change in a small period of time,\" she noted. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

And we think it's going to get to 96 per cent over the next four to five years.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That migration has prompted some changes. Dodig said CIBC is \"retooling\" its bank branches to focus more on advice. It is also handing customers more control, such as with the lender's recent move to allow clients to shut down their credit card via their phone if they suspect it is lost.</p><p>\"More and more is being pushed out to the client, that they can do on their own, and other resources are being diverted into building relationships and advice with those clients,\" he added.</p><p>The CEO's predictions are just the latest sign of the changing times in the banking business, as lenders try to strike the right balance of brick-and-mortar branches and digital offerings.</p><p>\"We tend to look at what the consumer wants,\" Dodig said. \"And what the consumer wants is more convenience on their smart tablet or on their smartphone or on their laptop.\"</p><p>At the same time, banks face challenges from fintech companies, as well as the looming threat that Silicon Valley might get serious about financial services.</p><p>There is some serious thought being given to the potential Big Tech menace. And a report from Moody's Investors Service this week warned that the \"greatest risk\" to incumbent banks posed by Big Tech is giving up control of customer relationships.</p><p>\"In most regions, big tech firms will likely avoid manufacturing financial products given a high regulatory burden on financial institutions,\" noted Moody's. \"Still, higher price transparency and less customer interaction when customer relationships are 'owned'by providers of digital ecosystems could translate to margin pressure for incumbents.\"</p><p>Those comments are in line with concerns voiced by the head of Royal Bank of Canada, Dave McKay, who told reporters earlier this year that \"we don't want to be buying back our clients through someone else's channel because they're living their lives there.\"</p><p>With that threat in mind, RBC has launched a Ventures unit that aims to reach prospective clients through a variety of apps. McKay said during the bank's third-quarter conference call in August that the lender has launched nine ventures and already registered more than 200,000 users, \"even with limited marketing in early stages.\"</p><p>RBC's head of technology and operations was asked about big tech during Wednesday's CIBC investor conference.</p><p>\"I'm a big believer in the best defence is a really strong offence,\" said Bruce Ross, RBC's head of tech.</p><p>\"We believe that we have to follow where our clients want to go.\"</p><p>Ross also said the bank has a three-pronged approach to fintechs: it invests in some, acquires some and partners with some (as the bank does with RBC Ventures). When it comes to bigger tech companies, such as Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., he said a clear line has to be drawn.</p><p>\"Those players, you have to be very specific on, OK, where are you going to work with them and where are you going to compete with them,\" Ross added. \"But ultimately it comes down to following the client, and we look at all of our businesses and say, 'OK, let's cause the disruption ourselves, versus having someone disrupt us.'\" Also speaking at the conference on Wednesday was Teri Currie, the head of Canadian personal banking at Toronto-Dominion Bank.</p><p>Currie told the audience that TD's tech spending has shifted since around 2012 and 2013 today, going from 75 per cent of the expenses geared towards \"runthe-bank\" outlays and 25 per cent for \"change the bank\" moves, to now 40 per cent of the tech dollars going towards the latter.</p><p>\"So a significant change in a small period of time,\" she noted. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

And a report from Moody's Investors Service this week warned that the \"greatest risk\" to incumbent banks posed by Big Tech is giving up control of customer relationships.</p><p>\"In most regions, big tech firms will likely avoid manufacturing financial products given a high regulatory burden on financial institutions,\" noted Moody's. \"Still, higher price transparency and less customer interaction when customer relationships are 'owned'by providers of digital ecosystems could translate to margin pressure for incumbents.\"</p><p>Those comments are in line with concerns voiced by the head of Royal Bank of Canada, Dave McKay, who told reporters earlier this year that \"we don't want to be buying back our clients through someone else's channel because they're living their lives there.\"</p><p>With that threat in mind, RBC has launched a Ventures unit that aims to reach prospective clients through a variety of apps. McKay said during the bank's third-quarter conference call in August that the lender has launched nine ventures and already registered more than 200,000 users, \"even with limited marketing in early stages.\"</p><p>RBC's head of technology and operations was asked about big tech during Wednesday's CIBC investor conference.</p><p>\"I'm a big believer in the best defence is a really strong offence,\" said Bruce Ross, RBC's head of tech. \"We believe that we have to follow where our clients want to go.\"</p><p>Ross also said the bank has a three-pronged approach to fintechs: it invests in some, acquires some and partners with some (as the bank does with RBC Ventures). When it comes to bigger tech companies, such as Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., he said a clear line has to be drawn.</p><p>\"Those players, you have to be very specific on, OK, where are you going to work with them and where are you going to compete with them,\" Ross added. \"But ultimately it comes down to following the client, and we look at all of our businesses and say, 'OK, let's cause the disruption ourselves, versus having someone disrupt us.'\" Also speaking at the conference on Wednesday was Teri Currie, the head of Canadian personal banking at Toronto-Dominion Bank.</p><p>Currie told the audience that TD's tech spending has shifted since around 2012 and 2013 today, going from 75 per cent of the expenses geared towards \"run-the-bank\" outlays and 25 per cent for \"change the bank\" moves, to now 40 per cent of the tech dollars going towards the latter. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Sun Media Corporation.

Software companies are trying to market Sarbanes-Oxley to their own benefit. Of course, it's not the first time vendors have tried to profit from the trials and tribulations of corporate IT departments, notes columnist Eric Nee. As in the past, CIOs should look before they leap into these supposed ready-made answers to all their problems. The primary challenge at most companies is to make sure financial processes can be documented and audited, and that's not something that can easily be put in a box.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Organizational Behavior: Nasty People</emphasis></p><p>By Robert I. Sutton</p><p>Managers who belittle and oppress one victim after another shouldn't be hired. And if people turn mean on the job, and won't change, they ought to be fired. When management expert and CIO Insight columnist Robert I. Sutton recently published these sentiments in the Harvard Business Review, he received hundreds of e-mails asking what exactly could be done. His advice: Avoid hiring jerks in the first place, and stop abusive employees in their tracks as soon as they reveal their true colors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Perspectives: Early Adopters</emphasis></p><p>With Debra D'Agostino</p><p>In this series of four interviews, executives who've led compliance efforts at their companies share hard-won advice on what they've learned from their strategies so far. Highlights include the use of self-assessment spreadsheets, creating a centralized IT organization that better supports your business, avoiding panic (and the hijacking of budgets for other agendas), and the need for constant and clear communication throughout the company.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Analysis: High-Speed Compliance</emphasis></p><p>By Jeffrey Rothfeder</p><p>Every company's experience with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance-and the technology used to meet the legislation's demands-will differ. Yet a picture is emerging of what the Sarbanes-compliant company will look like and how its technology, operations, networks and databases will be affected by the legislation. Contributing Editor Jeffrey Rothfeder analyzes the current state of systems devoted to analysis and documentation of financial controls, business performance management and e-mail management, and looks forward to a day when the compliance process-for a whole range of regulations-can be systematized and automated.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Expert Voices: The Letter and the Spirit</emphasis></p><p>With Elizabeth Wasserman</p><p>How will the Securities and Exchange Commission police the Sarbanes-Oxley Act? Who will be the enforcers? We posed these questions to two experts: Laura Unger, a former SEC commissioner; and Scott Green, head of audit and compliance at law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP. The consensus: While the actual rules and standards remain vague, the SEC's goal is to create in companies a \"culture of compliance\" that will extend to the outside auditors and ultimately to the filings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Whiteboard: The Sarbox Effect: Driving Shareholder Value</emphasis></p><p>By Lee Dittmar and Kyle Cheney</p><p>Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 isn't just a legal requirement; it's an opportunity to increase shareholder value. In this whiteboard, two members of Deloitte Consulting LLP's Sarbanes-Oxley practice, Lee Dittmar, its lead consulting partner, and Kyle Cheney, a senior manager, make the connection between Sarbox compliance and the four ways companies can create value: growing revenues, increasing margins, maximizing return on assets and good governance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Strategic Technology: Document Management</emphasis></p><p>By Debra D'Agostino</p><p>With analysts calling document management one of the cornerstones of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance (the other is business process management), hardware and software vendors are rushing to cash in on the big tech issue of the moment. Before you implement a document management system of your own, plan for how it can benefit your business above and beyond regulatory compliance-as it has several of the firms CIO Insight reporter Debra D'Agostino spoke to for her column.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Research: Sarbanes-Oxley</emphasis></p><p>By the editors of CIO Insight and the analysts at Gartner EXP</p><p>Large companies are more optimistic about meeting compliance deadlines and the adequacy of their Sarbox budget than their smaller brethren, according to this month's joint survey by CIO Insight and Gartner EXP. Of 198 IT executives at companies that must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, those at midsize and large companies are most likely to expect to see business benefits through their compliance work. But this optimism may be unrealistic, say Gartner EXP vice presidents Richard Hunter and Marcus Blosch: CIOs may have underestimated the effort required to gain business value from compliance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNSCOM-%CIO20237402%</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOINS2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4CDK-89W0-01KX-40F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">262909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"762\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CIO Insight</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13921\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2004 Quinstreet, Inc.

The clerk will report the next nomination. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Donald R. Tapia, of Arizona, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to Jamaica. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri. Trade Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, something I want to talk about today is something that you and I both care a lot about, and that is farming families and trade. For those of us who grew up on or near farming families, we know that there are a lot of things that are beyond the control of families who farm. For farming and ranching families, the only real certainty is uncertainty. The only thing you know for sure, if your mom or dad is a dairy farmer, like my mom and dad were, is that you don't know anything for sure. You don't know about the weather. You don't know absolutely for sure that all of your equipment is going to work exactly like you need it to and at exactly the time you need it to. In some farming situations, you don't know whether the help you need is going to be available the day you need it. The watermelons can't wait. The strawberries can't wait. The tomatoes can't wait. But you can't have a staff on all the time, ready to pick the watermelon the 2 weeks they need to be picked, or whatever those farmers have to deal with. Uncertainty is part of farming. That is why trade agreements with other countries are so important to America's agriculture. This is a part of our economy that not only feeds our country but goes so far toward feeding the whole world. Trade agreements can provide a little bit of certainty about markets and the opportunities people have to sell the products they are able to grow. In Missouri, agriculture is an $88 billion industry. It employs nearly 400,000 people in our State. Missouri farmers and ranchers export more than $4 billion worth of products every year. Trade deals that lower tariffs that are paid by Missouri farming and ranching families are a good deal now. I could go a long way beyond this, too, because not only does the agricultural sector impact people who make agricultural products but seeds and chemicals that we need fewer and fewer of all the time because people who make and repair machinery get more effective all the time. So both in the seed and chemical area but also people in transportation, people in insurance, people who run the local coffee shop, people whom the school district depends on for those property taxes are all benefited by a strong agricultural sector. We make lots of other things in our State too. We make airplanes. We make pickup trucks. We make cars. We make beer cans. We make all kinds of things that are impacted by trade, but I say to the Presiding Officer, particularly when you and I are out talking in our neighboring States with the communities we deal with in agriculture, trade is a top-of-the-line issue. It is just an important part of the economy of most of our States, frankly. Because of our location, where we live, infrastructure is critical. We are also the hub for products that go all over North America. Integrating that infrastructure--water, rail, cars, and [[Page S4932]] trucks--makes a difference in how we compete. Canada and Mexico are our two biggest trading partners in, I am sure, our State and in the country. In recent months, Mexico has become the biggest trading partner we have. Canada is the next biggest trading partner we have. These are not inconsequential relationships. When the United States signed the North America Free Trade Agreement 25 years ago, it did a lot to open those markets for our products and to not only strengthen our economy but to strengthen the neighborhood. Our exports of food and agricultural products to Canada and Mexico quadrupled under the NAFTA agreement. The treaty also helped to strengthen ties among our countries. You know, a strong Mexico is actually good for us. We have these problems at the border right now that Mexico is trying to help us solve. Almost nobody is coming from Mexico; they are coming through Mexico. And why aren't they coming from Mexico like they did 25 years ago? Because the Mexican economy is an economy that works for people who live there. A strong Canada is good for us. The daily trade over that Canadian-U.S border--things passing back and forth--is incredible and has been for a long time, but it is also much stronger than it used to be. Keeping these connections strong is essential. Trade increases our economic security, but it also increases our national security. Living in a good neighborhood is what we all want to do, and that is the value we have seen out of this agreement for the last 25 years. The agreement could have been better, and the President has made it better. The USMCA is going to be better than NAFTA. No NAFTA would be a bad thing; NAFTA replaced by USMCA would be a good thing. It is time that we begin to build on what we have learned in those 25 years and move into this century with a new agreement that works for farming families, for ranching families, for workers, for people who make automobiles, airplanes, and other things. This leads to more American jobs, and it leads to great benefit for us economically. But, again, let me repeat, the national security impact of having two neighbors that want to work with us. What we just saw the President negotiate with Mexico, where they are helping secure that much narrower border at the southern tip of Mexico more than we would be able to do at the much bigger northern border, that is helpful. Where they are working to help people stay there as their cases are being heard, that is helpful to our country. It is easier to keep people there and have their cases heard than let them disperse throughout the entire United States. Certainly, we hope to gain from the new USMCA treaty, but we hope our neighbors also benefit from that treaty and know they will. The three countries all signed this agreement in November. Mexico has ratified it already. The Prime Minister of Canada says they stand ready to call their Parliament back into session to ratify it. As soon as it is clear, they are going to. Trade is essential. All three of our countries agree on that. Democrats and Republicans agree on that. Members of the House and Senate agree on that. Now what we need to agree on is how to have a time to vote and approve this deal. Let's give our economy the boost it needs. Let's give our neighborhood the strength we have seen develop over the last 25 years. We hope our friends in the House bring this to the floor. It will be a bipartisan vote. It will be a comfortably passed vote. But you have to decide to have a vote for that to happen, and I hope we are close to that moment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. BROWSER Act Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, today I rise and seek my colleagues' support for the BROWSER Act, which is a bipartisan piece of legislation that will protect consumers' data privacy and offer tech companies the freedom they need to innovate. This is something we are hearing so much about. How do you protect your privacy online, or do you have privacy online? The BROWSER Act is the bipartisan solution to that. Innovation really puts the words and the wisdom of the world at our fingertips. Think about it. A click of a mouse, a touch of the screen, and everything you want to know appears right there in front of you. Now that we have all downloaded a myriad of apps and we are using search engines every single day, it is commonplace. But what we have learned and what people are aware of now more than ever is that in the process of doing this, they have given away something vitally important and precious; that is, their privacy and their information. I call it your ``virtual you'' because it is you, your presence, that is right there online. As your transactional life has grown online--you pay your bills, you do your shopping, you order your groceries, you order dinner to be delivered--every time you do that, you are giving these apps a peek into your privacy, into your habits, and there is really quite a battle going on. Who owns the ``virtual you''? Is it you or the bank or the insurance company or the app that is providing that service? Data is the bedrock of most tech companies' revenue streams. The higher the quality of that data, the more money they are going to get for the ad space they sell. The more money they get for the ad space they sell, the more profit they are going to put into their pocket. When you look at all these apps--Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Google, Snapchat--all of these apps are taking your information. They mine your information, and it gets sold--sold for those that are placing ads on your screen. There is a reason companies provide convoluted, pages-long disclosure, full disclosure and privacy policies in tiny print so small you can't read it. It is the same reason that watchdogs warn consumers that if the service is free, you are the product. If the service is free--take a look at these--you are the product. You are because it is your information that they want. Now, I will tell you this: We have come to a season in our society where we have a different story just about every single day of some type of bad behavior from one of these companies. The current story today is about FaceApp, and I think that if I went around the room and asked those who are younger if they have used any of these face- altering apps, they would probably say: Yeah, we downloaded one. They are really a lot of fun to play with. Here is the danger: That app--these face-altering apps and FaceApp-- is not limited to just bits of personal information that are going to be appended to a data set. It could be your image used publicly--with your consent, of course, if you agreed to the fine print by clicking ``download'' or ``get.'' With that, you give your privacy away. Consumers have really grown accustomed to clicking the ``get'' button. They say: I don't have time to read all of this. It would take too long. I don't understand what it means. I just want to use this app. It is convenient. A quick scroll through an average Instagram feed this morning revealed post after post of artificially-aged faces, all thanks to FaceApp, which now owns those images and can do whatever it wants with those images because you unintentionally, when you clicked ``get,'' gave them the permission to use them. This is one of those things where you have to say: Buyer beware and know what you are getting into. Ask anybody who downloaded that app last night, and I bet you they have a little bit of buyer's remorse going on, and they probably wish they hadn't done it and opened those photos to being used by people they will never ever know. Over the past few years, we have watched tech companies lose control of their own narrative, and that is for good reason. Customers feel invaded and are demanding a more satisfying response to the current parade of controversy--something more than just ``Oh, we are going to do better in the future.'' It is clear that the tech company can no longer regulate itself. Big Tech does not have the appetite for self- regulation. That is why I welcome my colleagues on each side of the aisle to sign on to the BROWSER Act. This bill really has been years in the making. I first introduced it in the House of Representatives during the 115th Congress, but my [[Page S4933]] work on the issue began long before that, as I chaired the Privacy Working Group in the House. What this legislation, the BROWSER Act, would do is it would set up a Federal compliance framework that tech companies would use as a guide. It would require companies to secure a clear opt-in from you, the consumer, before collecting sensitive information about your health, your finances, or your Social Security numbers--things that are important and personal to you. They would have to get your explicit permission in order to use those. For less sensitive information, like an IP address or your browsing history or your search and your purchase history, companies would have to give customers the opportunity to opt- out so that they would not have the permission to share that. Companies won't be able to deny service to anyone refusing to waive their privacy, but the Federal Trade Commission will keep the playing field level by applying the rules equally across the entire internet ecosystem. To recap that, you would have opt-in for sensitive information and opt-out for nonsensitive information and one set of rules, with one regulator, for the entire internet ecosystem and a tech platform that would not be able to throw you off because you said: Hey, I want to protect myself and my family. I think it is important, too, to realize that the BROWSER Act does not overregulate the industry, but what this does is it says: Let's have guidelines. Let's have some guardrails up here. Let's have a light-touch regulation that is going to protect the consumer and allow the consumer to protect their ``virtual you,'' their presence online. Lately, what we have seen is some blowback from some very public mistakes that have chased some of these big tech companies into the arms of the regulators, making them all too happy to accept government- mandated rules in lieu of internal standards. You have heard it. You have heard some people like Facebook saying: Oh, my goodness. We will accept regulation now. We want the Federal Government more involved. What they are trying to do is block out innovation and competition and new startups because they control the marketplace. Google. Ninety percent of search is done by Google. Recently, Facebook got a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission. I said that actually wasn't enough. It should have been more like $50 billion when you look at the business Facebook has built and the valuation they have built. They are a big advertising company. They have this platform. They get you on that platform. They build their valuation off the number of eyeballs they capture to that, the users they have and, remember what I said earlier, the high quality of the data. That is money in their revenue stream, and it is profit in their pockets. Their bad behavior will not change unless we change the way they are going to be able to do business. Understanding the business of Big Tech is half the battle. I have been at this for years, going back to my days in Tennessee, my home State, as we looked at film and entertainment and music and moving from analog to digital in the economy, coming to Congress, working in the House on this issue. I will state that the ins and outs of this industry is not something that can be learned in a day or something you can be briefed on and then all of a sudden you are an expert in that area. If you think you know it all--what I have learned in tech is, the more you learn the less you know, and you have to keep working on it if you are going to properly regulate the industry. I thank my colleague Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham for recognizing the need for institutional knowledge by this body and for asking me to lead the committee's new technology task force. This is a bipartisan group. We will meet regularly with leaders in the tech industry, and we will talk a good bit about data, privacy, competition, prioritization, censorship, and other issues that will arise. Our first meeting is actually going to be later today. I would encourage my friends in the Senate to use this time and use this task force as a resource and study up because these issues are not going to go away. It is time for us to do something on the issues of privacy, data security, censorship, and prioritization. To my colleagues who are really very skeptical that we can use a lighter touch in regulating Big Tech, I want to say this: Washington is historically very bad at culture change. They are very bad at it. What we do know is, when looking at the technology that now underpins every single industrial sector in this country, that technology goes through a life cycle, if you will, in about 18 months. We know there cannot be heavy-handed regulation. We know we cannot regulate to a technology. We know that the guidelines need to be put in place, and the guardrails need to be laid down. We need to make certain businesses are looking at their consumers, and they are saying: You can trust us to be a good steward of your information. Consumers, citizens--Tennesseeans, in my case--need to know I have asked the tech companies to work to restore the trust and confidence that is needed by the online consumer and to move away from having it understood by people--understood in the negative--that if the service is free, you are the product. Let's join together, in a bipartisan fashion, and give the American online consumer the ability to control and to own their virtual ``you,'' which is them and their presence online. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Yount). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2211693I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMC-6Y51-F0YC-N0S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Previously, as head of Banesco Panama, Salas expanded the brand in Panama and established offices in the Dominican Republic and Colombia.</p><p>Banesco USA recently celebrated one of its most successful quarters, with total assets reaching $1.25 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30. The bank also reported huge gains in net income, loans and deposits during the third quarter. With plans to begin 2019 with a new branch in Aventura, Banesco USA intends to see even more growth in the new year.</p><p>Salas sat down with the Business Journal to talk about his background, banking, and a career that's taken him from Venezuela to South Florida.</p><p>Why were you drawn to the banking industry? I wasn't necessarily attracted to the banking industry as much as I was attracted to Banesco. I was drawn to Banesco's entrepreneurial spirit. I have been given the opportunity to start from scratch affiliate companies in the group and grow Banesco's presence by opening locations in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Not many multinational groups offer that.</p><p>How does your public policy background help you in your current role? To me, public policy is about finding a solution to a problem that benefits all the parties involved. Think about a traffic light. If there were no traffic lights, the streets would be chaos. But a traffic light improves conditions for drivers, pedestrians, everyone on the street. Here at the bank, I'm dealing with regulators, shareholders, employees. When you're a top manager, you have to fulfill the expectations of multiple stakeholders, and I think that's something that my public policy background prepared me for.</p><p>What do you enjoy most about living in South Florida? My family is incredibly happy here - all of us love living close to the beach. Culturally, it's diverse; there's a fantastic restaurant scene that's only getting better. I like that South Florida is both dynamic and relaxed at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>Do you have a special morning routine? I actually have morning and evening routines. The evening routine might be more important; before I go to sleep, I always look at my calendar and go through my meetings for the next day. I only go to sleep after I've prepped for those meetings. In the morning, I have to exercise. I usually run or go to a spinning lesson. If I don't exercise in the morning, I don't have the same energy levels and I might feel like falling asleep by the afternoon.</p><p>What advice would you give your 20-year-old self? Nothing is as bad or as good as it seems. You might feel like something is the end of the world; it's not. You might think something is the best thing that will ever happen to you; it's not. Try to keep that perspective.</p><p>How do you balance work and your personal life? There's something I like to call the \"rocking chair exercise.\" Imagine you're 80 years old, in a rocking chair, looking at your situation from that vantage point. If you do that, a decision that might have seemed complex often becomes less difficult.</p><p>What's something that not many people know about you? Humor is important to me. Professionally, I'm sometimes skeptical of very serious people. If you're confident, you should be laughing a lot, or else something is wrong. Having fun along the way makes work a better experience for everybody.\u00a0</p><p>What challenges does the banking industry face? One is how to be more personal, which doesn't necessarily mean being more personalized. The big tech companies can be very personalized without being personal. For example, Amazon may know what you want to buy, but try talking to someone at Amazon. If you can talk to your banker in an ATM, that's using tech to be personal. That's the sweet spot community banks have to look for.\u00a0</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of David Bernhardt, of Virginia, to be Secretary of the Department of Interior. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. </p><p>Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Medicare Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, some officials are proposing radical changes to our healthcare system. These proposals include Medicare for All, Medicare Buy-in, Medicaid for All, and expansion of the Affordable Care Act. All of these are versions of government-run healthcare. These are, of course, better campaign slogans than serious solutions to the problems facing Americans. On a certain level, I have found that most people would rather have control over their own healthcare than have the government make those decisions for them. A single-payer healthcare system would be devastating for our seniors, people with disabilities, and people with preexisting conditions. I yield the floor. Recognition of the Majority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized. Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. McCONNELL. Today the Senate will vote to confirm the President's choice to serve as Secretary of the Interior. As I have discussed this week, David Bernhardt is no stranger to the Department. He has served twice before. In fact, this body has confirmed him twice before. Each time his professionalism and dedication proved us right. As Solicitor and as Deputy Secretary, Mr. Bernhardt has offered capable leadership and a firm grasp on the complex policy environment surrounding our Nation's public lands. His expertise has not gone unnoticed. Praise for Mr. Bernhardt has poured in from a list of more than 40 stakeholder organizations; from agriculture, trade, conservation, and Native American organizations. They describe him as a leader whose ``experience is sorely needed.'' They laud his commitment to ``make the lands he manages accessible to the recreating public.'' So we have before us an opportunity to confirm a well-qualified steward of our Nation's public lands and resources. Yesterday, a bipartisan majority of our colleagues voted to end debate on his nomination, and I hope each will join me in voting yes once more later today. [[Page S2400]] Of course, confirming Mr. Bernhardt will be just the latest in a series of many Executive Calendar accomplishments. Following on the heels of last week's turn back toward the Senate's historic tradition concerning nominations, we have been able to approve a number of the President's nominees at a much more reasonable pace in the last several days. I have noted, with particular interest that, for all the breathless warnings my Democratic colleagues issued about the kinds of people we would be confirming, these unobjectionable nominees have actually mostly coasted through on a bipartisan basis. We saw support from both sides of the aisle for Roy Altman to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, and for Daniel Domenico to the District of Colorado. We saw an overwhelming bipartisan vote in favor of confirming GEN John Abizaid to serve as Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and a voice-voted confirmation for Jeffrey Kessler to serve as Assistant Secretary of Commerce. These are not lightning-rod people whom my Democratic colleagues would have eagerly debated and investigated for an additional 30 hours. They are the kind of thoroughly qualified public servants who used to sail briskly through the Senate without opposition. Now, even as my Democratic colleagues continue to require us to file cloture on individuals whom they actually go on to support, we are able to fill out the President's team at a more reasonable clip. There are still many empty seats left to fill, but this week's progress marks a great new beginning not just for the administration that needs its personnel but for the health of this institution. Tax Reform Madam President, on another matter, over the past year or so, I have dedicated a large part of my time on the floor to discussing the performance of the U.S. economy, and at no point have I struggled to find things to say. Seemingly every day, we have been greeted by headlines that tell the same story: Under the political policies of a pro-growth, pro- opportunity Republican agenda, Americans are experiencing a remarkable economic moment. More than 1 year ago, I mentioned on the floor that weekly jobless claims had reached their lowest level since 1969. Last week, the Labor Department reported that by this measure, the U.S. economy has set yet another new record. What was already a nearly 49-year low has now dipped further to a nearly 50-year low. My colleagues and I have been busy highlighting the American stories behind these numbers--stories of recovery and prosperity being written in all sorts of communities, in all corners of our country. More than 1 year since a generational overhaul of the Federal Tax Code lifted burdens from American job creators, entrepreneurs, and working families, the headlines are continuing to pour in. With Tax Day just around the corner, millions of working families have filed for the first time under a law that has allowed, according to nonpartisan analysts, the vast majority of Americans to keep more of their money. They have pocketed higher take-home pay, wage increases, and special bonuses, and they benefited from the booming job market these policies have helped ignite. But old habits die hard. The Washington Democrats who were content to watch as the Obama era piled up 75 percent of new jobs and 90 percent of population growth to the biggest metropolitan areas are back to their same old tricks. In recent months, we have seen a steady drip of leftist daydreams making their way into press conferences, resolutions, and out on the 2020 campaign trail: a massive rewrite of American election laws and a power grab on an individual's right to exercise political speech, a mandatory, one-size-fits-all government-run replacement for private healthcare for over 180 million Americans, and an estimated $93 trillion in taxpayers' money to be spent testing out new Federal social planning schemes and abolishing the affordable energy sources American families rely on. Tax Day seems like an especially fitting day to tell Washington Democrats no thanks--no thanks. The Kentuckians I represent prefer to keep more of their own hard- earned money. They prefer to make their own decisions about their own families instead of ceding more power to bureaucrats. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. H.R. 268 Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, Members of the Senate, if you look at the poster I just put up, you know what I am going to talk about--the devastating floods in Iowa and the Midwest. In Western Iowa, we still have areas underwater from flooding on the Missouri river and its tributaries. In the east, we are dealing with the Mississippi River and tributary flooding. Unfortunately, the weather isn't cooperating with additional storms and rain throughout the Upper Midwest, as I speak, that could exacerbate flooding and hinder cleanup and repairs. This flooding is still a very active event, but as we move to recovery, we know the original damage estimates in Iowa are increasing. I can say that for Nebraska as well. Many roads are still closed; levy damage is extensive; towns are devastated; and many individuals lost their homes and businesses. In just 6 of our 99 counties in Iowa, 416,000 acres of cropland was flooded. Much of that cropland is still underwater. These farmers are facing the challenge of not being able to plant this year. Unfortunately, many of these farmers' fields were just recovering from previous years of major flooding. In this area of Iowa, that would have been in 2011. This is compounded by many losing their previous harvest through having their on-the-farm storage bins destroyed, as you can see here. Throughout the Midwest area that had severe flooding, 832 on-farm storage bins have been identified as being like these, destroyed. We don't have a complete estimate of that, but I think 832 on-the-farm storage bins would be at least a figure up to a certain date. These bins hold an estimated 5 to 10 million bushels of corn or soybeans, so, collectively, that would be a loss of worth between $17 million and $34 million. There is an existing program that goes by the acronym WHIP in the Department of Agriculture that is designed to address agricultural losses not covered by crop insurance and other programs. I reached out to the U.S. Department of Agriculture to see if this program could be used for losses such as those seen here, particularly in Iowa and Nebraska, for corn and soybeans. I was told because the WHIP program was designed for other commodities affected by hurricanes and wildfires, they needed a few words added to the law to extend the same help to these problems we now have in the Midwest. I asked what those words were, and I spoke to Senator Shelby, who manages this bill on the floor of the Senate, and to Senator Perdue, who has a great deal of interest in the bill because of agricultural losses in Georgia. These two Senators agreed to work with me. These two Senators agreed to work with me. So I filed a shorter amendment of a disaster bill along with Senator Ernst and several of my colleagues from the Midwest to make sure that devastation like this is covered. I am optimistic that this simple fix, which will mean so much to farmers facing such unusual catastrophic losses, can be included as the disaster bill moves forward through the Senate. Yesterday, as another way of helping more than just this type of farmer but, generally, other disaster victims, I joined Senators Fischer, Ernst, and Sasse in introducing a tax bill that goes by the title of the Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019. This bill includes a series of disaster tax relief provisions that will help American families and businesses recover from the terrible disasters that have occurred so far in 2019, including the Midwest flooding. On February 28 I introduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Wyden that included the same tax relief provisions that would assist the victims of disasters that occurred in 2018. So I view the Fischer bill and the Grassley-Wyden bill as complementary, providing disaster tax relief with respect to the disasters that occurred last year, as well as this year. The bill that I introduced in February also includes extensions of [[Page S2401]] a series of tax provisions that almost every Member of this Senate would like to see passed. These are the tax provisions that expired in 2017 and 2018. We labeled all 25 or 26 of these as tax extenders. These are things that, over the last two decades, have been extended almost automatically after they have sunset, and we need to get those provisions enacted, just like the disaster tax relief provisions. I encourage the House Democrats to send the Senate a bill that addresses both tax extenders and disaster tax relief provisions. When I say House Democrats, people listening are going to say: He is being partisan. No, I am being constitutional. The Constitution says that all tax bills have to start in the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives is controlled by the Democrat majority. So that is why I am saying to the House Democrats: Get these bills over here to us so we can help not only the people that benefit from what we call tax extenders but, more importantly, those who with the urgency of the disaster that we are facing. The importance of passing these bills is because Americans need certainty as they file their taxes in 2018, and they need the tax relief as they recover from these natural disasters. They really need the House Democrats, under the Constitution, to pass a tax bill because we can't act on these tax bills before. The custom around here is that the Constitution says that all tax bills have to start in the House of Representatives. If we pass even a simple tax bill--let's say we pass it as part of an appropriations bill--and we send it over to the House, they don't accept it. That has been the tradition around here for centuries. That is why I am calling on the House Democrats to move that bill. The disaster relief provisions included in the bill that we have introduced reduce penalties and make it easier to access retirement funds so individuals and families can get back up on their feet and rebuild their lives. In other words, these are retirement funds that people have set aback and that the law doesn't allow them to access for disasters. It is just a simple thing. If somebody is hurt by this disaster and wants to go to their retirement fund and borrow on it for a certain period of time to help them get relief, it is a pretty simple thing. Maybe, momentarily you could say it costs the Federal Government something, but they are still going to owe these taxes regardless of whenever they start drawing for retirement. These bills also make it easier for disaster victims to claim personal casualty losses, and they suspend certain limitations on charitable contributions to encourage more donations for this disaster relief. For businesses affected by these disasters, this tax relief is available to help them retain employees while businesses get back up and running. Let's continue the bipartisan tradition of helping our fellow Americans with disasters. When these disasters strike, we ought to do it by enacting this tax relief for both 2018 and 2019, so that disaster victims don't have to wait any longer to access this important assistance and continue to get back on their feet. It may sound like I am talking about something new. I don't know whether this just started with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or before, but I remember being chairman of the Finance Committee then. We passed similar legislation to help the victims of hurricanes. So this is really nothing new. Since it is nothing new and we have done it before, what is wrong with doing it now? The Democrats in the House of Representatives can get this bill over to us so we can get it enacted over here and get it to the President. We want to provide the certainty that taxpayers deserve by enacting extensions of not only those disasters but also the expired tax provisions. I encourage the House Democrats to move swiftly. The Senate and the American people are waiting. On another point about flooding, generally, not just dealing with this flood, this flood brings to attention something we have to deal with, with the Army Corps of Engineers. Next week the Environment and Public Works Committee is holding a field hearing in Southwest Iowa to provide oversight on the Army Corps of Engineers management of the 2019 Missouri River flooding. Senator Ernst, my colleague from Iowa, will be chairing this hearing, and I am going to be participating. Flood control should be the No. 1 priority of the Corps in its management of the Missouri River. I hope that tomorrow, when I get to travel with Vice President Pence as he views the same area that I viewed 2 weeks ago--the same area covered here--we have the Army Corps of Engineers there so that we can talk to them about the issue of the Missouri River Master Manual authorizing eight purposes as they control the water up and down the Missouri River. They do that through the dams on the Missouri River. It happens that seven of these can be at cross purposes with the eighth one--flood control. I hope flood control is No. 1 and not No. 8. We need to discuss with them how to prevent massive flooding and how to act to ensure that folks in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas are not faced with devastation every few years. Eventually, this water ends up in the Gulf of Mexico. So States below Missouri are going to eventually be affected by it. I appreciate the stamina and determination of Iowans whom I have seen out there, not only in this flood of 2019 but in the flood of 2011. The one of 2019 was much more devastating. I think we have great resiliency. We will come back and pull together to get the job done, but there is a very long recovery ahead of all of these Iowans affected by it and Nebraskans and, maybe to some extent, Kansas and quite a bit in Missouri. I will continue to do everything I can at the Federal level to help the State of Iowa, Iowa communities, and, more importantly, in fact, as individual Iowans are affected, I am going to help them to recover and to rebuild. Thank you. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, it is an exciting day for Colorado. I have known David Bernhardt, our nominee for Secretary of the Interior-- and the seventh Secretary of the Interior from Colorado should he be confirmed today--personally and professionally for over two decades. His roots are deep on both sides of Colorado--in the High Plains and on the Western Slope. We share a lot of common interests in rural development and in saving our small towns. My experience stems from growing up in the agricultural community of Yuma, CO, in the Eastern Plains, and Mr. Bernhardt's formative years were spent on the Western Slope of Colorado--an area that is a microcosm of all of the things that we cherish about our great public lands. We both began our public service only 1 year apart when we worked for Colorado State Representative Russell George, who would later go on to become speaker of the Colorado House. That is when I first met David. Mr. Bernhardt worked with Jaime, my wife, at the Department of the Interior during the George W. Bush administration under another Colorado Secretary of the Interior. His personal background and public and private sector professional experiences prove he is a strong voice for the West and is extremely well-qualified for the nomination to be the Secretary. In fact, there are few others who have the kind of experience that he has that enables him to be qualified to be Secretary. Which Secretary of the Interior has had more experience than David Bernhardt or has been more qualified to become the Secretary of the Interior? He has extensive insight on Western water policy, natural resources policy, and on Indian affairs, just to name a few. Those who have worked with Mr. Bernhardt commend him for his integrity and wealth of knowledge on the issues under the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction. In 2008, after the Department of the Interior reached the largest Indian [[Page S2402]] water rights settlement in our Nation's history, Secretary Kempthorne personally acknowledged Mr. Bernhardt's work as then-Solicitor and stated: ``His effective coordination--both within Interior as well as with the local, tribal, state and congressional leaders--was essential to the success we celebrate today.'' More recently, he worked to accommodate many Western States' requests for more flexibility under the Greater Sage-Grouse RMP Amendment. John Swartout, who as a senior policy adviser ran point on this issue for Colorado's Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper, had this to say in December 2018 once that process was completed: David Bernhardt is an honest man who puts all his cards on the table and keeps his word. I have worked with DOI for 25 years, and David is one of the finest people I have ever worked with. That didn't come from a partisan Republican or a partisan Democrat; that came from a person in the Democratic Governor's office who worked with him on natural resource issues. Dale Hall, the CEO of Ducks Unlimited, which is hardly a partisan Republican or Democratic organization but is an organization that does more real conservation work on the ground than most of the groups that have the word ``conservation'' in their names, had this to say when Mr. Bernhardt's nomination for Secretary was announced: I have known and worked with David Bernhardt for more than a decade, and we are excited to continue to work with him as the new Secretary of the Interior. His integrity in following the law is beyond reproach. David Bernhardt is a champion of conservation and the right person for the job. We urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him. Colleagues of his from his time spent working for Representative Scott McInnis, who represented Mr. Bernhardt's hometown in Colorado, swore he worked 40 hours a day, 8 days a week. Notably, during Mr. Bernhardt's tenure in his office, Representative McInnis was the House author of the bill that led to the designation of the Great Sand Dunes as being a national park. Having now worked at very senior levels in the Department of the Interior over the course of many years, there is zero question Mr. Bernhardt is qualified to do this job. Along with Mr. Bernhardt's professional career, I believe it is important to fully understand his background and the foundation of his interest in public lands, which further qualifies him for this role. Mr. Bernhardt is originally from the outskirts of the small town of Rifle, located on Colorado's Western Slope. Few places more fully embody the spirit and mission of the Agency he has been nominated to lead as Secretary with that understanding of this public land. Growing up in rural Colorado has instilled in him Western values and interests, and to this day, Mr. Bernhardt enjoys hunting, recreation, the outdoors, and fishing. Rifle is located in Garfield County, an area in which about 60 percent of the lands are public lands. Rifle was founded as a ranching community along the Colorado River, and it retains that heritage today, along with tremendous opportunities for outdoor recreation, including fishing, hiking, skiing, rafting, and rock climbing. It also sits at the edge of the Piceance Basin, an area in Colorado that has vast amounts of natural gas. Mr. Bernhardt grew up in the oil shale boom and bust and has said that the boom and bust ``has made [him] more sensitive to the potential benefits and the potential impacts, both environmental and social'' of energy development. In the 1980s, Rifle was hit by the State's oil shale crash, and he personally experienced some of the hard times that the Nation's rural communities often face in those boom and bust moments. Much like the Department of the Interior itself, Rifle is a community that is a product of its public lands and Western heritage. It is centrally located within a few miles of the iconic Grand Mesa--the world's largest flat-topped mountain--the Flat Tops Wilderness, and the Roan Plateau. It represents a home base among these public lands with there being virtually unmatched access to world-class outdoor experiences, which is why Mr. Bernhardt has such a passion for these issues. His previous experience at the Department of the Interior allowed him to fix a problem for Colorado that I was told for 8 years, under the Obama administration, was simply not fixable. As a result, in 2018, revenue that had been sitting in an account in the Federal Government for over a decade that had been owed to three counties in Colorado were distributed back to these Colorado counties and to the taxpayers who had been owed this money. How did this get solved after a decade of saying it could not be solved? It is because David Bernhardt believes you don't just push the problems that are on your front porch onto somebody else's; you find a solution and you fix it. Prior to his current position, his previous experience includes being tapped to be the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior. In 2006, by voice vote in the U.S. Senate, Mr. Bernhardt was confirmed to be Solicitor. In the last Congress, he earned bipartisan support during his confirmation process to be Deputy Secretary. His integrity and ability are assets that should bolster the case for his nomination, not detract from it. Yet, over the course of the last couple of months, the Washington, DC, political smear machine has been working overtime to sully a good man's name. None of what we have seen or heard in the pages of the New York Times and in other places has been new information. I guess the hope is that we will take it more seriously because this time around, the New York Times is the one writing about it. Mr. Bernhardt has undergone two separate and extensive FBI reviews for both his nomination to be Deputy Secretary and his nomination to be Secretary. These reviews occurred after the allegations were first raised, and he was cleared for both positions, which is probably something people didn't read in the New York Times. In understanding that these claims had been reviewed previously to the Senate's committee's satisfaction, Mr. Bernhardt's nomination was reported out last week by a bipartisan vote of 14 to 6. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Chairman Murkowski's and Ranking Member Manchin's committee statements. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Statements From Senators Murkowski and Manchin From the Business Meeting To Consider Pending Nominations (04/04/2019) Senator Murkowski: (21:01) Good morning everyone. The Committee will come to order. We're meeting this morning to consider three nominations. This is for the nomination of David Bernhardt to be Secretary of Department of Interior; Susan Combs to be assistant Secretary of Interior for Policy, Management and Budget; and Aimee Jorjani to be chair of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. I believe that all three of these nominees are well-qualified and encourage all members to vote to report them favorably this morning. As I noted last week Mr Bernhardt, I believe, has the right background. He's got the right experience to be an excellent Secretary of the Interior. He has twice been confirmed to positions at Interior with bipartisan support. First, to be Solicitor in 2006 and then to be Deputy Secretary in 2017. He's most recently served as Acting Secretary since January of 2019. I understand that Mr. Bernhardt has the second most prior experience at the Department out of any nominee for secretary, is from the West-I like that-he has great familiarity with issues that will come before him, and he's proven that he can ably lead the Department. So, what everybody's talking about this morning. There is-- there are accusations about his ethics. We had this conversation last--or two weeks ago when--when his name was before us. I think it's very clear you got some pretty well funded groups that are working very hard, very energetically against his nomination. We saw new allegations last week and then this morning there is--is yet another report. And this is all--this is all coming despite--despite the government scientists involved saying that there was nothing amiss when we had that conversation last week, Senator Gardner, you certainly raised that. This week we're starting to see--we're again seeing new reporting on old allegations. I don't think that this is a coincidence, that we are seeing this kind of a roundup of reporting on old stories--and I think nonstories-- just as we're approaching the markup here. Interior's Inspector General has reviewed the matter as part of its due diligence. It has not opened an investigation. In fact, our staff checked with the Inspector General's office. We were told that there are no open investigations into Mr. Bernhardt. We have had as a committee I believe ample time to review all of these allegations. I am aware of [[Page S2403]] no substantiation of them whatsoever and frankly I would be-- I would be stunned if they were to be substantiated. I would remind members that both the Office of Government Ethics and the Designated Agency Ethics Official have found Mr. Bernhardt to be in good standing. So, again, there--there will probably be a question this morning, I would imagine, on--on the New York Times article that is out there this morning, but I would remind colleagues or ask you to look into these. These allegations again contain no new infoimation. This is recycled. It's been repackaged. They're now focusing on an invoice from Mr. Bernhardt's prior Law Firm. The law firm has said that it was labeled incorrectly. Others have said it was labeled incorrectly. It didn't concern lobbying services. We have known about this previous work that he has had at Westlands. We knew it back in 2017 when we confirmed him as Deputy Secretary. And at that time this work was not deemed lobbying. So, just because it's in the New York Times this morning doesn't mean that it's correct. It's my hope that as a committee we will--will move forward in affirming Mr. Bernhardt to be Secretary of the Interior. And then the full Senate will confirm him coming up here. I think the sooner we have a permanent Secretary at Interior, the better. Senator Manchin: (30:50) Thank you Madam Chairman and I appreciate the committee-- ensuring this committee moves forward on important nominations. We have two of those nominations before us this morning that I'm glad that we are reporting from this committee and--the nominations of Susan Combs, Assistant Secretary of Interior of Policy, Management, and Budget and the nomination of Aimee Jorjani to chair The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. I think Madam Chairman gave a good overview of that. Committee voted to--to report both of these nominations during the last Congress, but unfortunately the Senate didn't vote to confirm them before at adjourned. Each time, the committee approved the nomination by voice vote and I previously supported of both nominations and I intend to do so again this morning. On David Bernhardt. As a former governor and those who have served in executive positions, that I understand it, we've had to ask our state senators and our Oversight committees about putting in our teams together. And I've always been differential to allowing an executive to put their team together as long as the person is qualified and meets the ethical standards. There's concerns and I respect those concerns. Mr. Bernhardt, in my estimation met the test. He's clearly qualified. I think we all know that. He has the knowledge and experience to serve as Secretary, knows the Interior Department inside and out--that might be a blessing to some, maybe a concern--and he is well-versed in all the issues that come before him. I spoke with him several times before this business meeting regarding his nomination. I've reviewed his follow-up questions for the record following his hearing. He has answered all of our questions in a timely manner. We received them back and I think it's all been made record. I even talked to him earlier this week by phone again. I questioned him again, extensively, about his willingness to be a good steward of our nation's greatest natural resources, our national parks, our monuments, and all of our historical sites. I questioned him about his responsibility to balance our resource needs with environmental protection in fairness to the owners of our public lands, which is all of the American people. I spoke to him about the need to make sure that those who are granted the privilege of using our public lands leave them in better condition than what they found them in, which is not always the case and we've got to change that. And I had extensive conversation with Mr. Bernhardt regarding compliance and ethics--ethics laws and regulations, as well as his potential conflict of interest. I was very much concerned about that. Based on my extensive discussions with Mr. Bernhardt and the assurances that he has given me, I'm prepared to vote for him this morning, but I will note that I expect him and the Department, now I've put them on notice, hold them--hold them to the highest ethical standards. And I've told him that. I said because I surely will. I surely will hold him to be accountable for his actions. He must work to ensure committee and a commitment to ethical and scientific integrity and I intend to work with him and his staff persistently to ensure that this is the case. Our parks and public lands, our scenic beauty, our fish and wildlife resources are important to all of us here, to the people we represent, and my state, and in your states. And West Virginians count on the Secretary of Interior, as they do in your States also, as the guardian of our public lands. . . . I intend to work with Mr. Bernhardt these important issues. I've made it clear to him that I expect him to put his extensive experience and knowledge of these issues to work for the American people and not to people used to work for. And to execute his responsibilities in the manner that ensures that our public lands are not just being maintained, but improved. Improved for the benefit of generations to come. Thank you Madam Chair. Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, let's talk about that story and ethics for a second. Mr. Bernhardt has spent more than 15 years of a 25-year career in public service, and most of that time has been spent at the Department of the Interior. While in his private law practice, he never lobbied the Department of the Interior--not once. During his time as Deputy Secretary, he has focused on the fundamental transformation of the Department and Bureau-level ethics programs to ingrain a culture of ethical compliance and reduce workplace misconduct. The reality is that the ethics program throughout the Department of the Interior had been, sadly, neglected by the previous administration. The Office of Inspector General and the Departmental Ethics Office had recommended significant resource changes that had fallen on deaf ears under the previous administration. Under Mr. Bernhardt's direction, the Department has hired a total of 42 career professional ethics advisers. By the end of fiscal year 2019, they will have doubled the number of career ethics officials that the previous administration had hired in its entire 8 years. The record shows that he has actively sought and consulted with the Department's designated Agency ethics officials regarding compliance with his ethics obligations recusals. In addition, he has installed a robust screening process to ensure that he does not meet with or engage in particular matters benefiting the former clients from which he is recused. Every proposed meeting is reviewed by career professionals to ensure compliance with not only his ethics agreement but ethics laws and to make sure his ethics pledge to the President is upheld. His work in natural resources law prior to joining the administration and related ethics agreements are very similar in scope and substance to the private work and ethics agreements of senior Interior officials who came before him in previous administrations. Let me say that again. The same kinds of ethics agreements and obligations that basically he is doing are what previous administrations did as well. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the Department of the Interior Designated Agency Ethics Official dated March 25, 2019. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: United States Department of the Interior, Office of the Solicitor, Washington, DC, March 25, 2019. Hon. Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Richard Blumenthal, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Warren and Senator Blumenthal: Thank you for your letter of February 26, 2019 regarding your expressed concerns of the actions of the Acting Secretary of the Department of the Interior (Department or DOI). Your letter references an article published by the New York Times on February 12, 2019 discussing the Acting Secretary's legal practice prior to joining the Department as Deputy Secretary in August 2017. Specifically, you asked about the Acting Secretary's involvement with the Central Valley Project (CVP) in California and whether his actions, ``violated his ethics pledge and federal conflict of interest regulations by participating in decisions that directly affect a former client.'' As discussed below, we have found the Acting Secretary's actions have complied with all applicable ethics laws, rules and other obligations, including the requirements of President Trump's Executive Order 13770 entitled, ``Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees'' (Jan. 28, 2017) (Ethics Pledge). As an initial matter, I would like to take this opportunity to inform you and your colleagues of recent developments and improvements with the DOI ethics program that will enhance our ability to prevent conflicts of interest at all levels of the Department. Since our arrival at the Department in April 2018, Deputy Director Heather Gottry and I have overhauled an ethics office that was previously characterized by both DOI employees and numerous Inspector General reports as passive and ineffectual. With the strong support of the Acting Secretary, we have spearheaded a long-overdue build-out of the Departmental Ethics Office (DEO) as well as the ethics programs of the various Bureaus and Offices throughout the Department. Our top priority as non-partisan, career ethics officials, is to prevent conflicts of interest at the DOI and ensure that DOI employees are aware of and comply with all applicable ethics laws and standards. We understand the importance of our program in helping the American people have trust and confidence in the lawful and proper administration of the Department. [[Page S2404]] Please know that my office takes all credible allegations of potential ethics violations by any DOI employee very seriously and allegations against senior officials are an extremely high priority. Consequently, when the New York Times published its article, I immediately sought to understand the facts and carefully analyzed the applicable legal authorities. We note that the Acting Secretary also immediately requested that my office look into this matter and to examine the prior ethics advice and counsel he had received. Of critical importance, we note that the Acting Secretary does not have any financial conflicts of interest related to either his former client, Westlands Water District, or the CVP generally. As reflected in his Ethics Agreement, dated May 1, 2017, and his Ethics Recusal memorandum, dated August 15, 2017, the Acting Secretary was required under 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2635.502 to recuse for one year (until August 3, 2018) from participating personally and substantially in any ``particular matters involving specific parties'' in which Westlands Water District was a party or represented a party. Because Westlands Water District is an agency or entity of a state or local government it is excluded from the requirements of paragraph 6 of the Ethics Pledge. Additionally, consistent with U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) guidance, it was determined that the law the Acting Secretary had lobbied on for Westlands Water District, Public Law 114-322, should not be categorized as a ``particular matter'' because the law addressed a broad range of issues and topics. Therefore, because he did not lobby on a ``particular matter'' for Westlands Water District, he was not required to recuse himself under paragraph 7 of the Ethics Pledge either from ``particular matters'' or ``specific issue areas'' related to Public Law 114-322. Accordingly, the Acting Secretary's recusal related to Westlands Water District ended on August 3, 2018, and was limited in scope to ``particular matters involving specific parties'' under 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2635.502. I have enclosed the transmittal e-mail from me to the Acting Secretary with a detailed memorandum attached wherein the DEO consolidates and memorializes prior ethics advice and guidance on certain issues involving the CVP. Of particular importance for a legal analysis of the scope of the Acting Secretary's recusals related to Westlands Water District, the memorandum analyzed and categorized certain issues involving the CVP and related State Water Project as ``matters,'' ``particular matters of general applicability,'' and ``particular matters involving specific parties.'' As I state in the transmittal e-mail, these legal categorizations are critical in determining whether an official complies with the various ethics rules. As reflected in the memorandum, we determined that both the Notice of Intent to Prepare a Draft EIS and the development of a 2019 Biological Assessment are appropriately categorized as ``matters,'' not ``particular matters.'' Our determinations are supported by Federal law and OGE opinions and though the matters involved may sound like ``particular matters'' or ``specific issue areas,'' they are legally broad matters outside the scope of 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2635.502. As noted above, the Acting Secretary's lobbying on behalf of Westlands Water District on Public Law 114-322 was not categorized as a ``particular matter'' and did not require an additional recusal under paragraph 7 of the Ethics Pledge. Therefore, the Acting Secretary was not required under either 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2635.502 or the Ethics Pledge to recuse from participation in either the Notice of Intent to Prepare a Draft EIS or the development of a 2019 Biological Assessment. Attached, for your convenience, please find the legal reference materials addressed in the memorandum--I believe our interpretation and application of the relevant legal authorities is both reasonable and prudent. I have advised the Acting Secretary, at his request, that he and his staff should continue to consult with the DEO prior to participating in any matter that is potentially within the scope of his Ethics Agreement, Ethics Recusal memorandum, the Ethics Pledge, or any other ethics law or regulation. Additionally, to eliminate any potential for miscommunication, I have instructed my staff that all ethics guidance to the Acting Secretary be in writing prior to his participation in a decision or action that reasonably appears to come within the purview of his legal ethics obligations. In closing, and to be responsive to your final requests, the DEO has not issued any authorizations or ethics waivers to the Acting Secretary or other Interior officials on the topics you raised, nor have we referred any matters to the IG on these topics. It is worth noting that the Acting Secretary meets with me and my senior staff frequently and that I have a standing meeting with him once a week to discuss any significant ethics issues at the DOI. Pursuant to the Acting Secretary's direction, my senior staff also meets with his scheduling staff and other top officials twice a week, at a minimum, to ensure we are aware of who the Acting Secretary is meeting with and the issues he will be discussing. These efforts, supported by the Acting Secretary and his staff, are designed to ensure his compliance with applicable ethics rules and protect the integrity of the Department's programs and operations. My experience has been that the Acting Secretary is very diligent about his ethics obligations and he has made ethics compliance and the creation of an ethical culture a top priority at the Department. If you have any other questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Scott A. de la Vega, Director, Departmental Ethics Office and Designated Agency Ethics Official. Enclosure. Mr. GARDNER. This letter is in response to a letter from Senators Warren and Blumenthal and states that the Ethics Office has found that Mr. Bernhardt's actions as Deputy Secretary and Acting Secretary ``have complied with all applicable ethics laws, rules, and other obligations, including the requirements of President Trump's executive order 13770, entitled `Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees.' '' This letter from the career head of the Department of Interior ethics professionals who served at the White House during the previous administration goes on to say: My experience has been that the Acting Secretary is very diligent about his ethics obligations and he has made ethics compliance and the creation of an ethical culture a top priority at the Department. That wasn't in the New York Times, either, but I think it should be. This is not about Mr. Bernhardt's ethics or his integrity or his qualifications; it is about the fact that he has been and will be effective at implementing an agenda that the other side doesn't agree with because they know he will be effective in protecting our great outdoors and our public lands. I am thankful there are qualified people out there like Mr. Bernhardt and his family who are still willing to wade through the muck and serve the people of the United States, knowing that they will be called a liar in front of their children at a U.S. Senate committee hearing despite letters from top officers in charge of our ethics laws at the Department of Interior saying otherwise. I am thankful for David, and I look forward to working with him and his team at the Department of the Interior. I hope my colleagues will see through the partisan rancor, see through the lens of blue or red, of party politics, and confirm a man who--if you go back to Colorado and talk to people like Russell George, you will learn that he has the greatest respect not only for our public lands but for the people of Colorado, and for that, I am grateful for him and my colleagues who will confirm him today. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado. Honoring State Patrol Corporal Daniel Howard Groves Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I rise today to honor an officer of the Colorado State Patrol who was killed in the line of duty on March 13. As other Members of this Chamber know, many parts of the country were hit hard by a bomb cyclone storm system last month. Again today, we are going through another spring storm. That storm caused flooding in much of the Midwest, as we have seen across the national news, and extremely hazardous road conditions in my State, which led to thousands of stranded drivers. State Patrol Corporal Daniel Howard Groves, like many first responders that day, was attempting to aid a driver in the Eastern Plains of Colorado on I-76 who had slid off the road, and he was struck by a passing vehicle. Corporal Groves was 52 years old. He leaves behind a large and loving family, including his parents, his partner Eddie, his four siblings, and many more. We know that his family will continue to honor his sacrifice and ensure that his legacy lives on. Corporal Groves joined the Colorado State Patrol in 2007 after leaving a career in the technology services industry in Chicago. His family and friends remember him as a man with a tremendous capacity to love and care for others. He was a man of humor who wasn't afraid to crack a joke just to make people smile. According to a fellow officer, he once arrived at training wearing pajamas instead of the required police sweats. At a memorial service honoring his life, a longtime friend spoke about the encouragement and advice that Dan was known for. He always encouraged others to follow their dreams, no matter how big. He often spoke of the importance of family and friendship and the need to make time to enjoy life with others. [[Page S2405]] His fellow officers remembered him as a man who was drawn to service because of his desire to help, someone who always knew the risks inherent in the job but never let that deter him from doing what needed to be done. One colleague who spoke at the memorial remembered Corporal Groves as someone who frequently asked, where do you need me to be? He always wanted to be in the spot where he could be most effective, no matter the danger involved. Even on the morning of March 13, as the weather was taking a turn for the worse, Corporal Groves knew there were drivers on the road who needed his help, and, as many law enforcement officers did that day, he bravely ventured out to offer assistance. This quality makes for a great law enforcement officer but is sadly the quality that we most often take for granted. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Dan and to all first responders who are willing to put their lives on the line to assist those in times of need and a debt of gratitude to their families as well. I know my colleagues in the Senate will join me in offering our thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of Corporal Groves and all those who defend that thin blue line. As I have done too many times in this Chamber, I remember the words of LTC Dave Grossman, who said: ``American law enforcement is the loyal and brave sheep dog, always standing watch for the wolf that lurks in the dark.'' I drive by the spot where Corporal Groves was killed at least two or three times a week, and he will always be in my prayers, along with his family, for his sacrifice. It is my hope that the thoughts and prayers that we offer to those who wear the blue uniform will bring them comfort as they carry out their solemn duties. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott of Florida). Without objection, it is so ordered. Recognition of the Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Attorney General William Barr Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, if anyone wonders whether Attorney General Barr is a straight shooter, this week, we got our answer. Yesterday, at the Senate Appropriations Committee, the country saw another disconcerting performance by the Attorney General. In the face of serious questions surrounding the release of the Mueller report, the Attorney General did exactly what President Trump wanted: He dodged questions, peddled a conspiracy theory, and, like the President, lobbed baseless accusations. It is clear that for Mr. Barr, the title he holds is far less important than the boss he serves. What he did not say is that Russia attacked our democracy, as all 17 Agencies of our intelligence community have confirmed. What he did not say is that the intelligence community concluded that the Russians infiltrated our democracy to help Donald Trump. What he also didn't say is why he continues to wait on releasing the Mueller report. It took him less than 48 hours to summarize over 300 pages but over 2 weeks, and counting, to release the report itself. Instead of giving straight answers, Mr. Barr seems to be nothing more than a spokesperson for the President's campaign. He seems more like the President's Press Secretary than the Attorney General. He is even using the President's own tactics: Admit nothing. Deny everything. Make counteraccusations. Many of us tried to give Mr. Barr a chance, but after this week's performance, it is clear as day he and the President are working off the same playbook and planning to withhold crucial facts from the American people. What is really important is this: When Attorney General Barr issues his report, his objectivity will be in total doubt. No one will believe, when he redacts large parts of the report, that it was done on the merits; people will believe he redacted parts of the report to help President Trump. How will the American people be able to trust Mr. Barr, and how will the American people be able to believe that his version of the report is the real version when he has been so, so partisan and was willing to peddle FOX News conspiracy theories before the Appropriations Committee yesterday? When Mr. Barr was first nominated as Attorney General, the question posed to him was, would he be part of the Trump legal team or an independent agent of the law? I think we have our answer, as we watch him echo President Trump's statements and enable President Trump's worst instincts. Whether it is defending the administration's dangerous healthcare lawsuit or perpetuating conspiracy theories, Mr. Barr is acting more like a member of the President's campaign than the independent Attorney General he is supposed to be. Mr. Barr is letting down thousands--tens of thousands--of hard- working people at the Justice Department. They are doing their job. When someone is given real information that Russia interfered with our elections, of course they are supposed to look into it. That is part of their job. For Mr. Barr to label this as spying, echoing some of the worst conspiracy theorists in the country, he loses all credibility, and that credibility is vital because he will be issuing a report with redactions. When Mr. Barr issues his report, in terms of what should be redacted and what shouldn't, his objectivity will be in total doubt because of his performance yesterday. Again, how will the American people be able to trust that the Attorney General has given them the most information he can rather than the least and that he has given them a full view of what happened rather than protecting the President? People are just not going to believe it. The bottom line is that yesterday's performance calls into complete question the objectivity and even the judgment of the Attorney General. He does not seem to be an independent actor pursuing the rule of law. Rather, he seems to be somebody simply ready to help the President no matter what the price. H.R. 268 Mr. President, on another matter, disaster relief, it is an absolute travesty that this Chamber is recessing without a compromise on much needed funding for disaster relief. From the start, Democrats have supported an ``all of the above'' approach to helping every part of America that is struggling from natural disasters. We need to help everyone hurt last year and everyone hurt this year--everyone hurt in Puerto Rico, everyone hurt in the Midwest, everyone hurt in Florida, and everyone hurt in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia. In the American tradition, everyone comes together when we have disasters, and we help everyone. Our Republican friends seem to have a different view. They want disaster relief that explicitly denies Puerto Rico the help it needs, even though they are American citizens like everybody else. They heard President Trump's temper tantrum at their lunch a few Tuesdays back, and they have obeyed. This is un-American. We should not be picking and choosing who gets disaster relief. When Americans suffer, we all step in. We all help. President Trump does not believe that, but where are our Senators who are standing up for this principle? The compassion of the American people is much greater than President Trump's small-minded contempt for the people of Puerto Rico. The Senate, particularly Senators from the disaster States who need that money, ought to have the courage to resist it instead of making up stories and pointing fingers of blame. Republicans have refused to present a serious solution that can pass the House and the Senate. We all know that if Puerto Rico is not treated equally, it will not be seen on the floor of the House. We all know that the Governor of Puerto Rico has said that the solution Republicans are supporting is not adequate for Puerto Rico. We all know that. It is a tragedy that the Republican leadership in this Chamber has refused to help American citizens before going into recess. They own the mess they [[Page S2406]] are creating across America, and with each passing day, the American people see it. Tax Reform Mr. President, tax day is coming up, and we have seen another travesty of the Republican Senate. When the Republicans pushed their tax scam, it was sold as a ``middle-class miracle.'' They promised it would prioritize middle- class families. President Trump and others promised Americans would get a $4,000 raise every year. That is what President Trump promised about his tax cuts. He said that his tax cuts for the very wealthy and the big corporations would benefit every American to the tune of $4,000 a year. Unsurprisingly, this Republican tax scam has now defaulted on its promise to lift up average American families. For too many Americans expecting a tax refund, they have gotten nothing or worse. After this tax season, the jig is up. In fairness, there is one part of America that has made a killing-- the very wealthy. Indeed, 83 percent of the benefits in the Republican tax bill will eventually go to the top 1 percent of earners, and the American people know it. A recent poll shows more than 60 percent of Americans believe the wealthy and corporations--big corporations--have been helped by the tax law. They are right. Unfortunately, corporations aren't using their windfalls as our Republican friends promised. They are not boosting worker pay, by and large, or increasing benefits or creating jobs. According to a recent survey, 84 percent of companies say they have not changed their plans because of the tax law. What are they doing with the money they got? They are spending billions in windfall on record corporate stock buybacks, not benefiting their workers, not benefiting their community but benefiting the CEOs of the corporations, because the shares generally go up, and benefiting the top 10 percent of America who own 85 percent of all the stocks. Unfortunately, this story doesn't end in making the rich richer. American workers are suffering while those same corporate executives and the very wealthy shareholders cash in. Take the case of CSX, a freight rail company spending billions of dollars on stock buybacks after benefiting from the tax law. Just last week, we heard CSX announce that they are laying off 100 workers in Kentucky, Leader McConnell's own backyard--not a $4,000 raise but a pink slip. You would think with all of these tax benefits that workers would benefit. It doesn't seem to be happening. That story that happened in Kentucky can be repeated throughout the country. It is hard to look at these examples with a straight face and say that the middle class factored at all into the Republican tax bill. It was a trick--no trickle down, just a trick. As Americans finish their filings this year, they will know exactly who to blame if they see their taxes go up. They will know who to blame if they don't get a refund or if they owe the IRS. The tax bill is already a stunningly unpopular piece of legislation. I don't recall a single Republican campaigning on it. It shows they weren't proud of it. After this tax season, the Republican tax bill will be even further crystalized in the minds of everyday Americans as a scam that left them out to dry while soaking the ultrawealthy with even more wealth. Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. President, on Mr. Bernhardt, yesterday, I sat down with David Bernhardt, President Trump's choice for Secretary of the Interior, and I pressed him on some things that we should all know before we vote on his confirmation. I asked Mr. Bernhardt: Do you agree that climate change is real, caused by humans, and that we must act? I asked Mr. Bernhardt if he will commit to not opening up the waters off our coasts to harmful drilling, even off the coasts of States opposed to such drilling, and what he will do about his well-documented web of conflicting interests. I got no answers to these questions. I remind all of my colleagues on the Atlantic coast that, again, I asked him to at least commit that he will not do drilling off the shores of States that didn't want drilling off their shores. He would not commit to that, and there is word that there is a plan in the Interior Department to allow that to happen. This is the same administration that promised to clean the swamp and rid Washington of corruption. Yet it is a twisted parody to think that President Trump wants an oil and gas lobbyist to lead the Department of the Interior. What a contradiction. What a betrayal. It doesn't stop there. Bernhardt reportedly participated in efforts to launch a White House climate denial panel, the sole purpose of which was to rebuke accepted science. We cannot allow the work of our Federal Agencies to fall into the hands of people like this. It is hard to imagine someone whose background is so at odds with the Department's mission as Bernhardt's. In good conscience, I cannot vote in favor of his confirmation. For the same reasons, I urge all of my fellow Senators, particularly those along the coasts, to vote against this nomination to protect their shoreline and their beaches. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina. Remembering Fritz Hollings Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on behalf of Senator Hollings' passing, along with my colleague Senator Scott from South Carolina. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. Mr. President, Senator Scott and I have come to the floor today to recognize a legend in South Carolina and this body, Senator Fritz Hollings, who passed away on April 6 in Isle of Palms, SC. He was 97. He loved Isle of Palms. That was his place to be. He was born in Charleston, SC, in 1922. He graduated from the Citadel in 1942. He attended the University of South Carolina School of Law. He served as an artillery officer in World War II, earned a Bronze Star, and finished with the rank of captain. He was in the State house of representatives from 1949 to 1954. He became our Governor in 1958 at age 36. He shepherded South Carolina through the turbulent times of the civil rights movement. He urged the legislature to follow the law after Brown v. Board of Education. He established the best technical college system in the country. We say that with great pride. It was Fritz Hollings who was the father of the South Carolina technical college system, which has resulted in thousands of jobs being created and educational opportunity for millions in our State. When he was a Senator, they called him the Senator from central casting. He looked the part, he acted the part, and he sounded the part. He was the junior Senator for 36 years, I think, in South Carolina, with Senator Thurmond being the senior Senator. When Senator Thurmond retired, I was honored to be able to take his place, and Fritz was my senior Senator for 2 years. I just want to thank him and recognize what he did for me to become established in the Senate. He was kind. He was gracious. We did not agree on policy, but he could not have been a better friend. I spent half of my time trying to interpret what he was saying on the floor. I caught about every third word. He has this Charleston accent that even I couldn't understand at times. Nobody enjoyed their job more than Senator Hollings. Nobody was ever better at it. When it came to South Carolina, Senator Hollings was able to move mountains. He was the chairman of the Commerce Committee and the Budget Committee. He was one of the great environmentalists of our time. The ACE Basin in South Carolina is a beautiful place along the coast where three major rivers come together. It was Senator Hollings who established that, now and forever to be preserved. He helped establish NOAA, which has done so much for our oceans. He was part of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget Act. He was always trying to keep our fiscal house in order. He was a champion of the military. Being a World War II veteran himself, he always looked out for those in uniform. Senator Thurmond and Hollings were giants of their time, and they [[Page S2407]] really made a difference for our State and for the country as a whole. When it comes to his distinguished career in the Senate, Fritz Hollings was at the top of anybody's list. He served for 38 years. He was a tireless advocate for the hungry--for hunger. He was trying to combat hunger and poverty before it was cool. He traveled all over this world to try to spread the good news about America. After Senate life, he established the Hollings Center for International Dialogue to create exchanges in dialogue between the United States and mostly Muslim populations. He was ahead of his time there. For us to win this war on terror, we have to side with people in the faith who reject radical Islam, which the overwhelming majority of people reject, and Fritz understood that. He was a great husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He was my friend. He had the eighth longest tour of duty in the U.S. Senate in the history of the body. Yesterday, with Senator Scott's help, we passed a resolution unanimously--every Senator signed on--honoring the service of Senator Hollings. There are so many friends of his in this body. The staff and former Senators all will tell you that Fritz was a force of nature. He had strong opinions. He would share them with you whether you asked him or not. He knew what he was talking about. He was prepared. He was a fighter for his causes. He was willing to die for his country. Now he has passed, and the legacy for the people of South Carolina will be enduring. Our beaches and our oceans and our mountains and our rivers are better off for his service. Our educational system stands out on the technical school side because of his vision. He shepherded us through very turbulent times during the civil rights movement, where other States were literally on fire. South Carolina had problems, but they paled in comparison to most because of Senator Hollings' leadership. He was a lawyer. He loved the law. He was my friend. Senator Scott is from Charleston, and both of us have a tough act to follow when it comes to being Senators in South Carolina. Senator Hollings' way was to fight for your causes, work across the aisle, know what you are talking about before you speak, and try to do it with good humor. What more can you say? From the time he was a young man in Charleston until he passed away on April 6, he was always fighting for his causes. He loved his State. He delivered for the people of South Carolina. When it comes to the Senate, he was a legend. His presence was felt up here. His legacy is enduring. He fought the good fight. He was a faithful servant, and now he will enjoy an eternal rest. To his family, I know you are grieving, but you have much to be proud of. To the people of South Carolina, it is not about being a Republican or a Democrat in terms of service; it is about how much you love your State. No Republican and no Democrat ever loved South Carolina more than Fritz Hollings, and no Senator has ever made more of a difference than Senator Hollings. So Senator Scott and I will do our best to keep up this good man's legacy. We will have different policy choices, and we will go down a different political path, but we will be ever mindful of the way we do our job. The way we do our job matters as much as what you do. Let it be said that when it came to doing his job, Fritz Hollings did it professionally, effectively, and with love and passion. I now yield to Senator Scott of South Carolina. Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. President, I thank Senator Graham for yielding to me. Without any question, I think Senator Graham did such a great job of distilling the life and some of the accomplishments of Senator Hollings. Without any question, I cannot imagine Mr. Graham spending 36 years or so as a junior Senator from the great State of South Carolina because of the long tenure of the senior Senator, Strom Thurmond, whose seat you have. I have the privilege of being in the seat of Senator Hollings, who, of course, is from Charleston, as I am from Charleston. I think of the commonalities we all share as South Carolinians, and certainly ones who are not--all of us from South Carolina understand how hard it is to understand those folks who speak in the old Charleston brogue, the language of Senator Hollings and folks like our cousin, Arthur Ravenel, who shares the same inflection in his voice. Senator Graham brought back some very fond memories with his thoughts. To the family, the Hollings family, we certainly extend our condolences. I had the chance to speak with Michael, his son, just the other day, and the family is doing well. The family is encouraged by the outpouring of love and support from so many folks from the Senate and throughout the country because Senator Hollings was not only a South Carolina Senator, he was America's Senator. He spent a lot of time doing a lot of things that made a significant difference. I do want to put a little meat on the bones. As Senator Graham has covered so much of what I would have said, I will not say it twice. I will, perhaps, drill into a few of the times of service Senator Hollings had. As we think through the 1960s and as we read through the 1960s, we read through a time of volatility, a time where our Nation is clashing with one another, where the races were so divided. In the Deep South, we perhaps led in that direction of conflict. We have a provocative history on race in South Carolina. Without any question, Senator Hollings did what so many others did not do, which is, he led for a peaceful integration of what is today one of America's great public universities, Clemson University. I say that as a South Carolina fan, without any question, but it is no doubt that Harvey Gantt, being the first African American in Clemson to graduate from Clemson, was a monumental shift in southern education, one we can all celebrate today. I went to church with Harvey Gantt's family for 20-plus years at Morris Street Baptist Church in Charleston, SC, and I will say that, perhaps as a part of the springboard of controversy and challenge and conflict, it led to a level of greatness in Harvey Gantt's life as he took arrows that most of us are unfamiliar with. Senator Hollings-- then-Governor Hollings--took arrows that some would be unfamiliar with in making the decision to ask for and to encourage and support a peaceful transition in a State at the time broiled in controversy. Harvey Gantt went on, of course, to be the first African-American mayor of the city of Charlotte, NC. In thinking about Senator Graham's comments as it relates to the technical college system in South Carolina, how Senator Hollings birthed that for our State, that may sound like a good accomplishment, but for a State that faced extinction from an economic standpoint, when industries were leaving our State, the technical college system became the springboard, once again, for the great city of South Carolina to see a rebirth of our economic systems. What we have today is a manufacturing haven whose foundation is the technical college system. When we think about companies like BMW, Boeing, Volvo, Mercedes, Bosch, Michelin, Bridgestone, all these companies became a part of the corporate family in South Carolina because we had a healthy, thriving technical college system born because of the leadership of Senator Hollings. Senator Hollings not only succeeded in public life, but he also succeeded in his private life. I will tell you that I cannot imagine the reunion between Senator Hollings and his wife, Peatsy, of over 40 years. I can't imagine the celebration that is happening in Heaven as those two are being reunited and spending time talking about what has occurred over their lifetimes and the things they had to see. There is an amazing Greek proverb that I want to end with, as it relates to Senator Hollings, that says that a society grows when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit under. Senator Graham and I, the youngsters, comparatively speaking to Senator Hollings and Senator Thurmond--we are sitting under the shade of that tree. Our Nation benefits from people who have the wisdom to look forward, beyond their lifetime, and create a country where we all benefit. Tax Reform Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I do want to spend a few minutes [[Page S2408]] talking about what is an obvious day in our near future--tax day. Americans from coast to coast are thrilled with the opportunity to finish their taxes. I say that with the poorest tongue in cheek. I will say that without any question I am excited about this tax season because of the success of our tax reform in December 2017. It is exciting to think about the benefits to so many families throughout this country because of the successful passage of the tax reform bill in December 2017. I stood on the floor and listened to other speakers talk about how perhaps the tax reform package has not delivered consistent with the promises made during the debate. I would like to put some meat on those bones as well. When you think about the average family who has kids, the doubling of the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and allowing for more refundability to happen because of the child tax credit being increased, more families today are healthier because of the doubling of the child tax credit, which is good news. When you think about the size of the refund, $2,873 is, in fact, consistent with the refunds of years gone by, which, once again, reinforces the fact that the tax reform bill has presented itself in a positive way and produced results consistent with what we suggested. Because if you get the same refund you had last time--about--but you have more money in your take-home pay every payday during 2018, you actually can measure the success of the tax reform by looking at how many dollars you had in your paycheck in 2018 versus 2017, even if your employer did not give you a raise. So the success of our package is without question. I would like to suggest that as you think about folks like me, and perhaps others in this body who were raised by single parents, a single mom in 2018 with two children did not have a Federal tax burden at all until her income hit over $54,000. That is important, and it is powerful for a specific reason. The average single mother makes around $40,000 a year, not $54,000. That means that for the average single mother in America, because of the success of our tax reform package, her Federal tax burden is down to zero. That is not just good news, that is great news. I know it personally because of a single mother who worked 16 hours a day trying to keep food on the table. Having doubled the child tax credit and having lowered her taxes by doubling the standard deduction from $9,300 to $18,000, what we see for the single mom is hope and a light at the end of the tunnel that is not a train. This is good news. Not only is it good news, but some have talked about our plan--we have defaulted on our mission to help the American people. I suggest that as opposed to defaulting on our mission, what we heard from others is that they are deflated because of the success of our mission. During the previous administration, GDP growth averaged somewhere around 2 percent. In 2018, we saw a 3.1-percent GDP growth. What does that mean for the average person? What it means for the average person is that for the first time in a long time, more than a decade, we saw their wages grow over 3 percent. So not only did their wages grow over 3 percent, but, more importantly, they had more jobs--actually, not just more jobs. This is really good news. They had more jobs. So many more jobs are open today than people looking for work. In other words, if you think about the number of folks looking for work, the number of openings exceeds that number. That is a transformation in this country in a way we have very seldom seen or experienced. There is even more good news to that. Our unemployment rate is down to nearly a 50-year low, 3.8 percent. So if we are asking ourselves what these corporations did with the money, we are seeing the evolution or the manifestation of what happened with these extra resources by seeing the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. Now, that is not just true for America as a whole, it is true for the subgroups within America who have been challenged and sometimes excluded from the workforce. The African-American unemployment rate is around 7 percent over the last 2 years. You have to compare that to, under the previous administration, an unemployment rate of around 12 percent. The Hispanic unemployment is near 5 percent. You have to compare that to a 50- percent increase under the previous administration. We have seen perhaps the greatest renaissance in our country, economically, than we have seen in 20 years, and much of it is due to tax reform being passed. Embedded in the tax reform package was my signature legislation that I am so excited about, the opportunity zones legislation, that is having a transformative impact and effect throughout the poorest, most distressed communities in all of our country. Somewhere around 8,000 opportunity zones have been designated by the Governors in collaboration with the mayors. Mr. President, as a former Governor, you understand better than most of us the process by which one went through in order to establish the zones and the potential of those zones in the most distressed communities in each of the States. There is good news. The good news is, in places like my home State of South Carolina, is a logistics company named DHL that drives those little yellow vans that ship some of your packages across the country. They are investing $100 million in a distribution and warehouse park, creating nearly 500 jobs in Dorchester County, and they have said the Federal opportunity zone designation was a factor DHL weighed in making this location decision. In Washington State, the Vancouver Downtown Redevelopment Authority president said: ``It's an absolute no-brainer, and a real gift from the federal government and will give us a real shot in the arm in these areas''--these challenged, distressed communities. In Vegas, the largest opportunity zone expo in the Nation is being held next month with some of the biggest names across the country trying to figure out how they can reinvest their resources in areas where they were unwilling to take a second look, because now the incentive is good enough, and we did so without more bureaucrats and without government money. These are private-sector dollars being deployed in some of the most distressed communities. In the Midwest, up to 3,000 jobs are on the way to East Chicago, and a local foundation is looking to invest $800 million in a solar farm in Flint, MI. There are so many other States with amazing projects that I would run out of time talking about those. I will close with two thoughts. One is from Mayor Bowser of DC. She had a March Madness event for opportunity zones, and she attracted 400- plus folks who are interested in investing and seeing the results of the investments in the local community here in DC. For folks on the left and on the right, African Americans, Hispanics, Whites, Asians, this is a policy that brings America together. Whether you live in the most affluent communities or the most distressed communities, Americans are looking at opportunity zones as a way to have a conversation with each other. If there is one thing that we all would agree upon, it is that America needs to talk a little more with each other in a civil way about fairness and opportunity. One of the reasons why I started my national opportunity tour is to highlight some of the successes--from Miami, with my good friend Marco Rubio, to Boston, New Hampshire, and West Virginia, with Senator Capito, to Iowa, with Senator Ernst, and Colorado, Arizona, and so many other places. I look forward to continuing the conversation and distilling the benefits of the opportunity zones over the next few months. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am honored to be cochairing the Entrepreneurship Caucus with the Senator from South Carolina. He is right that there are some great examples of people who want to get businesses started and who want to pursue their dreams, and we need to highlight those because we have a lot of people who right now have some great new ideas. If we are going to continue to be a country that is an incubator for those ideas, then, we have to promote those ideas and allow those people to follow their dreams. [[Page S2409]] Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. President, I am here today to join many of my colleagues in discussing the nomination of David Bernhardt to be Secretary of the Department of the Interior. I have serious concerns about many of the actions that Mr. Bernhardt has taken while serving as both Deputy Secretary of the Department, since 2017, and as Acting Secretary, since the resignation of Secretary Zinke in January. Some of the most concerning actions include defending the administration's budget request, which zeroed out funding for the newly reauthorized Land and Water Conservation Fund; rolling back protections for public lands, including proposals to reduce the size of some of our national monuments; limiting opportunities for public input into Agency rulemakings; and weakening enforcement of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. These actions have threatened the responsible and sustainable management of our public lands, imperiled laws designed to protect and conserve wildlife, and stacked the deck in favor of fossil fuel industries. One particular area that I would like to focus on today is how Mr. Bernhardt has played a role in the Department of the Interior's decisions to rescind Obama-era climate and conservation policies that directed Agency employees to minimize the environmental impact of activities on Federal land. In a secretarial order published just before Christmas in 2017, which was signed by Mr. Bernhardt, the Department limited how its employees at sub-Agencies, like the Bureau of Land Management, can factor climate and environmental effects into their decision making. What does this mean, exactly? Well, it means that manuals, handbooks, and other lists of best practices that were compiled by Agency employees over the years--career Agency employees-- that were meant to minimize activities that would harm species or accelerate climate change were thrown out or their instructions were rendered obsolete. Mr. Bernhardt has not only downplayed climate science and prevented efforts to mitigate it within the Department of the Interior, but he has also advanced policy and rulemakings that will accelerate its effect. We all know what we are up against here with climate change. We have seen the weather events throughout the country--the heating of our ocean waters; the increase in hurricanes; the predictions of how many metropolitan areas are going to be experiencing significant flooding in just the next few decades; the wildfires that we have seen in Arizona, Colorado, and California; and the video of the dad in Northern California driving his daughter through lapping wildfires, leaving their house burning behind them as they drove and he sang to her to calm her down. Those are the big effects and the little effects, but Americans know this is happening. So the question is not, Is it happening? We know it is because every one of these things was predicted by our scientists and was predicted by our military. The question is, What do we do about it? That is why I am so opposed to the administration's decision to get out of the international climate change agreement, and I am opposed to its decision to get us out of the Clean Power rules that we had just started to put forward and to implement, and why I am opposed to the decision it made to reverse the gas mileage standards. Unfortunately, Mr. Bernhardt has not only downplayed climate change, but he has also helped, as I said, to advance policy that accelerates it. For example, in September 2018, the Bureau of Land Management announced a draft rule that would relax the Obama-era methane rules that regulated flared, leaked, and vented natural gas from oil and gas operations on Federal and Tribal lands. Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas that according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has an impact that is 34 times greater over a 100-year period than carbon dioxide. It is also important to remember that these proposed rescissions to methane rules are in direct opposition and run counter to the Senate's vote in 2017 to reject an effort at full repeal under the Congressional Review Act. Instead of going backward, we should be taking real action to combat climate change. We need a comprehensive approach to greenhouse gas emissions, and we need energy efficient technologies and homegrown energy resources. I also believe, as I noted, that we should reinstate the Clean Power rules and the gas mileage standards. Under Mr. Bernhardt's leadership, the Department of the Interior has been taking us in the wrong direction on climate, conservation, and public lands. I will oppose his nomination. Nomination of David Steven Morales Mr. President, before I conclude, I wish to make brief remarks on the nomination of David Morales to be a Federal judge for the Southern District of Texas, who was just confirmed yesterday evening. Yesterday the Senate began its consideration on this nomination at 4 p.m. and voted on the confirmation around 6 p.m. Under the new rules, we had just about 2 hours of time on the Senate floor to debate the nomination for a lifetime appointment to the Federal judiciary. I would have liked to have made these comments before that time. But with these severe limits, it is very difficult for Senators, if they have other obligations within the building or constituent visits or hearings going on, to be able to make it within the 2-hour period that we are now allowed, which is actually a 1-hour period. There was much more to be concerned about with respect to this nominee, which is why I am making these comments now. To name one example, during his time in the Texas Attorney General's Office, he has participated in cases that have undermined American voting rights. In 2007 he submitted an amicus brief before the Supreme Court in support of an Indiana voter ID law. The brief argued that requiring voters to have photo IDs was only ``a negligible burden on the right to vote.'' They should ask that of some of our seniors in Minnesota who have voted for decades and decades and decades and are well-known by election officials and, in our State, are able to show up at the voting booth and be able to vote or maybe they don't have a driver's license because they no longer drive. These are examples that go on across the United States. In many States that have these restrictions, these people are literally turned away from voting. It is one of the reasons that the voters of my State turned away a proposal that was on our ballot to have these restrictive photo-ID requirements. It sounds good, but then when you really look under the hood, you find that it limits voting. It was especially difficult for people in our rural areas and our seniors to accept this change, and they didn't. We also know that voter ID laws have a disproportionate impact on voters who are low income, racial and ethnic minorities, elderly, and people with disabilities. The nominee also defended Texas's ban on same-sex marriage. In 2010 he signed on to a brief arguing that Texas had a right to ban same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court rejected similar arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, which found that the Constitution guarantees the right to marry for same-sex couples. These issues are about how our democracy functions and about treating people equally under the law and with respect. It is the Senate's constitutional responsibility to give its advice and consent on lifetime nominees to the Federal bench. These nominations are too important to turn the Senate into a mere rubberstamp. The Senate must maintain its role as a meaningful check and balance in our constitutional system, and I join my colleagues in expressing my deep concern about the pace at which we are confirming these nominees. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. S. 1116 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Thank you, Mr. President. Today I rise to speak about the legislation I introduced to the Senate this week, S. 1116, the BROWSER ACT. [[Page S2410]] Broadband or high-speed internet has absolutely revolutionized the way we communicate, the way we conduct commerce, and actually the way we participate in government. Broadband is one of the greatest innovations in history. It allows near-instantaneous exchange of information and brings efficiencies to the daily life of millions of Americans as they move more of their transactional life online. Thanks to broadband, entrepreneurs have been able to bring thousands of new applications to consumers. These edge services are now an essential part of our lives. We find ourselves every day saying: I can't imagine what we did before we had this or before we had that. These apps give consumers access to entertainment, news, information, helping us drive around town, and access to emergency services. As consumers use these applications, they generate massive amounts of data about themselves, and that is the problem. Many companies collect this data and use it for a range of purposes without the user's knowledge. They are collecting all of this--every bill you pay, every website you visit, these platforms are following you. After all this information is shared, the question is, Who owns the virtual you? Who owns you and your presence online? Our laws have not kept pace with technological innovation. Now we see some States and we even have some cities that are adding more complexity to the problem by enacting their own privacy rules and standards, despite the fact that digital commerce is not restricted to one area. Digital commerce is interstate and global in nature. It is time we have a consistent national law regarding online privacy. We need one set of rules and one regulator for the entire internet ecosystem. It just makes sense. That is why I have introduced the legislation I previously proposed as a Member of the House of Representatives. As I said, it is called the BROWSER Act. Americans want to be certain their privacy is protected in the physical and the virtual space. Broadband users--who are each and every one of us--should have the right to say who can or cannot access their private data. Think about it. At this point, how and when you pay your bills, the credit cards you use, the sites you visit, the merchandise you shop for, friends you connect with, there is somebody tracking that activity with every move of the mouse. They are on it. Consumers should have the right to clear and conspicuous notice of a service providers' privacy policies and the ability to either opt in or opt out, depending on the sensitive nature of that data. The BROWSER Act requires digital services to provide users with clear and conspicuous notice of their privacy rights. It also requires digital services to provide users the ability to opt in to the collection of sensitive information while also giving users the ability to opt out of the collection of nonsensitive information. By allowing for a clear and conspicuous notification process, consumers will be able to make a more educated choice about the nature of the relationship they want to have with online vendors and with tech companies. Furthermore, the BROWSER Act will prohibit digital services from denying their service to users who refuse to waive their personal privacy rights. The BROWSER Act also empowers the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, to enforce these rules using its unfair or deceptive acts or practices authorities. Now the Federal Trade Commission has been our privacy regulator in both the physical and the online space. Just this week, Senator Klobuchar and I sent a letter to the FTC urging stronger action for bad actors in the tech space. Companies like Facebook and Google have transformed society in revolutionary ways and need to recognize that with that great power comes great responsibility. This is the 21st century; it is not the Wild West. These tech companies need to be respectful of your privacy rights. My hope is that through this bipartisan effort, we will shed light on the need to protect competition and online privacy to keep up with the fast-paced changes in technology. The FTC has a responsibility to hold tech companies accountable for securing their platforms. We need them to step up and be the cop on the beat in the virtual space. Before I yield the floor, I want to make one last point. The BROWSER Act treats everyone in broadband and edge companies exactly the same-- one regulator, one set of rules. This is common sense. Unfortunately, yesterday, Democrats in the House passed a bill to regulate broadband service providers, but they didn't do anything to Big Tech. They didn't do anything about privacy with Google, with Facebook, with Yahoo--these people who collect your data and sell it to the highest bidder; then that person markets back to you. When I chaired the Communications and Technology Subcommittee in the House, I repeatedly offered to work with the other side of the aisle to preserve a free and open internet. I am always happy to work together to find a legislative solution and put this so-called net neutrality issue to rest once and for all. Rather than work together on this, the House pushed through a hyperpartisan bill to reinstate a controversial, heavyhanded regulation of communication companies, but--heaven forbid-- they do not want to touch Big Tech, their big buddies. I am so grateful Leader McConnell has said that this bill coming from the House is dead on arrival in the Senate. I look forward to continuing to work on this issue. But here is what my friends across the aisle and my friends over in the House need to realize: The internet is not broken. The internet is not broken. Many of you probably have an electronic device close at hand. It is working just fine. The internet does not need the intervention of Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats. It is fine. It is going to be just fine by itself. In fact, as an alternative, we could just strike out the text of the House-passed bill and insert the BROWSER Act in its place--one set of rules for the entire internet ecosystem, one set of rules enforced by one Federal regulator. That is the BROWSER Act. It is about fairness. It is about encouraging innovation. It is about making certain we keep a free and open internet. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The majority leader. Order of Business Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the postcloture time on the Bernhardt nomination expire at 1:45 p.m. today. I further ask that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Vehicle Innovation Act Mr. PETERS. Madam President, transportation is responsible for roughly two-thirds of our national consumption of petroleum and one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. But imagine a future where we could produce low-cost, secure clean energy technologies to move people and goods easily across our Nation. Imagine if we could then sell our advanced American technology and products to the rest of the world. Well, that is a future, by working together, we can indeed achieve. There is no question that the cars and trucks of the future can be equipped with technology to make them safer and more fuel efficient while also saving consumers money. Rapidly emerging technology has the potential not only to reduce air emissions, but their development could also create jobs in Michigan and across the Nation, and these are jobs that cannot be outsourced. We must ensure that the United States leads the way in developing these innovations. That is why I reintroduced the bipartisan Vehicle Innovation Act with my colleagues Senator Alexander and Senator Stabenow. The Vehicle Innovation Act promotes research and development investments in clean vehicle and advanced safety technologies. The bill also modernizes [[Page S2411]] the Vehicle Technologies Office within the Department of Energy, which exists to help create and sustain American leadership in the transition to a global clean energy economy. This office's leadership has already led to improvements in engine efficiency through vehicle weight reductions and reduced fuel production costs, and the Vehicle Innovation Act will help ensure that these continued innovations move forward. I am proud to again partner on this bill with Senator Alexander and fellow Michigander, Senator Debbie Stabenow. In the last Congress, we were able to pass the Vehicle Innovation Act through the Senate. Now, with fellow Michigan delegation Members, Congresswomen Debbie Dingell and Haley Stevens, leading this bill in the House, there is no reason this legislation should not be enacted into law. The bill is supported by labor, by industry, and by conservation groups, including the United Auto Workers, the Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association, the Auto Alliance, the BlueGreen Alliance, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. America should lead the world in clean energy advancements, and I urge my colleagues to support the Vehicle Innovation Act. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. Border Security Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, while many folks in Washington, DC, remain ambivalent about what is happening along the southern border, I am here to report that we are reaching a breaking point. Every month, Customs and Border Protection releases the total number of people who attempt to cross the southern border. The total includes those who cross illegally between the ports of entry, as well as those deemed inadmissible at a port of entry. Just to give you an idea of the size and scope of the numbers we have been dealing with in the past, since June 2014--the month that President Obama referred to this as a ``humanitarian crisis''--more than 66,000 individuals were encountered along the border. At that time, we thought 66,000 was a huge number, but it pales in comparison to what we are seeing now. Last month, more than 103,000 people attempted to illegally cross the border. That is 103,000 up from 76,000 the previous month. A few weeks ago, I know we got into a debate about what did and did not constitute an emergency or a crisis at the border. I don't care whether you call it a crisis or an emergency, but the entire system is breaking, and it is unsustainable. This is the highest number of people who has attempted to enter the country that we have seen since 2007. The mind-boggling figure represents the strain that is being felt by the personnel--those being U.S. Government employees--whether they be Border Patrol or Customs or whoever is trying to manage the influx of the migrants. The men and women of the CBP lack both the manpower and the facilities to appropriately respond. The already understaffed Agency is reassigning personnel to try to make do, but 40 percent of the Border Patrol's manpower is spent processing migrants and providing care and transportation, and many of the agents are taken off their patrol lines to do this work, which leaves areas of the border vulnerable to exploitation by drug cartels and others. The detention centers at which these migrants are housed and processed are relatively small facilities that are not designed for these kinds of huge numbers. They were originally built to house single adults for a short period of time, but the skyrocketing number of unaccompanied children and family units is now putting a serious strain on those resources. Last month alone, there were more than 53,000 families and nearly 9,000 unaccompanied children who were apprehended at the border--53,000 families and 9,000 unaccompanied children. Customs and Border Protection simply lacks the facilities to hold these children, and it lacks the personnel to provide appropriate care. Do we really want the Border Patrol handing out juice boxes and diapers as opposed to interdicting dangerous drugs and other contraband that come into the United States? I don't think so. We know they are desperately asking for additional detention space and staff to be able to manage the migrants who are in custody. Why is it so important they be detained? It is because, if we engage in the practice that has come to be known as catch and release, then it is doubtful we will ever see these migrants again, even though they will be notified of their time to appear in front of immigration judges months--maybe even years--into the future. They will simply melt into the landscape. If they were to have bona fide reasons to claim asylum but were to fail to appear for their hearings in front of immigration judges, they will have waived those rights and be deported if they are ultimately located in the United States. We know customs inspectors have been reassigned from their duties at ports of entry to do things like process migrants and provide transportation. With fewer customs agents on the job, you are now seeing lengthy delays at the ports and checkpoints along the entire border. In what is just right across from El Paso, TX, truckers have been reported as sleeping in their vehicles for hours and sometimes days so they will not lose their spots in line. I have heard from some of the car manufacturers that require there be a flow of their supply chains into Mexico and vice versa, so they are literally hiring aircraft to fly from Juarez to El Paso because that 11-minute flight is faster than a trucker waiting 24 hours in line. Also, when many of our car manufacturers that depend on just-in-time inventory can't get their inventory just in time but have to wait 24 hours, it disrupts their manufacturing lines and endangers their businesses. Of course, it is easy to see how this could have a ripple effect on the entire border and the American economy. This slowdown isn't just affecting businesses along the border; it has businesses across the country worried. Mexican products feed the supply chain for many manufacturers in the United States, and these slowdowns affect production. While folks who live far away from the border may have just chosen to look the other way until now, they don't have a choice anymore. The system is breaking. The ripples will soon be felt across the country unless Members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, work together and are serious about enacting a solution. We know what we need to do, but politics is preventing us from getting it done. It is time to provide our frontline officers and agents with the personnel, the resources, and the legal authorities they need in order to do the jobs we have asked them to do. Yet, without support from Congress, we are sending them into a losing battle, and we are setting our economy up for a disaster. GEAR UP for Success Act Madam President, on another matter, when the Senate is in recess next week, I, like most of our colleagues here, will be running to my State to talk to my constituents and to hopefully listen to what they have to say. As I travel from El Paso to Laredo, some of the things I will be talking about will include the GEAR UP for Success Act with students, teachers, and school administrators. GEAR UP seeks to increase college and career readiness for underrepresented and low-income students. It currently serves about 600,000 students nationwide, and Texans have benefited from the $885 million in GEAR UP grants over the last 20 years. I am glad I have had a chance to visit with some of my constituents in San Antonio and Harlingen about this bill and the incredible impact that GEAR UP grants have had on their students. I guess I didn't fully appreciate the fact that students really have to begin deciding in the seventh grade what their courses of study will be because, if they don't take the required courses, or the prerequisite courses, or the other courses they are going to need in order to graduate or to get into college, they may miss the boat entirely. Many of these students come from families whose parents have never attended college or who may be unaware of the requirement to plan in order for their children to make the right course selections early on as opposed to their waiting until their junior or senior year to begin to think about where to apply to college. This legislation would allow school districts to better cater to their students' specific needs rather than to use [[Page S2412]] a one-size-fits-all program, and it would reduce the local cost share required by half. I am eager to hear from my constituents in El Paso and Laredo and to talk about what else we can do in Washington to promote college and career readiness. In a tight labor market with a booming economy, one of the things we hear about the most back home is the fact that employers can't find adequately trained workers for the jobs that are available and return a good wage. So it is important that we continue to do everything we can not only to promote education generally but also to promote career readiness for many of the well-paying jobs that are going wanting for the lack of qualified workers. Jenna Quinn Law Madam President, I will also take some time to visit the Center for Child Protection in Austin to discuss the Jenna Quinn Law. This would authorize grants for training students, teachers, and caregivers on identifying and reporting child sexual abuse. The bill is named for a courageous Texan and is modeled after successful reforms in my State. It is another great example of how we are working to bring the successful Texas model to the national level. B-21 Strategic Bomber Madam President, finally, I will visit Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, TX, with my friend and colleague, Congressman Jodey Arrington, for a briefing on its latest operations and the recent news from the Air Force that Dyess will be receiving the B-21--the next generation of strategic bombers. Dyess is the most dynamic bomber base in the country, and I am glad the Air Force has chosen the future home for the B-21 squadrons as well as weapons instruction courses and test squadrons. It just makes a lot of sense. I look forward to spending time at home with my constituents. These conversations drive my work in the Senate, and I am eager to get more feedback on how these bills could make positive changes in their lives and in the lives of all of my constituents in the State. Remembering Lieutenant Colonel Richard Cole Madam President, on one final matter, this week, Texas lost a true hero. Lt. Col. Richard Cole passed away on Tuesday at the ripe old age of 103 in my hometown of San Antonio. For Texans and for so many Americans, Lieutenant Colonel Cole--or ``Dick'' as his friends and brothers in arms called him--symbolized one of the most remarkable groups from the greatest generation in World War II--the Doolittle Raiders. The group is named for then-Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle, who, in April of 1942, fearlessly led 16 B-25 bombers and 80 crew members on a strike that targeted factories and military installations in and around Tokyo. This was actually Dick's first mission, and he was Jimmy Doolittle's copilot. After the attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, this mission was not just of tactical importance--it was a major morale boost for our Nation. Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein recently said: Those 80 intrepid airmen changed the course of history. They executed a one-way mission without hesitation and against enormous odds. The mission was, as you might imagine, perilous. Doolittle's Raiders took off from the USS Hornet with barely enough runway to get airborne. In fact, Doolittle and Cole's aircraft only had 467 feet with which to take off in an aircraft that was not designed to launch from an aircraft carrier. The airplanes inadvertently took off 170 miles further from Japan than they had planned, so they had insufficient fuel to make it to their landing fields in China. As a result, Dick--then 26 and having had limited experience in jumping out of an aircraft--had to leap out of his B-25 into unknown territory. He later reported that he gave himself a black eye when he pulled the ripcord and finally landed in the branches of a tree, where he spent the night, dangling. He later said: They don't give a Purple Heart for self-inflicted injuries. I gave myself a black eye. Yet his heroism was certainly rewarded. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his role in the bombing as well as the Bronze Star and the Air Medal. Then, in 2015, Dick and his fellow Raiders received the Congressional Gold Medal. These men, as you might imagine, shared an incredible bond, and their lasting camaraderie was evident through one special tradition they shared. At each reunion, the crew would share a cognac in silver goblets. Each goblet was engraved with a Raider's name both right-side up and right-side down. After toasting to the men who had died since their last reunion, they would flip over the goblets of those who had passed away. At their final reunion in 2013, only four Raiders were left. After determining that this would be the final reunion due to their ages and travel limitations, Dick delivered the last toast. Now his silver goblet will be turned over just as it was for the 79 brothers who left this Earth before him. We remember the final Doolittle Raider today for his incredible courage and sacrifice and a life well lived. America has lost another hero, but our country will never forget him. I send my condolences to Dick's family and friends and especially to Rich, his son, and to Cindy, his daughter. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I rise today to address the Senate on the nomination of David Bernhardt to head the Department of the Interior. I ask unanimous consent that I may use this chart in order to further my goal of making it clear why he should not be nominated and confirmed as Secretary of the Interior. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, under Secretary Bernhardt, the Department of the Interior will come to stand for the Department of Oil Interests, DOI. This wheel of Bernhardt's giveaways makes it very clear what the objective of his tenure as the Secretary of Interior will, in fact, entail. Bernhardt's nomination is just a continuation of the Trump administration's cartel Cabinet. Only a month ago, a former coal lobbyist was confirmed to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Let me say that again. Just last month, a coal lobbyist was nominated and confirmed to be the head of the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States--unbelievable. But now Republicans want to install a former oil lobbyist to head the Department of the Interior because, in Trump's administration, it is nothing but foxes guarding the henhouse. We need more answers about Mr. Bernhardt's lobbying activities. We need answers on whether Mr. Bernhardt used his position at the Department of the Interior to help former clients. The American people need to see the documents associated with Bernhardt's lobbying activities. Most importantly, we should not confirm a former oil lobbyist to lead the very Agency that is tasked with protecting our public lands from despoliation. Let me now point to the wheel of giveaways for more oil--more oil. And that is the goal of his appointment. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of our national treasures that is under threat from Big Oil and the Trump administration. This is the wildest place left in America, and it should not be turned into a drilling playground. Yet Republicans here in the Senate voted in 2017 to hand this special place--the Arctic Refuge--over to Big Oil. Now this administration is trying to hit the gas on drilling there, in one of the Earth's most pristine wilderness areas. Last year, Mr. Bernhardt said that he would ``expedite'' oil development in the wildlife refuge, and he has worked inside the Department of the Interior to limit environmental review of drilling activities. So let's just imagine gushing oil poisoning the habitat of magnificent creatures like polar bears and caribou, snowy owls and the Arctic fox; rigs and pumps threatening the ancestral homeland of the Gwich'in and Inupiat peoples, which they call ``the sacred place where life begins.'' [[Page S2413]] I have spent my career protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for future generations, and today I will not support the nomination of David Bernhardt to undermine the protections we have worked so hard to put in place. We must stand up for the generations yet to come that cannot yet speak to protect our public lands and our oceans. At the same time, the Trump administration is trying to roll back the fuel economy standards for the vehicles we drive. In other words, since we put 70 percent of all the oil we consume in our country on a yearly basis into the gasoline tanks of the vehicles we drive in our country, if you increase the fuel economy of every one of those vehicles, it will reduce the amount of oil you need to drill for. What do the Republicans want to do? What do the oil companies want? What do the Koch brothers want? What does ExxonMobil want? Well, it is very simple. By not increasing the fuel economy standards of the vehicles we drive, we need more oil because cars will consume more in the course of a year. They then say: Ah, let's turn to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--a sacred place--and find more oil, because the vehicles we drive won't be that efficient. What kind of sacrifice are we going to make in our country because the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil want to have more oil drilled for? We are going to have the Trump administration say: The only way we can justify it is if the cars, the light trucks, the SUVs that people drive are not that efficient; therefore, we need all the oil we can get, even though we are a technical giant and we know we can make these vehicles so much more efficient, so we never have to drill there. That is a sin against the environment and a sin against our country and future generations that should be able to enjoy this pristine area, the wildlife refuge. Let's move on to another part of the wheel of giveaways--even more oil that will be another giveaway during the Bernhardt time at the Department of the Interior. On January 4, 2018, the Department of the Interior announced a plan to revise the offshore drilling plan to eliminate protections for the east and west coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic Ocean. The plan proposed to open up more than 90 percent of the U.S. coastlines to oil and gas leasing. Since then, the bipartisan opposition has been deafening. All Governors along the east and west coasts have opposed or expressed concerns about expanded oil and gas exploration off their coasts. More than 340 municipalities and over 2,100 elected local, State, and Federal officials have formally opposed offshore oil and gas drilling and seismic airgun blasting in our ocean. But David Bernhardt is not listening to those concerns. Instead, he is listening to his former fossil fuel clients. He is moving ahead with this terrible offshore drilling plan that would threaten State after State with the threat of a spill in the ocean off of those States. We should not confirm Bernhardt to lead the Department of the Interior. Handing the keys to the beaches of our country, the coastlines of our country, and our fishing and tourism industries in our country over to Big Oil is not what our citizens want. That is the opposite of what we need to do to protect our environment, but that is what David Bernhardt and his fossil fuel friends want. There is no reason that we have to drill off of the coastlines of our country right where people who are swimming will be watching these oil rigs that are going to be drilling down into those ocean areas off of our beaches to find oil that we don't need. If we increase the fuel economy standards of the vehicles we drive, we will be able to back out the need for all of that additional oil. That is the sin against the environment that is being committed. That is the agenda of David Bernhardt's at the Department of the Interior. Instead of being the United States of America--a technological giant that invents its way to the new automotive technologies that reduce the amount of oil we need and reduces the amount of greenhouse gasses that go up into the atmosphere--with David Bernhardt as the Secretary of the Interior, partnered with the new coal lobbyist who is running the EPA, we are going to wind up with more greenhouse gasses going up into the air, a reduction in the efficiency of the vehicles we drive, and putting more profits into the pockets of the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil and the auto industry, which also wants to reduce the fuel economy standards of the vehicles we drive. This is a sin against our environment but also our identity as the technological giant of the planet. We can do this. We can make our cars more efficient. We can have plug-in hybrids. We can have all-electric vehicles. We can create a revolution that avoids the necessity of drilling off of our beaches and drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. We can do this, but that is not what Donald Trump wants. He wants fossil fuel industry representatives at the Department of the Interior and EPA running these Agencies. David Bernhardt's ties to Big Oil--the very industry he is tasked with regulating--are as deep as an oil well. Those ties should be disqualifying for anyone nominated to head the Department of the Interior. We need to stop the pollution of our democracy by Big Oil interests. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the nomination of David Bernhardt. I ask my colleagues to consider what we can do to avoid the necessity of despoiling these sacred environmental locations in our country for the oil industry, for the Koch brothers. This is a big moment, this vote we are about to cast. This is one more step by Donald Trump that will result in far more greenhouse gases going up into the atmosphere, far more danger being presented to places that should be put off limits to the oil industry because of the risk of environmental danger that would result from that permission to drill. That is why we should all pause and really consider whether we want to go deeper and deeper into an era that is completely avoidable if we unleash the technological might of our country. When President Kennedy went to Rice University in 1961, what he said was that we were going to have a mission to the Moon and that mission would require us to invent new metals, new alloys, new propulsion systems that did not exist, and that within 10 years, we would have to then bring that mission back safely from the Moon through heat half the intensity of the Sun and do so successfully. Auto mechanics is not rocket science. We already know how to improve the fuel economy standards of the vehicles we drive. We don't need nuclear physics and we don't need aeronautical engineers to help us do this. President Kennedy challenged our country, and we responded. President Trump is like J.F.K. in reverse. He is saying that we can't do it; that, instead, what we have to do is, here on Earth, be the leaders in spoiling our most sacred environmental locations. That is why today is such a monumental opportunity for the Senate to say no on a bipartisan basis to David Bernhardt, who is someone who does not deserve the post of Secretary of the Interior. I once again urge a ``no'' vote from all of my colleagues. I yield the floor. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nomination of David Bernhardt Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am pleased to be here today to speak in strong support of David Bernhardt's nomination to be Secretary of the Interior, and I thank all of my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. We worked pretty hard together to report Mr. Bernhardt's nomination last week. We moved it out with good bipartisan support. I also thank the majority leader for filing cloture this week so that we can confirm him before we depart for this 2-week work period. I have several reasons--I have a whole host of different reasons to outline as to why I support Mr. Bernhardt's nomination. I outlined them [[Page S2414]] before the committee, but I would like to take a couple of minutes here this afternoon to reiterate them on the Senate floor. First, really, is his background. He understands and is in touch with our public lands. Mr. Bernhardt is from the West where, of course, the vast majority of our public lands are located. He grew up in Rifle, which is a small town in Western Colorado. He spent a lot of his summers in Wyoming. He, to this day, remains an avid sportsman and outdoorsman. He likes hunting and fishing. He is a guy who appreciates the outdoors. He is really almost unparalleled in terms of the experience that he brings to the job. He has worked at the Department of the Interior now for about 10 years, including two Senate-confirmed posts. Back in 2006, we confirmed him as Solicitor by voice vote, and then in 2017, we confirmed him to be the Deputy Secretary. Again, that vote was a good bipartisan vote. He has now served as Acting Secretary since January of 2019, so we have a situation where, simply put, he has more experience at the Department than any other previous nominee for Secretary, except one. That is a pretty good credential there. Of equal importance, Mr. Bernhardt has the right perspective to be the Secretary of the Interior. He understands how Federal land management decisions affect our local communities. He has seen how Federal policies impact people's access to and use of public land, and he also recognizes the need to balance conservation and opportunities for economic development. I think David Bernhardt has really proved his ability to lead the Department. He is well qualified. He is highly competent. He has built strong working relationships with those who are affected by the Department's decisions. I really think there is no question that he is ready for the job. He can handle everything it entails. I have been asked by several of the reporters who are out there: What do you think David Bernhardt really brings to the table? What I have shared with them is that as I have gotten to know David Bernhardt in his various capacities at Interior, he is a guy who understands and enjoys the policy of these issues. He likes to get down into the fine details. He knows the background. He is not just being given something by staff to read. He is the one who is really engaged in understanding at a level of detail that is greatly appreciated. When I think about the importance of this position of Secretary of the Interior, I come at it from the perspective of an Alaskan coming from a State that has more Federal acres than any other State. The Department of the Interior controls most of those. We often refer to the Department, and the Secretary specifically, as our landlord. That is not necessarily a title we like. We like to consider ourselves a partner, but I think we truly recognize we need leadership to understand and appreciate the impact their decisions within the Department of the Interior can have on us. I know David Bernhardt understands that. He has been a good partner for Alaskans, but he has also been a good partner for individuals, groups, and States all across the country, and that is why his nomination is supported by a wide range of stakeholder groups from the Alaska Federation of Natives to Ducks Unlimited, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. I think it is also important to note that Mr. Bernhardt moved through our committee process in pretty good order. He answered all of our questions. Again, he demonstrated the depth of his understanding of the issues and his expertise. He really exceeded expectations, which led to a very strong bipartisan vote of 14 to 6 at the business meeting last week. Now the full Senate has the opportunity to confirm Mr. Bernhardt. Some will continue to make allegations over ethics, but the fact is, as we have reviewed those charges, we have found nothing that should hold him back. I know this has been a subject of discussion on the Senate floor, so I want to lay it out very clearly. There are some news stories that are being printed and have been printed that are filled with old information that has already been reviewed by our committee staff. New stories, old facts--they don't contain anything new or anything disqualifying. There is nothing amiss here, and there is no valid reason to delay this process. The Office of Government Ethics has certified that Mr. Bernhardt is in good standing; so has Interior's Designated Agency Ethics Official. My committee staff has contacted Interior's Inspector General. It has been confirmed that there are no open investigations into Mr. Bernhardt. I would tell folks that what needs to happen here is that we need to move forward. We need to reject the last-minute rhetoric that is designed to delay. We need to confirm a well-qualified candidate to be our next Secretary of the Interior. We have a lot to do. Interior has a lot to do to make sure that we are protecting our lands, increasing our energy security, as well as fulfilling all of the missions of the Department, and the sooner we are able to confirm a Secretary to focus on them, the better. Mr. Bernhardt is very well qualified to be the Secretary of the Interior. He has the right background, the right experience, and the right perspective for the job. He is ready to lead on a permanent basis, and I am glad that very shortly here we are going to be considering his nomination. I strongly encourage every Member in this Chamber to support his confirmation. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak to the robust support that David Bernhardt has received for his nomination to be Secretary of the Interior. Last week, those of us on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee reported Mr. Bernhardt on a strong, bipartisan vote of 14 to 6. He has actually added support from the last time that he was considered in committee, in 2017, and I hope we will see that again when we vote on his nomination later today. Mr. Bernhardt's support is not limited to the Senate. For example, the Congressional Western Caucus is solidly behind Mr. Bernhardt, with many of its members on record in support of his nomination. Bear in mind, these are members from Western States, where the vast majority of our public lands are located, whose districts are most impacted by the Department of the Interior. It is a very good sign that Mr. Bernhardt has drawn their strong support. We have also kept a list of individuals and groups who have submitted letters of support for Mr. Bernhardt. It spans the spectrum of stakeholders, from the Public Lands Council and the Colorado Farm Bureau to the American Exploration and Mining Association and the Corps Network. Multiple recreation groups have written in urging the Senate to confirm Mr. Bernhardt. The motorized recreation groups, like the American Council of Snowmobile Associations and the Off-Road Business Association, wrote that, ``At a time when many of the senior posts at the agency lack Senate confirmed executives, a person of Mr. Bernhardt's experience is sorely need . . . having [him] at the helm of the Interior Department will strengthen the agency's resolve to make the lands it manages accessible to the recreating public.'' Officials at all levels of government are voicing their support for Mr. Bernhardt's nomination. The Governor of Wyoming, Mark Gordon, offered this statement: [Mr. Bernhardt's] recognition of expertise in the States is refreshing . . . I wish [him] a speedy and easy confirmation process.'' The Mesa County Commissioners in Colorado wrote that ``Mr. Bernhardt's extensive knowledge of public lands and energy issues makes him an avid leader with skill to see issues from multiple perspectives to maintain and improve partnerships among federal, state, and local governments.'' The Harney County Court in Oregon has highlighted Mr. Bernhardt's commitment to balancing the multiple use of public land, writing that, ``[He] has proved himself in the past by exhibiting understanding between the balance that is needed from an ecological standpoint, but also, what is needed from the economic and social aspect of public land use. He will work towards a balanced approach by trying to assess and distinguish between the multiple issues that we are facing with the [bureaus].'' [[Page S2415]] Tribal groups and entities are also supportive of his nomination. In my home State, the Alaska Federation of Natives noted that, ``Mr. Bernhardt has demonstrated a thorough understanding of the legal frameworks of the major laws covering Alaska Native subsistence customary and traditional rights and protections . . . he listens well, is articulate in his responses, and draws reasonable conclusions.'' The Chairman of the Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council wrote in that, ``the [Tribe] has worked with [Mr. Bernhardt] previously and firmly believes that his knowledge and experience make him a very good fit for the Department . . . we also believe he is committed to building strong working relationships that rely on good faith and respect among all interests at the table.'' We have truly heard from a very wide range of organizations in support of this nomination. The Archery Trade Association wrote to us that ``[Mr. Bernhardt] has demonstrated tremendous commitment to conserving and protecting our nation's natural, historic and cultural resources . . . [his] experience with the Department of the Interior coupled [with his] exemplary history of collaboration, non-partisan views, highly respected demeanor and deeply held passion for conservation and historic preservation make him uniquely qualified for this position.'' One of the reasons that such a diverse group of stakeholders support Mr. Bernhardt's nomination is that they have worked with him during his nearly ten years at Interior, including most recently as Deputy Secretary and then Acting Secretary. He has proven that he can work with groups, he has formed strong relationships with them, and they respect and support him. For example, the Gila River Indian Community wrote that, ``based on our experience in negotiating and working on complex issues with Mr. Bernhardt we support his position as Secretary of the Department of the Interior. We believe he has an understanding of Tribal sovereignty and the United States' trust responsibility to Tribal nations.'' The Corps Network wrote that ``Mr. Bernhardt has been accessible and responsive to our inquiries, visited several Corps in the field, and joined the Corps Network's Day of Service last summer.'' These groups are reiterating what we already know--that Mr. Bernhardt's experience at Interior and in the West; his willingness to listen, build relationships, be responsive; and his ability to earn people's trust make him more than qualified to lead the Department of the Interior. I want to wrap up by reading an excerpt from a letter that we received from the Beaver County Commission in Utah: ``In our interactions with Mr. Bernhardt we have found him to act with integrity, be open minded to all points of view, and have a contagious passion for the health of our Nation's lands and people. These qualities, combined with many others, make Mr. Bernhardt an ideal candidate to serve the county by leading the Department of the Interior.'' I couldn't say it any better. Mr. Bernhardt knows the Department and the laws that govern it inside and out. He appreciates and respects the Department's mission. He is the right person for the job--the best person to lead Interior--and I look forward to his confirmation. Remembering Selina Everson Madam President, before I relinquish my time, I just want to take a very brief moment to note that a friend, a leader, an extraordinary role model for many Alaskans--certainly in the Alaska Native community--has recently passed. Selina Everson was a language and culture warrior in Southeastern Alaska and one who fought for the Tlingit language and culture preservation. She was an extraordinary woman and role model. She grew up speaking Tlingit. It was her first language. In school, she was told: You can only speak English. She broke that rule and courageously spoke Tlingit anyway. She was a champion for her culture. We mourn her passing. This woman not only was considered Grandma Selina and considered by hundreds of children in schools in Southeastern Alaska as a friend and a relative, I considered her one as well. I was honored that she was the one who helped adopt me into the Deisheetaan clan and gave me the honor and treasured name of Aan shaawatk'i, Lady of the Land. So know that I send my prayers to Selina's family as they face this loss. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The assistant Democratic leader. Tribute to MJ Kenny Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to honor a member of my staff. I thank Senator Fischer and Senator Manchin for giving me an opportunity to speak at this moment. MJ Kenny has been part of my team in the Senate for 9 years, and for the past several years, he was a constant on the floor of the Senate as deputy floor director of my staff. At the end of this week, he is going to be moving on to a new professional opportunity. Unlike many of us who work in this building, MJ actually is a resident of the Washington, DC, area. He graduated from Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, MD, a suburb of the city of Washington. Walt Whitman wrote in his essay, ``Democratic Vistas,'' the following: ``Did you too, O friend, suppose democracy was only for elections, for politics, and for a party name?'' Walt Whitman understood that democracy is more than campaigns. Democracy is certainly more than just yelling at one another. Democracy is a process. It is a daily dedication to the institutions and norms and the rule of law. Making democracy work takes skill and commitment, and it takes many people who are willing to make a sacrifice and see the demands for long hours and the demands for time on the floor as part of their democratic commitment. This can demand great patience and great sacrifice. I think Walt Whitman would have given MJ Kenny high marks, as do I. For the last few years, MJ has helped to make sure the Senate does the daily work of democracy. I have counted on him to make sure that my interests were represented on the floor of the Senate, that my constituents in Illinois had a voice in the Senate, and that stories about Dreamers and other important information be shared in the Congressional Record with my colleagues and beyond. Making certain that the information was floor-ready was a responsibility of MJ Kenny, and he handled it professionally. MJ and my floor director, Reema Dodin, are my dynamic duo who help make things happen around here. Together, they are my eyes and ears on the floor when meetings and other obligations take me away. MJ has also been a big help to so many other Senators. He came to my office 12 years ago for an informational interview. We tried to decide whether we were right for one another. Luckily, I came to the conclusion that this graduate of Northwestern University in Chicago with a degree in history, who had already interned for then- Congressman and now Senator Chris Van Hollen, was a good fit for my team and a good prospect to help us move forward. I gave MJ Kenny his opportunity, and I am sure glad I did. He flourished. In one year he moved from legislative correspondent to legislative aid to becoming a key part of my floor team. In every job he has done for me, MJ has been a steady, reliable partner. Even in difficult times, he works long hours without complaint and with grit and good humor. In college, he studied history. In the U.S. Senate and on this floor for the last 9 years, he has not only witnessed history, he has helped to shape it. I couldn't ask for more in a staff. I suspect that some of what MJ knows about patience and perseverance he learned as a lifelong, long-suffering Baltimore Orioles fan. It is like being a Chicago Cubs fan. Among his treasured possessions on his desk is a bobblehead of Manny Machado, the former O's third baseman and Golden Glove winner. Just as Manny Machado left the O's, MJ Kenny is leaving the Senate at the end of this week. I want to wish him continued success and thank him again for being such an important part of my team over the years. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank MJ also, on behalf of Senator Durbin. His staff does a [[Page S2416]] great job, and we always enjoy working with them. MJ, enjoy your new endeavor in life. Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of Mr. David Bernhardt to be the Secretary of the Interior. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources voted to report David Bernhardt's nomination to be the Secretary of the Interior last week by a vote 14 to 6. Members on both sides held and continue to hold strong feelings on Mr. Bernhardt's nomination. Both sides have scrutinized his record carefully, as we should, considering the enormous responsibility entrusted to the Secretary of the Interior. Whether it be payments for miners for their healthcare benefits, processing permits for the privilege of energy production on Federal lands, or ensuring the U.S. Geological Survey can conduct its critical work of collecting and analyzing data on our changing climate, the Department of the Interior has a huge amount of responsibility and diverse jurisdiction. Furthermore, the Secretary of the Interior is the guardian of our Nation's greatest natural resources. The Department of the Interior manages nearly half a billion acres of Federal land, or about 20 percent of the Nation's land. One of every 5 acres in the United States is under their control. These lands include some of our most special places--our national parks, trails, seashores, and historic sites. In addition, the Department manages another 1.7 billion acres of submerged land on the Outer Continental Shelf. The Department of the Interior is also the largest supplier of water in the 17 Western States. It manages nearly 500 dams and over 300 reservoirs that supply water to over 31 million people and irrigate 10 million acres of farmland. Furthermore, nearly 20 percent of energy we use is produced on lands managed by the Secretary. These include not just coal and oil and natural gas but also hydropower, geothermal, solar, and wind energy. In addition, the Secretary of the Interior manages our trust obligations to nearly 600 federally recognized Indian Tribes and provides services to nearly 2 million Native Americans. By any measure, the job of Secretary of the Interior is an enormous and special responsibility. As a former Governor, I have always believed that an executive is entitled to deference when selecting his or her team, as long as the candidates are qualified and ethical. I have carefully reviewed Mr. Bernhardt's experience and his qualifications. I met with him twice before his hearing and spoke with him again by phone afterwards. I questioned him extensively about his willingness to be a good steward of our Nation's greatest natural treasures--our national parks, monuments, and historical sites. I questioned him about his responsibility to balance our resource needs with environmental protection and fairness to the owners of our public lands, which are all of us, the American people. I spoke to him about the need to make sure that those who are granted the privilege of using our public lands leave them in better condition than they found them. Based on my extensive discussion with him and my review of his record, I believe Mr. Bernhardt is clearly qualified to serve as Secretary. He held senior positions in the Department for 8 years during the Bush administration, including over 2 years as the Solicitor, which is the third highest office in the Department. He has served as the Deputy Secretary for the past 2 years and as Acting Secretary since January. He knows the Interior Department inside and out, and he is well-versed on all of the issues that come before it. He clearly has the knowledge and experience to serve as Secretary. Now, the opposition to Mr. Bernhardt's nomination comes not from any lack of knowledge or experience but from questions about appearances of conflicts of interest arising from his law practice prior to being confirmed as Deputy Secretary. I had extensive conversations with Mr. Bernhardt about these potential conflicts of interest and his compliance with ethics laws and regulations. I reminded him that he takes the same oath I take--public service, not self-service. We also spoke about the importance of ensuring a culture at the Department of the Interior that reflects the highest level of ethical compliance and integrity. Based on my extensive discussion with Mr. Bernhardt and the assurances he gave me, I voted for him in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources last week, and I will support his nomination when we vote on the floor to confirm him. But I said before the vote in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--and I will say it again--that I expect him and the Department to hold itself to the highest ethical standards because I assured him I will. Mr. Bernhardt must work to ensure the commitment to ethical and scientific integrity, and I intend to work with him and his staff persistently to ensure this is the case. Our parks and public lands, our scenic beauty, and our fish and wildlife resources are important to everybody and especially to the people of West Virginia, which I represent, and to the people of all of our States and to the Nation's outdoor recreation economy. West Virginians count on the Secretary of the Interior as the guardian of our public lands, as I know you do, Mr. President, in Louisiana. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which I am privileged to serve on as ranking member, has a lot of work to do. We have to address the park maintenance backlog. We have to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, ensure that companies granted the privilege of developing public energy and mineral resources pay the royalties they owe the taxpayers and nothing less, and see that our public lands and resources are wisely managed and protected. I intend to work with Mr. Bernhardt on these important issues. I have made it clear to him that I expect him to put his extensive experience and knowledge of these issues to work for all the American people and to execute his responsibilities in a manner that ensures that our public lands are not just being maintained but improved for the benefit of generations to come. For that reason, I will vote to confirm him to this important position, and I ask your consideration for the same. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska. ICBMs Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, recently I came to the Senate floor to speak about the airborne leg of the nuclear triad. Today I rise to discuss the value of another leg of the triad--our intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. Following the brief deployment of the Atlas and Titan ICBM weapon systems in the early 1960s, the United States deployed the first Minuteman ICBMs in support of the strategic deterrence mission. Over half a century later, today the United States deploys 400 Minuteman III ICBMs, each carrying a single warhead. While the Minuteman III system was deployed in the 1970s, much of its technology dates to the previous decade. The system was originally designed for a 10-year service life but has sustained an exceptionally high availability rate and is expected to remain in service through the 2030s, thanks to a series of life-extension programs. But we cannot extend the current system beyond 2030, and that is why we are now developing its replacement--the ground based strategic deterrent. Doing so will require resources in a budget- constrained environment and, perhaps for that reason, we are hearing renewed calls to abandon the triad and cut our ICBM force. However, this step would be foolish and dangerous to the United States and to our allied security for several reasons. First, ICBMs are highly reliable and always ready. That is why they are regarded as the most responsive leg of the triad. Unlike bombers and submarines, which may require time to arm or maneuver, the ICBM force provides the President the ability to promptly respond if deterrence fails. This virtue is often mischaracterized as a source of risk. The system's rapid response is described as a ``hair trigger'' by critics who often paint chilling pictures of 400 ICBMs automatically flying to their [[Page S2417]] targets and causing Armageddon, either by accident or as a result of cyber interference. I want to be clear that there is no ``hair trigger'' about our ICBMs. We have many safeguards put in place to ensure the system operates only as intended. For example, our ICBMs are actually targeted on the open- ocean spaces as a means of ensuring that, even if all of our safeguards failed and a missile somehow managed to launch by accident, it would land in the ocean and not accidentally start a nuclear war. The critics conveniently fail to mention this. Former STRATCOM commander General Robert Kehler recently testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, and he said: ``It isn't the same thing at all as thinking about a Wild West hair trigger . . . . It's not the way it works.'' The high readiness of the ICBM force also provides an important hedge against uncertainty. Since we no longer maintain bombers on nuclear alert, the ICBMs and the submarines reinforce each other so that a technical failure in one leg of the triad does not render our day-to- day deterrent inoperative. Those who advocate for doing away with the ICBM force must account for the fact that, under their proposals, in such moments there would not have been an additional leg of the triad to ensure our Nation isn't left without a nuclear deterrent. As our nuclear forces continue to age, reliability challenges will only grow. Critics often describe the ICBM force as being vulnerable, even going so far as to call our missiles sitting ducks. It is true that silos are not hidden, they aren't mobile, and they can be targeted. But, again, this is a misunderstanding of what actually is the strength of the ICBM force. In his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Hyten stated that the ICBM force ``creates the most significant targeting problem for an adversary, because there are 400 separate targets across the United States. All would have to be independently targeted by an adversary. That targeting problem is hugely problematic and creates a significant advantage for us.'' Simply put, destroying 400 hardened and geographically dispersed silos is an extremely difficult proposition. Only Russia possesses the capability to destroy our ICBM force. No other nation on Earth can do so, and it would greatly diminish Russia's arsenal in the process. That is not a vulnerability. As General Hyten clearly states, it is a significant advantage for our Nation. For these reasons and many others, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have maintained ICBMs as part of our nuclear forces for decades. The role of ICBMs has been reconsidered and reviewed many times, and their value has been repeatedly reaffirmed in a bipartisan manner. For example, last November the report by the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission stated that the triad presents insurmountable targeting challenges for adversaries, imposes disproportionate costs on adversary defenses, and hedges against unforeseen geopolitical or technological changes. Mr. President, I will close by saying that our ICBM forces make key contributions to our overall nuclear forces and, as Members on both sides of the aisle agree, they are an essential ingredient to the bedrock of our national security--our nuclear deterrent. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Venezuela Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Good afternoon. The crisis in Venezuela is a crisis in America. Senator Rubio, Congressman Diaz-Balart, and I have been talking about this for years and worked with the White House on a comprehensive strategy. More than 200,000 Venezuelans live in Florida, and their concerns are our concerns. Make no mistake--this is a crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis that threatens the lives of the people of Venezuela and has created a flood of refugees numbering in the millions. It is also a crisis that threatens the safety and security of our allies in Latin America and in the United States of America. The dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro and the creeping influence and military presence of our global adversaries represent a clear and present danger to the entire Western Hemisphere. There are some who will say that this is not our fight, that the millions of Venezuelans suffering 2,000 miles away are not our concern. Some have criticized the mere mention of the crisis in Venezuela by those like myself as American imperialism or a U.S.-backed coup. I reject that. This is our fight. Freedom and democracy in Latin America is our fight. I remind these critics that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing. We cannot let evil triumph in Venezuela. It would be a failure of leadership with disastrous consequences. There is only one option left to get aid to the people of Venezuela. It is something that no one is willing to talk about. It is becoming clear that we will have to consider the use of American military assets to deliver aid. Maduro and his thugs have left us no choice. I applaud President Trump and his administration for taking bold action by recognizing Juan Guaido as the legitimate President of Venezuela and organizing the international community to do the same. The sanctions implemented by this administration against the Maduro regime and its puppet masters in Havana reflect their commitment to freedom and democracy in Latin America. Yet Maduro remains in power, the people of Venezuela continue to suffer, and the influence of Cuba, Russia, China, and international terrorist organizations grows. We must do more, but in order to understand where we go from here, we need to look at history. Hugo Chavez might have been elected democratically, but he never intended to govern democratically. He built a socialist dictatorship by hollowing out all the democratic institutions: the constitution, the electoral system, and the courts. He made civil society and the business sector bend to his will or face elimination. He nationalized entire sectors of the economy and used them to pay off his cronies. He took over the oil sector and made the national energy company his piggy bank. He made common cause with our enemies--most notably, the Castro regime. Cuba received and continues to receive free oil from Venezuela and in return provides political and internal security operatives. In other words, Cuba provided and is still providing military thugs to help stop freedom. Chavez allowed his regime to engage in illicit trafficking of drugs and people. He cooperated with Middle Eastern terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and the terrorist state of Iran. This cooperation has only intensified under Chavez's successor, Maduro. The path of socialism chosen by the Chavistas inevitably led to a failed state that relies on bad actors for survival. The result is one of the worst humanitarian crises in our hemisphere's history. We cannot ignore the impact the socialist policies of Chavez and Maduro has had on the people of Venezuela. Nine out of ten households say they don't have enough money to buy food. That is socialism. Eighty percent of children under 5 are in some state of malnutrition. That is socialism. Inflation is over 10 million percent this year, and their currency is worthless. What does that mean to the average person? A bundle of carrots costs 3 million bolivars. A dozen eggs costs $150 USD. That is socialism. Venezuela has the highest murder rate in the world. That is socialism. More than 3.5 million refugees--about 12 percent of the population-- have fled to nearby countries because they can't get food, water, medicine, or safety from their government. Two million more Venezuelans are expected to flee before the year is out, with Colombia taking the brunt of this refugee crisis. Colombian resources are strained, as they do all they can to help the refugees fleeing persecution, starvation, and sickness, while the Maduro regime blocks aid caravans, sets them on fire, and continues to cooperate with the narcotrafficking rebels that plague Colombia. I want to thank my good friend President Duque for all he is doing. Other nations in the region, such as Brazil and Peru, have also chipped in, accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees. [[Page S2418]] For weeks, millions of Venezuelans have been left without running water and amid a series of massive blackouts. Journalists report scenes that are now a part of the daily life for Venezuelans: dozens sleeping in line for their turn at a well in one of the city's biggest slums; three men tossing an old paint bucket tied with ropes down a well hoping to hit water; people parked by the highway, waiting their turn to place bottles under small streams that run down the Avila Mountain. Many Venezuelans call these conditions a genocide because the violence and starvation are being imposed on the civilian population as a conscious policy of Maduro and his Cuban puppet masters. Dictators like Maduro recognize weakness as an opportunity. The hungrier and sicker his people are, the easier they are to repress. This is the kind of evil we are facing in our hemisphere. But one thing is clear: Maduro underestimates his people. They may be oppressed, but they are not weak. They may be hungry, but their hunger is for freedom, and they are making their voices heard. We need to listen. Nicholas Maduro is an illegitimate President. His election was a sham, just like the elections in Cuba and Russia--a complete sham and a joke. Dozens of countries across Latin America and Europe have recognized Juan Guaido's right to the interim Presidency. As President of the National Assembly--the only democratic body left in Venezuela-- Juan Guaido has the right and the duty to preside over new elections and the return of democracy. The people still in power in Venezuela are corrupt bureaucrats and military officers engaged in embezzlement, narcotrafficking, and human rights abuses. Since being tested by uprisings in 2014 and 2017, the regime has reinforced a repressive apparatus that uses armed mobile civilian gangs known as colectivos, specialized police units, and anti- riot forces of the National Guard to terrorize and control the civilian population through arbitrary arrests, beatings, detentions, and killings. The Maduro regime has gone so far as to arrest the Chief of Staff for Interim President Guaido, Roberto Marrero. I met his wife Romy on Monday in Miami. She fled the country 3 weeks ago with their 7-year-old son, right before Maduro's thugs destroyed their home. The majority of the armed forces want change in their country, but they live under the repressive forces of control, threats, intimidation, and violence. Russian mercenaries protect Maduro because he can't trust his own troops, and the Russian Government has provided military advisers and specialists to maintain the Maduro regime's defenses, including surface-to-air missile systems. Russia has also sent nuclear-capable bombers to Venezuela, in violation of the Venezuelan Constitution, to intimidate the United States and other countries in the region. In short, Russia is expanding its military presence in Venezuela to prop up a regime hostile to the United States and create a foothold in the Western Hemisphere. Not since the Cuban Missile Crisis has Russia taken such an aggressive step to expand their influence in the region. Meanwhile, China evades sanctions we have placed on the regime by investing in the country and extending generous loans to prop up the dictatorship in Caracas. The United States faces a serious national security threat and a humanitarian crisis at our doorstep. This is becoming as dangerous for us as the Syrian civil war has been for Europe, Israel, and Jordan. Left unchecked, it will destabilize our regional allies and provide a base of operations for our enemies. Today, I am urging the administration, Congress, and the American people to see the crisis for what it is--a rising tide of social and political collapse encouraged and funded by our enemies. The socialist dictatorship of Nicholas Maduro and his Cuban, Russian, Chinese, and narcotrafficking allies do not care how many millions of Venezuelans suffer and die. He is determined to remain in power, sucking the life out of a once-vibrant nation and creating an outpost for adversaries and a safe harbor for terrorists intent on harming Americans. We cannot let this stand. We will be judged for our response to this crisis--not just the humanitarian crisis but the threat to our hemisphere. The credibility and security of the United States is on the line. The question is not whether we can tolerate this crisis that is worsening daily--we surely cannot. The question is, When will we act to end it? Hostile regimes like Russia, China, and Cuba are digging in. They are training killers, distributing weapons, and placing military assets in Venezuela. Their message is clear: They don't intend to give up without a fight. History has proven that permitting the former Soviet Union to establish a presence in Cuba perpetrated a six-decade, totalitarian dictatorship that has exported instability to the region and worked against U.S. national security interests. Our safety, national security, and the peace of our hemisphere demand that we take action. We cannot allow this murderous regime to continue spreading misery within its borders and into neighboring countries. There is a democratic government-in-waiting in the form of National Assembly and Interim President Juan Guaido. U.S. policy relies on rallying his internal support and forcing those around Maduro to see their future as brighter if they defect and support the movement toward freedom and democracy. There are steps we can take to accelerate this process. First, we must follow through on American policy and indict regime leaders for human rights violations and for narcotrafficking and money laundering crimes. The region's strongest supporters do not care if the people suffer, but they do care if their stolen fortunes and their freedom are at risk. We must make clear to them that their future is in jeopardy if they continue to support Maduro and interference from Cuba, Russia, and China. There will be nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. The United States will give no quarter to those who support the brutal Maduro dictatorship instead of freedom and democracy for the people of Venezuela. Second, we must break the hold the Cuban Government has on Venezuela. It is imperative that the United States fully implement the sanctions contained in the LIBERTAD Act to allow U.S. nationals to sue over property confiscated by the Cuban Government and to deny entry to those who traffic in stolen property. Cuba cannot continue to freely incite violence in Venezuela while profiting from the use of stolen property and human trafficking. Chavez and Maduro kept the Cuban regime afloat for decades, and now Cuban operators are keeping the Maduro regime in power. It is time we recognize that these problems are one and the same. Third, we must encourage our allies in the region to join us in this effort. President Trump has repeatedly called on regional counterparts to exert more leadership, and he has a right to do so. The United States has implemented strong sanctions on Venezuelan leaders, on oil, and on trade. Our allies must join us in this effort. The Lima Group, made up of our friends in the region, has given broad support to the strategy of isolating the Maduro regime in favor of Interim President Guaido, urging additional sanctions. That is welcome, but they should not rule out the possibility that they need to pursue more aggressive means to secure this threat. Their security and economic well-being are also at risk. They should remember that the Maduro regime and its supporters want Venezuela's neighbors to live in fear. Even before this crisis began in earnest, Colombia and Guyana faced regular interventions and threats from the Venezuelan regime. Maduro and his supporters do not want peaceful relations with other countries except on their own terms. I am quite sure that Cuba, China, and Russia do not have the best interests of the region in mind. I was glad to see the Organization of American States accept the appointment of the designated permanent representative of the National Assembly, Gustavo Tarre Briceno. Consistent with the Inter-American Democratic Charter, the Organization of American States must expel Maduro's representative. The Maduro regime is not a legitimate government and has no right to send a representative to the very body in the Western Hemisphere charged with protecting and promoting democracy in the region. [[Page S2419]] Fourth, we must not appear weak in the face of Chinese, Russian, and Cuban determination to prop up Maduro. Our adversaries question our will and determination. Put simply, they don't think we are serious. We should disabuse them of that notion. All options, including the use of American military assets, must remain on the table. If sanctions can cripple the Maduro regime, we must continue on that path, but so far, sanctions alone are not stopping the Maduro regime, and the United States needs to start considering the use of military assets to bring aid to the millions of starving and sick Venezuelans. I call on all of our allies and those supporting Guaido to help us in this effort. Let me repeat that. The United States must consider the use of military assets to bring aid to the people of Venezuela, but that doesn't end the conversation. If embargoes and blockades can help, we should consider them. If military force on the part of the United States and our allies in the region is necessary to rid us of the scourge of Maduro and his thugs, then we cannot rule it out. If the Venezuelan people, through their elected National Assembly and their own laws and Constitution, request assistance to restore constitutional government and democracy, we should be ready to answer that call. The Maduro regime has not been broken yet and can count on billions of dollars looted from the Venezuelan people and generated from 20 years of narcotrafficking. The Cubans, Russians, and Chinese see Venezuela as an economic opportunity, but, more importantly, they see a chance to intimidate the United States--to be a thorn in our side. This is a ``great power'' confrontation and one that our national defense strategy might not explicitly contemplate. Yet it is a confrontation we must be willing to meet with decisive action. The Venezuelan people want change, and even now they think of survival as much as they think of a democratic future. They are looking to the future. They are looking to the United States and democratic countries to help them. We must answer that call. I yield the floor. nomination of david bernhardt Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination of David Bernhardt to be Secretary of the Interior. I opposed his nomination as Deputy Secretary of the Interior because of his numerous conflicts of interest as a former lobbyist. Bernhardt's tenure, both as Deputy Secretary and now the Acting Secretary at Interior, has since confirmed my initial concerns and given rise to new ones. As a former partner at a powerful DC lobbying and law firm, Bernhardt represented numerous oil, gas, mining, and water companies with ongoing business before the Department that he now oversees. The Washington Post recently reported that he has at least 22 known conflicts of interest, the most of any of President Trump's nominees. This is particularly concerning given that Mr. Bernhardt's recusals mandated by President Trump will expire in August, and he has refused to commit to continuing recusing himself beyond then on any issues that could benefit former clients. In fact, during his recent confirmation hearing, Bernhardt stated that recusal isn't ``really is the best strategy''--an unacceptable stance. By refusing to recuse himself, Bernhardt has shown a potential willingness to put his former clients' needs before the public good. One troubling example is his relationship with Cadiz, a company that wants to profit by draining a critical aquifer in the Mojave Desert. Before coming to the Department of the Interior, Mr. Bernhardt was a partner at and led the natural resources division of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Cadiz's lobbying firm that retains a financial stake in the project. This project would destroy the treasured California desert that I have fought my entire Senate career to protect. In order to sell the water, Cadiz needs to build a more than 40-mile pipeline through the desert to connect to an aqueduct. Several months after Bernhardt was nominated as Deputy Secretary, the Department of Interior temporarily suspended its own solicitor's opinion requiring Cadiz to get Federal permits to build its pipeline along a railroad right-of-way. That solicitor's opinion was ultimately reversed 2 months after he was confirmed, completely removing the Federal permitting authority for this project. The timing of this decision is extremely troubling, particularly in light of the Interior Department's own independent science that has repeatedly questioned the sustainability of this project. The U.S. Geological Survey, which is part of the Interior Department, stated in 2002 and confirmed in 2017 that the natural recharge rate of the aquifer is only 2,000 to 10,000 acre-feet per year. Cadiz proposes to withdraw water at more than 50,000 acre-feet, or 16 billion gallons, per year for 50 years. Taking that much water would rob the desert of its most precious natural resource and harm the surrounding flora and fauna. Now the Federal Government, despite its own science saying Cadiz would take too much water and legal opinions requiring Federal review, has removed itself from the permitting process. Even the mere appearance of favoritism or special favors for Cadiz is extremely inappropriate and a concern with this nomination. I am also concerned that throughout his tenure at Interior, Bernhardt has shown a willingness to ignore the public's interest for political purposes. During President Trump's government shutdown--the longest in U.S. history--Acting Secretary Bernhardt kept most of the national parks open to avoid public backlash for the shutdown. Left open but severally understaffed, major damage occurred to parks across the country. Few places felt the impact of his poor decision more than Joshua Tree National Park. Iconic Joshua trees were cut down, cultural artifacts stolen or destroyed, and pristine desert habitat marred by vehicle traffic. I have twice requested from Mr. Bernhardt a full accounting of the damage and costs of his decision and have not received a response. I am also deeply concerned by steps Interior has recently taken to expand offshore oil drilling, despite bipartisan opposition from coastal States. Californians don't want new offshore drilling along our coast. We still remember the horror of the 1969 Santa Barbara spill, when an offshore oil rig leaked more than 100,000 barrels, the third largest oil spill behind the Exxon-Valdez and Deepwater Horizon disasters. There has been no new drilling in State waters since that spill and no new drilling in Federal waters off the coast of California since 1984. Now, the Department of the Interior is openly discussing the option of restarting such drilling. Bernhardt's ties to the fossil fuel industry give me zero confidence that the Interior Department will reach the right conclusion if he is confirmed. For the reasons I have stated, I cannot vote to confirm Mr. Bernhardt. Should he be confirmed, I again ask that he fully recuse himself from all matters related to former clients during his tenure as a lobbyist. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider this nomination before voting. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 6 minutes prior to the scheduled vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the President's nominee for Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt. Once again, instead of draining the swamp, President Trump is flooding the swamp with a whole new breed of corporate-sponsored creatures. Already, we have a former coal lobbyist running the Environmental Protection Agency. We have chemical lobbyists running the EPA's chemical safety programs. And unless we put the brakes on Mr. Bernhardt's nomination, soon we will have a fossil fuel lobbyist running the Department of Interior. For a State like New Jersey, which depends on a healthy, vibrant coastal [[Page S2420]] economy, Mr. Bernhardt's extensive ties to the fossil fuel industry are troubling, to say the least. The Secretary of the Interior is charged with the stewardship of public lands and waters and safeguarding our natural resources for generations to come. Yet the Washington Post has reported that Mr. Bernhardt has so many conflicts of interest that he must carry a card around just to keep track of them. Think about that. Mr. Bernhardt has such deep ties to fossil fuel companies with business pending before the Interior Department that he cannot keep track of them. How Mr. Bernhardt would approach his position if confirmed as Secretary of Interior is no mystery. During his time as Acting Secretary, he has gained a reputation as a general in the Trump administration's war on science. Reports suggest that he has suppressed scientific evidence in order to benefit corporate interests at the expense of environmental protection. Rather than be responsive to Congress about our concerns, Mr. Bernhardt has displayed a stunning lack of transparency. Like many Trump nominees, he has failed to respond to basic inquiries from Congress. For example, on March 20, I sent a letter--along with Senator Feinstein, Senator Merkley, and 15 of our colleagues--requesting that the Acting Secretary respond to a series of questions about his views on offshore drilling. With his hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee quickly approaching, we asked Mr. Bernhardt to respond prior to coming before Congress. This way, committee members could have at least a baseline understanding of his views while crafting their questions. We received no response. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN959367320190412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW6-4W61-DXCW-D1D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"28960\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of David Bernhardt, of Virginia, to be Secretary of the Department of Interior. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Medicare Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, some officials are proposing radical changes to our healthcare system. These proposals include Medicare for All, Medicare Buy-in, Medicaid for All, and expansion of the Affordable Care Act. All of these are versions of government-run healthcare. These are, of course, better campaign slogans than serious solutions to the problems facing Americans. On a certain level, I have found that most people would rather have control over their own healthcare than have the government make those decisions for them. A single-payer healthcare system would be devastating for our seniors, people with disabilities, and people with preexisting conditions. I yield the floor. Recognition of the Majority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized. Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. McCONNELL. Today the Senate will vote to confirm the President's choice to serve as Secretary of the Interior. As I have discussed this week, David Bernhardt is no stranger to the Department. He has served twice before. In fact, this body has confirmed him twice before. Each time his professionalism and dedication proved us right. As Solicitor and as Deputy Secretary, Mr. Bernhardt has offered capable leadership and a firm grasp on the complex policy environment surrounding our Nation's public lands. His expertise has not gone unnoticed. Praise for Mr. Bernhardt has poured in from a list of more than 40 stakeholder organizations; from agriculture, trade, conservation, and Native American organizations. They describe him as a leader whose ``experience is sorely needed.'' They laud his commitment to ``make the lands he manages accessible to the recreating public.'' So we have before us an opportunity to confirm a well-qualified steward of our Nation's public lands and resources. Yesterday, a bipartisan majority of our colleagues voted to end debate on his nomination, and I hope each will join me in voting yes once more later today. [[Page S2400]] Of course, confirming Mr. Bernhardt will be just the latest in a series of many Executive Calendar accomplishments. Following on the heels of last week's turn back toward the Senate's historic tradition concerning nominations, we have been able to approve a number of the President's nominees at a much more reasonable pace in the last several days. I have noted, with particular interest that, for all the breathless warnings my Democratic colleagues issued about the kinds of people we would be confirming, these unobjectionable nominees have actually mostly coasted through on a bipartisan basis. We saw support from both sides of the aisle for Roy Altman to the U.S District Court for the Southern District of Florida, and for Daniel Domenico to the District of Colorado. We saw an overwhelming bipartisan vote in favor of confirming GEN John Abizaid to serve as Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and a voice-voted confirmation for Jeffrey Kessler to serve as Assistant Secretary of Commerce. These are not lightning-rod people whom my Democratic colleagues would have eagerly debated and investigated for an additional 30 hours. They are the kind of thoroughly qualified public servants who used to sail briskly through the Senate without opposition. Now, even as my Democratic colleagues continue to require us to file cloture on individuals whom they actually go on to support, we are able to fill out the President's team at a more reasonable clip. There are still many empty seats left to fill, but this week's progress marks a great new beginning not just for the administration that needs its personnel but for the health of this institution. Tax Reform Madam President, on another matter, over the past year or so, I have dedicated a large part of my time on the floor to discussing the performance of the U.S economy, and at no point have I struggled to find things to say. Seemingly every day, we have been greeted by headlines that tell the same story: Under the political policies of a pro-growth, pro- opportunity Republican agenda, Americans are experiencing a remarkable economic moment. More than 1 year ago, I mentioned on the floor that weekly jobless claims had reached their lowest level since 1969. Last week, the Labor Department reported that by this measure, the U.S economy has set yet another new record. What was already a nearly 49-year low has now dipped further to a nearly 50-year low. My colleagues and I have been busy highlighting the American stories behind these numbers--stories of recovery and prosperity being written in all sorts of communities, in all corners of our country. More than 1 year since a generational overhaul of the Federal Tax Code lifted burdens from American job creators, entrepreneurs, and working families, the headlines are continuing to pour in. With Tax Day just around the corner, millions of working families have filed for the first time under a law that has allowed, according to nonpartisan analysts, the vast majority of Americans to keep more of their money. They have pocketed higher take-home pay, wage increases, and special bonuses, and they benefited from the booming job market these policies have helped ignite. But old habits die hard. The Washington Democrats who were content to watch as the Obama era piled up 75 percent of new jobs and 90 percent of population growth to the biggest metropolitan areas are back to their same old tricks. In recent months, we have seen a steady drip of leftist daydreams making their way into press conferences, resolutions, and out on the 2020 campaign trail: a massive rewrite of American election laws and a power grab on an individual's right to exercise political speech, a mandatory, one-size-fits-all government-run replacement for private healthcare for over 180 million Americans, and an estimated $93 trillion in taxpayers' money to be spent testing out new Federal social planning schemes and abolishing the affordable energy sources American families rely on. Tax Day seems like an especially fitting day to tell Washington Democrats no thanks--no thanks. The Kentuckians I represent prefer to keep more of their own hard- earned money. They prefer to make their own decisions about their own families instead of ceding more power to bureaucrats. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. H.R 268 Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, Members of the Senate, if you look at the poster I just put up, you know what I am going to talk about--the devastating floods in Iowa and the Midwest. In Western Iowa, we still have areas underwater from flooding on the Missouri river and its tributaries. In the east, we are dealing with the Mississippi River and tributary flooding. Unfortunately, the weather isn't cooperating with additional storms and rain throughout the Upper Midwest, as I speak, that could exacerbate flooding and hinder cleanup and repairs. This flooding is still a very active event, but as we move to recovery, we know the original damage estimates in Iowa are increasing. I can say that for Nebraska as well. Many roads are still closed; levy damage is extensive; towns are devastated; and many individuals lost their homes and businesses. In just 6 of our 99 counties in Iowa, 416,000 acres of cropland was flooded. Much of that cropland is still underwater. These farmers are facing the challenge of not being able to plant this year. Unfortunately, many of these farmers' fields were just recovering from previous years of major flooding. In this area of Iowa, that would have been in 2011. This is compounded by many losing their previous harvest through having their on-the-farm storage bins destroyed, as you can see here. Throughout the Midwest area that had severe flooding, 832 on-farm storage bins have been identified as being like these, destroyed. We don't have a complete estimate of that, but I think 832 on-the-farm storage bins would be at least a figure up to a certain date. These bins hold an estimated 5 to 10 million bushels of corn or soybeans, so, collectively, that would be a loss of worth between $17 million and $34 million. There is an existing program that goes by the acronym WHIP in the Department of Agriculture that is designed to address agricultural losses not covered by crop insurance and other programs. I reached out to the U.S Department of Agriculture to see if this program could be used for losses such as those seen here, particularly in Iowa and Nebraska, for corn and soybeans. I was told because the WHIP program was designed for other commodities affected by hurricanes and wildfires, they needed a few words added to the law to extend the same help to these problems we now have in the Midwest. I asked what those words were, and I spoke to Senator Shelby, who manages this bill on the floor of the Senate, and to Senator Perdue, who has a great deal of interest in the bill because of agricultural losses in Georgia. These two Senators agreed to work with me. These two Senators agreed to work with me. So I filed a shorter amendment of a disaster bill along with Senator Ernst and several of my colleagues from the Midwest to make sure that devastation like this is covered. I am optimistic that this simple fix, which will mean so much to farmers facing such unusual catastrophic losses, can be included as the disaster bill moves forward through the Senate. Yesterday, as another way of helping more than just this type of farmer but, generally, other disaster victims, I joined Senators Fischer, Ernst, and Sasse in introducing a tax bill that goes by the title of the Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019. This bill includes a series of disaster tax relief provisions that will help American families and businesses recover from the terrible disasters that have occurred so far in 2019, including the Midwest flooding. On February 28 I introduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Wyden that included the same tax relief provisions that would assist the victims of disasters that occurred in 2018. So I view the Fischer bill and the Grassley-Wyden bill as complementary, providing disaster tax relief with respect to the disasters that occurred last year, as well as this year. The bill that I introduced in February also includes extensions of [[Page S2401]] a series of tax provisions that almost every Member of this Senate would like to see passed. These are the tax provisions that expired in 2017 and 2018. We labeled all 25 or 26 of these as tax extenders. These are things that, over the last two decades, have been extended almost automatically after they have sunset, and we need to get those provisions enacted, just like the disaster tax relief provisions. I encourage the House Democrats to send the Senate a bill that addresses both tax extenders and disaster tax relief provisions. When I say House Democrats, people listening are going to say: He is being partisan. No, I am being constitutional. The Constitution says that all tax bills have to start in the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives is controlled by the Democrat majority. So that is why I am saying to the House Democrats: Get these bills over here to us so we can help not only the people that benefit from what we call tax extenders but, more importantly, those who with the urgency of the disaster that we are facing. The importance of passing these bills is because Americans need certainty as they file their taxes in 2018, and they need the tax relief as they recover from these natural disasters. They really need the House Democrats, under the Constitution, to pass a tax bill because we can't act on these tax bills before. The custom around here is that the Constitution says that all tax bills have to start in the House of Representatives. If we pass even a simple tax bill--let's say we pass it as part of an appropriations bill--and we send it over to the House, they don't accept it. That has been the tradition around here for centuries. That is why I am calling on the House Democrats to move that bill. The disaster relief provisions included in the bill that we have introduced reduce penalties and make it easier to access retirement funds so individuals and families can get back up on their feet and rebuild their lives. In other words, these are retirement funds that people have set aback and that the law doesn't allow them to access for disasters. It is just a simple thing. If somebody is hurt by this disaster and wants to go to their retirement fund and borrow on it for a certain period of time to help them get relief, it is a pretty simple thing. Maybe, momentarily you could say it costs the Federal Government something, but they are still going to owe these taxes regardless of whenever they start drawing for retirement. These bills also make it easier for disaster victims to claim personal casualty losses, and they suspend certain limitations on charitable contributions to encourage more donations for this disaster relief. For businesses affected by these disasters, this tax relief is available to help them retain employees while businesses get back up and running. Let's continue the bipartisan tradition of helping our fellow Americans with disasters. When these disasters strike, we ought to do it by enacting this tax relief for both 2018 and 2019, so that disaster victims don't have to wait any longer to access this important assistance and continue to get back on their feet. It may sound like I am talking about something new. I don't know whether this just started with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or before, but I remember being chairman of the Finance Committee then. We passed similar legislation to help the victims of hurricanes. So this is really nothing new. Since it is nothing new and we have done it before, what is wrong with doing it now? The Democrats in the House of Representatives can get this bill over to us so we can get it enacted over here and get it to the President. We want to provide the certainty that taxpayers deserve by enacting extensions of not only those disasters but also the expired tax provisions. I encourage the House Democrats to move swiftly. The Senate and the American people are waiting. On another point about flooding, generally, not just dealing with this flood, this flood brings to attention something we have to deal with, with the Army Corps of Engineers. Next week the Environment and Public Works Committee is holding a field hearing in Southwest Iowa to provide oversight on the Army Corps of Engineers management of the 2019 Missouri River flooding. Senator Ernst, my colleague from Iowa, will be chairing this hearing, and I am going to be participating. Flood control should be the No. 1 priority of the Corps in its management of the Missouri River. I hope that tomorrow, when I get to travel with Vice President Pence as he views the same area that I viewed 2 weeks ago--the same area covered here--we have the Army Corps of Engineers there so that we can talk to them about the issue of the Missouri River Master Manual authorizing eight purposes as they control the water up and down the Missouri River. They do that through the dams on the Missouri River. It happens that seven of these can be at cross purposes with the eighth one--flood control. I hope flood control is No. 1 and not No. 8. We need to discuss with them how to prevent massive flooding and how to act to ensure that folks in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas are not faced with devastation every few years. Eventually, this water ends up in the Gulf of Mexico. So States below Missouri are going to eventually be affected by it. I appreciate the stamina and determination of Iowans whom I have seen out there, not only in this flood of 2019 but in the flood of 2011. The one of 2019 was much more devastating. I think we have great resiliency. We will come back and pull together to get the job done, but there is a very long recovery ahead of all of these Iowans affected by it and Nebraskans and, maybe to some extent, Kansas and quite a bit in Missouri. I will continue to do everything I can at the Federal level to help the State of Iowa, Iowa communities, and, more importantly, in fact, as individual Iowans are affected, I am going to help them to recover and to rebuild. Thank you. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, it is an exciting day for Colorado. I have known David Bernhardt, our nominee for Secretary of the Interior-- and the seventh Secretary of the Interior from Colorado should he be confirmed today--personally and professionally for over two decades. His roots are deep on both sides of Colorado--in the High Plains and on the Western Slope. We share a lot of common interests in rural development and in saving our small towns. My experience stems from growing up in the agricultural community of Yuma, CO, in the Eastern Plains, and Mr. Bernhardt's formative years were spent on the Western Slope of Colorado--an area that is a microcosm of all of the things that we cherish about our great public lands. We both began our public service only 1 year apart when we worked for Colorado State Representative Russell George, who would later go on to become speaker of the Colorado House. That is when I first met David. Mr. Bernhardt worked with Jaime, my wife, at the Department of the Interior during the George W. Bush administration under another Colorado Secretary of the Interior. His personal background and public and private sector professional experiences prove he is a strong voice for the West and is extremely well-qualified for the nomination to be the Secretary. In fact, there are few others who have the kind of experience that he has that enables him to be qualified to be Secretary. Which Secretary of the Interior has had more experience than David Bernhardt or has been more qualified to become the Secretary of the Interior? He has extensive insight on Western water policy, natural resources policy, and on Indian affairs, just to name a few. Those who have worked with Mr. Bernhardt commend him for his integrity and wealth of knowledge on the issues under the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction. In 2008, after the Department of the Interior reached the largest Indian [[Page S2402]] water rights settlement in our Nation's history, Secretary Kempthorne personally acknowledged Mr. Bernhardt's work as then-Solicitor and stated: ``His effective coordination--both within Interior as well as with the local, tribal, state and congressional leaders--was essential to the success we celebrate today.'' More recently, he worked to accommodate many Western States' requests for more flexibility under the Greater Sage-Grouse RMP Amendment. John Swartout, who as a senior policy adviser ran point on this issue for Colorado's Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper, had this to say in December 2018 once that process was completed: David Bernhardt is an honest man who puts all his cards on the table and keeps his word. I have worked with DOI for 25 years, and David is one of the finest people I have ever worked with. That didn't come from a partisan Republican or a partisan Democrat; that came from a person in the Democratic Governor's office who worked with him on natural resource issues. Dale Hall, the CEO of Ducks Unlimited, which is hardly a partisan Republican or Democratic organization but is an organization that does more real conservation work on the ground than most of the groups that have the word ``conservation'' in their names, had this to say when Mr. Bernhardt's nomination for Secretary was announced: I have known and worked with David Bernhardt for more than a decade, and we are excited to continue to work with him as the new Secretary of the Interior. His integrity in following the law is beyond reproach. David Bernhardt is a champion of conservation and the right person for the job. We urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him. Colleagues of his from his time spent working for Representative Scott McInnis, who represented Mr. Bernhardt's hometown in Colorado, swore he worked 40 hours a day, 8 days a week. Notably, during Mr. Bernhardt's tenure in his office, Representative McInnis was the House author of the bill that led to the designation of the Great Sand Dunes as being a national park. Having now worked at very senior levels in the Department of the Interior over the course of many years, there is zero question Mr. Bernhardt is qualified to do this job. Along with Mr. Bernhardt's professional career, I believe it is important to fully understand his background and the foundation of his interest in public lands, which further qualifies him for this role. Mr. Bernhardt is originally from the outskirts of the small town of Rifle, located on Colorado's Western Slope. Few places more fully embody the spirit and mission of the Agency he has been nominated to lead as Secretary with that understanding of this public land. Growing up in rural Colorado has instilled in him Western values and interests, and to this day, Mr. Bernhardt enjoys hunting, recreation, the outdoors, and fishing. Rifle is located in Garfield County, an area in which about 60 percent of the lands are public lands. Rifle was founded as a ranching community along the Colorado River, and it retains that heritage today, along with tremendous opportunities for outdoor recreation, including fishing, hiking, skiing, rafting, and rock climbing. It also sits at the edge of the Piceance Basin, an area in Colorado that has vast amounts of natural gas. Mr. Bernhardt grew up in the oil shale boom and bust and has said that the boom and bust ``has made [him] more sensitive to the potential benefits and the potential impacts, both environmental and social'' of energy development. In the 1980s, Rifle was hit by the State's oil shale crash, and he personally experienced some of the hard times that the Nation's rural communities often face in those boom and bust moments. Much like the Department of the Interior itself, Rifle is a community that is a product of its public lands and Western heritage. It is centrally located within a few miles of the iconic Grand Mesa--the world's largest flat-topped mountain--the Flat Tops Wilderness, and the Roan Plateau. It represents a home base among these public lands with there being virtually unmatched access to world-class outdoor experiences, which is why Mr. Bernhardt has such a passion for these issues. His previous experience at the Department of the Interior allowed him to fix a problem for Colorado that I was told for 8 years, under the Obama administration, was simply not fixable. As a result, in 2018, revenue that had been sitting in an account in the Federal Government for over a decade that had been owed to three counties in Colorado were distributed back to these Colorado counties and to the taxpayers who had been owed this money. How did this get solved after a decade of saying it could not be solved? It is because David Bernhardt believes you don't just push the problems that are on your front porch onto somebody else's; you find a solution and you fix it. Prior to his current position, his previous experience includes being tapped to be the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior. In 2006, by voice vote in the U.S Senate, Mr. Bernhardt was confirmed to be Solicitor. In the last Congress, he earned bipartisan support during his confirmation process to be Deputy Secretary. His integrity and ability are assets that should bolster the case for his nomination, not detract from it. Yet, over the course of the last couple of months, the Washington, DC, political smear machine has been working overtime to sully a good man's name. None of what we have seen or heard in the pages of the New York Times and in other places has been new information. I guess the hope is that we will take it more seriously because this time around, the New York Times is the one writing about it. Mr. Bernhardt has undergone two separate and extensive FBI reviews for both his nomination to be Deputy Secretary and his nomination to be Secretary. These reviews occurred after the allegations were first raised, and he was cleared for both positions, which is probably something people didn't read in the New York Times. In understanding that these claims had been reviewed previously to the Senate's committee's satisfaction, Mr. Bernhardt's nomination was reported out last week by a bipartisan vote of 14 to 6. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Chairman Murkowski's and Ranking Member Manchin's committee statements. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Statements From Senators Murkowski and Manchin From the Business Meeting To Consider Pending Nominations (04/04/2019) Senator Murkowski: (21:01) Good morning everyone. The Committee will come to order. We're meeting this morning to consider three nominations. This is for the nomination of David Bernhardt to be Secretary of Department of Interior; Susan Combs to be assistant Secretary of Interior for Policy, Management and Budget; and Aimee Jorjani to be chair of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. I believe that all three of these nominees are well-qualified and encourage all members to vote to report them favorably this morning. As I noted last week Mr Bernhardt, I believe, has the right background. He's got the right experience to be an excellent Secretary of the Interior. He has twice been confirmed to positions at Interior with bipartisan support. First, to be Solicitor in 2006 and then to be Deputy Secretary in 2017. He's most recently served as Acting Secretary since January of 2019. I understand that Mr. Bernhardt has the second most prior experience at the Department out of any nominee for secretary, is from the West-I like that-he has great familiarity with issues that will come before him, and he's proven that he can ably lead the Department. So, what everybody's talking about this morning. There is-- there are accusations about his ethics. We had this conversation last--or two weeks ago when--when his name was before us. I think it's very clear you got some pretty well funded groups that are working very hard, very energetically against his nomination. We saw new allegations last week and then this morning there is--is yet another report. And this is all--this is all coming despite--despite the government scientists involved saying that there was nothing amiss when we had that conversation last week, Senator Gardner, you certainly raised that. This week we're starting to see--we're again seeing new reporting on old allegations. I don't think that this is a coincidence, that we are seeing this kind of a roundup of reporting on old stories--and I think nonstories-- just as we're approaching the markup here. Interior's Inspector General has reviewed the matter as part of its due diligence. It has not opened an investigation. In fact, our staff checked with the Inspector General's office. We were told that there are no open investigations into Mr. Bernhardt. We have had as a committee I believe ample time to review all of these allegations. I am aware of [[Page S2403]] no substantiation of them whatsoever and frankly I would be-- I would be stunned if they were to be substantiated. I would remind members that both the Office of Government Ethics and the Designated Agency Ethics Official have found Mr. Bernhardt to be in good standing. So, again, there--there will probably be a question this morning, I would imagine, on--on the New York Times article that is out there this morning, but I would remind colleagues or ask you to look into these. These allegations again contain no new infoimation. This is recycled. It's been repackaged. They're now focusing on an invoice from Mr. Bernhardt's prior Law Firm. The law firm has said that it was labeled incorrectly. Others have said it was labeled incorrectly. It didn't concern lobbying services. We have known about this previous work that he has had at Westlands. We knew it back in 2017 when we confirmed him as Deputy Secretary. And at that time this work was not deemed lobbying. So, just because it's in the New York Times this morning doesn't mean that it's correct. It's my hope that as a committee we will--will move forward in affirming Mr. Bernhardt to be Secretary of the Interior. And then the full Senate will confirm him coming up here. I think the sooner we have a permanent Secretary at Interior, the better. Senator Manchin: (30:50) Thank you Madam Chairman and I appreciate the committee-- ensuring this committee moves forward on important nominations. We have two of those nominations before us this morning that I'm glad that we are reporting from this committee and--the nominations of Susan Combs, Assistant Secretary of Interior of Policy, Management, and Budget and the nomination of Aimee Jorjani to chair The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. I think Madam Chairman gave a good overview of that. Committee voted to--to report both of these nominations during the last Congress, but unfortunately the Senate didn't vote to confirm them before at adjourned. Each time, the committee approved the nomination by voice vote and I previously supported of both nominations and I intend to do so again this morning. On David Bernhardt. As a former governor and those who have served in executive positions, that I understand it, we've had to ask our state senators and our Oversight committees about putting in our teams together. And I've always been differential to allowing an executive to put their team together as long as the person is qualified and meets the ethical standards. There's concerns and I respect those concerns. Mr. Bernhardt, in my estimation met the test. He's clearly qualified. I think we all know that. He has the knowledge and experience to serve as Secretary, knows the Interior Department inside and out--that might be a blessing to some, maybe a concern--and he is well-versed in all the issues that come before him. I spoke with him several times before this business meeting regarding his nomination. I've reviewed his follow-up questions for the record following his hearing. He has answered all of our questions in a timely manner. We received them back and I think it's all been made record. I even talked to him earlier this week by phone again. I questioned him again, extensively, about his willingness to be a good steward of our nation's greatest natural resources, our national parks, our monuments, and all of our historical sites. I questioned him about his responsibility to balance our resource needs with environmental protection in fairness to the owners of our public lands, which is all of the American people. I spoke to him about the need to make sure that those who are granted the privilege of using our public lands leave them in better condition than what they found them in, which is not always the case and we've got to change that. And I had extensive conversation with Mr. Bernhardt regarding compliance and ethics--ethics laws and regulations, as well as his potential conflict of interest. I was very much concerned about that. Based on my extensive discussions with Mr. Bernhardt and the assurances that he has given me, I'm prepared to vote for him this morning, but I will note that I expect him and the Department, now I've put them on notice, hold them--hold them to the highest ethical standards. And I've told him that. I said because I surely will. I surely will hold him to be accountable for his actions. He must work to ensure committee and a commitment to ethical and scientific integrity and I intend to work with him and his staff persistently to ensure that this is the case. Our parks and public lands, our scenic beauty, our fish and wildlife resources are important to all of us here, to the people we represent, and my state, and in your states. And West Virginians count on the Secretary of Interior, as they do in your States also, as the guardian of our public lands. . . . I intend to work with Mr. Bernhardt these important issues. I've made it clear to him that I expect him to put his extensive experience and knowledge of these issues to work for the American people and not to people used to work for. And to execute his responsibilities in the manner that ensures that our public lands are not just being maintained, but improved. Improved for the benefit of generations to come. Thank you Madam Chair. Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, let's talk about that story and ethics for a second. Mr. Bernhardt has spent more than 15 years of a 25-year career in public service, and most of that time has been spent at the Department of the Interior. While in his private law practice, he never lobbied the Department of the Interior--not once. During his time as Deputy Secretary, he has focused on the fundamental transformation of the Department and Bureau-level ethics programs to ingrain a culture of ethical compliance and reduce workplace misconduct. The reality is that the ethics program throughout the Department of the Interior had been, sadly, neglected by the previous administration. The Office of Inspector General and the Departmental Ethics Office had recommended significant resource changes that had fallen on deaf ears under the previous administration. Under Mr. Bernhardt's direction, the Department has hired a total of 42 career professional ethics advisers. By the end of fiscal year 2019, they will have doubled the number of career ethics officials that the previous administration had hired in its entire 8 years. The record shows that he has actively sought and consulted with the Department's designated Agency ethics officials regarding compliance with his ethics obligations recusals. In addition, he has installed a robust screening process to ensure that he does not meet with or engage in particular matters benefiting the former clients from which he is recused. Every proposed meeting is reviewed by career professionals to ensure compliance with not only his ethics agreement but ethics laws and to make sure his ethics pledge to the President is upheld. His work in natural resources law prior to joining the administration and related ethics agreements are very similar in scope and substance to the private work and ethics agreements of senior Interior officials who came before him in previous administrations. Let me say that again. The same kinds of ethics agreements and obligations that basically he is doing are what previous administrations did as well. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the Department of the Interior Designated Agency Ethics Official dated March 25, 2019. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: United States Department of the Interior, Office of the Solicitor, Washington, DC, March 25, 2019. Hon. Elizabeth Warren, U.S Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Richard Blumenthal, U.S Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Warren and Senator Blumenthal: Thank you for your letter of February 26, 2019 regarding your expressed concerns of the actions of the Acting Secretary of the Department of the Interior (Department or DOI). Your letter references an article published by the New York Times on February 12, 2019 discussing the Acting Secretary's legal practice prior to joining the Department as Deputy Secretary in August 2017. Specifically, you asked about the Acting Secretary's involvement with the Central Valley Project (CVP) in California and whether his actions, ``violated his ethics pledge and federal conflict of interest regulations by participating in decisions that directly affect a former client.'' As discussed below, we have found the Acting Secretary's actions have complied with all applicable ethics laws, rules and other obligations, including the requirements of President Trump's Executive Order 13770 entitled, ``Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees'' (Jan. 28, 2017) (Ethics Pledge). As an initial matter, I would like to take this opportunity to inform you and your colleagues of recent developments and improvements with the DOI ethics program that will enhance our ability to prevent conflicts of interest at all levels of the Department. Since our arrival at the Department in April 2018, Deputy Director Heather Gottry and I have overhauled an ethics office that was previously characterized by both DOI employees and numerous Inspector General reports as passive and ineffectual. With the strong support of the Acting Secretary, we have spearheaded a long-overdue build-out of the Departmental Ethics Office (DEO) as well as the ethics programs of the various Bureaus and Offices throughout the Department. Our top priority as non-partisan, career ethics officials, is to prevent conflicts of interest at the DOI and ensure that DOI employees are aware of and comply with all applicable ethics laws and standards. We understand the importance of our program in helping the American people have trust and confidence in the lawful and proper administration of the Department. [[Page S2404]] Please know that my office takes all credible allegations of potential ethics violations by any DOI employee very seriously and allegations against senior officials are an extremely high priority. Consequently, when the New York Times published its article, I immediately sought to understand the facts and carefully analyzed the applicable legal authorities. We note that the Acting Secretary also immediately requested that my office look into this matter and to examine the prior ethics advice and counsel he had received. Of critical importance, we note that the Acting Secretary does not have any financial conflicts of interest related to either his former client, Westlands Water District, or the CVP generally. As reflected in his Ethics Agreement, dated May 1, 2017, and his Ethics Recusal memorandum, dated August 15, 2017, the Acting Secretary was required under 5 C.F.R Sec. 2635.502 to recuse for one year (until August 3, 2018) from participating personally and substantially in any ``particular matters involving specific parties'' in which Westlands Water District was a party or represented a party. Because Westlands Water District is an agency or entity of a state or local government it is excluded from the requirements of paragraph 6 of the Ethics Pledge. Additionally, consistent with U.S Office of Government Ethics (OGE) guidance, it was determined that the law the Acting Secretary had lobbied on for Westlands Water District, Public Law 114-322, should not be categorized as a ``particular matter'' because the law addressed a broad range of issues and topics. Therefore, because he did not lobby on a ``particular matter'' for Westlands Water District, he was not required to recuse himself under paragraph 7 of the Ethics Pledge either from ``particular matters'' or ``specific issue areas'' related to Public Law 114-322. Accordingly, the Acting Secretary's recusal related to Westlands Water District ended on August 3, 2018, and was limited in scope to ``particular matters involving specific parties'' under 5 C.F.R Sec. 2635.502 I have enclosed the transmittal e-mail from me to the Acting Secretary with a detailed memorandum attached wherein the DEO consolidates and memorializes prior ethics advice and guidance on certain issues involving the CVP. Of particular importance for a legal analysis of the scope of the Acting Secretary's recusals related to Westlands Water District, the memorandum analyzed and categorized certain issues involving the CVP and related State Water Project as ``matters,'' ``particular matters of general applicability,'' and ``particular matters involving specific parties.'' As I state in the transmittal e-mail, these legal categorizations are critical in determining whether an official complies with the various ethics rules. As reflected in the memorandum, we determined that both the Notice of Intent to Prepare a Draft EIS and the development of a 2019 Biological Assessment are appropriately categorized as ``matters,'' not ``particular matters.'' Our determinations are supported by Federal law and OGE opinions and though the matters involved may sound like ``particular matters'' or ``specific issue areas,'' they are legally broad matters outside the scope of 5 C.F.R Sec. 2635.502 As noted above, the Acting Secretary's lobbying on behalf of Westlands Water District on Public Law 114-322 was not categorized as a ``particular matter'' and did not require an additional recusal under paragraph 7 of the Ethics Pledge. Therefore, the Acting Secretary was not required under either 5 C.F.R Sec. 2635.502 or the Ethics Pledge to recuse from participation in either the Notice of Intent to Prepare a Draft EIS or the development of a 2019 Biological Assessment. Attached, for your convenience, please find the legal reference materials addressed in the memorandum--I believe our interpretation and application of the relevant legal authorities is both reasonable and prudent. I have advised the Acting Secretary, at his request, that he and his staff should continue to consult with the DEO prior to participating in any matter that is potentially within the scope of his Ethics Agreement, Ethics Recusal memorandum, the Ethics Pledge, or any other ethics law or regulation. Additionally, to eliminate any potential for miscommunication, I have instructed my staff that all ethics guidance to the Acting Secretary be in writing prior to his participation in a decision or action that reasonably appears to come within the purview of his legal ethics obligations. In closing, and to be responsive to your final requests, the DEO has not issued any authorizations or ethics waivers to the Acting Secretary or other Interior officials on the topics you raised, nor have we referred any matters to the IG on these topics. It is worth noting that the Acting Secretary meets with me and my senior staff frequently and that I have a standing meeting with him once a week to discuss any significant ethics issues at the DOI. Pursuant to the Acting Secretary's direction, my senior staff also meets with his scheduling staff and other top officials twice a week, at a minimum, to ensure we are aware of who the Acting Secretary is meeting with and the issues he will be discussing. These efforts, supported by the Acting Secretary and his staff, are designed to ensure his compliance with applicable ethics rules and protect the integrity of the Department's programs and operations. My experience has been that the Acting Secretary is very diligent about his ethics obligations and he has made ethics compliance and the creation of an ethical culture a top priority at the Department. If you have any other questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Scott A. de la Vega, Director, Departmental Ethics Office and Designated Agency Ethics Official. Enclosure. Mr. GARDNER. This letter is in response to a letter from Senators Warren and Blumenthal and states that the Ethics Office has found that Mr. Bernhardt's actions as Deputy Secretary and Acting Secretary ``have complied with all applicable ethics laws, rules, and other obligations, including the requirements of President Trump's executive order 13770, entitled `Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees.' '' This letter from the career head of the Department of Interior ethics professionals who served at the White House during the previous administration goes on to say: My experience has been that the Acting Secretary is very diligent about his ethics obligations and he has made ethics compliance and the creation of an ethical culture a top priority at the Department. That wasn't in the New York Times, either, but I think it should be. This is not about Mr. Bernhardt's ethics or his integrity or his qualifications; it is about the fact that he has been and will be effective at implementing an agenda that the other side doesn't agree with because they know he will be effective in protecting our great outdoors and our public lands. I am thankful there are qualified people out there like Mr. Bernhardt and his family who are still willing to wade through the muck and serve the people of the United States, knowing that they will be called a liar in front of their children at a U.S Senate committee hearing despite letters from top officers in charge of our ethics laws at the Department of Interior saying otherwise. I am thankful for David, and I look forward to working with him and his team at the Department of the Interior. I hope my colleagues will see through the partisan rancor, see through the lens of blue or red, of party politics, and confirm a man who--if you go back to Colorado and talk to people like Russell George, you will learn that he has the greatest respect not only for our public lands but for the people of Colorado, and for that, I am grateful for him and my colleagues who will confirm him today. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado. Honoring State Patrol Corporal Daniel Howard Groves Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I rise today to honor an officer of the Colorado State Patrol who was killed in the line of duty on March 13. As other Members of this Chamber know, many parts of the country were hit hard by a bomb cyclone storm system last month. Again today, we are going through another spring storm. That storm caused flooding in much of the Midwest, as we have seen across the national news, and extremely hazardous road conditions in my State, which led to thousands of stranded drivers. State Patrol Corporal Daniel Howard Groves, like many first responders that day, was attempting to aid a driver in the Eastern Plains of Colorado on I-76 who had slid off the road, and he was struck by a passing vehicle. Corporal Groves was 52 years old. He leaves behind a large and loving family, including his parents, his partner Eddie, his four siblings, and many more. We know that his family will continue to honor his sacrifice and ensure that his legacy lives on. Corporal Groves joined the Colorado State Patrol in 2007 after leaving a career in the technology services industry in Chicago. His family and friends remember him as a man with a tremendous capacity to love and care for others. He was a man of humor who wasn't afraid to crack a joke just to make people smile. According to a fellow officer, he once arrived at training wearing pajamas instead of the required police sweats. At a memorial service honoring his life, a longtime friend spoke about the encouragement and advice that Dan was known for. He always encouraged others to follow their dreams, no matter how big. He often spoke of the importance of family and friendship and the need to make time to enjoy life with others. [[Page S2405]] His fellow officers remembered him as a man who was drawn to service because of his desire to help, someone who always knew the risks inherent in the job but never let that deter him from doing what needed to be done. One colleague who spoke at the memorial remembered Corporal Groves as someone who frequently asked, where do you need me to be? He always wanted to be in the spot where he could be most effective, no matter the danger involved. Even on the morning of March 13, as the weather was taking a turn for the worse, Corporal Groves knew there were drivers on the road who needed his help, and, as many law enforcement officers did that day, he bravely ventured out to offer assistance. This quality makes for a great law enforcement officer but is sadly the quality that we most often take for granted. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Dan and to all first responders who are willing to put their lives on the line to assist those in times of need and a debt of gratitude to their families as well. I know my colleagues in the Senate will join me in offering our thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of Corporal Groves and all those who defend that thin blue line. As I have done too many times in this Chamber, I remember the words of LTC Dave Grossman, who said: ``American law enforcement is the loyal and brave sheep dog, always standing watch for the wolf that lurks in the dark.'' I drive by the spot where Corporal Groves was killed at least two or three times a week, and he will always be in my prayers, along with his family, for his sacrifice. It is my hope that the thoughts and prayers that we offer to those who wear the blue uniform will bring them comfort as they carry out their solemn duties. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott of Florida). Without objection, it is so ordered. Recognition of the Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Attorney General William Barr Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, if anyone wonders whether Attorney General Barr is a straight shooter, this week, we got our answer. Yesterday, at the Senate Appropriations Committee, the country saw another disconcerting performance by the Attorney General. In the face of serious questions surrounding the release of the Mueller report, the Attorney General did exactly what President Trump wanted: He dodged questions, peddled a conspiracy theory, and, like the President, lobbed baseless accusations. It is clear that for Mr. Barr, the title he holds is far less important than the boss he serves. What he did not say is that Russia attacked our democracy, as all 17 Agencies of our intelligence community have confirmed. What he did not say is that the intelligence community concluded that the Russians infiltrated our democracy to help Donald Trump. What he also didn't say is why he continues to wait on releasing the Mueller report. It took him less than 48 hours to summarize over 300 pages but over 2 weeks, and counting, to release the report itself. Instead of giving straight answers, Mr. Barr seems to be nothing more than a spokesperson for the President's campaign. He seems more like the President's Press Secretary than the Attorney General. He is even using the President's own tactics: Admit nothing. Deny everything. Make counteraccusations. Many of us tried to give Mr. Barr a chance, but after this week's performance, it is clear as day he and the President are working off the same playbook and planning to withhold crucial facts from the American people. What is really important is this: When Attorney General Barr issues his report, his objectivity will be in total doubt. No one will believe, when he redacts large parts of the report, that it was done on the merits; people will believe he redacted parts of the report to help President Trump. How will the American people be able to trust Mr. Barr, and how will the American people be able to believe that his version of the report is the real version when he has been so, so partisan and was willing to peddle FOX News conspiracy theories before the Appropriations Committee yesterday? When Mr. Barr was first nominated as Attorney General, the question posed to him was, would he be part of the Trump legal team or an independent agent of the law? I think we have our answer, as we watch him echo President Trump's statements and enable President Trump's worst instincts. Whether it is defending the administration's dangerous healthcare lawsuit or perpetuating conspiracy theories, Mr. Barr is acting more like a member of the President's campaign than the independent Attorney General he is supposed to be. Mr. Barr is letting down thousands--tens of thousands--of hard- working people at the Justice Department. They are doing their job. When someone is given real information that Russia interfered with our elections, of course they are supposed to look into it. That is part of their job. For Mr. Barr to label this as spying, echoing some of the worst conspiracy theorists in the country, he loses all credibility, and that credibility is vital because he will be issuing a report with redactions. When Mr. Barr issues his report, in terms of what should be redacted and what shouldn't, his objectivity will be in total doubt because of his performance yesterday. Again, how will the American people be able to trust that the Attorney General has given them the most information he can rather than the least and that he has given them a full view of what happened rather than protecting the President? People are just not going to believe it. The bottom line is that yesterday's performance calls into complete question the objectivity and even the judgment of the Attorney General. He does not seem to be an independent actor pursuing the rule of law. Rather, he seems to be somebody simply ready to help the President no matter what the price. H.R 268 Mr. President, on another matter, disaster relief, it is an absolute travesty that this Chamber is recessing without a compromise on much needed funding for disaster relief. From the start, Democrats have supported an ``all of the above'' approach to helping every part of America that is struggling from natural disasters. We need to help everyone hurt last year and everyone hurt this year--everyone hurt in Puerto Rico, everyone hurt in the Midwest, everyone hurt in Florida, and everyone hurt in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia. In the American tradition, everyone comes together when we have disasters, and we help everyone. Our Republican friends seem to have a different view. They want disaster relief that explicitly denies Puerto Rico the help it needs, even though they are American citizens like everybody else. They heard President Trump's temper tantrum at their lunch a few Tuesdays back, and they have obeyed. This is un-American. We should not be picking and choosing who gets disaster relief. When Americans suffer, we all step in. We all help. President Trump does not believe that, but where are our Senators who are standing up for this principle? The compassion of the American people is much greater than President Trump's small-minded contempt for the people of Puerto Rico. The Senate, particularly Senators from the disaster States who need that money, ought to have the courage to resist it instead of making up stories and pointing fingers of blame. Republicans have refused to present a serious solution that can pass the House and the Senate. We all know that if Puerto Rico is not treated equally, it will not be seen on the floor of the House. We all know that the Governor of Puerto Rico has said that the solution Republicans are supporting is not adequate for Puerto Rico. We all know that. It is a tragedy that the Republican leadership in this Chamber has refused to help American citizens before going into recess. They own the mess they [[Page S2406]] are creating across America, and with each passing day, the American people see it. Tax Reform Mr. President, tax day is coming up, and we have seen another travesty of the Republican Senate. When the Republicans pushed their tax scam, it was sold as a ``middle-class miracle.'' They promised it would prioritize middle- class families. President Trump and others promised Americans would get a $4,000 raise every year. That is what President Trump promised about his tax cuts. He said that his tax cuts for the very wealthy and the big corporations would benefit every American to the tune of $4,000 a year. Unsurprisingly, this Republican tax scam has now defaulted on its promise to lift up average American families. For too many Americans expecting a tax refund, they have gotten nothing or worse. After this tax season, the jig is up. In fairness, there is one part of America that has made a killing-- the very wealthy. Indeed, 83 percent of the benefits in the Republican tax bill will eventually go to the top 1 percent of earners, and the American people know it. A recent poll shows more than 60 percent of Americans believe the wealthy and corporations--big corporations--have been helped by the tax law. They are right. Unfortunately, corporations aren't using their windfalls as our Republican friends promised. They are not boosting worker pay, by and large, or increasing benefits or creating jobs. According to a recent survey, 84 percent of companies say they have not changed their plans because of the tax law. What are they doing with the money they got? They are spending billions in windfall on record corporate stock buybacks, not benefiting their workers, not benefiting their community but benefiting the CEOs of the corporations, because the shares generally go up, and benefiting the top 10 percent of America who own 85 percent of all the stocks. Unfortunately, this story doesn't end in making the rich richer. American workers are suffering while those same corporate executives and the very wealthy shareholders cash in. Take the case of CSX, a freight rail company spending billions of dollars on stock buybacks after benefiting from the tax law. Just last week, we heard CSX announce that they are laying off 100 workers in Kentucky, Leader McConnell's own backyard--not a $4,000 raise but a pink slip. You would think with all of these tax benefits that workers would benefit. It doesn't seem to be happening. That story that happened in Kentucky can be repeated throughout the country. It is hard to look at these examples with a straight face and say that the middle class factored at all into the Republican tax bill. It was a trick--no trickle down, just a trick. As Americans finish their filings this year, they will know exactly who to blame if they see their taxes go up. They will know who to blame if they don't get a refund or if they owe the IRS. The tax bill is already a stunningly unpopular piece of legislation. I don't recall a single Republican campaigning on it. It shows they weren't proud of it. After this tax season, the Republican tax bill will be even further crystalized in the minds of everyday Americans as a scam that left them out to dry while soaking the ultrawealthy with even more wealth. Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. President, on Mr. Bernhardt, yesterday, I sat down with David Bernhardt, President Trump's choice for Secretary of the Interior, and I pressed him on some things that we should all know before we vote on his confirmation. I asked Mr. Bernhardt: Do you agree that climate change is real, caused by humans, and that we must act? I asked Mr. Bernhardt if he will commit to not opening up the waters off our coasts to harmful drilling, even off the coasts of States opposed to such drilling, and what he will do about his well-documented web of conflicting interests. I got no answers to these questions. I remind all of my colleagues on the Atlantic coast that, again, I asked him to at least commit that he will not do drilling off the shores of States that didn't want drilling off their shores. He would not commit to that, and there is word that there is a plan in the Interior Department to allow that to happen. This is the same administration that promised to clean the swamp and rid Washington of corruption. Yet it is a twisted parody to think that President Trump wants an oil and gas lobbyist to lead the Department of the Interior. What a contradiction. What a betrayal. It doesn't stop there. Bernhardt reportedly participated in efforts to launch a White House climate denial panel, the sole purpose of which was to rebuke accepted science. We cannot allow the work of our Federal Agencies to fall into the hands of people like this. It is hard to imagine someone whose background is so at odds with the Department's mission as Bernhardt's. In good conscience, I cannot vote in favor of his confirmation. For the same reasons, I urge all of my fellow Senators, particularly those along the coasts, to vote against this nomination to protect their shoreline and their beaches. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina. Remembering Fritz Hollings Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on behalf of Senator Hollings' passing, along with my colleague Senator Scott from South Carolina. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. Mr. President, Senator Scott and I have come to the floor today to recognize a legend in South Carolina and this body, Senator Fritz Hollings, who passed away on April 6 in Isle of Palms, SC. He was 97. He loved Isle of Palms. That was his place to be. He was born in Charleston, SC, in 1922. He graduated from the Citadel in 1942. He attended the University of South Carolina School of Law. He served as an artillery officer in World War II, earned a Bronze Star, and finished with the rank of captain. He was in the State house of representatives from 1949 to 1954. He became our Governor in 1958 at age 36. He shepherded South Carolina through the turbulent times of the civil rights movement. He urged the legislature to follow the law after Brown v. Board of Education. He established the best technical college system in the country. We say that with great pride. It was Fritz Hollings who was the father of the South Carolina technical college system, which has resulted in thousands of jobs being created and educational opportunity for millions in our State. When he was a Senator, they called him the Senator from central casting. He looked the part, he acted the part, and he sounded the part. He was the junior Senator for 36 years, I think, in South Carolina, with Senator Thurmond being the senior Senator. When Senator Thurmond retired, I was honored to be able to take his place, and Fritz was my senior Senator for 2 years. I just want to thank him and recognize what he did for me to become established in the Senate. He was kind. He was gracious. We did not agree on policy, but he could not have been a better friend. I spent half of my time trying to interpret what he was saying on the floor. I caught about every third word. He has this Charleston accent that even I couldn't understand at times. Nobody enjoyed their job more than Senator Hollings. Nobody was ever better at it. When it came to South Carolina, Senator Hollings was able to move mountains. He was the chairman of the Commerce Committee and the Budget Committee. He was one of the great environmentalists of our time. The ACE Basin in South Carolina is a beautiful place along the coast where three major rivers come together. It was Senator Hollings who established that, now and forever to be preserved. He helped establish NOAA, which has done so much for our oceans. He was part of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget Act. He was always trying to keep our fiscal house in order. He was a champion of the military. Being a World War II veteran himself, he always looked out for those in uniform. Senator Thurmond and Hollings were giants of their time, and they [[Page S2407]] really made a difference for our State and for the country as a whole. When it comes to his distinguished career in the Senate, Fritz Hollings was at the top of anybody's list. He served for 38 years. He was a tireless advocate for the hungry--for hunger. He was trying to combat hunger and poverty before it was cool. He traveled all over this world to try to spread the good news about America. After Senate life, he established the Hollings Center for International Dialogue to create exchanges in dialogue between the United States and mostly Muslim populations. He was ahead of his time there. For us to win this war on terror, we have to side with people in the faith who reject radical Islam, which the overwhelming majority of people reject, and Fritz understood that. He was a great husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He was my friend. He had the eighth longest tour of duty in the U.S Senate in the history of the body. Yesterday, with Senator Scott's help, we passed a resolution unanimously--every Senator signed on--honoring the service of Senator Hollings. There are so many friends of his in this body. The staff and former Senators all will tell you that Fritz was a force of nature. He had strong opinions. He would share them with you whether you asked him or not. He knew what he was talking about. He was prepared. He was a fighter for his causes. He was willing to die for his country. Now he has passed, and the legacy for the people of South Carolina will be enduring. Our beaches and our oceans and our mountains and our rivers are better off for his service. Our educational system stands out on the technical school side because of his vision. He shepherded us through very turbulent times during the civil rights movement, where other States were literally on fire. South Carolina had problems, but they paled in comparison to most because of Senator Hollings' leadership. He was a lawyer. He loved the law. He was my friend. Senator Scott is from Charleston, and both of us have a tough act to follow when it comes to being Senators in South Carolina. Senator Hollings' way was to fight for your causes, work across the aisle, know what you are talking about before you speak, and try to do it with good humor. What more can you say? From the time he was a young man in Charleston until he passed away on April 6, he was always fighting for his causes. He loved his State. He delivered for the people of South Carolina. When it comes to the Senate, he was a legend. His presence was felt up here. His legacy is enduring. He fought the good fight. He was a faithful servant, and now he will enjoy an eternal rest. To his family, I know you are grieving, but you have much to be proud of. To the people of South Carolina, it is not about being a Republican or a Democrat in terms of service; it is about how much you love your State. No Republican and no Democrat ever loved South Carolina more than Fritz Hollings, and no Senator has ever made more of a difference than Senator Hollings. So Senator Scott and I will do our best to keep up this good man's legacy. We will have different policy choices, and we will go down a different political path, but we will be ever mindful of the way we do our job. The way we do our job matters as much as what you do. Let it be said that when it came to doing his job, Fritz Hollings did it professionally, effectively, and with love and passion. I now yield to Senator Scott of South Carolina. Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. President, I thank Senator Graham for yielding to me. Without any question, I think Senator Graham did such a great job of distilling the life and some of the accomplishments of Senator Hollings. Without any question, I cannot imagine Mr. Graham spending 36 years or so as a junior Senator from the great State of South Carolina because of the long tenure of the senior Senator, Strom Thurmond, whose seat you have. I have the privilege of being in the seat of Senator Hollings, who, of course, is from Charleston, as I am from Charleston. I think of the commonalities we all share as South Carolinians, and certainly ones who are not--all of us from South Carolina understand how hard it is to understand those folks who speak in the old Charleston brogue, the language of Senator Hollings and folks like our cousin, Arthur Ravenel, who shares the same inflection in his voice. Senator Graham brought back some very fond memories with his thoughts. To the family, the Hollings family, we certainly extend our condolences. I had the chance to speak with Michael, his son, just the other day, and the family is doing well. The family is encouraged by the outpouring of love and support from so many folks from the Senate and throughout the country because Senator Hollings was not only a South Carolina Senator, he was America's Senator. He spent a lot of time doing a lot of things that made a significant difference. I do want to put a little meat on the bones. As Senator Graham has covered so much of what I would have said, I will not say it twice. I will, perhaps, drill into a few of the times of service Senator Hollings had. As we think through the 1960s and as we read through the 1960s, we read through a time of volatility, a time where our Nation is clashing with one another, where the races were so divided. In the Deep South, we perhaps led in that direction of conflict. We have a provocative history on race in South Carolina. Without any question, Senator Hollings did what so many others did not do, which is, he led for a peaceful integration of what is today one of America's great public universities, Clemson University. I say that as a South Carolina fan, without any question, but it is no doubt that Harvey Gantt, being the first African American in Clemson to graduate from Clemson, was a monumental shift in southern education, one we can all celebrate today. I went to church with Harvey Gantt's family for 20-plus years at Morris Street Baptist Church in Charleston, SC, and I will say that, perhaps as a part of the springboard of controversy and challenge and conflict, it led to a level of greatness in Harvey Gantt's life as he took arrows that most of us are unfamiliar with. Senator Hollings-- then-Governor Hollings--took arrows that some would be unfamiliar with in making the decision to ask for and to encourage and support a peaceful transition in a State at the time broiled in controversy. Harvey Gantt went on, of course, to be the first African-American mayor of the city of Charlotte, NC. In thinking about Senator Graham's comments as it relates to the technical college system in South Carolina, how Senator Hollings birthed that for our State, that may sound like a good accomplishment, but for a State that faced extinction from an economic standpoint, when industries were leaving our State, the technical college system became the springboard, once again, for the great city of South Carolina to see a rebirth of our economic systems. What we have today is a manufacturing haven whose foundation is the technical college system. When we think about companies like BMW, Boeing, Volvo, Mercedes, Bosch, Michelin, Bridgestone, all these companies became a part of the corporate family in South Carolina because we had a healthy, thriving technical college system born because of the leadership of Senator Hollings. Senator Hollings not only succeeded in public life, but he also succeeded in his private life. I will tell you that I cannot imagine the reunion between Senator Hollings and his wife, Peatsy, of over 40 years. I can't imagine the celebration that is happening in Heaven as those two are being reunited and spending time talking about what has occurred over their lifetimes and the things they had to see. There is an amazing Greek proverb that I want to end with, as it relates to Senator Hollings, that says that a society grows when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit under. Senator Graham and I, the youngsters, comparatively speaking to Senator Hollings and Senator Thurmond--we are sitting under the shade of that tree. Our Nation benefits from people who have the wisdom to look forward, beyond their lifetime, and create a country where we all benefit. Tax Reform Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I do want to spend a few minutes [[Page S2408]] talking about what is an obvious day in our near future--tax day. Americans from coast to coast are thrilled with the opportunity to finish their taxes. I say that with the poorest tongue in cheek. I will say that without any question I am excited about this tax season because of the success of our tax reform in December 2017. It is exciting to think about the benefits to so many families throughout this country because of the successful passage of the tax reform bill in December 2017. I stood on the floor and listened to other speakers talk about how perhaps the tax reform package has not delivered consistent with the promises made during the debate. I would like to put some meat on those bones as well. When you think about the average family who has kids, the doubling of the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and allowing for more refundability to happen because of the child tax credit being increased, more families today are healthier because of the doubling of the child tax credit, which is good news. When you think about the size of the refund, $2,873 is, in fact, consistent with the refunds of years gone by, which, once again, reinforces the fact that the tax reform bill has presented itself in a positive way and produced results consistent with what we suggested. Because if you get the same refund you had last time--about--but you have more money in your take-home pay every payday during 2018, you actually can measure the success of the tax reform by looking at how many dollars you had in your paycheck in 2018 versus 2017, even if your employer did not give you a raise. So the success of our package is without question. I would like to suggest that as you think about folks like me, and perhaps others in this body who were raised by single parents, a single mom in 2018 with two children did not have a Federal tax burden at all until her income hit over $54,000. That is important, and it is powerful for a specific reason. The average single mother makes around $40,000 a year, not $54,000. That means that for the average single mother in America, because of the success of our tax reform package, her Federal tax burden is down to zero. That is not just good news, that is great news. I know it personally because of a single mother who worked 16 hours a day trying to keep food on the table. Having doubled the child tax credit and having lowered her taxes by doubling the standard deduction from $9,300 to $18,000, what we see for the single mom is hope and a light at the end of the tunnel that is not a train. This is good news. Not only is it good news, but some have talked about our plan--we have defaulted on our mission to help the American people. I suggest that as opposed to defaulting on our mission, what we heard from others is that they are deflated because of the success of our mission. During the previous administration, GDP growth averaged somewhere around 2 percent. In 2018, we saw a 3.1-percent GDP growth. What does that mean for the average person? What it means for the average person is that for the first time in a long time, more than a decade, we saw their wages grow over 3 percent. So not only did their wages grow over 3 percent, but, more importantly, they had more jobs--actually, not just more jobs. This is really good news. They had more jobs. So many more jobs are open today than people looking for work. In other words, if you think about the number of folks looking for work, the number of openings exceeds that number. That is a transformation in this country in a way we have very seldom seen or experienced. There is even more good news to that. Our unemployment rate is down to nearly a 50-year low, 3.8 percent. So if we are asking ourselves what these corporations did with the money, we are seeing the evolution or the manifestation of what happened with these extra resources by seeing the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. Now, that is not just true for America as a whole, it is true for the subgroups within America who have been challenged and sometimes excluded from the workforce. The African-American unemployment rate is around 7 percent over the last 2 years. You have to compare that to, under the previous administration, an unemployment rate of around 12 percent. The Hispanic unemployment is near 5 percent. You have to compare that to a 50- percent increase under the previous administration. We have seen perhaps the greatest renaissance in our country, economically, than we have seen in 20 years, and much of it is due to tax reform being passed. Embedded in the tax reform package was my signature legislation that I am so excited about, the opportunity zones legislation, that is having a transformative impact and effect throughout the poorest, most distressed communities in all of our country. Somewhere around 8,000 opportunity zones have been designated by the Governors in collaboration with the mayors. Mr. President, as a former Governor, you understand better than most of us the process by which one went through in order to establish the zones and the potential of those zones in the most distressed communities in each of the States. There is good news. The good news is, in places like my home State of South Carolina, is a logistics company named DHL that drives those little yellow vans that ship some of your packages across the country. They are investing $100 million in a distribution and warehouse park, creating nearly 500 jobs in Dorchester County, and they have said the Federal opportunity zone designation was a factor DHL weighed in making this location decision. In Washington State, the Vancouver Downtown Redevelopment Authority president said: ``It's an absolute no-brainer, and a real gift from the federal government and will give us a real shot in the arm in these areas''--these challenged, distressed communities. In Vegas, the largest opportunity zone expo in the Nation is being held next month with some of the biggest names across the country trying to figure out how they can reinvest their resources in areas where they were unwilling to take a second look, because now the incentive is good enough, and we did so without more bureaucrats and without government money. These are private-sector dollars being deployed in some of the most distressed communities. In the Midwest, up to 3,000 jobs are on the way to East Chicago, and a local foundation is looking to invest $800 million in a solar farm in Flint, MI. There are so many other States with amazing projects that I would run out of time talking about those. I will close with two thoughts. One is from Mayor Bowser of DC. She had a March Madness event for opportunity zones, and she attracted 400- plus folks who are interested in investing and seeing the results of the investments in the local community here in DC. For folks on the left and on the right, African Americans, Hispanics, Whites, Asians, this is a policy that brings America together. Whether you live in the most affluent communities or the most distressed communities, Americans are looking at opportunity zones as a way to have a conversation with each other. If there is one thing that we all would agree upon, it is that America needs to talk a little more with each other in a civil way about fairness and opportunity. One of the reasons why I started my national opportunity tour is to highlight some of the successes--from Miami, with my good friend Marco Rubio, to Boston, New Hampshire, and West Virginia, with Senator Capito, to Iowa, with Senator Ernst, and Colorado, Arizona, and so many other places. I look forward to continuing the conversation and distilling the benefits of the opportunity zones over the next few months. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am honored to be cochairing the Entrepreneurship Caucus with the Senator from South Carolina. He is right that there are some great examples of people who want to get businesses started and who want to pursue their dreams, and we need to highlight those because we have a lot of people who right now have some great new ideas. If we are going to continue to be a country that is an incubator for those ideas, then, we have to promote those ideas and allow those people to follow their dreams. [[Page S2409]] Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. President, I am here today to join many of my colleagues in discussing the nomination of David Bernhardt to be Secretary of the Department of the Interior. I have serious concerns about many of the actions that Mr. Bernhardt has taken while serving as both Deputy Secretary of the Department, since 2017, and as Acting Secretary, since the resignation of Secretary Zinke in January. Some of the most concerning actions include defending the administration's budget request, which zeroed out funding for the newly reauthorized Land and Water Conservation Fund; rolling back protections for public lands, including proposals to reduce the size of some of our national monuments; limiting opportunities for public input into Agency rulemakings; and weakening enforcement of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. These actions have threatened the responsible and sustainable management of our public lands, imperiled laws designed to protect and conserve wildlife, and stacked the deck in favor of fossil fuel industries. One particular area that I would like to focus on today is how Mr. Bernhardt has played a role in the Department of the Interior's decisions to rescind Obama-era climate and conservation policies that directed Agency employees to minimize the environmental impact of activities on Federal land. In a secretarial order published just before Christmas in 2017, which was signed by Mr. Bernhardt, the Department limited how its employees at sub-Agencies, like the Bureau of Land Management, can factor climate and environmental effects into their decision making. What does this mean, exactly? Well, it means that manuals, handbooks, and other lists of best practices that were compiled by Agency employees over the years--career Agency employees-- that were meant to minimize activities that would harm species or accelerate climate change were thrown out or their instructions were rendered obsolete. Mr. Bernhardt has not only downplayed climate science and prevented efforts to mitigate it within the Department of the Interior, but he has also advanced policy and rulemakings that will accelerate its effect. We all know what we are up against here with climate change. We have seen the weather events throughout the country--the heating of our ocean waters; the increase in hurricanes; the predictions of how many metropolitan areas are going to be experiencing significant flooding in just the next few decades; the wildfires that we have seen in Arizona, Colorado, and California; and the video of the dad in Northern California driving his daughter through lapping wildfires, leaving their house burning behind them as they drove and he sang to her to calm her down. Those are the big effects and the little effects, but Americans know this is happening. So the question is not, Is it happening? We know it is because every one of these things was predicted by our scientists and was predicted by our military. The question is, What do we do about it? That is why I am so opposed to the administration's decision to get out of the international climate change agreement, and I am opposed to its decision to get us out of the Clean Power rules that we had just started to put forward and to implement, and why I am opposed to the decision it made to reverse the gas mileage standards. Unfortunately, Mr. Bernhardt has not only downplayed climate change, but he has also helped, as I said, to advance policy that accelerates it. For example, in September 2018, the Bureau of Land Management announced a draft rule that would relax the Obama-era methane rules that regulated flared, leaked, and vented natural gas from oil and gas operations on Federal and Tribal lands. Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas that according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has an impact that is 34 times greater over a 100-year period than carbon dioxide. It is also important to remember that these proposed rescissions to methane rules are in direct opposition and run counter to the Senate's vote in 2017 to reject an effort at full repeal under the Congressional Review Act. Instead of going backward, we should be taking real action to combat climate change. We need a comprehensive approach to greenhouse gas emissions, and we need energy efficient technologies and homegrown energy resources. I also believe, as I noted, that we should reinstate the Clean Power rules and the gas mileage standards. Under Mr. Bernhardt's leadership, the Department of the Interior has been taking us in the wrong direction on climate, conservation, and public lands. I will oppose his nomination. Nomination of David Steven Morales Mr. President, before I conclude, I wish to make brief remarks on the nomination of David Morales to be a Federal judge for the Southern District of Texas, who was just confirmed yesterday evening. Yesterday the Senate began its consideration on this nomination at 4 p.m and voted on the confirmation around 6 p.m Under the new rules, we had just about 2 hours of time on the Senate floor to debate the nomination for a lifetime appointment to the Federal judiciary. I would have liked to have made these comments before that time. But with these severe limits, it is very difficult for Senators, if they have other obligations within the building or constituent visits or hearings going on, to be able to make it within the 2-hour period that we are now allowed, which is actually a 1-hour period. There was much more to be concerned about with respect to this nominee, which is why I am making these comments now. To name one example, during his time in the Texas Attorney General's Office, he has participated in cases that have undermined American voting rights. In 2007 he submitted an amicus brief before the Supreme Court in support of an Indiana voter ID law. The brief argued that requiring voters to have photo IDs was only ``a negligible burden on the right to vote.'' They should ask that of some of our seniors in Minnesota who have voted for decades and decades and decades and are well-known by election officials and, in our State, are able to show up at the voting booth and be able to vote or maybe they don't have a driver's license because they no longer drive. These are examples that go on across the United States. In many States that have these restrictions, these people are literally turned away from voting. It is one of the reasons that the voters of my State turned away a proposal that was on our ballot to have these restrictive photo-ID requirements. It sounds good, but then when you really look under the hood, you find that it limits voting. It was especially difficult for people in our rural areas and our seniors to accept this change, and they didn't. We also know that voter ID laws have a disproportionate impact on voters who are low income, racial and ethnic minorities, elderly, and people with disabilities. The nominee also defended Texas's ban on same-sex marriage. In 2010 he signed on to a brief arguing that Texas had a right to ban same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court rejected similar arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, which found that the Constitution guarantees the right to marry for same-sex couples. These issues are about how our democracy functions and about treating people equally under the law and with respect. It is the Senate's constitutional responsibility to give its advice and consent on lifetime nominees to the Federal bench. These nominations are too important to turn the Senate into a mere rubberstamp. The Senate must maintain its role as a meaningful check and balance in our constitutional system, and I join my colleagues in expressing my deep concern about the pace at which we are confirming these nominees. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. S. 1116 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Thank you, Mr. President. Today I rise to speak about the legislation I introduced to the Senate this week, S. 1116, the BROWSER ACT. [[Page S2410]] Broadband or high-speed internet has absolutely revolutionized the way we communicate, the way we conduct commerce, and actually the way we participate in government. Broadband is one of the greatest innovations in history. It allows near-instantaneous exchange of information and brings efficiencies to the daily life of millions of Americans as they move more of their transactional life online. Thanks to broadband, entrepreneurs have been able to bring thousands of new applications to consumers. These edge services are now an essential part of our lives. We find ourselves every day saying: I can't imagine what we did before we had this or before we had that. These apps give consumers access to entertainment, news, information, helping us drive around town, and access to emergency services. As consumers use these applications, they generate massive amounts of data about themselves, and that is the problem. Many companies collect this data and use it for a range of purposes without the user's knowledge. They are collecting all of this--every bill you pay, every website you visit, these platforms are following you. After all this information is shared, the question is, Who owns the virtual you? Who owns you and your presence online? Our laws have not kept pace with technological innovation. Now we see some States and we even have some cities that are adding more complexity to the problem by enacting their own privacy rules and standards, despite the fact that digital commerce is not restricted to one area. Digital commerce is interstate and global in nature. It is time we have a consistent national law regarding online privacy. We need one set of rules and one regulator for the entire internet ecosystem. It just makes sense. That is why I have introduced the legislation I previously proposed as a Member of the House of Representatives. As I said, it is called the BROWSER Act. Americans want to be certain their privacy is protected in the physical and the virtual space. Broadband users--who are each and every one of us--should have the right to say who can or cannot access their private data. Think about it. At this point, how and when you pay your bills, the credit cards you use, the sites you visit, the merchandise you shop for, friends you connect with, there is somebody tracking that activity with every move of the mouse. They are on it. Consumers should have the right to clear and conspicuous notice of a service providers' privacy policies and the ability to either opt in or opt out, depending on the sensitive nature of that data. The BROWSER Act requires digital services to provide users with clear and conspicuous notice of their privacy rights. It also requires digital services to provide users the ability to opt in to the collection of sensitive information while also giving users the ability to opt out of the collection of nonsensitive information. By allowing for a clear and conspicuous notification process, consumers will be able to make a more educated choice about the nature of the relationship they want to have with online vendors and with tech companies. Furthermore, the BROWSER Act will prohibit digital services from denying their service to users who refuse to waive their personal privacy rights. The BROWSER Act also empowers the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, to enforce these rules using its unfair or deceptive acts or practices authorities. Now the Federal Trade Commission has been our privacy regulator in both the physical and the online space. Just this week, Senator Klobuchar and I sent a letter to the FTC urging stronger action for bad actors in the tech space. Companies like Facebook and Google have transformed society in revolutionary ways and need to recognize that with that great power comes great responsibility. This is the 21st century; it is not the Wild West. These tech companies need to be respectful of your privacy rights. My hope is that through this bipartisan effort, we will shed light on the need to protect competition and online privacy to keep up with the fast-paced changes in technology. The FTC has a responsibility to hold tech companies accountable for securing their platforms. We need them to step up and be the cop on the beat in the virtual space. Before I yield the floor, I want to make one last point. The BROWSER Act treats everyone in broadband and edge companies exactly the same-- one regulator, one set of rules. This is common sense. Unfortunately, yesterday, Democrats in the House passed a bill to regulate broadband service providers, but they didn't do anything to Big Tech. They didn't do anything about privacy with Google, with Facebook, with Yahoo--these people who collect your data and sell it to the highest bidder; then that person markets back to you. When I chaired the Communications and Technology Subcommittee in the House, I repeatedly offered to work with the other side of the aisle to preserve a free and open internet. I am always happy to work together to find a legislative solution and put this so-called net neutrality issue to rest once and for all. Rather than work together on this, the House pushed through a hyperpartisan bill to reinstate a controversial, heavyhanded regulation of communication companies, but--heaven forbid-- they do not want to touch Big Tech, their big buddies. I am so grateful Leader McConnell has said that this bill coming from the House is dead on arrival in the Senate. I look forward to continuing to work on this issue. But here is what my friends across the aisle and my friends over in the House need to realize: The internet is not broken. The internet is not broken. Many of you probably have an electronic device close at hand. It is working just fine. The internet does not need the intervention of Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats. It is fine. It is going to be just fine by itself. In fact, as an alternative, we could just strike out the text of the House-passed bill and insert the BROWSER Act in its place--one set of rules for the entire internet ecosystem, one set of rules enforced by one Federal regulator. That is the BROWSER Act. It is about fairness. It is about encouraging innovation. It is about making certain we keep a free and open internet. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The majority leader. Order of Business Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the postcloture time on the Bernhardt nomination expire at 1:45 p.m today. I further ask that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Vehicle Innovation Act Mr. PETERS. Madam President, transportation is responsible for roughly two-thirds of our national consumption of petroleum and one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. But imagine a future where we could produce low-cost, secure clean energy technologies to move people and goods easily across our Nation. Imagine if we could then sell our advanced American technology and products to the rest of the world. Well, that is a future, by working together, we can indeed achieve. There is no question that the cars and trucks of the future can be equipped with technology to make them safer and more fuel efficient while also saving consumers money. Rapidly emerging technology has the potential not only to reduce air emissions, but their development could also create jobs in Michigan and across the Nation, and these are jobs that cannot be outsourced. We must ensure that the United States leads the way in developing these innovations. That is why I reintroduced the bipartisan Vehicle Innovation Act with my colleagues Senator Alexander and Senator Stabenow. The Vehicle Innovation Act promotes research and development investments in clean vehicle and advanced safety technologies. The bill also modernizes [[Page S2411]] the Vehicle Technologies Office within the Department of Energy, which exists to help create and sustain American leadership in the transition to a global clean energy economy. This office's leadership has already led to improvements in engine efficiency through vehicle weight reductions and reduced fuel production costs, and the Vehicle Innovation Act will help ensure that these continued innovations move forward. I am proud to again partner on this bill with Senator Alexander and fellow Michigander, Senator Debbie Stabenow. In the last Congress, we were able to pass the Vehicle Innovation Act through the Senate. Now, with fellow Michigan delegation Members, Congresswomen Debbie Dingell and Haley Stevens, leading this bill in the House, there is no reason this legislation should not be enacted into law. The bill is supported by labor, by industry, and by conservation groups, including the United Auto Workers, the Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association, the Auto Alliance, the BlueGreen Alliance, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. America should lead the world in clean energy advancements, and I urge my colleagues to support the Vehicle Innovation Act. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. Border Security Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, while many folks in Washington, DC, remain ambivalent about what is happening along the southern border, I am here to report that we are reaching a breaking point. Every month, Customs and Border Protection releases the total number of people who attempt to cross the southern border. The total includes those who cross illegally between the ports of entry, as well as those deemed inadmissible at a port of entry. Just to give you an idea of the size and scope of the numbers we have been dealing with in the past, since June 2014--the month that President Obama referred to this as a ``humanitarian crisis''--more than 66,000 individuals were encountered along the border. At that time, we thought 66,000 was a huge number, but it pales in comparison to what we are seeing now. Last month, more than 103,000 people attempted to illegally cross the border. That is 103,000 up from 76,000 the previous month. A few weeks ago, I know we got into a debate about what did and did not constitute an emergency or a crisis at the border. I don't care whether you call it a crisis or an emergency, but the entire system is breaking, and it is unsustainable. This is the highest number of people who has attempted to enter the country that we have seen since 2007. The mind-boggling figure represents the strain that is being felt by the personnel--those being U.S Government employees--whether they be Border Patrol or Customs or whoever is trying to manage the influx of the migrants. The men and women of the CBP lack both the manpower and the facilities to appropriately respond. The already understaffed Agency is reassigning personnel to try to make do, but 40 percent of the Border Patrol's manpower is spent processing migrants and providing care and transportation, and many of the agents are taken off their patrol lines to do this work, which leaves areas of the border vulnerable to exploitation by drug cartels and others. The detention centers at which these migrants are housed and processed are relatively small facilities that are not designed for these kinds of huge numbers. They were originally built to house single adults for a short period of time, but the skyrocketing number of unaccompanied children and family units is now putting a serious strain on those resources. Last month alone, there were more than 53,000 families and nearly 9,000 unaccompanied children who were apprehended at the border--53,000 families and 9,000 unaccompanied children. Customs and Border Protection simply lacks the facilities to hold these children, and it lacks the personnel to provide appropriate care. Do we really want the Border Patrol handing out juice boxes and diapers as opposed to interdicting dangerous drugs and other contraband that come into the United States? I don't think so. We know they are desperately asking for additional detention space and staff to be able to manage the migrants who are in custody. Why is it so important they be detained? It is because, if we engage in the practice that has come to be known as catch and release, then it is doubtful we will ever see these migrants again, even though they will be notified of their time to appear in front of immigration judges months--maybe even years--into the future. They will simply melt into the landscape. If they were to have bona fide reasons to claim asylum but were to fail to appear for their hearings in front of immigration judges, they will have waived those rights and be deported if they are ultimately located in the United States. We know customs inspectors have been reassigned from their duties at ports of entry to do things like process migrants and provide transportation. With fewer customs agents on the job, you are now seeing lengthy delays at the ports and checkpoints along the entire border. In what is just right across from El Paso, TX, truckers have been reported as sleeping in their vehicles for hours and sometimes days so they will not lose their spots in line. I have heard from some of the car manufacturers that require there be a flow of their supply chains into Mexico and vice versa, so they are literally hiring aircraft to fly from Juarez to El Paso because that 11-minute flight is faster than a trucker waiting 24 hours in line. Also, when many of our car manufacturers that depend on just-in-time inventory can't get their inventory just in time but have to wait 24 hours, it disrupts their manufacturing lines and endangers their businesses. Of course, it is easy to see how this could have a ripple effect on the entire border and the American economy. This slowdown isn't just affecting businesses along the border; it has businesses across the country worried. Mexican products feed the supply chain for many manufacturers in the United States, and these slowdowns affect production. While folks who live far away from the border may have just chosen to look the other way until now, they don't have a choice anymore. The system is breaking. The ripples will soon be felt across the country unless Members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, work together and are serious about enacting a solution. We know what we need to do, but politics is preventing us from getting it done. It is time to provide our frontline officers and agents with the personnel, the resources, and the legal authorities they need in order to do the jobs we have asked them to do. Yet, without support from Congress, we are sending them into a losing battle, and we are setting our economy up for a disaster. GEAR UP for Success Act Madam President, on another matter, when the Senate is in recess next week, I, like most of our colleagues here, will be running to my State to talk to my constituents and to hopefully listen to what they have to say. As I travel from El Paso to Laredo, some of the things I will be talking about will include the GEAR UP for Success Act with students, teachers, and school administrators. GEAR UP seeks to increase college and career readiness for underrepresented and low-income students. It currently serves about 600,000 students nationwide, and Texans have benefited from the $885 million in GEAR UP grants over the last 20 years. I am glad I have had a chance to visit with some of my constituents in San Antonio and Harlingen about this bill and the incredible impact that GEAR UP grants have had on their students. I guess I didn't fully appreciate the fact that students really have to begin deciding in the seventh grade what their courses of study will be because, if they don't take the required courses, or the prerequisite courses, or the other courses they are going to need in order to graduate or to get into college, they may miss the boat entirely. Many of these students come from families whose parents have never attended college or who may be unaware of the requirement to plan in order for their children to make the right course selections early on as opposed to their waiting until their junior or senior year to begin to think about where to apply to college. This legislation would allow school districts to better cater to their students' specific needs rather than to use [[Page S2412]] a one-size-fits-all program, and it would reduce the local cost share required by half. I am eager to hear from my constituents in El Paso and Laredo and to talk about what else we can do in Washington to promote college and career readiness. In a tight labor market with a booming economy, one of the things we hear about the most back home is the fact that employers can't find adequately trained workers for the jobs that are available and return a good wage. So it is important that we continue to do everything we can not only to promote education generally but also to promote career readiness for many of the well-paying jobs that are going wanting for the lack of qualified workers. Jenna Quinn Law Madam President, I will also take some time to visit the Center for Child Protection in Austin to discuss the Jenna Quinn Law. This would authorize grants for training students, teachers, and caregivers on identifying and reporting child sexual abuse. The bill is named for a courageous Texan and is modeled after successful reforms in my State. It is another great example of how we are working to bring the successful Texas model to the national level. B-21 Strategic Bomber Madam President, finally, I will visit Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, TX, with my friend and colleague, Congressman Jodey Arrington, for a briefing on its latest operations and the recent news from the Air Force that Dyess will be receiving the B-21--the next generation of strategic bombers. Dyess is the most dynamic bomber base in the country, and I am glad the Air Force has chosen the future home for the B-21 squadrons as well as weapons instruction courses and test squadrons. It just makes a lot of sense. I look forward to spending time at home with my constituents. These conversations drive my work in the Senate, and I am eager to get more feedback on how these bills could make positive changes in their lives and in the lives of all of my constituents in the State. Remembering Lieutenant Colonel Richard Cole Madam President, on one final matter, this week, Texas lost a true hero. Lt. Col. Richard Cole passed away on Tuesday at the ripe old age of 103 in my hometown of San Antonio. For Texans and for so many Americans, Lieutenant Colonel Cole--or ``Dick'' as his friends and brothers in arms called him--symbolized one of the most remarkable groups from the greatest generation in World War II--the Doolittle Raiders. The group is named for then-Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle, who, in April of 1942, fearlessly led 16 B-25 bombers and 80 crew members on a strike that targeted factories and military installations in and around Tokyo. This was actually Dick's first mission, and he was Jimmy Doolittle's copilot. After the attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, this mission was not just of tactical importance--it was a major morale boost for our Nation. Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein recently said: Those 80 intrepid airmen changed the course of history. They executed a one-way mission without hesitation and against enormous odds. The mission was, as you might imagine, perilous. Doolittle's Raiders took off from the USS Hornet with barely enough runway to get airborne. In fact, Doolittle and Cole's aircraft only had 467 feet with which to take off in an aircraft that was not designed to launch from an aircraft carrier. The airplanes inadvertently took off 170 miles further from Japan than they had planned, so they had insufficient fuel to make it to their landing fields in China. As a result, Dick--then 26 and having had limited experience in jumping out of an aircraft--had to leap out of his B-25 into unknown territory. He later reported that he gave himself a black eye when he pulled the ripcord and finally landed in the branches of a tree, where he spent the night, dangling. He later said: They don't give a Purple Heart for self-inflicted injuries. I gave myself a black eye. Yet his heroism was certainly rewarded. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his role in the bombing as well as the Bronze Star and the Air Medal. Then, in 2015, Dick and his fellow Raiders received the Congressional Gold Medal. These men, as you might imagine, shared an incredible bond, and their lasting camaraderie was evident through one special tradition they shared. At each reunion, the crew would share a cognac in silver goblets. Each goblet was engraved with a Raider's name both right-side up and right-side down. After toasting to the men who had died since their last reunion, they would flip over the goblets of those who had passed away. At their final reunion in 2013, only four Raiders were left. After determining that this would be the final reunion due to their ages and travel limitations, Dick delivered the last toast. Now his silver goblet will be turned over just as it was for the 79 brothers who left this Earth before him. We remember the final Doolittle Raider today for his incredible courage and sacrifice and a life well lived. America has lost another hero, but our country will never forget him. I send my condolences to Dick's family and friends and especially to Rich, his son, and to Cindy, his daughter. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I rise today to address the Senate on the nomination of David Bernhardt to head the Department of the Interior. I ask unanimous consent that I may use this chart in order to further my goal of making it clear why he should not be nominated and confirmed as Secretary of the Interior. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, under Secretary Bernhardt, the Department of the Interior will come to stand for the Department of Oil Interests, DOI. This wheel of Bernhardt's giveaways makes it very clear what the objective of his tenure as the Secretary of Interior will, in fact, entail. Bernhardt's nomination is just a continuation of the Trump administration's cartel Cabinet. Only a month ago, a former coal lobbyist was confirmed to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Let me say that again. Just last month, a coal lobbyist was nominated and confirmed to be the head of the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States--unbelievable. But now Republicans want to install a former oil lobbyist to head the Department of the Interior because, in Trump's administration, it is nothing but foxes guarding the henhouse. We need more answers about Mr. Bernhardt's lobbying activities. We need answers on whether Mr. Bernhardt used his position at the Department of the Interior to help former clients. The American people need to see the documents associated with Bernhardt's lobbying activities. Most importantly, we should not confirm a former oil lobbyist to lead the very Agency that is tasked with protecting our public lands from despoliation. Let me now point to the wheel of giveaways for more oil--more oil. And that is the goal of his appointment. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of our national treasures that is under threat from Big Oil and the Trump administration. This is the wildest place left in America, and it should not be turned into a drilling playground. Yet Republicans here in the Senate voted in 2017 to hand this special place--the Arctic Refuge--over to Big Oil. Now this administration is trying to hit the gas on drilling there, in one of the Earth's most pristine wilderness areas. Last year, Mr. Bernhardt said that he would ``expedite'' oil development in the wildlife refuge, and he has worked inside the Department of the Interior to limit environmental review of drilling activities. So let's just imagine gushing oil poisoning the habitat of magnificent creatures like polar bears and caribou, snowy owls and the Arctic fox; rigs and pumps threatening the ancestral homeland of the Gwich'in and Inupiat peoples, which they call ``the sacred place where life begins.'' [[Page S2413]] I have spent my career protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for future generations, and today I will not support the nomination of David Bernhardt to undermine the protections we have worked so hard to put in place. We must stand up for the generations yet to come that cannot yet speak to protect our public lands and our oceans. At the same time, the Trump administration is trying to roll back the fuel economy standards for the vehicles we drive. In other words, since we put 70 percent of all the oil we consume in our country on a yearly basis into the gasoline tanks of the vehicles we drive in our country, if you increase the fuel economy of every one of those vehicles, it will reduce the amount of oil you need to drill for. What do the Republicans want to do? What do the oil companies want? What do the Koch brothers want? What does ExxonMobil want? Well, it is very simple. By not increasing the fuel economy standards of the vehicles we drive, we need more oil because cars will consume more in the course of a year. They then say: Ah, let's turn to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--a sacred place--and find more oil, because the vehicles we drive won't be that efficient. What kind of sacrifice are we going to make in our country because the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil want to have more oil drilled for? We are going to have the Trump administration say: The only way we can justify it is if the cars, the light trucks, the SUVs that people drive are not that efficient; therefore, we need all the oil we can get, even though we are a technical giant and we know we can make these vehicles so much more efficient, so we never have to drill there. That is a sin against the environment and a sin against our country and future generations that should be able to enjoy this pristine area, the wildlife refuge. Let's move on to another part of the wheel of giveaways--even more oil that will be another giveaway during the Bernhardt time at the Department of the Interior. On January 4, 2018, the Department of the Interior announced a plan to revise the offshore drilling plan to eliminate protections for the east and west coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic Ocean. The plan proposed to open up more than 90 percent of the U.S coastlines to oil and gas leasing. Since then, the bipartisan opposition has been deafening. All Governors along the east and west coasts have opposed or expressed concerns about expanded oil and gas exploration off their coasts. More than 340 municipalities and over 2,100 elected local, State, and Federal officials have formally opposed offshore oil and gas drilling and seismic airgun blasting in our ocean. But David Bernhardt is not listening to those concerns. Instead, he is listening to his former fossil fuel clients. He is moving ahead with this terrible offshore drilling plan that would threaten State after State with the threat of a spill in the ocean off of those States. We should not confirm Bernhardt to lead the Department of the Interior. Handing the keys to the beaches of our country, the coastlines of our country, and our fishing and tourism industries in our country over to Big Oil is not what our citizens want. That is the opposite of what we need to do to protect our environment, but that is what David Bernhardt and his fossil fuel friends want. There is no reason that we have to drill off of the coastlines of our country right where people who are swimming will be watching these oil rigs that are going to be drilling down into those ocean areas off of our beaches to find oil that we don't need. If we increase the fuel economy standards of the vehicles we drive, we will be able to back out the need for all of that additional oil. That is the sin against the environment that is being committed. That is the agenda of David Bernhardt's at the Department of the Interior. Instead of being the United States of America--a technological giant that invents its way to the new automotive technologies that reduce the amount of oil we need and reduces the amount of greenhouse gasses that go up into the atmosphere--with David Bernhardt as the Secretary of the Interior, partnered with the new coal lobbyist who is running the EPA, we are going to wind up with more greenhouse gasses going up into the air, a reduction in the efficiency of the vehicles we drive, and putting more profits into the pockets of the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil and the auto industry, which also wants to reduce the fuel economy standards of the vehicles we drive. This is a sin against our environment but also our identity as the technological giant of the planet. We can do this. We can make our cars more efficient. We can have plug-in hybrids. We can have all-electric vehicles. We can create a revolution that avoids the necessity of drilling off of our beaches and drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. We can do this, but that is not what Donald Trump wants. He wants fossil fuel industry representatives at the Department of the Interior and EPA running these Agencies. David Bernhardt's ties to Big Oil--the very industry he is tasked with regulating--are as deep as an oil well. Those ties should be disqualifying for anyone nominated to head the Department of the Interior. We need to stop the pollution of our democracy by Big Oil interests. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the nomination of David Bernhardt. I ask my colleagues to consider what we can do to avoid the necessity of despoiling these sacred environmental locations in our country for the oil industry, for the Koch brothers. This is a big moment, this vote we are about to cast. This is one more step by Donald Trump that will result in far more greenhouse gases going up into the atmosphere, far more danger being presented to places that should be put off limits to the oil industry because of the risk of environmental danger that would result from that permission to drill. That is why we should all pause and really consider whether we want to go deeper and deeper into an era that is completely avoidable if we unleash the technological might of our country. When President Kennedy went to Rice University in 1961, what he said was that we were going to have a mission to the Moon and that mission would require us to invent new metals, new alloys, new propulsion systems that did not exist, and that within 10 years, we would have to then bring that mission back safely from the Moon through heat half the intensity of the Sun and do so successfully. Auto mechanics is not rocket science. We already know how to improve the fuel economy standards of the vehicles we drive. We don't need nuclear physics and we don't need aeronautical engineers to help us do this. President Kennedy challenged our country, and we responded. President Trump is like J.F.K in reverse. He is saying that we can't do it; that, instead, what we have to do is, here on Earth, be the leaders in spoiling our most sacred environmental locations. That is why today is such a monumental opportunity for the Senate to say no on a bipartisan basis to David Bernhardt, who is someone who does not deserve the post of Secretary of the Interior. I once again urge a ``no'' vote from all of my colleagues. I yield the floor. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nomination of David Bernhardt Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am pleased to be here today to speak in strong support of David Bernhardt's nomination to be Secretary of the Interior, and I thank all of my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. We worked pretty hard together to report Mr. Bernhardt's nomination last week. We moved it out with good bipartisan support. I also thank the majority leader for filing cloture this week so that we can confirm him before we depart for this 2-week work period. I have several reasons--I have a whole host of different reasons to outline as to why I support Mr. Bernhardt's nomination. I outlined them [[Page S2414]] before the committee, but I would like to take a couple of minutes here this afternoon to reiterate them on the Senate floor. First, really, is his background. He understands and is in touch with our public lands. Mr. Bernhardt is from the West where, of course, the vast majority of our public lands are located. He grew up in Rifle, which is a small town in Western Colorado. He spent a lot of his summers in Wyoming. He, to this day, remains an avid sportsman and outdoorsman. He likes hunting and fishing. He is a guy who appreciates the outdoors. He is really almost unparalleled in terms of the experience that he brings to the job. He has worked at the Department of the Interior now for about 10 years, including two Senate-confirmed posts. Back in 2006, we confirmed him as Solicitor by voice vote, and then in 2017, we confirmed him to be the Deputy Secretary. Again, that vote was a good bipartisan vote. He has now served as Acting Secretary since January of 2019, so we have a situation where, simply put, he has more experience at the Department than any other previous nominee for Secretary, except one. That is a pretty good credential there. Of equal importance, Mr. Bernhardt has the right perspective to be the Secretary of the Interior. He understands how Federal land management decisions affect our local communities. He has seen how Federal policies impact people's access to and use of public land, and he also recognizes the need to balance conservation and opportunities for economic development. I think David Bernhardt has really proved his ability to lead the Department. He is well qualified. He is highly competent. He has built strong working relationships with those who are affected by the Department's decisions. I really think there is no question that he is ready for the job. He can handle everything it entails. I have been asked by several of the reporters who are out there: What do you think David Bernhardt really brings to the table? What I have shared with them is that as I have gotten to know David Bernhardt in his various capacities at Interior, he is a guy who understands and enjoys the policy of these issues. He likes to get down into the fine details. He knows the background. He is not just being given something by staff to read. He is the one who is really engaged in understanding at a level of detail that is greatly appreciated. When I think about the importance of this position of Secretary of the Interior, I come at it from the perspective of an Alaskan coming from a State that has more Federal acres than any other State. The Department of the Interior controls most of those. We often refer to the Department, and the Secretary specifically, as our landlord. That is not necessarily a title we like. We like to consider ourselves a partner, but I think we truly recognize we need leadership to understand and appreciate the impact their decisions within the Department of the Interior can have on us. I know David Bernhardt understands that. He has been a good partner for Alaskans, but he has also been a good partner for individuals, groups, and States all across the country, and that is why his nomination is supported by a wide range of stakeholder groups from the Alaska Federation of Natives to Ducks Unlimited, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. I think it is also important to note that Mr. Bernhardt moved through our committee process in pretty good order. He answered all of our questions. Again, he demonstrated the depth of his understanding of the issues and his expertise. He really exceeded expectations, which led to a very strong bipartisan vote of 14 to 6 at the business meeting last week. Now the full Senate has the opportunity to confirm Mr. Bernhardt. Some will continue to make allegations over ethics, but the fact is, as we have reviewed those charges, we have found nothing that should hold him back. I know this has been a subject of discussion on the Senate floor, so I want to lay it out very clearly. There are some news stories that are being printed and have been printed that are filled with old information that has already been reviewed by our committee staff. New stories, old facts--they don't contain anything new or anything disqualifying. There is nothing amiss here, and there is no valid reason to delay this process. The Office of Government Ethics has certified that Mr. Bernhardt is in good standing; so has Interior's Designated Agency Ethics Official. My committee staff has contacted Interior's Inspector General. It has been confirmed that there are no open investigations into Mr. Bernhardt. I would tell folks that what needs to happen here is that we need to move forward. We need to reject the last-minute rhetoric that is designed to delay. We need to confirm a well-qualified candidate to be our next Secretary of the Interior. We have a lot to do. Interior has a lot to do to make sure that we are protecting our lands, increasing our energy security, as well as fulfilling all of the missions of the Department, and the sooner we are able to confirm a Secretary to focus on them, the better. Mr. Bernhardt is very well qualified to be the Secretary of the Interior. He has the right background, the right experience, and the right perspective for the job. He is ready to lead on a permanent basis, and I am glad that very shortly here we are going to be considering his nomination. I strongly encourage every Member in this Chamber to support his confirmation. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak to the robust support that David Bernhardt has received for his nomination to be Secretary of the Interior. Last week, those of us on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee reported Mr. Bernhardt on a strong, bipartisan vote of 14 to 6. He has actually added support from the last time that he was considered in committee, in 2017, and I hope we will see that again when we vote on his nomination later today. Mr. Bernhardt's support is not limited to the Senate. For example, the Congressional Western Caucus is solidly behind Mr. Bernhardt, with many of its members on record in support of his nomination. Bear in mind, these are members from Western States, where the vast majority of our public lands are located, whose districts are most impacted by the Department of the Interior. It is a very good sign that Mr. Bernhardt has drawn their strong support. We have also kept a list of individuals and groups who have submitted letters of support for Mr. Bernhardt. It spans the spectrum of stakeholders, from the Public Lands Council and the Colorado Farm Bureau to the American Exploration and Mining Association and the Corps Network. Multiple recreation groups have written in urging the Senate to confirm Mr. Bernhardt. The motorized recreation groups, like the American Council of Snowmobile Associations and the Off-Road Business Association, wrote that, ``At a time when many of the senior posts at the agency lack Senate confirmed executives, a person of Mr. Bernhardt's experience is sorely need . . . having [him] at the helm of the Interior Department will strengthen the agency's resolve to make the lands it manages accessible to the recreating public.'' Officials at all levels of government are voicing their support for Mr. Bernhardt's nomination. The Governor of Wyoming, Mark Gordon, offered this statement: [Mr. Bernhardt's] recognition of expertise in the States is refreshing . . . I wish [him] a speedy and easy confirmation process.'' The Mesa County Commissioners in Colorado wrote that ``Mr. Bernhardt's extensive knowledge of public lands and energy issues makes him an avid leader with skill to see issues from multiple perspectives to maintain and improve partnerships among federal, state, and local governments.'' The Harney County Court in Oregon has highlighted Mr. Bernhardt's commitment to balancing the multiple use of public land, writing that, ``[He] has proved himself in the past by exhibiting understanding between the balance that is needed from an ecological standpoint, but also, what is needed from the economic and social aspect of public land use. He will work towards a balanced approach by trying to assess and distinguish between the multiple issues that we are facing with the [bureaus].'' [[Page S2415]] Tribal groups and entities are also supportive of his nomination. In my home State, the Alaska Federation of Natives noted that, ``Mr. Bernhardt has demonstrated a thorough understanding of the legal frameworks of the major laws covering Alaska Native subsistence customary and traditional rights and protections . . . he listens well, is articulate in his responses, and draws reasonable conclusions.'' The Chairman of the Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council wrote in that, ``the [Tribe] has worked with [Mr. Bernhardt] previously and firmly believes that his knowledge and experience make him a very good fit for the Department . . . we also believe he is committed to building strong working relationships that rely on good faith and respect among all interests at the table.'' We have truly heard from a very wide range of organizations in support of this nomination. The Archery Trade Association wrote to us that ``[Mr. Bernhardt] has demonstrated tremendous commitment to conserving and protecting our nation's natural, historic and cultural resources . . . [his] experience with the Department of the Interior coupled [with his] exemplary history of collaboration, non-partisan views, highly respected demeanor and deeply held passion for conservation and historic preservation make him uniquely qualified for this position.'' One of the reasons that such a diverse group of stakeholders support Mr. Bernhardt's nomination is that they have worked with him during his nearly ten years at Interior, including most recently as Deputy Secretary and then Acting Secretary. He has proven that he can work with groups, he has formed strong relationships with them, and they respect and support him. For example, the Gila River Indian Community wrote that, ``based on our experience in negotiating and working on complex issues with Mr. Bernhardt we support his position as Secretary of the Department of the Interior. We believe he has an understanding of Tribal sovereignty and the United States' trust responsibility to Tribal nations.'' The Corps Network wrote that ``Mr. Bernhardt has been accessible and responsive to our inquiries, visited several Corps in the field, and joined the Corps Network's Day of Service last summer.'' These groups are reiterating what we already know--that Mr. Bernhardt's experience at Interior and in the West; his willingness to listen, build relationships, be responsive; and his ability to earn people's trust make him more than qualified to lead the Department of the Interior. I want to wrap up by reading an excerpt from a letter that we received from the Beaver County Commission in Utah: ``In our interactions with Mr. Bernhardt we have found him to act with integrity, be open minded to all points of view, and have a contagious passion for the health of our Nation's lands and people. These qualities, combined with many others, make Mr. Bernhardt an ideal candidate to serve the county by leading the Department of the Interior.'' I couldn't say it any better. Mr. Bernhardt knows the Department and the laws that govern it inside and out. He appreciates and respects the Department's mission. He is the right person for the job--the best person to lead Interior--and I look forward to his confirmation. Remembering Selina Everson Madam President, before I relinquish my time, I just want to take a very brief moment to note that a friend, a leader, an extraordinary role model for many Alaskans--certainly in the Alaska Native community--has recently passed. Selina Everson was a language and culture warrior in Southeastern Alaska and one who fought for the Tlingit language and culture preservation. She was an extraordinary woman and role model. She grew up speaking Tlingit. It was her first language. In school, she was told: You can only speak English. She broke that rule and courageously spoke Tlingit anyway. She was a champion for her culture. We mourn her passing. This woman not only was considered Grandma Selina and considered by hundreds of children in schools in Southeastern Alaska as a friend and a relative, I considered her one as well. I was honored that she was the one who helped adopt me into the Deisheetaan clan and gave me the honor and treasured name of Aan shaawatk'i, Lady of the Land. So know that I send my prayers to Selina's family as they face this loss. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The assistant Democratic leader. Tribute to MJ Kenny Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to honor a member of my staff. I thank Senator Fischer and Senator Manchin for giving me an opportunity to speak at this moment. MJ Kenny has been part of my team in the Senate for 9 years, and for the past several years, he was a constant on the floor of the Senate as deputy floor director of my staff. At the end of this week, he is going to be moving on to a new professional opportunity. Unlike many of us who work in this building, MJ actually is a resident of the Washington, DC, area. He graduated from Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, MD, a suburb of the city of Washington. Walt Whitman wrote in his essay, ``Democratic Vistas,'' the following: ``Did you too, O friend, suppose democracy was only for elections, for politics, and for a party name?'' Walt Whitman understood that democracy is more than campaigns. Democracy is certainly more than just yelling at one another. Democracy is a process. It is a daily dedication to the institutions and norms and the rule of law. Making democracy work takes skill and commitment, and it takes many people who are willing to make a sacrifice and see the demands for long hours and the demands for time on the floor as part of their democratic commitment. This can demand great patience and great sacrifice. I think Walt Whitman would have given MJ Kenny high marks, as do I. For the last few years, MJ has helped to make sure the Senate does the daily work of democracy. I have counted on him to make sure that my interests were represented on the floor of the Senate, that my constituents in Illinois had a voice in the Senate, and that stories about Dreamers and other important information be shared in the Congressional Record with my colleagues and beyond. Making certain that the information was floor-ready was a responsibility of MJ Kenny, and he handled it professionally. MJ and my floor director, Reema Dodin, are my dynamic duo who help make things happen around here. Together, they are my eyes and ears on the floor when meetings and other obligations take me away. MJ has also been a big help to so many other Senators. He came to my office 12 years ago for an informational interview. We tried to decide whether we were right for one another. Luckily, I came to the conclusion that this graduate of Northwestern University in Chicago with a degree in history, who had already interned for then- Congressman and now Senator Chris Van Hollen, was a good fit for my team and a good prospect to help us move forward. I gave MJ Kenny his opportunity, and I am sure glad I did. He flourished. In one year he moved from legislative correspondent to legislative aid to becoming a key part of my floor team. In every job he has done for me, MJ has been a steady, reliable partner. Even in difficult times, he works long hours without complaint and with grit and good humor. In college, he studied history. In the U.S Senate and on this floor for the last 9 years, he has not only witnessed history, he has helped to shape it. I couldn't ask for more in a staff. I suspect that some of what MJ knows about patience and perseverance he learned as a lifelong, long-suffering Baltimore Orioles fan. It is like being a Chicago Cubs fan. Among his treasured possessions on his desk is a bobblehead of Manny Machado, the former O's third baseman and Golden Glove winner. Just as Manny Machado left the O's, MJ Kenny is leaving the Senate at the end of this week. I want to wish him continued success and thank him again for being such an important part of my team over the years. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank MJ also, on behalf of Senator Durbin. His staff does a [[Page S2416]] great job, and we always enjoy working with them. MJ, enjoy your new endeavor in life. Nomination of David Bernhardt Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of Mr. David Bernhardt to be the Secretary of the Interior. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources voted to report David Bernhardt's nomination to be the Secretary of the Interior last week by a vote 14 to 6. Members on both sides held and continue to hold strong feelings on Mr. Bernhardt's nomination. Both sides have scrutinized his record carefully, as we should, considering the enormous responsibility entrusted to the Secretary of the Interior. Whether it be payments for miners for their healthcare benefits, processing permits for the privilege of energy production on Federal lands, or ensuring the U.S Geological Survey can conduct its critical work of collecting and analyzing data on our changing climate, the Department of the Interior has a huge amount of responsibility and diverse jurisdiction. Furthermore, the Secretary of the Interior is the guardian of our Nation's greatest natural resources. The Department of the Interior manages nearly half a billion acres of Federal land, or about 20 percent of the Nation's land. One of every 5 acres in the United States is under their control. These lands include some of our most special places--our national parks, trails, seashores, and historic sites. In addition, the Department manages another 1.7 billion acres of submerged land on the Outer Continental Shelf. The Department of the Interior is also the largest supplier of water in the 17 Western States. It manages nearly 500 dams and over 300 reservoirs that supply water to over 31 million people and irrigate 10 million acres of farmland. Furthermore, nearly 20 percent of energy we use is produced on lands managed by the Secretary. These include not just coal and oil and natural gas but also hydropower, geothermal, solar, and wind energy. In addition, the Secretary of the Interior manages our trust obligations to nearly 600 federally recognized Indian Tribes and provides services to nearly 2 million Native Americans. By any measure, the job of Secretary of the Interior is an enormous and special responsibility. As a former Governor, I have always believed that an executive is entitled to deference when selecting his or her team, as long as the candidates are qualified and ethical. I have carefully reviewed Mr. Bernhardt's experience and his qualifications. I met with him twice before his hearing and spoke with him again by phone afterwards. I questioned him extensively about his willingness to be a good steward of our Nation's greatest natural treasures--our national parks, monuments, and historical sites. I questioned him about his responsibility to balance our resource needs with environmental protection and fairness to the owners of our public lands, which are all of us, the American people. I spoke to him about the need to make sure that those who are granted the privilege of using our public lands leave them in better condition than they found them. Based on my extensive discussion with him and my review of his record, I believe Mr. Bernhardt is clearly qualified to serve as Secretary. He held senior positions in the Department for 8 years during the Bush administration, including over 2 years as the Solicitor, which is the third highest office in the Department. He has served as the Deputy Secretary for the past 2 years and as Acting Secretary since January. He knows the Interior Department inside and out, and he is well-versed on all of the issues that come before it. He clearly has the knowledge and experience to serve as Secretary. Now, the opposition to Mr. Bernhardt's nomination comes not from any lack of knowledge or experience but from questions about appearances of conflicts of interest arising from his law practice prior to being confirmed as Deputy Secretary. I had extensive conversations with Mr. Bernhardt about these potential conflicts of interest and his compliance with ethics laws and regulations. I reminded him that he takes the same oath I take--public service, not self-service. We also spoke about the importance of ensuring a culture at the Department of the Interior that reflects the highest level of ethical compliance and integrity. Based on my extensive discussion with Mr. Bernhardt and the assurances he gave me, I voted for him in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources last week, and I will support his nomination when we vote on the floor to confirm him. But I said before the vote in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--and I will say it again--that I expect him and the Department to hold itself to the highest ethical standards because I assured him I will. Mr. Bernhardt must work to ensure the commitment to ethical and scientific integrity, and I intend to work with him and his staff persistently to ensure this is the case. Our parks and public lands, our scenic beauty, and our fish and wildlife resources are important to everybody and especially to the people of West Virginia, which I represent, and to the people of all of our States and to the Nation's outdoor recreation economy. West Virginians count on the Secretary of the Interior as the guardian of our public lands, as I know you do, Mr. President, in Louisiana. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which I am privileged to serve on as ranking member, has a lot of work to do. We have to address the park maintenance backlog. We have to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, ensure that companies granted the privilege of developing public energy and mineral resources pay the royalties they owe the taxpayers and nothing less, and see that our public lands and resources are wisely managed and protected. I intend to work with Mr. Bernhardt on these important issues. I have made it clear to him that I expect him to put his extensive experience and knowledge of these issues to work for all the American people and to execute his responsibilities in a manner that ensures that our public lands are not just being maintained but improved for the benefit of generations to come. For that reason, I will vote to confirm him to this important position, and I ask your consideration for the same. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska. ICBMs Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, recently I came to the Senate floor to speak about the airborne leg of the nuclear triad. Today I rise to discuss the value of another leg of the triad--our intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. Following the brief deployment of the Atlas and Titan ICBM weapon systems in the early 1960s, the United States deployed the first Minuteman ICBMs in support of the strategic deterrence mission. Over half a century later, today the United States deploys 400 Minuteman III ICBMs, each carrying a single warhead. While the Minuteman III system was deployed in the 1970s, much of its technology dates to the previous decade. The system was originally designed for a 10-year service life but has sustained an exceptionally high availability rate and is expected to remain in service through the 2030s, thanks to a series of life-extension programs. But we cannot extend the current system beyond 2030, and that is why we are now developing its replacement--the ground based strategic deterrent. Doing so will require resources in a budget- constrained environment and, perhaps for that reason, we are hearing renewed calls to abandon the triad and cut our ICBM force. However, this step would be foolish and dangerous to the United States and to our allied security for several reasons. First, ICBMs are highly reliable and always ready. That is why they are regarded as the most responsive leg of the triad. Unlike bombers and submarines, which may require time to arm or maneuver, the ICBM force provides the President the ability to promptly respond if deterrence fails. This virtue is often mischaracterized as a source of risk. The system's rapid response is described as a ``hair trigger'' by critics who often paint chilling pictures of 400 ICBMs automatically flying to their [[Page S2417]] targets and causing Armageddon, either by accident or as a result of cyber interference. I want to be clear that there is no ``hair trigger'' about our ICBMs. We have many safeguards put in place to ensure the system operates only as intended. For example, our ICBMs are actually targeted on the open- ocean spaces as a means of ensuring that, even if all of our safeguards failed and a missile somehow managed to launch by accident, it would land in the ocean and not accidentally start a nuclear war. The critics conveniently fail to mention this. Former STRATCOM commander General Robert Kehler recently testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, and he said: ``It isn't the same thing at all as thinking about a Wild West hair trigger . . . . It's not the way it works.'' The high readiness of the ICBM force also provides an important hedge against uncertainty. Since we no longer maintain bombers on nuclear alert, the ICBMs and the submarines reinforce each other so that a technical failure in one leg of the triad does not render our day-to- day deterrent inoperative. Those who advocate for doing away with the ICBM force must account for the fact that, under their proposals, in such moments there would not have been an additional leg of the triad to ensure our Nation isn't left without a nuclear deterrent. As our nuclear forces continue to age, reliability challenges will only grow. Critics often describe the ICBM force as being vulnerable, even going so far as to call our missiles sitting ducks. It is true that silos are not hidden, they aren't mobile, and they can be targeted. But, again, this is a misunderstanding of what actually is the strength of the ICBM force. In his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Hyten stated that the ICBM force ``creates the most significant targeting problem for an adversary, because there are 400 separate targets across the United States. All would have to be independently targeted by an adversary. That targeting problem is hugely problematic and creates a significant advantage for us.'' Simply put, destroying 400 hardened and geographically dispersed silos is an extremely difficult proposition. Only Russia possesses the capability to destroy our ICBM force. No other nation on Earth can do so, and it would greatly diminish Russia's arsenal in the process. That is not a vulnerability. As General Hyten clearly states, it is a significant advantage for our Nation. For these reasons and many others, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have maintained ICBMs as part of our nuclear forces for decades. The role of ICBMs has been reconsidered and reviewed many times, and their value has been repeatedly reaffirmed in a bipartisan manner. For example, last November the report by the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission stated that the triad presents insurmountable targeting challenges for adversaries, imposes disproportionate costs on adversary defenses, and hedges against unforeseen geopolitical or technological changes. Mr. President, I will close by saying that our ICBM forces make key contributions to our overall nuclear forces and, as Members on both sides of the aisle agree, they are an essential ingredient to the bedrock of our national security--our nuclear deterrent. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Venezuela Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Good afternoon. The crisis in Venezuela is a crisis in America. Senator Rubio, Congressman Diaz-Balart, and I have been talking about this for years and worked with the White House on a comprehensive strategy. More than 200,000 Venezuelans live in Florida, and their concerns are our concerns. Make no mistake--this is a crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis that threatens the lives of the people of Venezuela and has created a flood of refugees numbering in the millions. It is also a crisis that threatens the safety and security of our allies in Latin America and in the United States of America. The dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro and the creeping influence and military presence of our global adversaries represent a clear and present danger to the entire Western Hemisphere. There are some who will say that this is not our fight, that the millions of Venezuelans suffering 2,000 miles away are not our concern. Some have criticized the mere mention of the crisis in Venezuela by those like myself as American imperialism or a U.S -backed coup. I reject that. This is our fight. Freedom and democracy in Latin America is our fight. I remind these critics that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing. We cannot let evil triumph in Venezuela. It would be a failure of leadership with disastrous consequences. There is only one option left to get aid to the people of Venezuela. It is something that no one is willing to talk about. It is becoming clear that we will have to consider the use of American military assets to deliver aid. Maduro and his thugs have left us no choice. I applaud President Trump and his administration for taking bold action by recognizing Juan Guaido as the legitimate President of Venezuela and organizing the international community to do the same. The sanctions implemented by this administration against the Maduro regime and its puppet masters in Havana reflect their commitment to freedom and democracy in Latin America. Yet Maduro remains in power, the people of Venezuela continue to suffer, and the influence of Cuba, Russia, China, and international terrorist organizations grows. We must do more, but in order to understand where we go from here, we need to look at history. Hugo Chavez might have been elected democratically, but he never intended to govern democratically. He built a socialist dictatorship by hollowing out all the democratic institutions: the constitution, the electoral system, and the courts. He made civil society and the business sector bend to his will or face elimination. He nationalized entire sectors of the economy and used them to pay off his cronies. He took over the oil sector and made the national energy company his piggy bank. He made common cause with our enemies--most notably, the Castro regime. Cuba received and continues to receive free oil from Venezuela and in return provides political and internal security operatives. In other words, Cuba provided and is still providing military thugs to help stop freedom. Chavez allowed his regime to engage in illicit trafficking of drugs and people. He cooperated with Middle Eastern terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and the terrorist state of Iran. This cooperation has only intensified under Chavez's successor, Maduro. The path of socialism chosen by the Chavistas inevitably led to a failed state that relies on bad actors for survival. The result is one of the worst humanitarian crises in our hemisphere's history. We cannot ignore the impact the socialist policies of Chavez and Maduro has had on the people of Venezuela. Nine out of ten households say they don't have enough money to buy food. That is socialism. Eighty percent of children under 5 are in some state of malnutrition. That is socialism. Inflation is over 10 million percent this year, and their currency is worthless. What does that mean to the average person? A bundle of carrots costs 3 million bolivars. A dozen eggs costs $150 USD. That is socialism. Venezuela has the highest murder rate in the world. That is socialism. More than 3.5 million refugees--about 12 percent of the population-- have fled to nearby countries because they can't get food, water, medicine, or safety from their government. Two million more Venezuelans are expected to flee before the year is out, with Colombia taking the brunt of this refugee crisis. Colombian resources are strained, as they do all they can to help the refugees fleeing persecution, starvation, and sickness, while the Maduro regime blocks aid caravans, sets them on fire, and continues to cooperate with the narcotrafficking rebels that plague Colombia. I want to thank my good friend President Duque for all he is doing. Other nations in the region, such as Brazil and Peru, have also chipped in, accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees. [[Page S2418]] For weeks, millions of Venezuelans have been left without running water and amid a series of massive blackouts. Journalists report scenes that are now a part of the daily life for Venezuelans: dozens sleeping in line for their turn at a well in one of the city's biggest slums; three men tossing an old paint bucket tied with ropes down a well hoping to hit water; people parked by the highway, waiting their turn to place bottles under small streams that run down the Avila Mountain. Many Venezuelans call these conditions a genocide because the violence and starvation are being imposed on the civilian population as a conscious policy of Maduro and his Cuban puppet masters. Dictators like Maduro recognize weakness as an opportunity. The hungrier and sicker his people are, the easier they are to repress. This is the kind of evil we are facing in our hemisphere. But one thing is clear: Maduro underestimates his people. They may be oppressed, but they are not weak. They may be hungry, but their hunger is for freedom, and they are making their voices heard. We need to listen. Nicholas Maduro is an illegitimate President. His election was a sham, just like the elections in Cuba and Russia--a complete sham and a joke. Dozens of countries across Latin America and Europe have recognized Juan Guaido's right to the interim Presidency. As President of the National Assembly--the only democratic body left in Venezuela-- Juan Guaido has the right and the duty to preside over new elections and the return of democracy. The people still in power in Venezuela are corrupt bureaucrats and military officers engaged in embezzlement, narcotrafficking, and human rights abuses. Since being tested by uprisings in 2014 and 2017, the regime has reinforced a repressive apparatus that uses armed mobile civilian gangs known as colectivos, specialized police units, and anti- riot forces of the National Guard to terrorize and control the civilian population through arbitrary arrests, beatings, detentions, and killings. The Maduro regime has gone so far as to arrest the Chief of Staff for Interim President Guaido, Roberto Marrero. I met his wife Romy on Monday in Miami. She fled the country 3 weeks ago with their 7-year-old son, right before Maduro's thugs destroyed their home. The majority of the armed forces want change in their country, but they live under the repressive forces of control, threats, intimidation, and violence. Russian mercenaries protect Maduro because he can't trust his own troops, and the Russian Government has provided military advisers and specialists to maintain the Maduro regime's defenses, including surface-to-air missile systems. Russia has also sent nuclear-capable bombers to Venezuela, in violation of the Venezuelan Constitution, to intimidate the United States and other countries in the region. In short, Russia is expanding its military presence in Venezuela to prop up a regime hostile to the United States and create a foothold in the Western Hemisphere. Not since the Cuban Missile Crisis has Russia taken such an aggressive step to expand their influence in the region. Meanwhile, China evades sanctions we have placed on the regime by investing in the country and extending generous loans to prop up the dictatorship in Caracas. The United States faces a serious national security threat and a humanitarian crisis at our doorstep. This is becoming as dangerous for us as the Syrian civil war has been for Europe, Israel, and Jordan. Left unchecked, it will destabilize our regional allies and provide a base of operations for our enemies. Today, I am urging the administration, Congress, and the American people to see the crisis for what it is--a rising tide of social and political collapse encouraged and funded by our enemies. The socialist dictatorship of Nicholas Maduro and his Cuban, Russian, Chinese, and narcotrafficking allies do not care how many millions of Venezuelans suffer and die. He is determined to remain in power, sucking the life out of a once-vibrant nation and creating an outpost for adversaries and a safe harbor for terrorists intent on harming Americans. We cannot let this stand. We will be judged for our response to this crisis--not just the humanitarian crisis but the threat to our hemisphere. The credibility and security of the United States is on the line. The question is not whether we can tolerate this crisis that is worsening daily--we surely cannot. The question is, When will we act to end it? Hostile regimes like Russia, China, and Cuba are digging in. They are training killers, distributing weapons, and placing military assets in Venezuela. Their message is clear: They don't intend to give up without a fight. History has proven that permitting the former Soviet Union to establish a presence in Cuba perpetrated a six-decade, totalitarian dictatorship that has exported instability to the region and worked against U.S national security interests. Our safety, national security, and the peace of our hemisphere demand that we take action. We cannot allow this murderous regime to continue spreading misery within its borders and into neighboring countries. There is a democratic government-in-waiting in the form of National Assembly and Interim President Juan Guaido. U.S policy relies on rallying his internal support and forcing those around Maduro to see their future as brighter if they defect and support the movement toward freedom and democracy. There are steps we can take to accelerate this process. First, we must follow through on American policy and indict regime leaders for human rights violations and for narcotrafficking and money laundering crimes. The region's strongest supporters do not care if the people suffer, but they do care if their stolen fortunes and their freedom are at risk. We must make clear to them that their future is in jeopardy if they continue to support Maduro and interference from Cuba, Russia, and China. There will be nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. The United States will give no quarter to those who support the brutal Maduro dictatorship instead of freedom and democracy for the people of Venezuela. Second, we must break the hold the Cuban Government has on Venezuela. It is imperative that the United States fully implement the sanctions contained in the LIBERTAD Act to allow U.S nationals to sue over property confiscated by the Cuban Government and to deny entry to those who traffic in stolen property. Cuba cannot continue to freely incite violence in Venezuela while profiting from the use of stolen property and human trafficking. Chavez and Maduro kept the Cuban regime afloat for decades, and now Cuban operators are keeping the Maduro regime in power. It is time we recognize that these problems are one and the same. Third, we must encourage our allies in the region to join us in this effort. President Trump has repeatedly called on regional counterparts to exert more leadership, and he has a right to do so. The United States has implemented strong sanctions on Venezuelan leaders, on oil, and on trade. Our allies must join us in this effort. The Lima Group, made up of our friends in the region, has given broad support to the strategy of isolating the Maduro regime in favor of Interim President Guaido, urging additional sanctions. That is welcome, but they should not rule out the possibility that they need to pursue more aggressive means to secure this threat. Their security and economic well-being are also at risk. They should remember that the Maduro regime and its supporters want Venezuela's neighbors to live in fear. Even before this crisis began in earnest, Colombia and Guyana faced regular interventions and threats from the Venezuelan regime. Maduro and his supporters do not want peaceful relations with other countries except on their own terms. I am quite sure that Cuba, China, and Russia do not have the best interests of the region in mind. I was glad to see the Organization of American States accept the appointment of the designated permanent representative of the National Assembly, Gustavo Tarre Briceno. Consistent with the Inter-American Democratic Charter, the Organization of American States must expel Maduro's representative. The Maduro regime is not a legitimate government and has no right to send a representative to the very body in the Western Hemisphere charged with protecting and promoting democracy in the region. [[Page S2419]] Fourth, we must not appear weak in the face of Chinese, Russian, and Cuban determination to prop up Maduro. Our adversaries question our will and determination. Put simply, they don't think we are serious. We should disabuse them of that notion. All options, including the use of American military assets, must remain on the table. If sanctions can cripple the Maduro regime, we must continue on that path, but so far, sanctions alone are not stopping the Maduro regime, and the United States needs to start considering the use of military assets to bring aid to the millions of starving and sick Venezuelans. I call on all of our allies and those supporting Guaido to help us in this effort. Let me repeat that. The United States must consider the use of military assets to bring aid to the people of Venezuela, but that doesn't end the conversation. If embargoes and blockades can help, we should consider them. If military force on the part of the United States and our allies in the region is necessary to rid us of the scourge of Maduro and his thugs, then we cannot rule it out. If the Venezuelan people, through their elected National Assembly and their own laws and Constitution, request assistance to restore constitutional government and democracy, we should be ready to answer that call. The Maduro regime has not been broken yet and can count on billions of dollars looted from the Venezuelan people and generated from 20 years of narcotrafficking. The Cubans, Russians, and Chinese see Venezuela as an economic opportunity, but, more importantly, they see a chance to intimidate the United States--to be a thorn in our side. This is a ``great power'' confrontation and one that our national defense strategy might not explicitly contemplate. Yet it is a confrontation we must be willing to meet with decisive action. The Venezuelan people want change, and even now they think of survival as much as they think of a democratic future. They are looking to the future. They are looking to the United States and democratic countries to help them. We must answer that call. I yield the floor. nomination of david bernhardt Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination of David Bernhardt to be Secretary of the Interior. I opposed his nomination as Deputy Secretary of the Interior because of his numerous conflicts of interest as a former lobbyist. Bernhardt's tenure, both as Deputy Secretary and now the Acting Secretary at Interior, has since confirmed my initial concerns and given rise to new ones. As a former partner at a powerful DC lobbying and law firm, Bernhardt represented numerous oil, gas, mining, and water companies with ongoing business before the Department that he now oversees. The Washington Post recently reported that he has at least 22 known conflicts of interest, the most of any of President Trump's nominees. This is particularly concerning given that Mr. Bernhardt's recusals mandated by President Trump will expire in August, and he has refused to commit to continuing recusing himself beyond then on any issues that could benefit former clients. In fact, during his recent confirmation hearing, Bernhardt stated that recusal isn't ``really is the best strategy''--an unacceptable stance. By refusing to recuse himself, Bernhardt has shown a potential willingness to put his former clients' needs before the public good. One troubling example is his relationship with Cadiz, a company that wants to profit by draining a critical aquifer in the Mojave Desert. Before coming to the Department of the Interior, Mr. Bernhardt was a partner at and led the natural resources division of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Cadiz's lobbying firm that retains a financial stake in the project. This project would destroy the treasured California desert that I have fought my entire Senate career to protect. In order to sell the water, Cadiz needs to build a more than 40-mile pipeline through the desert to connect to an aqueduct. Several months after Bernhardt was nominated as Deputy Secretary, the Department of Interior temporarily suspended its own solicitor's opinion requiring Cadiz to get Federal permits to build its pipeline along a railroad right-of-way. That solicitor's opinion was ultimately reversed 2 months after he was confirmed, completely removing the Federal permitting authority for this project. The timing of this decision is extremely troubling, particularly in light of the Interior Department's own independent science that has repeatedly questioned the sustainability of this project. The U.S Geological Survey, which is part of the Interior Department, stated in 2002 and confirmed in 2017 that the natural recharge rate of the aquifer is only 2,000 to 10,000 acre-feet per year. Cadiz proposes to withdraw water at more than 50,000 acre-feet, or 16 billion gallons, per year for 50 years. Taking that much water would rob the desert of its most precious natural resource and harm the surrounding flora and fauna. Now the Federal Government, despite its own science saying Cadiz would take too much water and legal opinions requiring Federal review, has removed itself from the permitting process. Even the mere appearance of favoritism or special favors for Cadiz is extremely inappropriate and a concern with this nomination. I am also concerned that throughout his tenure at Interior, Bernhardt has shown a willingness to ignore the public's interest for political purposes. During President Trump's government shutdown--the longest in U.S history--Acting Secretary Bernhardt kept most of the national parks open to avoid public backlash for the shutdown. Left open but severally understaffed, major damage occurred to parks across the country. Few places felt the impact of his poor decision more than Joshua Tree National Park. Iconic Joshua trees were cut down, cultural artifacts stolen or destroyed, and pristine desert habitat marred by vehicle traffic. I have twice requested from Mr. Bernhardt a full accounting of the damage and costs of his decision and have not received a response. I am also deeply concerned by steps Interior has recently taken to expand offshore oil drilling, despite bipartisan opposition from coastal States. Californians don't want new offshore drilling along our coast. We still remember the horror of the 1969 Santa Barbara spill, when an offshore oil rig leaked more than 100,000 barrels, the third largest oil spill behind the Exxon-Valdez and Deepwater Horizon disasters. There has been no new drilling in State waters since that spill and no new drilling in Federal waters off the coast of California since 1984. Now, the Department of the Interior is openly discussing the option of restarting such drilling. Bernhardt's ties to the fossil fuel industry give me zero confidence that the Interior Department will reach the right conclusion if he is confirmed. For the reasons I have stated, I cannot vote to confirm Mr. Bernhardt. Should he be confirmed, I again ask that he fully recuse himself from all matters related to former clients during his tenure as a lobbyist. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider this nomination before voting. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 6 minutes prior to the scheduled vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the President's nominee for Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt. Once again, instead of draining the swamp, President Trump is flooding the swamp with a whole new breed of corporate-sponsored creatures. Already, we have a former coal lobbyist running the Environmental Protection Agency. We have chemical lobbyists running the EPA's chemical safety programs. And unless we put the brakes on Mr. Bernhardt's nomination, soon we will have a fossil fuel lobbyist running the Department of Interior. For a State like New Jersey, which depends on a healthy, vibrant coastal [[Page S2420]] economy, Mr. Bernhardt's extensive ties to the fossil fuel industry are troubling, to say the least. The Secretary of the Interior is charged with the stewardship of public lands and waters and safeguarding our natural resources for generations to come. Yet the Washington Post has reported that Mr. Bernhardt has so many conflicts of interest that he must carry a card around just to keep track of them. Think about that. Mr. Bernhardt has such deep ties to fossil fuel companies with business pending before the Interior Department that he cannot keep track of them. How Mr. Bernhardt would approach his position if confirmed as Secretary of Interior is no mystery. During his time as Acting Secretary, he has gained a reputation as a general in the Trump administration's war on science. Reports suggest that he has suppressed scientific evidence in order to benefit corporate interests at the expense of environmental protection. Rather than be responsive to Congress about our concerns, Mr. Bernhardt has displayed a stunning lack of transparency. Like many Trump nominees, he has failed to respond to basic inquiries from Congress. For example, on March 20, I sent a letter--along with Senator Feinstein, Senator Merkley, and 15 of our colleagues--requesting that the Acting Secretary respond to a series of questions about his views on offshore drilling. With his hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee quickly approaching, we asked Mr. Bernhardt to respond prior to coming before Congress. This way, committee members could have at least a baseline understanding of his views while crafting their questions. We received no response.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1813506I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNP-JYY1-JDG9-Y12X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"28955\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Kenneth Kiyul Lee, of California, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Pentagon Oversight Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to shed light on yet another really dark cloud that is hanging over our Department of Defense. In fact, for decades, a dark cloud of fiscal mismanagement has loomed large over the Pentagon. During my very first term here in the Senate, I began my quest to bring fiscal accountability to the Pentagon. Four decades later, I am still keeping tabs on the money trail. That money trail is sometimes difficult to follow. Back then, it was a bit like David taking on Goliath. We all know that the United States of America has the strongest and mightiest military in the world. I am thankful for that because a strong military is not meant to fight a war; it is meant to maintain the peace. We haven't had a world war III since we have had a strong military. Our brave men and women who serve in the U.S Armed Forces protect our shores at home and abroad to keep us safe and to protect the blessings of liberty for our children and grandchildren. That is exactly why it is so very important to keep check on the Pentagon's ledgers, to help make sure that every tax dollar assigned to the Nation's defense is actually spent effectively and not squandered on waste, fraud, and abuse. With the help of brave whistleblowers who stuck their necks out to ``commit truth,'' I stuck my neck out during the Reagan administration. That is when I learned about the Pentagon's little shop of price horrors. Of course, ripping off the taxpayers started during the Revolutionary War, when contractors sold rotten meat to the Continental Army, and it continued during the Civil War, when profiteers sold ammunition filled with sawdust and shoddy shoes and horses to the Union Army. It looks like it continues to this day. Back in 1985, Americans will recall, the Defense Department was shelling out vast amounts of taxpayer dollars for spare parts. Remember back then the $450 hammers and the $640 toilet seats? That sounds like a real bargain compared to the more recent wasteful spending at the Pentagon, such as the $1,280 coffee mug and the $14,000 toilet seat lid. Obviously, the cost of waste is getting a whole lot more expensive for our taxpayers. Back in the 1980s, I fought to win a spending freeze on unchecked spending sprees. Misspending and overspending were riddling the defense budget at the expense of the American taxpayer. Military readiness drives the spending decisions that Members of Congress make when we cast our votes on the defense budget. Our constituents expect their elected representatives to make sure that the moms and dads, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters who are serving our country in uniform are well equipped with the best resources money can buy. But they also expect their elected representatives to make sure their hard-earned dollars that are withheld from every paycheck-- their tax dollars--aren't being ripped off by greedy corporations, like TransDigm Group, Inc., which I will speak about in a moment. That is why I conduct robust oversight of defense spending. As a taxpayer watchdog--and all of us are supposed to be watchdogs, and all of us would claim to be watchdogs--it is our [[Page S2846]] responsibility and my responsibility to make sure every defense dollar is spent as effectively and as efficiently as possible. Every dollar lost to waste, fraud, and abuse harms military readiness, and it also lines the pockets of somebody else at taxpayers' expense. Trimming the fat in a bloated bureaucracy won't happen in the shadows. There is no magic wand to wave either. If there is one thing I have learned in my years of oversight, transparency matters. Transparency brings accountability. Every time I come to the floor to talk about the fiscal mess at the Pentagon, I get a bit of deja vu. Earlier, I said my fraud-fighting efforts in the 1980s could be compared to David v. Goliath. Now let's fast-forward to this year, 2019. I am still here working as hard as ever to do away with wrongdoing and extract fiscal accountability at the Pentagon. Today, some might say that job is like the one performed by the famous character in Greek mythology who was destined to roll that heavy stone up the hill and to do it from then until eternity. Congressional oversight can be extremely tedious, and it can be time- consuming, but, as I like to remind each of the other 534 Members of Congress, it is essential to our country that we exercise this system of checks and balances. Without it, the dark fiscal cloud looming over the Pentagon would swell bigger and bigger and bigger. Oversight work may feel like an uphill climb, but oversight is not futile in the end. That is why I keep my shoulder to the wheel--to hold people at the Pentagon accountable, to protect taxpayers, and most importantly, when it comes to a defense dollar, to make sure we have our military readiness. Right now, I am here today to share some new details about the broken record of fiscal mismanagement at the Department of Defense. No matter how high I turn up the volume, the overdogs at the Pentagon remain tone deaf to fiscal integrity. Consider the recent report by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. It is called ``Review of Parts Purchased From TransDigm Group Inc.'' First, I want to compliment Senator Warren and two Representatives, Ro Khanna and Tim Ryan, for getting the ball rolling with their request asking the inspector general to look into the contract--this contractor's pricing structure. We need all hands on deck in Congress to conduct oversight, so I thank these other Members of Congress just named. After digging into the details, I can only conclude that the Pentagon is still, after all these years, stuck on autopilot. No one on board in the Pentagon's mother ship seems to bother to steer its ``fiscal ship'' into shape. Fiscal integrity somehow got lost in the spare parts horror story I am about to tell. In fact, I was more than dismayed with the response from the internal watchdogs at the DOD IG office. Their team wrote the report, and yet the inspector general leadership team seemed to show no urgency whatsoever to fix the problem they described. This tells me I also need to keep a tight leash on the internal watchdogs leading the Department of Defense inspector general's office. Their February report exposes a galactic price gouging, colossal ripple, and out-of-this-world waste. It reads like a sequel to the same financial shenanigans that have turned the Pentagon into a taxpayer money pit. Change out the name of the contractor, inflate the charges, submit the invoice and voila--the American taxpayer is on the hook for another fixed-price, sole source contract. For this report, the inspector general examined one contractor, TransDigm Group. In total, the inspector general analyzed 113 contracts between January 2015 and January 2017. They reviewed 47 spare parts the Department of Defense purchased from this contractor. In just those 2 years, the inspector general found TransDigm overcharged the Pentagon by $16-1/10th million out of a total of $29-7/10th million in contracts. The reasonable profit threshold is considered by the Department of Defense to be 15 percent or below. The IG found that TransDigm earned excess profits on 46 of the 47 parts sold to the Defense Department. On 17 of those parts, TransDigm earned more than a 1,000-percent profit. Remarkably, the highest profit percentage was 4,436 percent. It is obvious to our taxpayers that that is a fleecing of the American taxpayer. Pulling the wool over the eyes of Congress and the taxpayers will only stop with transparency--which transparency will bring accountability. So that is why I am here today. Just think for a minute about the big picture. This report is just one snapshot of a much larger problem. It is kind of a spit in the ocean when you consider the enormous $716 billion defense budget. Just imagine the boatloads of bloat elsewhere in the bureaucracy. The Department of Defense is obligated under Federal law and under regulations to uphold basic measures of fiscal integrity. So where do we go from here? The inspector general made just a few paltry recommendations. For starters, it directed contracting officers to request voluntary refunds for excess profits. Guess the chances of getting voluntary refunds. Let me suggest that I would not advise taxpayers to hold their breath on a voluntary refund. The inspector's general recommendations, then, have no teeth. Their recommendations are insufficient. What is worse, the inspector general leadership team claims no single Department of Defense official is responsible for this price gouging that goes on. So let me repeat: The inspector general leadership team, the internal watchdog for fiscal integrity and compliance at the Department of Defense, is effectively saying something like this: No one person at the Department of Defense can be held accountable for waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayers' money. Obviously, to the taxpayers listening or anybody else, this illustrates a cavalier attitude toward taxpayer money that former Secretary of Defense James Mattis sought to extinguish. By the way, I wrote him a note, complimenting him on some statements he made about taking care of some of these problems. The decades-long odyssey of misspending at the Pentagon keeps going around and around and around. That is why--the way I see it--the Department of Defense has a fundamental responsibility to uphold fiscal integrity. After reviewing the IG report and meeting with its auditing team and the Department of Defense pricing czar, I have reached three conclusions. No. 1, fiscal control at the Department of Defense is AWOL. The Pentagon will never clean up its books if it cannot properly track the money trail and connect the dots. Consider why the Department of Defense contracting officers were unable to even certify if a profit was ``fair and reasonable.'' Do you know why? It was because they could not obtain critical cost data at the company TransDigm. In the most egregious case--that case I mentioned where there was a 4,436-percent profit margin for just one spare part--the contracting officer--you will not believe this-- certified that the price was fair and reasonable. There is something very, very wrong about that procedure. A whopping 4,000-percent profit margin for a spare part doesn't square with our midwestern commonsense standard. No. 2, the leadership team at the IG office has exhibited an alarming hands-off approach toward stopping waste, fraud, and abuse. The lack of urgency and the failure to hold anyone accountable is very revealing. It sends a signal throughout the chain of command: Just keep on signing contracts; keep ordering spare parts; keep up business as usual. Lastly, it shows that no one will be held accountable for price gouging. No. 3, the pattern of price gouging at TransDigm and its subsidiaries has gone unimpeded for decades. It has amassed exclusive rights to sell these spare parts to the Pentagon. In fact, the Defense Department accounted for 34 percent of its sales in 2017. TransDigm exploited its business model and took advantage of its sole source position to leverage higher prices. Now, as a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee--and still a member of that committee--I have examined anticompetitive business practices over a long period of time, including those in agriculture and the pharmaceutical sectors of our economy. It is very concerning to me when [[Page S2847]] contracting arrangements, like those between TransDigm and its 100 subsidiaries, are effectively a monopoly. It is like an octopus with 100 arms putting the squeeze on the Pentagon. Effectively, the Pentagon is at the mercy of TransDigm--which owns the intellectual property--to buy the spare parts it needs to build the Nation's critical weapon systems. That leaves the American taxpayer on the hook for exorbitant price gouging. The inspector general report found that TransDigm's choke hold has added up to tens of millions of dollars overcharging to the taxpayer. This is a good time to refresh people's memories about my legislative and oversight work with anticompetitive business practices. It is pretty simple. Monopolies invite government regulation. If that is the road TransDigm wants to continue following, I am here to deliver a message. The jig is up on this cozy relationship. The buck stops here. I have written a letter to Acting Secretary Shanahan about these flawed contracts and failures to identify price gouging. I have asked him to make measurable recommendations on how to restore accountability and end this price gouging. One thing is crystal clear. Transparency and competition are MIA--missing in action--when the Pentagon buys spare parts from TransDigm and its subsidiaries. Now, thank God the other body, the House of Representatives, its Committee on Oversight and Reform, called an oversight hearing this week to examine TransDigm and its price-gouging shenanigans. Congress has a constitutional duty of oversight to keep check on taxpayers' money and hold government accountable. As I said earlier, we need all hands on deck to root out wasteful spending. Once again, we are back to square one. The Pentagon has flunked a fundamental benchmark of fiscal responsibility and stewardship. It is one of Washington's worst kept secrets. Year after year, Congress shovels more money into the Pentagon coffers to ensure we maintain the best military in the world, and I express my support for the military. I express my support that a strong department of national defense is also a strong keeper of the peace because we might not be challenged, and we are going to be able to help keep peace around the world, but year after year, the Pentagon squanders hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. Some people at the Pentagon seem to think that paying $16 million in excess profits somehow seems to be small potatoes. In my letter to the Acting Defense Secretary, I made it clear that I am not one of those people. I have asked him to answer a direct question. That question is this: What specific steps is he going to take to stop the profiteers from pilfering taxpayer money? Contracts like I have described today between TransDigm and the Pentagon are shortchanging the troops, fleecing the taxpayers, and tarnishing its reputation. As Justice Brandeis said, ``sunshine is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' So I am here today to pull back the curtains on the TransDigm audit. The American people need the sun to shine in on price gouging at the Pentagon so we can root out the wasteful spending here and elsewhere. Transparency is the best ammunition that we have to chase away the dark fiscal crowd looming along the shores of the Potomac. Recognition of the Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. National Police Week Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for always staying on top of things like this. Mr. President, first, I would like to talk about Police Week. Today we observe Peace Officers Memorial Day, the heart of National Police Week. We all remember the men and women in law enforcement who have made the ultimate sacrifice, and we pause to say thank you to all of our police officers who work day and night to keep our communities safe. I want to share a special thanks to all of our law enforcement members visiting from New York, who, in my view, are the gold standard in police work. I grew up in a neighborhood where police officers lived. I played with their children at their houses. You would always know sort of instinctively, even as a kid, when that phone rang and the spouse-- almost always, in those days, the wife of a police officer--heard the phone ring, what went through her head a little bit is this: I hope that is not the call I dreaded. This is the job of police officers and their families--that is, to risk their safety for our safety--and they do a great job. As we recognize their contributions, we should acknowledge what we could do in Congress to make their jobs safer and easier. We can make our streets safer by passing comprehensive background check legislation. We can help law enforcement combat foreign opioid trafficking by passing the bipartisan Fentanyl Sanctions Act and the POWER Act, which provides handheld scanning devices. When a police officer is on a drug bust, they can tell if fentanyl is part of a crime scene there, and they can take precautions to protect themselves, because we know how deadly fentanyl is, even if it gets on your skin or in your nostrils. We can also do more to care for the families of fallen officers. That is why I have been so proud to fight alongside my colleague Senator Gillibrand and so many others to make sure that the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund has the necessary funding. Last Friday, the New York Police Department, or the NYPD, added the names of nearly 50 police officers to the 9/11 memorial wall, all of whom died in 9/11-related illnesses. It is our duty to take care of these families, and the first step is making sure that the Victims Compensation Fund has enough funds to compensate them. I say to our law enforcement officers two words: Thank you. Thank you for your service. It is an honor to represent you in the Senate, and we are all grateful for the sacrifices you make every day. Nominations Mr. President, now on judges, during the same week that we mark the 65th anniversary of the historic ``Brown v. Board of Education'' decision, Leader McConnell has scheduled votes on nominees whose views directly contradict the spirit of equality and justice that Brown represents. It is appalling. These new people we are putting on the bench turn the clock so backward after we have made so much progress, many of it through the courts. Consider the nomination of Michael Truncale of Texas. He has peddled conspiracies of ``widespread voter fraud'' and once called President Obama an ``un-American imposter'' who ``bows to Arab Sheikhs and other world leaders.'' This is a man who we are putting on the bench, a man who is supposed to be judicious, thoughtful, and sees both sides. What we are putting on the bench is hard-right ideologues who will do damage to this country for a generation. Mr. Truncale was approved by the Republican Senate yesterday for a seat on the district court in Texas, and he is going to sit on that bench for life--a man who says things like this and who thinks like this. I have always tried to put on the bench people who are moderate. So many of us have. Bill Clinton did. Barack Obama did. Here we have a parade of narrow ideologues, and that is not who should be on the bench because they will make law rather than interpret the law. Here is another one, Kenneth Lee of California. His past writings reveal shocking positions on race and diversity, affirmative action, educational opportunity, and women's reproductive freedom. He once wrote that multiculturalism is a ``malodorous sickness'' and that sexism--sexism, which we have all seen and heard about and a little more than half of our population experiences--is ``irrelevant pouting.'' That is a man who should be on the bench? If confirmed today, Mr. Lee may preside over cases dealing with gender discrimination. Consider Wendy Vitter, nominated to the Eastern District of Louisiana. She once promoted the idea that contraceptives caused cancer and claimed that Planned Parenthood kills 150,000 women annually. She also refused to acknowledge that Brown v. Broad was correctly decided. On this very anniversary, that is who is on the floor to be voted on in lockstep by all the folks here on the Republican side. She refused to acknowledge that Brown v. [[Page S2848]] Board was correctly decided, saying instead that the decision was correct with the benefit of hindsight--whatever that means. In the same district, where 6-year-old Ruby Bridges became the first African- American child to attend an all-White elementary school in the South, the Senate will consider confirming someone who claims that hindsight was needed to understand why the decision that allowed Ruby to go to the same school as a White child wasn't correct. That is who we are putting on the bench. These are not just conservatives. We understand that the President and Republicans will put in conservatives, but hard-right, narrow ideologues who show no understanding or sympathy for people who don't look like them or pray like them or marry like them--what is wrong here? It is not hard. If you need the benefit of hindsight to understand that Brown v. Board of Education, which brought an end to school segregation and led to the end of American apartheid, was correctly decided, you shouldn't be a Federal judge. I urge my colleagues, in the spirit of the Brown anniversary and what it means, to oppose Ms. Vitter's nomination this afternoon. Puerto Rico Mr. President, now on Puerto Rico, briefly, as negotiations on a final package of disaster aid continue, I want to stress to everyone that we must remain focused on reaching an agreement as swiftly as possible. Disaster-stricken Americans in the West, the South, the Midwest, and 3 million citizens of Puerto Rico are waiting on Congress to deliver relief, in some cases for disasters that occurred over a year ago. Why is this held up? We know why. Republicans are not willing to give aid to Puerto Rico. There was a bill that would never pass the House and something they didn't think originally, when President Trump said: Don't do it. And they just bowed down. They thought they could roll over the House and the Democratic minority in the Senate, who wouldn't stand up for certain Americans. Well, we did. Now, thankfully, we are making progress. Republicans are realizing that Puerto Ricans cannot be left out of the package, but now we must avoid poison pills at all costs. President Trump, if he sticks his thumb into this again and asks for something unreasonable, will delay disaster aid once again, just as he did before. To my Republican colleagues, let's do this together. Let's do it in the right way. Let's do it in the way that can pass the House. President Trump will sign the bill. We have to make sure this legislation gets across the finish line. Every time the President intervenes and Republican colleagues go along, it gets held up even further. Abortion Mr. President, on the Alabama abortion bill, last night the Republican Alabama Senate passed, perhaps, the most draconian abortion law in the country. It bans abortion in every stage of pregnancy, imposes criminal penalties--criminal penalties--on any doctor who performs one, and includes no exception in the case of rape or incest, even if the victim is a child. If a child is raped, they have to have the baby. The Alabama bill is as extreme as it gets. It is a clear attack on women's freedom. It contravenes a woman's constitutional right to make private medical decisions. It would deeply harm women, turn doctors into criminals, and deny the right of rape victims, even if they are children, to make personal medical decisions. The Alabama abortion bill is plainly inhumane. It should never have passed. The Governor should not sign it. If she does, it ought to be swiftly struck down by the courts. Iran Mr. President, on Iran, over of the past few days, it has come to light in public reporting that the Trump administration's national security team has reviewed a plan to deploy as many as 120,000--yes, you heard that right, 120,000--U.S troops in the Mideast should tensions with Iran escalate. I was stunned to read this report in the New York Times yesterday. The administration just started a maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against Iran, but is it simultaneously reviewing plans for war? That would make no sense. Meanwhile, the President oddly denied the report while also saying he would ``absolutely'' send ground troops to the Middle East. But if he did, it would be a ``heck''--and I am paraphrasing--``of a lot more troops [than 120,000].'' Did we learn the lessons of the last decade? Do we know that we have to spend our time focusing on building up this country here, not build roads and bridges in the Middle East but do them here? There is an alarming lack of clarity here. There is a lack of strategy, and there is a lack of consultation. The President ought to come up with a strategy and make it clear to Congress. An adventure like this--120,000 troops or a large number of troops--should have to be approved by Congress. It certainly should be discussed with Congress ahead of time. There need to be open hearings and closed briefings with the committees of jurisdiction immediately. Any potential increase in our military presence in the Middle East should require consultation with Congress, and anything beyond that would require this body to act. President Trump, what is your strategy? Where are you headed? Why aren't you talking to Congress about it? Public Housing Mr. President, finally, on public housing, it was reported last week that the Department of HUD has proposed a rule that would bar families with mixed immigration status from receiving public housing assistance, even if everyone but one member of the family is a legal resident. So if it is a family of six--a mother who is an American citizen, four children who are American citizens, but a husband who is not and who is not here legally--they kick them all out. It risks displacing tens of thousands of legal residents and of American citizens, including 55,000 children. The administration has created crisis after crisis with the immigration community. Are they going to create another one and take 55,000 young American children, almost all of whom are citizens, and just kick them out on the streets when we know there is very little affordable housing? What a cruel and callous policy. It is another example of the Trump administration's desire to separate families and disrupt communities. There is nothing to say about this proposed rule but that it is cruel, wrong-headed, and would lead to even more chaos than the administration has created already. In an effort to appear even more punitive toward immigrants, the administration has conjured up a rule that could potentially force tens of thousands of children into homelessness or away from their families. My message to President Trump and Secretary Carson is simple: Scrap this idea now. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized. Maiden Speech Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, it is an honor to rise today to speak in this Chamber on behalf of the people of Missouri. When I think of those who have served my State here before me, I am humbled. When I think of the true and strong Missourians who have sent me here, I am sobered, because to represent them will be a great responsibility indeed. I pledge to my fellow Missourians that I will work at this task with all the strength that God can give me, and I will serve without fear and without favor to any man. We Missourians are known for our frankness, and today I will be frank because this is a moment of great need for my State and for our Nation. This Nation was born in a revolution by ``We the People'' and premised on a revolutionary faith that it is the people--the common man and woman who make democracy work--and it is the calling of every generation to renew that revolution for their day. In our time, our revolutionary faith is faltering, and in the heartland of this country, the great challenge of our age is unfolding. I come from a town called Lexington, MO. It is a small place, but a proud one. It is a place where people wake early and work late to make a life for themselves and their children. It is a place where people value honesty and gumption and life's simple pleasures: a fine morning in a deer stand, reading [[Page S2849]] to the kids before bed, and Sunday dinner at Mom's. Although it is humble, it is a place that reflects the dignity and quiet greatness of the working men and women. These are the people who explored a continent, who built the railroads, and who opened the West. These are the workers whose labor launched the Industrial Revolution and whose ingenuity made the American economy the marvel of the world. These are the families who have rallied to this country's flag at every hour of danger and who bear the burden of defending our Nation even now. These are the patriots who man the fire department and coach the Little League. These are the generous who give $25 a month out of their gas money to assist people halfway around the globe whom they will never meet just because they believe in helping others. They don't ask for much, and they live by a simple creed: Give the best of yourself to your family, your community, and your fellow man. America is a place of promise, because in these hearts, honor lives. These working men and women are confronting crises today, and, as they do, so does our democracy. After years of sacrifice, the great American middle is being pushed aside by a new arrogant aristocracy. The new aristocrats seek to remake society in their own image, to engineer an economy that works for the elite but few else, and to fashion a culture that is dominated by their own preferences. When they think of helping their fellow citizens, they think of making everyone else more like themselves. And Washington has just gone along. This town has embraced the politics of elite values and elite ambition rather than building opportunities to thrive in the great and broad American middle. This has left middle America--the great American middle class--under siege, battling the loss of respect and work, the decline of home and family, and an epidemic of loneliness and despair. This is the crisis of our time. I am afraid you wouldn't know it to listen to the talk of this town much of the time. As the crisis deepens, the political establishment looks the other way, rehearsing and rehashing the political debates of 30 or 40 years ago. There is no time for that any longer. The 21st century is upon us, and the great struggle of this century can no longer wait. The crisis that we face goes to the heart of our revolution. The United States is unique in history as a republic governed not by a select elite but by the working man and woman, because we believe it is through the working man and woman that God chooses to change the world. That change comes not through spectacular feats of daring or glory but through everyday work and everyday sacrifice and everyday acts of courage and love. It has been the proud working people, our farmers and mechanics, and teachers and tradesmen who have defined the character of this country. For too long now, neither our economy nor our culture has lent them much support. Instead, our policymakers have entrenched the new elites and undermined the way of life that once bound this country together. It is time to face the facts. Over the last 40 years, our economy has worked best for those at the top--the wealthy and the well-educated. If you have a job in Silicon Valley or an expensive and prestigious degree, this economy has worked for you, and Washington has focused on how to get more people to join this elite. But if you want a life built around the place where you grew up, if your ambition is not to start a tech business but to join the family business, to serve in the PTA or in your local church, well, you are told that you are not a success, and you are told that you are on your own. This is no accident. The people who make the rules now, who run our large corporations, and who set the tone for our popular culture all belong to the same class. This economy has been their economy. They made it for themselves. But in places like the one where I grew up in middle Missouri, good- paying jobs that you can raise a family on are going away. The jobs go overseas or south of the border or to cities on the coasts. Once vibrant towns decline, taking with them the network of schools and neighborhoods and churches that make up middle-class life. Rural America has been particularly hard hit. Rural Americans' life expectancy has not just leveled off. It has actually dropped, and for women without a high school degree, that drop has been staggering. In some rural places, residents struggle with outright deprivation. My home State contains some of the poorest counties in America, all in rural places that once boasted thriving small towns. As those communities struggle, want sets in. The crisis reaches well beyond economics. The message that Washington has sent our whole society is loud and clear: Our elites are the people who matter and those who aspire to join them. Everyone else is unimportant or backward. Millions of Americans are left with a sense that the people who run this country view them with nothing but contempt and value them as nothing but consumers. These trends tear at our country's social fabric, and they undermine our common ethic of citizenship because being a free person and being an American isn't just about what you can buy. It is about the pride that comes in supporting a family. It is about contributing something of worth to your community. It is about being able to look a neighbor in the eye and know that you are his equal. It is about respect, and too many Americans haven't been getting it. They are certainly not getting it from our cultural elite. The media, Hollywood, and academia relentlessly press their values and their priorities on the rest of us. They advocate liberation from the duties of family and tradition. They look down on the plain virtues of patriotism, self-giving, and faith. They idealize fame and preach self- realization through consuming more stuff, and as they do, they assault the foundations of the great American middle. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised, then, at the epidemic of loneliness and despair that is spreading across working communities. Fewer young people are getting married and starting families. Drug addiction is surging. The opioid menace has ravaged every sector, every age group, and every geography of working people. It is not only pills. It is heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, meth, and, of course, marijuana that have flooded our streets and our homes. Everywhere, deaths of despair are mounting among farmers and among the young. Most shockingly, the young are the hope of our society, but in America today, they are taking their lives in numbers we have never seen in our history. The well-off frequently note that our Nation has never been richer, but the tragedy of youth suicide betrays a profound poverty of hope. And is that really so surprising? Today's youth must make their way in a society increasingly defined not by the genuine and personal love of family and church but by the cold and judgmental world of social media. A typical young person is bombarded by video games and violence and the relentless status-seeking imposed and modeled by our cultural elite. There is no more shocking illustration of our cultural poverty and no more damning indictment of our cultural leaders than these lost lives. The sum of it all is that too many Americans are losing their standing as citizens. They are losing their voice in the life of this Nation, and with that, they are losing their liberty. To be free is to have a voice. It is to have a say, and it is to have the power of self- government. The chattering class often tells us that all of this--the jobs, the despair, and the loss of standing--is a result of forces beyond anyone's control, as if that is an excuse to do nothing, but in fact, it is not true. Today's society benefits those who shaped it, and it has been shaped not by working men and women but by the new aristocratic elite. Big banks, big tech, and big multinational corporations, along with their allies in the academy and the media-- these are the aristocrats of our age. They live in the United States, but they consider themselves citizens of the world. They operate businesses or run universities here, but their primary loyalty is to their own agenda for a more unified, progressive, and profitable global order. These modern aristocrats often claim to be a meritocracy, and many of them truly believe they are. What they don't see or will not acknowledge is that the [[Page S2850]] society they have built works mainly for themselves. They have effectively run this country for decades, and their legacy is national division and national decline. It is time to reclaim our revolutionary heritage and reassert the democracy of ``We the People.'' To those who despair at the task ahead, I say the hour is not too late and the crisis is not too deep for the determined effort of a great people, and to those who feel forgotten and unheard, I say this is your time. Now we must stand together to renew the promise of our enduring revolution. We must put aside the tired orthodoxies of years past and forge a new politics of national renewal. We must begin by acknowledging that GDP growth alone cannot be the measure of this Nation's greatness, and so it cannot be the only aim of this Nation's policy because our purpose is not to make a few people wealthy but to sustain a great democracy. We need not just a bigger economy but a better society. We need a society that offers rewarding work for every worker who wants it, wherever she is from, whatever degree he might have, whether their ambition is to start a business or to start a family. We need a society that will allow towns and neighborhoods to flourish across the great heartland of this country and not just in the megacities of the coasts. We need a society that puts American workers first, that prioritizes them over cheap goods from abroad and offers them the chance to better their station. All this we must fight for and more. We need to repair the torn fabric of our common life. We need a politics that prioritizes strong marriages and encourages strong families, where children can know their parents and be nurtured by their love. We need strong schools and churches and co-ops because these are the things that make liberty possible, for liberty is more than selling or buying or the right to be left alone. Liberty is the ability to master our own fate and, as a free people, to set our own course. That is the promise of the American Revolution, and we will renew it for our day. Washington has ignored the need for this renewal for too long. It has rested easy with the priorities of an earlier age. Now it must wake up and face the facts of this day. Now we must ask new questions, force new debates, articulate new priorities, and find new solutions to make the great American middle thrive again. This is not the work of a day or a season. It is the work of a generation. We will make it the work of this generation and so do our part to see the success of liberty in our time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Welcoming Senator Hawley of Missouri Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am glad to be joined by my good colleague Senator Hawley. He brings incredible depth to the issues we talked about. He grew up in Lexington, MO, I understand, in smalltown America. He was educated in some of the best schools in our country and had the great good fortune to be assigned as a John Roberts law clerk in the office of another John Roberts law clerk and the good judgment to convince her to marry him. He and Erin are a valuable asset to our State. They have two wonderful little boys. I have enjoyed the time we have had together and look forward to more time with Josh and his family. He clearly thinks deeply about the issues that affect the country. He is focused on not only the present but the future. Those are all good things. We have jointly had the opportunity to represent a State that is as diverse as any State in the country. I think a week, a month, a year in Missouri is probably the closest thing to that same period of time if you could somehow condense the entire United States into one place, where sometimes St. Louis is seen as the westernmost eastern city and Kansas City may be more like Denver than St. Louis. Northern Missouri is more like Iowa. I would state to Senator Grassley that when crossing the border there, you certainly can't tell when you cross from Missouri farmland into Iowa farmland and the small cities and small towns. The Bootheel, Delta South in character where Josh and I live in Springfield has that northwest Arkansas-Oklahoma vitality that is different from anywhere else in our State. As we travel actively around our State, as we both do, I think we have a great sense of so much of what happens in the country. It is still the population center of America, if not the exact geographic center. Missouri is where the country comes together. Josh had an opportunity last year to talk to tens of thousands of Missourians about that and to communicate in other ways with millions of Missourians about that. I am glad he is here and glad to welcome him to the work we will be doing together. We won't agree every single day because if we did, I guess we could have just one Senator and give him two votes. But it gives us a chance to talk about the issues we face and what that means for our State but also what it means to the country. I am delighted he has committed himself to public service. Missourians have now elected him to two statewide offices in less than 3 years, and they have expressed that confidence in him. With great frequency, I run into students both Josh and Erin had when they were both teaching at the Law School at the University of Missouri, and they always tell me Erin was the best teacher they ever had and often tell me Joshua was the best teacher they ever had. They must not have had a class with Erin yet. But I am delighted that they are both part of the discussion that will lead America forward. I look forward to engaging in that discussion with them and partnering in the things we can find to do together and getting a chance to represent our strong, unique State that I think is ready to merge into a greater future, whether that is with all the healthcare and ag research we see happening, the GEOINT focus that is coming into our State because of the new NGA, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency facility being built there. This is a time of great opportunity. I am glad to have the chance to share part of that opportunity and look at that future with my colleague Josh Hawley and certainly want to join others in welcoming him officially to the Senate today as he makes his maiden speech to the Senate. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to join with my colleague, the senior Senator from Missouri, and congratulate the junior Senator from Missouri on some wonderful remarks. I came into the Congress with Senator Blunt from the House of Representatives over 20 years ago, which I guess makes us the old guys around here, but it warms my heart and gives me great hope for the future to see the caliber and the quality of people who are entering public life in the form of people like Senator Hawley. He is somebody who not only brings great intellect, great passion, and great conviction, but he is a principled leader who is here for the right reasons and profoundly wants to make a difference for the future of this country. In his remarks, he touched upon the genius of our Founders, and that is that average Americans--working men and women in this country--have an opportunity to make a difference with their voices and with their votes by entering the public arena and being a part of our democracy. That is really what this is all about. That is what our work should be about every day, is empowering them to do a better job in raising their families and serving their communities. I certainly look forward to continuing our work with the new Senator from Missouri and with the rest of our colleagues here as we embark upon that task. I hope we can be successful in restoring that vision our Founders had for what this country should be and in each day waking up and thinking about the fact that it is not about us; it is about what we do to secure a better and brighter future consistent with that brilliant past we have been so blessed by because of those who have come before and have been willing to enter public life and make a difference. So thank you and congratulations to Senator Hawley. It is a great honor to [[Page S2851]] serve with you, and we look forward to working with you in the days and weeks and months ahead to serve the very people you talked about in your remarks. National Military Appreciation Month Mr. President, May is National Military Appreciation Month, a chance for us to honor the service of those who have kept our Nation free for 243 years. For me, when I reflect on our military men and women, there are always two things in the forefront of my mind: my dad, Harold Thune, and the men and women of Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota and the South Dakota National Guard. My father was a fighter pilot who flew Hellcats off the USS Intrepid in the Pacific theater during World War II. I came to know the ``greatest generation'' through my dad--their humility, their quiet service, their patriotism, and their deep dedication to the cause of freedom. I have come to know the men and women of today's military through Ellsworth and through South Dakota's National Guard and the great work, the extraordinary work they do day in and day out, the professionalism, the skill, the talent, and the dedication they bring to the work of defending America and America's freedoms. Ellsworth has been on my mind in particular this week because right now the Air Force is conducting a large force exercise involving B-1 bombers, B-2s, B-52s, F-16s, C-17s, KC-135s, JSTARS and AWACS, and, for the first time, F-35s. My acquaintance with Ellsworth began during my time as a Member of the House of Representatives, but I really got to know the base and what it meant to the Rapid City area shortly after I became a Senator. Just a few months into my first term in the Senate, Ellsworth found itself targeted for closure by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. That summer of 2005 was a long one as we mobilized to protect the base. I don't think I missed a BRAC hearing in DC that summer. It didn't matter whether Ellsworth was on the agenda; I wanted to be there in case the chance to advocate for Ellsworth arose. Thanks to the efforts of a lot of dedicated people, we were victorious. We demonstrated to the Commission that Ellsworth was a vital national security asset and that moving the B-1 fleet from Ellsworth would actually cost money. We also made the case that the United States shouldn't put all of its eggs in one basket, that it shouldn't consolidate all of its assets in one location. By August, we had succeeded in having Ellsworth removed from the closure list. Since then, the congressional delegation, Ellsworth, and community leaders have worked hard to build up the base so that we never again find ourselves in that same position. In 2007, we saw the Air Force Financial Services Center open at Ellsworth. In 2011, we saw the arrival of the 89th Attack Squadron and its command and control stations for MQ-9 Reapers. In 2015, a decade-long mission paid off with the expansion of the training airspace for the base. The Powder River Training Complex is now the largest training airspace in the continental United States. It is undoubtedly partly thanks to this airspace that Ellsworth was just chosen not only as the home for the B- 21 training mission, the first bombers to the fleet, but operational squadrons as well. Once on the chopping block, Ellsworth is going from strength to strength, and South Dakota is deeply proud to host this crucial base. Ellsworth's airmen have played an essential role in the armed conflicts of recent years. Ellsworth's pilots have engaged targets in the Middle East using Predator and Reaper remotely piloted aircraft for vital reconnaissance, search and rescue, and strike missions. The Thunderbirds of the 34th Bomb Squadron and the Tigers of the 37th Bomb Squadron have flown countless missions, conducting strikes, providing deterrence, and delivering critical close air support. During Operation Odyssey Dawn, B-1s from Ellsworth launched from South Dakota, flew halfway around the world to Libya, dropped their bombs, and returned home--all in a single mission. This marked the first time in history that B-1s launched combat missions from the United States to strike targets overseas. During my time advocating for Ellsworth, I have had the chance to learn a lot about aircraft and the incredible capabilities of the U.S military, especially the capabilities of the U.S Air Force. But the greatest part of representing Ellsworth has been the chance to meet with and get to know its airmen, from the wing commanders and other base leaders to the airmen who care for the planes. Ultimately, no matter what technology we have, the strength of our fighting force comes down to our military men and women. It is because of the men and women we have that the United States has the strongest fighting force in the world. Members of the military are a special breed. At an age when many are focused on graduation ceremonies or summer vacations, they take a different path--a path that challenges them mentally and physically, that pushes them to their limits and then asks them to go further, that asks them to forget their own needs and to focus only on what they can do for others, and that asks them to forgo comfort for sacrifice, up to and including the sacrifice of their lives. At 18, at 21, these warriors pledge to lay down their lives for the rest of us, and they make that pledge again every day of their service, every morning when they wake up and head to work, whether that is the repair base at Ellsworth or a battlefield half a world away. I am profoundly grateful for the honor of representing some of the men and women of the U.S military here in the Senate. We owe our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and Coast Guard a debt we can never repay. As Military Appreciation Month continues and Armed Forces Day approaches, we can take the time to remember--to remember that we go about our lives in peace and freedom every day because of members of the U.S military who are standing watch for us. May God bless the members of the U.S military, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Abortion Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to start today by saying I am really appalled by the extreme, cruel, shameful abortion ban that was passed yesterday in Alabama. That legislation is nothing short of an attack on women, and it is part of a larger effort we are seeing today around the country to take away the constitutional right of women to safe, legal abortion and allowing politicians to make decisions for women about their bodies, their health, and their lives instead of trusting doctors and women. I want every woman reading the news this morning and wondering what this means for you, your family, and for your granddaughters to know I am with you, and I am going to keep fighting for you every step of the way. Nomination of Wendy Vitter Mr. President, I want to turn to speak about my opposition to Wendy Vitter's nomination, which is yet another step extreme politicians are taking to undermine women's rights and access to healthcare. I oppose Wendy Vitter's nomination to the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. President Trump and Vice President Pence have made it clear that they want to pack the Judiciary with far-right judges who will turn back the clock on reproductive rights, and this nominee is no exception. Time and again, Mrs. Vitter has advocated against women's reproductive rights using inflammatory language and falsehoods. She has demonstrated a keen sense of partisanship and a poor sense of judgment, starting with her initial response to the Senate Judiciary Committee's questionnaire. Mrs. Vitter left out information about her past statements in her response to the committee--the kinds of serious submissions Republicans have objected to with other nominees. I am [[Page S2852]] not talking about a small memory lapse. I am talking about nearly 200 additional pages that had to be added to her response once they were brought to light. I am not talking about insignificant statements, things that are hard to find or easy to forget. I am talking about campaign ads, panel discussions, political rallies. I am not talking about innocent uncontroversial comments. I am talking about the fearmongering of an activist who is entirely unfit for the Federal bench. Mrs. Vitter initially failed to disclose her remarks at a political rally opposing the construction of a Planned Parenthood clinic, remarks where she claimed Planned Parenthood--which, by the way, provides low- cost healthcare like cancer screenings and STI screenings and contraceptive care to millions of people. She claimed Planned Parenthood is responsible for killing 150,000 women a year. That is careless, it is reckless, and it is wrong. It is incredibly poor judgment for somebody who is being considered for a lifetime judicial appointment. She also failed to disclose the time she moderated a deeply dishonest panel called ``Abortion Hurts Women's Health.'' Mrs. Vitter prompted panelists to peddle misinformation about women's health, encouraging a discussion that falsely suggested abortion is linked to cancer and infertility. One panel spoke at length about a deeply inaccurate brochure she had authored called ``How the Pill Kills.'' As you can tell from that title, the brochure was loaded with glaring falsehoods, like the false claim that birth control causes breast cancer or that women on birth control are more likely to die a violent death. In response to that speaker's long string of very dangerous lies about women's healthcare, Mrs. Vitter encouraged the attendees to download the brochure, bring it to their doctors, and ask them to put it in their waiting rooms. It is incredibly alarming that a nominee for the Federal bench would be so willing to voice her support for such dangerous propaganda, especially when that same nominee is unwilling to voice her support for one of the landmark civil rights cases in our country's history, Brown v. Board of Education. During her confirmation hearing, Mrs. Vitter was asked whether Brown v. Board was decided correctly. It wasn't a trick question. Many past judicial nominees, including Chief Justice Roberts, have been able to answer it. Mrs. Vitter refused. This week, we are going to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the Brown v. Board decision. Do Republicans really want to mark this occasion by confirming a judge who has voiced more support for outright lies about women's health than for the historic decision that struck down State-sponsored segregation? This should be simple. Someone whose statements and record fail to support the Brown v. Board decision cannot be trusted with the responsibility of deciding the historic cases of tomorrow. Someone who has worked to spread misinformation about contraceptives and undermine the constitutional right to safe, legal abortion that is enshrined in Roe v. Wade cannot be trusted to fight for the truth or uphold women's reproductive rights. In other words, someone like Wendy Vitter cannot be trusted with a lifetime seat on a Federal bench. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this nomination. While President Trump and Vice President Pence may keep sending us these far- right nominees and Senate Republicans may keep jamming them through under the radar, Democrats are not going to stand by or stand down. They may try to push our courts to the right. We are going to keep pushing back. We are going to keep holding a spotlight on these nominees and making clear just how extreme they are, and we are going to keep fighting for women and men and families in this country. Thank you. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mental Health Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, I knew I wanted to make mental health one of my top priorities. As a Minnesotan, I am proud of the way our Senators have led the way on this important issue, from Paul Wellstone to Al Franken, to Amy Klobuchar. I am honored to have the chance to further our proud legacy when it comes to improving our mental health system, but that is not the only reason I have chosen to make mental health a focus. I am glad it has become a more prominent issue here in Washington, but I have noticed it usually comes to the forefront in the context of some unthinkable tragedy. When a high-profile celebrity takes his or her own life, we immediately want to reach out to other people who are suffering in silence. Of course, we do. That is not a bad thing. We can't repeat the number often enough. If you are having thoughts of suicide, please, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. Even if you aren't suffering from acute mental illness, put that number in your cell phone so you can, someday, help someone who is. On the other hand, when a profoundly disturbed person commits a horrible act of violence, we immediately want to intervene before the next time it happens. Of course, we do. When we bring up the need to improve our mental health system as the answer to the epidemic of mass shootings in America, though, we are making two huge mistakes. First, we are ignoring our responsibility to address a much more direct cause of these tragedies--guns. Second, we are unfairly and falsely stigmatizing mental illness. Here is another thing we can't say often enough: It is exceedingly rare that one's mental illness leads one to commit acts of violence. In fact, one is much more likely to be a victim of violence than to be a perpetrator, and we must not make it harder for people to seek help by falsely tagging them, as we do, as being potentially dangerous. Yes, these tragedies are reminders that we need to spend more time talking about mental health, but let's have the right conversation. For most people who struggle with mental illness in America, the struggle is not about life or death; it is about the quality of the lives we lead. Mental health is a continuum, and many of our fellow citizens fall somewhere along this continuum. These millions of Americans deserve our attention, and these millions of Americans deserve our help. The other reason I want to focus on mental health care while I am here in the Senate is that I am one of them. When it started for me, I thought I was just having a bad day or, really, a series of bad days. While growing up, I had always been a pretty cheerful kid, but at some point during my second year of college, I had started to find it harder and harder to cope with the daily challenges of life. Actually, it had been my roommate who had noticed that I had not been myself and hadn't been myself for a long time. She had suggested that I talk to someone over at the Student Health Services. It had been a completely foreign idea to me, and I had responded in the way a lot of people would have-- ``I have this.'' Eventually, I had realized that maybe I had been wrong about that. It was really hard to make that phone call, walk over to the counselor's office, and sit in the waiting room. I didn't know what to expect, and to be honest, I was embarrassed. The counselor's name was Charlotte. She was nice, had common sense, and wasn't patronizing or judgmental. She just asked me some simple questions about how I was feeling, and I remember what a relief it was just to talk about it. Over the course of a few months, Charlotte gave me some ideas about how to cope a little bit better with the challenges I was facing, and I would always walk out of her office feeling a little bit more courageous and a little bit more hopeful. Did I live happily ever after? Well, not quite. That is not how mental illness works. There isn't a box for when you are healthy and a box for when you are not. Like I said, it is a continuum, and you try to get a little closer to the healthy end every day. At one point in my thirties, though, I found myself sliding back in the wrong direction. There was nothing unusually traumatic going on in my life. [[Page S2853]] I had a career, and Archie and I were raising our two sons. We were busy, and we were tired, but that is the way it is when you are a young parent. Still, something was wrong. All who have suffered from depression have their own metaphors to describe it, but most can identify with the sensation of the color just sort of draining out of your world. The things that used to give you joy don't give you joy anymore. The things that you used to love to do may just make you exhausted. Basically, you are just trying to slog through the day. Of course, when you feel this way, just making it through the day is tough. I found myself struggling to be a good mom, a good wife, a good friend, a good colleague. I just felt off all the time--clumsy and slow. I forgot things and got angry at the drop of a hat. See, the thing is, depression messes with your memory. I will never forget when my young son asked me quietly and cautiously: ``Mom, are you OK?'' It was a spiral. The worse things got, the more frustrated I became, but I couldn't get it together. Down and down I went until I could no longer see hope on the horizon. I was never suicidal, but I struggled to function. I definitely wasn't living my best life. I really wasn't living at all. That is the reality of mental illness for millions of Americans. I am one of the lucky ones. I was lucky that my college had excellent mental health resources and that my roommate cared enough about me to urge me to take advantage of those resources. I was lucky that when my depression came back with a vengeance, I had health insurance that covered treatment. There was a therapist named Susan with the skill and the expertise to help me. Susan asked me a few questions: How are you sleeping? Terrible. Are you forgetting things? All the time. She then suggested that I take a diagnostic test, which basically consisted of answering questions like those. Even then, I was resistant. People often say that depression lies, and the biggest lie depression tells is that what is wrong with you is you. So you resist getting help because you refuse to accept that there is anything happening except that you stupidly forgot it was recycling day again. I went ahead and I did the diagnostic test, and Susan came back and said: Yes, you are clinically depressed, so let's talk about what we can do about it. One thing I would say to people who are resisting going in for that appointment is that even after I got that diagnosis, I was still in control. When Susan brought up the idea of medication, it was a suggestion and not an order. I will admit it--it was a suggestion I had a hard time with. I didn't want to become a different person. I didn't want some pill messing with my brain. What if it didn't work and I got worse? On the other hand, what if it did work? Would I really be better, or would it just be an illusion of feeling better? Susan convinced me to give it a try, and I was lucky again when the first medication we tried worked. I didn't feel better right away. There was no big milestone moment where I woke up and everything was great again. But I remember feeling like I was slowly coming out of a fog. The color started to seep back into my day a little bit more every day. I began to reengage with my family and my friends and my work, and I could see hope on the horizon again. After a couple of years on medication, I slowly ramped down, and I haven't had to get treatment since. As I said, there is no happily ever after when it comes to mental illness, but happier is possible. If anyone needs proof, just talk to me. So that is my story, but really it is the story of millions of Americans. I chose to share mine--first in an op-ed in the Rochester Post-Bulletin and now here on the floor of the Senate--because I want to urge anyone who struggles with depression or anxiety or substance abuse or post-traumatic stress disorder or any other mental health issue to reach out and seek help. Destigmatizing and demystifying mental illness is just the beginning. Everyone can be a friend to those in need by urging them to take advantage of the resources that are available to them, but the 100 of us here in the Senate have a responsibility to make sure those resources are available to everyone. We can't afford to leave holes in the net we build to catch people when they fall, especially when one of the biggest holes is in our schools. I have spent a lot of time over the last months having conversations with teachers and administrators in public schools across Minnesota. Time and again, when I ask them ``What keeps you up at night?'' they come back to the mental health of their students. They talk about the causes--everything from increased social pressure that comes from social media to the trauma of losing a parent to opioids--but they also tell me what the crisis really looks like at ground level. A principal in St. Paul told me about the regular phenomenon of an ambulance pulling up at the school doors, rushing to the aid of a student who has suffered a break. It has happened more than a half a dozen times at his school alone this year. Meanwhile, the principal in Parkers Prairie--a town in Otter Tail County of just over 1,000, people--tells me that she sees students experiencing homelessness and other trauma, students dealing with PTSD, and students with eating disorders. Just this year, she has had three students end up in the hospital for self-harming. They have a heroic social worker who comes in but only every other day because they have to share her with another school in the district. School psychologists across Minnesota tell me they are struggling to keep up with the number of kids who need urgent intervention to make sure that, for example, their behavioral issues don't become so significant that they get them kicked out of school altogether. As for kids whose issues are very real but not so acute--like the ninth grader whose anxiety makes her sick to her stomach every day-- they wind up stuck on waiting lists for treatment. And that is even before psychologists can do any active outreach to the students who haven't reached out for help. That is why last month I reintroduced my Mental Health Services for Students Act. This bill would create a grant program for school districts looking to expand the mental health services they are able to offer to students by partnering with community mental health system organizations. If we are going to get our arms around this crisis, we need to train more teachers, administrators, and members of the school community, including parents, to recognize when kids are struggling and to connect them with help. If we here in the Senate are serious about addressing mental health in our schools, we should pass this bill without delay. A comprehensive approach to mental health means improving the system all along the age continuum. Over in the HELP Committee, we will have an opportunity this year to reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or CAPTA. And I have a bill, sponsored in the House by my friend Representative Dean Phillips, that would improve the delivery of mental health services within our child welfare system. For example, our bill would make sure that young, at-risk children get important developmental screenings when they need it. We are learning that childhood trauma can be a major factor in future mental illness. The more we do to address the underlying trauma, whether it is poverty, the death or incarceration of a loved one or a parent, or sexual abuse, the better we address those issues, the better chance we will have of turning the tide on this epidemic. The mental health crisis isn't only affecting our kids; it is affecting our parents too. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control, one in five adults age 55 or older experiences a mental health issue, and a third of them never receive treatment. Men over the age of 75 have a higher suicide rate than any other age group. The social isolation that too often comes with aging or caring for a loved one isn't just unfortunate; it is a public health risk. Just as we have learned to reach out to the veterans in our lives and in our communities to let them know we are there for them if they are struggling, we should do the same for our elders. As the HELP Committee takes up the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act this year, I will be working to do my part. [[Page S2854]] Our mental health system should be there for people at every age, from nursery to nursing home. It should be there for people everywhere along the mental health continuum, offering everything from preventive care, to ongoing therapy for chronic conditions, to crisis support for those in acute distress. It should also be there for people in every ZIP Code, and unfortunately, some of the biggest holes in our system can be found in rural areas. As a Senator, I am proud to serve on the Agriculture Committee. I frequently meet with farm groups, and today mental health is one of the first topics to come up. Farming is an inherently stressful profession, especially these days, when the numbers for suicide prevention hotlines regularly appear in farm publications. But we need to include the entire rural community, from bankers and pastors to grocers and fertilizer sellers. We need to include them in this conversation, and we need to make sure that when people do reach out for help, there is help there for them. Unfortunately, rural communities in general are often underserved by mental health professionals compared to cities and suburbs. Many still have inconsistent access to the internet, meaning that even online resources can be out of reach for someone who is struggling. That is why, in the last farm bill, we set up a rural health liaison in the Department of Agriculture--someone who understands the specific needs of rural communities and is charged with paying attention to a crisis that has too often lurked beneath the surface. Last year, Senator Murkowski and I worked together to pass a law that would provide mental health professionals in the National Health Service Corps with greater flexibility in where they practice and deliver care, increasing the resources available in underserved rural communities. I hope my colleagues will join me in continuing to take action to address the mental health crisis, and I hope that sharing my own story will make it easier for more Americans to add their voices to this fight. Still, there is no magic cure for depression. There is no magic bill to solve this problem. Mental health is a reality of life for millions of people in our country, and we can't legislate it away. If we work to help more Americans bring their struggles out of the shadows into the sunshine, if we reach out to people in need and connect them with people who can help, and if we understand the factors that make people vulnerable to these problems and focus our energies on making sure the net is there to catch them if they fall--if we do these things, then we can take steps in the right direction, one right after the other and one day at a time. I still remember what it felt like in those weeks and months after I began to treat my depression--the sense of empowerment that came with finally taking my mental health into my own hands, the renewed energy that came with finally feeling like today is better than yesterday and maybe tomorrow will be even better yet, and the joy that came with finally seeing hope on the horizon once again. So even in the midst of this public health crisis, I believe there is hope on the horizon for the millions of Americans who struggle with mental illness, but they are counting on us to make this hopeful vision a reality. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1963169I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W4Y-93K1-F0YC-N1SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12307\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 16, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Kenneth Kiyul Lee, of California, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. </p><p>Pentagon Oversight Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to shed light on yet another really dark cloud that is hanging over our Department of Defense. In fact, for decades, a dark cloud of fiscal mismanagement has loomed large over the Pentagon. During my very first term here in the Senate, I began my quest to bring fiscal accountability to the Pentagon. Four decades later, I am still keeping tabs on the money trail. That money trail is sometimes difficult to follow. Back then, it was a bit like David taking on Goliath. We all know that the United States of America has the strongest and mightiest military in the world. I am thankful for that because a strong military is not meant to fight a war; it is meant to maintain the peace. We haven't had a world war III since we have had a strong military. Our brave men and women who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces protect our shores at home and abroad to keep us safe and to protect the blessings of liberty for our children and grandchildren. That is exactly why it is so very important to keep check on the Pentagon's ledgers, to help make sure that every tax dollar assigned to the Nation's defense is actually spent effectively and not squandered on waste, fraud, and abuse. With the help of brave whistleblowers who stuck their necks out to ``commit truth,'' I stuck my neck out during the Reagan administration. That is when I learned about the Pentagon's little shop of price horrors. Of course, ripping off the taxpayers started during the Revolutionary War, when contractors sold rotten meat to the Continental Army, and it continued during the Civil War, when profiteers sold ammunition filled with sawdust and shoddy shoes and horses to the Union Army. It looks like it continues to this day. Back in 1985, Americans will recall, the Defense Department was shelling out vast amounts of taxpayer dollars for spare parts. Remember back then the $450 hammers and the $640 toilet seats? That sounds like a real bargain compared to the more recent wasteful spending at the Pentagon, such as the $1,280 coffee mug and the $14,000 toilet seat lid. Obviously, the cost of waste is getting a whole lot more expensive for our taxpayers. Back in the 1980s, I fought to win a spending freeze on unchecked spending sprees. Misspending and overspending were riddling the defense budget at the expense of the American taxpayer. Military readiness drives the spending decisions that Members of Congress make when we cast our votes on the defense budget. Our constituents expect their elected representatives to make sure that the moms and dads, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters who are serving our country in uniform are well equipped with the best resources money can buy. But they also expect their elected representatives to make sure their hard-earned dollars that are withheld from every paycheck-- their tax dollars--aren't being ripped off by greedy corporations, like TransDigm Group, Inc., which I will speak about in a moment. That is why I conduct robust oversight of defense spending. As a taxpayer watchdog--and all of us are supposed to be watchdogs, and all of us would claim to be watchdogs--it is our [[Page S2846]] responsibility and my responsibility to make sure every defense dollar is spent as effectively and as efficiently as possible. Every dollar lost to waste, fraud, and abuse harms military readiness, and it also lines the pockets of somebody else at taxpayers' expense. Trimming the fat in a bloated bureaucracy won't happen in the shadows. There is no magic wand to wave either. If there is one thing I have learned in my years of oversight, transparency matters. Transparency brings accountability. Every time I come to the floor to talk about the fiscal mess at the Pentagon, I get a bit of deja vu. Earlier, I said my fraud-fighting efforts in the 1980s could be compared to David v. Goliath. Now let's fast-forward to this year, 2019. I am still here working as hard as ever to do away with wrongdoing and extract fiscal accountability at the Pentagon. Today, some might say that job is like the one performed by the famous character in Greek mythology who was destined to roll that heavy stone up the hill and to do it from then until eternity. Congressional oversight can be extremely tedious, and it can be time- consuming, but, as I like to remind each of the other 534 Members of Congress, it is essential to our country that we exercise this system of checks and balances. Without it, the dark fiscal cloud looming over the Pentagon would swell bigger and bigger and bigger. Oversight work may feel like an uphill climb, but oversight is not futile in the end. That is why I keep my shoulder to the wheel--to hold people at the Pentagon accountable, to protect taxpayers, and most importantly, when it comes to a defense dollar, to make sure we have our military readiness. Right now, I am here today to share some new details about the broken record of fiscal mismanagement at the Department of Defense. No matter how high I turn up the volume, the overdogs at the Pentagon remain tone deaf to fiscal integrity. Consider the recent report by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. It is called ``Review of Parts Purchased From TransDigm Group Inc.'' First, I want to compliment Senator Warren and two Representatives, Ro Khanna and Tim Ryan, for getting the ball rolling with their request asking the inspector general to look into the contract--this contractor's pricing structure. We need all hands on deck in Congress to conduct oversight, so I thank these other Members of Congress just named. After digging into the details, I can only conclude that the Pentagon is still, after all these years, stuck on autopilot. No one on board in the Pentagon's mother ship seems to bother to steer its ``fiscal ship'' into shape. Fiscal integrity somehow got lost in the spare parts horror story I am about to tell. In fact, I was more than dismayed with the response from the internal watchdogs at the DOD IG office. Their team wrote the report, and yet the inspector general leadership team seemed to show no urgency whatsoever to fix the problem they described. This tells me I also need to keep a tight leash on the internal watchdogs leading the Department of Defense inspector general's office. Their February report exposes a galactic price gouging, colossal ripple, and out-of-this-world waste. It reads like a sequel to the same financial shenanigans that have turned the Pentagon into a taxpayer money pit. Change out the name of the contractor, inflate the charges, submit the invoice and voila--the American taxpayer is on the hook for another fixed-price, sole source contract. For this report, the inspector general examined one contractor, TransDigm Group. In total, the inspector general analyzed 113 contracts between January 2015 and January 2017. They reviewed 47 spare parts the Department of Defense purchased from this contractor. In just those 2 years, the inspector general found TransDigm overcharged the Pentagon by $16-1/10th million out of a total of $29-7/10th million in contracts. The reasonable profit threshold is considered by the Department of Defense to be 15 percent or below. The IG found that TransDigm earned excess profits on 46 of the 47 parts sold to the Defense Department. On 17 of those parts, TransDigm earned more than a 1,000-percent profit. Remarkably, the highest profit percentage was 4,436 percent. It is obvious to our taxpayers that that is a fleecing of the American taxpayer. Pulling the wool over the eyes of Congress and the taxpayers will only stop with transparency--which transparency will bring accountability. So that is why I am here today. Just think for a minute about the big picture. This report is just one snapshot of a much larger problem. It is kind of a spit in the ocean when you consider the enormous $716 billion defense budget. Just imagine the boatloads of bloat elsewhere in the bureaucracy. The Department of Defense is obligated under Federal law and under regulations to uphold basic measures of fiscal integrity. So where do we go from here? The inspector general made just a few paltry recommendations. For starters, it directed contracting officers to request voluntary refunds for excess profits. Guess the chances of getting voluntary refunds. Let me suggest that I would not advise taxpayers to hold their breath on a voluntary refund. The inspector's general recommendations, then, have no teeth. Their recommendations are insufficient. What is worse, the inspector general leadership team claims no single Department of Defense official is responsible for this price gouging that goes on. So let me repeat: The inspector general leadership team, the internal watchdog for fiscal integrity and compliance at the Department of Defense, is effectively saying something like this: No one person at the Department of Defense can be held accountable for waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayers' money. Obviously, to the taxpayers listening or anybody else, this illustrates a cavalier attitude toward taxpayer money that former Secretary of Defense James Mattis sought to extinguish. By the way, I wrote him a note, complimenting him on some statements he made about taking care of some of these problems. The decades-long odyssey of misspending at the Pentagon keeps going around and around and around. That is why--the way I see it--the Department of Defense has a fundamental responsibility to uphold fiscal integrity. After reviewing the IG report and meeting with its auditing team and the Department of Defense pricing czar, I have reached three conclusions. No. 1, fiscal control at the Department of Defense is AWOL. The Pentagon will never clean up its books if it cannot properly track the money trail and connect the dots. Consider why the Department of Defense contracting officers were unable to even certify if a profit was ``fair and reasonable.'' Do you know why? It was because they could not obtain critical cost data at the company TransDigm. In the most egregious case--that case I mentioned where there was a 4,436-percent profit margin for just one spare part--the contracting officer--you will not believe this-- certified that the price was fair and reasonable. There is something very, very wrong about that procedure. A whopping 4,000-percent profit margin for a spare part doesn't square with our midwestern commonsense standard. No. 2, the leadership team at the IG office has exhibited an alarming hands-off approach toward stopping waste, fraud, and abuse. The lack of urgency and the failure to hold anyone accountable is very revealing. It sends a signal throughout the chain of command: Just keep on signing contracts; keep ordering spare parts; keep up business as usual. Lastly, it shows that no one will be held accountable for price gouging. No. 3, the pattern of price gouging at TransDigm and its subsidiaries has gone unimpeded for decades. It has amassed exclusive rights to sell these spare parts to the Pentagon. In fact, the Defense Department accounted for 34 percent of its sales in 2017. TransDigm exploited its business model and took advantage of its sole source position to leverage higher prices. Now, as a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee--and still a member of that committee--I have examined anticompetitive business practices over a long period of time, including those in agriculture and the pharmaceutical sectors of our economy. It is very concerning to me when [[Page S2847]] contracting arrangements, like those between TransDigm and its 100 subsidiaries, are effectively a monopoly. It is like an octopus with 100 arms putting the squeeze on the Pentagon. Effectively, the Pentagon is at the mercy of TransDigm--which owns the intellectual property--to buy the spare parts it needs to build the Nation's critical weapon systems. That leaves the American taxpayer on the hook for exorbitant price gouging. The inspector general report found that TransDigm's choke hold has added up to tens of millions of dollars overcharging to the taxpayer. This is a good time to refresh people's memories about my legislative and oversight work with anticompetitive business practices. It is pretty simple. Monopolies invite government regulation. If that is the road TransDigm wants to continue following, I am here to deliver a message. The jig is up on this cozy relationship. The buck stops here. I have written a letter to Acting Secretary Shanahan about these flawed contracts and failures to identify price gouging. I have asked him to make measurable recommendations on how to restore accountability and end this price gouging. One thing is crystal clear. Transparency and competition are MIA--missing in action--when the Pentagon buys spare parts from TransDigm and its subsidiaries. Now, thank God the other body, the House of Representatives, its Committee on Oversight and Reform, called an oversight hearing this week to examine TransDigm and its price-gouging shenanigans. Congress has a constitutional duty of oversight to keep check on taxpayers' money and hold government accountable. As I said earlier, we need all hands on deck to root out wasteful spending. Once again, we are back to square one. The Pentagon has flunked a fundamental benchmark of fiscal responsibility and stewardship. It is one of Washington's worst kept secrets. Year after year, Congress shovels more money into the Pentagon coffers to ensure we maintain the best military in the world, and I express my support for the military. I express my support that a strong department of national defense is also a strong keeper of the peace because we might not be challenged, and we are going to be able to help keep peace around the world, but year after year, the Pentagon squanders hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. Some people at the Pentagon seem to think that paying $16 million in excess profits somehow seems to be small potatoes. In my letter to the Acting Defense Secretary, I made it clear that I am not one of those people. I have asked him to answer a direct question. That question is this: What specific steps is he going to take to stop the profiteers from pilfering taxpayer money? Contracts like I have described today between TransDigm and the Pentagon are shortchanging the troops, fleecing the taxpayers, and tarnishing its reputation. As Justice Brandeis said, ``sunshine is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' So I am here today to pull back the curtains on the TransDigm audit. The American people need the sun to shine in on price gouging at the Pentagon so we can root out the wasteful spending here and elsewhere. Transparency is the best ammunition that we have to chase away the dark fiscal crowd looming along the shores of the Potomac. Recognition of the Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. National Police Week Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for always staying on top of things like this. Mr. President, first, I would like to talk about Police Week. Today we observe Peace Officers Memorial Day, the heart of National Police Week. We all remember the men and women in law enforcement who have made the ultimate sacrifice, and we pause to say thank you to all of our police officers who work day and night to keep our communities safe. I want to share a special thanks to all of our law enforcement members visiting from New York, who, in my view, are the gold standard in police work. I grew up in a neighborhood where police officers lived. I played with their children at their houses. You would always know sort of instinctively, even as a kid, when that phone rang and the spouse-- almost always, in those days, the wife of a police officer--heard the phone ring, what went through her head a little bit is this: I hope that is not the call I dreaded. This is the job of police officers and their families--that is, to risk their safety for our safety--and they do a great job. As we recognize their contributions, we should acknowledge what we could do in Congress to make their jobs safer and easier. We can make our streets safer by passing comprehensive background check legislation. We can help law enforcement combat foreign opioid trafficking by passing the bipartisan Fentanyl Sanctions Act and the POWER Act, which provides handheld scanning devices. When a police officer is on a drug bust, they can tell if fentanyl is part of a crime scene there, and they can take precautions to protect themselves, because we know how deadly fentanyl is, even if it gets on your skin or in your nostrils. We can also do more to care for the families of fallen officers. That is why I have been so proud to fight alongside my colleague Senator Gillibrand and so many others to make sure that the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund has the necessary funding. Last Friday, the New York Police Department, or the NYPD, added the names of nearly 50 police officers to the 9/11 memorial wall, all of whom died in 9/11-related illnesses. It is our duty to take care of these families, and the first step is making sure that the Victims Compensation Fund has enough funds to compensate them. I say to our law enforcement officers two words: Thank you. Thank you for your service. It is an honor to represent you in the Senate, and we are all grateful for the sacrifices you make every day. Nominations Mr. President, now on judges, during the same week that we mark the 65th anniversary of the historic ``Brown v. Board of Education'' decision, Leader McConnell has scheduled votes on nominees whose views directly contradict the spirit of equality and justice that Brown represents. It is appalling. These new people we are putting on the bench turn the clock so backward after we have made so much progress, many of it through the courts. Consider the nomination of Michael Truncale of Texas. He has peddled conspiracies of ``widespread voter fraud'' and once called President Obama an ``un-American imposter'' who ``bows to Arab Sheikhs and other world leaders.'' This is a man who we are putting on the bench, a man who is supposed to be judicious, thoughtful, and sees both sides. What we are putting on the bench is hard-right ideologues who will do damage to this country for a generation. Mr. Truncale was approved by the Republican Senate yesterday for a seat on the district court in Texas, and he is going to sit on that bench for life--a man who says things like this and who thinks like this. I have always tried to put on the bench people who are moderate. So many of us have. Bill Clinton did. Barack Obama did. Here we have a parade of narrow ideologues, and that is not who should be on the bench because they will make law rather than interpret the law. Here is another one, Kenneth Lee of California. His past writings reveal shocking positions on race and diversity, affirmative action, educational opportunity, and women's reproductive freedom. He once wrote that multiculturalism is a ``malodorous sickness'' and that sexism--sexism, which we have all seen and heard about and a little more than half of our population experiences--is ``irrelevant pouting.'' That is a man who should be on the bench? If confirmed today, Mr. Lee may preside over cases dealing with gender discrimination. Consider Wendy Vitter, nominated to the Eastern District of Louisiana. She once promoted the idea that contraceptives caused cancer and claimed that Planned Parenthood kills 150,000 women annually. She also refused to acknowledge that Brown v. Broad was correctly decided. On this very anniversary, that is who is on the floor to be voted on in lockstep by all the folks here on the Republican side. She refused to acknowledge that Brown v. [[Page S2848]] Board was correctly decided, saying instead that the decision was correct with the benefit of hindsight--whatever that means. In the same district, where 6-year-old Ruby Bridges became the first African- American child to attend an all-White elementary school in the South, the Senate will consider confirming someone who claims that hindsight was needed to understand why the decision that allowed Ruby to go to the same school as a White child wasn't correct. That is who we are putting on the bench. These are not just conservatives. We understand that the President and Republicans will put in conservatives, but hard-right, narrow ideologues who show no understanding or sympathy for people who don't look like them or pray like them or marry like them--what is wrong here? It is not hard. If you need the benefit of hindsight to understand that Brown v. Board of Education, which brought an end to school segregation and led to the end of American apartheid, was correctly decided, you shouldn't be a Federal judge. I urge my colleagues, in the spirit of the Brown anniversary and what it means, to oppose Ms. Vitter's nomination this afternoon. Puerto Rico Mr. President, now on Puerto Rico, briefly, as negotiations on a final package of disaster aid continue, I want to stress to everyone that we must remain focused on reaching an agreement as swiftly as possible. Disaster-stricken Americans in the West, the South, the Midwest, and 3 million citizens of Puerto Rico are waiting on Congress to deliver relief, in some cases for disasters that occurred over a year ago. Why is this held up? We know why. Republicans are not willing to give aid to Puerto Rico. There was a bill that would never pass the House and something they didn't think originally, when President Trump said: Don't do it. And they just bowed down. They thought they could roll over the House and the Democratic minority in the Senate, who wouldn't stand up for certain Americans. Well, we did. Now, thankfully, we are making progress. Republicans are realizing that Puerto Ricans cannot be left out of the package, but now we must avoid poison pills at all costs. President Trump, if he sticks his thumb into this again and asks for something unreasonable, will delay disaster aid once again, just as he did before. To my Republican colleagues, let's do this together. Let's do it in the right way. Let's do it in the way that can pass the House. President Trump will sign the bill. We have to make sure this legislation gets across the finish line. Every time the President intervenes and Republican colleagues go along, it gets held up even further. Abortion Mr. President, on the Alabama abortion bill, last night the Republican Alabama Senate passed, perhaps, the most draconian abortion law in the country. It bans abortion in every stage of pregnancy, imposes criminal penalties--criminal penalties--on any doctor who performs one, and includes no exception in the case of rape or incest, even if the victim is a child. If a child is raped, they have to have the baby. The Alabama bill is as extreme as it gets. It is a clear attack on women's freedom. It contravenes a woman's constitutional right to make private medical decisions. It would deeply harm women, turn doctors into criminals, and deny the right of rape victims, even if they are children, to make personal medical decisions. The Alabama abortion bill is plainly inhumane. It should never have passed. The Governor should not sign it. If she does, it ought to be swiftly struck down by the courts. Iran Mr. President, on Iran, over of the past few days, it has come to light in public reporting that the Trump administration's national security team has reviewed a plan to deploy as many as 120,000--yes, you heard that right, 120,000--U.S. troops in the Mideast should tensions with Iran escalate. I was stunned to read this report in the New York Times yesterday. The administration just started a maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against Iran, but is it simultaneously reviewing plans for war? That would make no sense. Meanwhile, the President oddly denied the report while also saying he would ``absolutely'' send ground troops to the Middle East. But if he did, it would be a ``heck''--and I am paraphrasing--``of a lot more troops [than 120,000].'' Did we learn the lessons of the last decade? Do we know that we have to spend our time focusing on building up this country here, not build roads and bridges in the Middle East but do them here? There is an alarming lack of clarity here. There is a lack of strategy, and there is a lack of consultation. The President ought to come up with a strategy and make it clear to Congress. An adventure like this--120,000 troops or a large number of troops--should have to be approved by Congress. It certainly should be discussed with Congress ahead of time. There need to be open hearings and closed briefings with the committees of jurisdiction immediately. Any potential increase in our military presence in the Middle East should require consultation with Congress, and anything beyond that would require this body to act. President Trump, what is your strategy? Where are you headed? Why aren't you talking to Congress about it? Public Housing Mr. President, finally, on public housing, it was reported last week that the Department of HUD has proposed a rule that would bar families with mixed immigration status from receiving public housing assistance, even if everyone but one member of the family is a legal resident. So if it is a family of six--a mother who is an American citizen, four children who are American citizens, but a husband who is not and who is not here legally--they kick them all out. It risks displacing tens of thousands of legal residents and of American citizens, including 55,000 children. The administration has created crisis after crisis with the immigration community. Are they going to create another one and take 55,000 young American children, almost all of whom are citizens, and just kick them out on the streets when we know there is very little affordable housing? What a cruel and callous policy. It is another example of the Trump administration's desire to separate families and disrupt communities. There is nothing to say about this proposed rule but that it is cruel, wrong-headed, and would lead to even more chaos than the administration has created already. In an effort to appear even more punitive toward immigrants, the administration has conjured up a rule that could potentially force tens of thousands of children into homelessness or away from their families. My message to President Trump and Secretary Carson is simple: Scrap this idea now. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized. Maiden Speech Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, it is an honor to rise today to speak in this Chamber on behalf of the people of Missouri. When I think of those who have served my State here before me, I am humbled. When I think of the true and strong Missourians who have sent me here, I am sobered, because to represent them will be a great responsibility indeed. I pledge to my fellow Missourians that I will work at this task with all the strength that God can give me, and I will serve without fear and without favor to any man. We Missourians are known for our frankness, and today I will be frank because this is a moment of great need for my State and for our Nation. This Nation was born in a revolution by ``We the People'' and premised on a revolutionary faith that it is the people--the common man and woman who make democracy work--and it is the calling of every generation to renew that revolution for their day. In our time, our revolutionary faith is faltering, and in the heartland of this country, the great challenge of our age is unfolding. I come from a town called Lexington, MO. It is a small place, but a proud one. It is a place where people wake early and work late to make a life for themselves and their children. It is a place where people value honesty and gumption and life's simple pleasures: a fine morning in a deer stand, reading [[Page S2849]] to the kids before bed, and Sunday dinner at Mom's. Although it is humble, it is a place that reflects the dignity and quiet greatness of the working men and women. These are the people who explored a continent, who built the railroads, and who opened the West. These are the workers whose labor launched the Industrial Revolution and whose ingenuity made the American economy the marvel of the world. These are the families who have rallied to this country's flag at every hour of danger and who bear the burden of defending our Nation even now. These are the patriots who man the fire department and coach the Little League. These are the generous who give $25 a month out of their gas money to assist people halfway around the globe whom they will never meet just because they believe in helping others. They don't ask for much, and they live by a simple creed: Give the best of yourself to your family, your community, and your fellow man. America is a place of promise, because in these hearts, honor lives. These working men and women are confronting crises today, and, as they do, so does our democracy. After years of sacrifice, the great American middle is being pushed aside by a new arrogant aristocracy. The new aristocrats seek to remake society in their own image, to engineer an economy that works for the elite but few else, and to fashion a culture that is dominated by their own preferences. When they think of helping their fellow citizens, they think of making everyone else more like themselves. And Washington has just gone along. This town has embraced the politics of elite values and elite ambition rather than building opportunities to thrive in the great and broad American middle. This has left middle America--the great American middle class--under siege, battling the loss of respect and work, the decline of home and family, and an epidemic of loneliness and despair. This is the crisis of our time. I am afraid you wouldn't know it to listen to the talk of this town much of the time. As the crisis deepens, the political establishment looks the other way, rehearsing and rehashing the political debates of 30 or 40 years ago. There is no time for that any longer. The 21st century is upon us, and the great struggle of this century can no longer wait. The crisis that we face goes to the heart of our revolution. The United States is unique in history as a republic governed not by a select elite but by the working man and woman, because we believe it is through the working man and woman that God chooses to change the world. That change comes not through spectacular feats of daring or glory but through everyday work and everyday sacrifice and everyday acts of courage and love. It has been the proud working people, our farmers and mechanics, and teachers and tradesmen who have defined the character of this country. For too long now, neither our economy nor our culture has lent them much support. Instead, our policymakers have entrenched the new elites and undermined the way of life that once bound this country together. It is time to face the facts. Over the last 40 years, our economy has worked best for those at the top--the wealthy and the well-educated. If you have a job in Silicon Valley or an expensive and prestigious degree, this economy has worked for you, and Washington has focused on how to get more people to join this elite. But if you want a life built around the place where you grew up, if your ambition is not to start a tech business but to join the family business, to serve in the PTA or in your local church, well, you are told that you are not a success, and you are told that you are on your own. This is no accident. The people who make the rules now, who run our large corporations, and who set the tone for our popular culture all belong to the same class. This economy has been their economy. They made it for themselves. But in places like the one where I grew up in middle Missouri, good- paying jobs that you can raise a family on are going away. The jobs go overseas or south of the border or to cities on the coasts. Once vibrant towns decline, taking with them the network of schools and neighborhoods and churches that make up middle-class life. Rural America has been particularly hard hit. Rural Americans' life expectancy has not just leveled off. It has actually dropped, and for women without a high school degree, that drop has been staggering. In some rural places, residents struggle with outright deprivation. My home State contains some of the poorest counties in America, all in rural places that once boasted thriving small towns. As those communities struggle, want sets in. The crisis reaches well beyond economics. The message that Washington has sent our whole society is loud and clear: Our elites are the people who matter and those who aspire to join them. Everyone else is unimportant or backward. Millions of Americans are left with a sense that the people who run this country view them with nothing but contempt and value them as nothing but consumers. These trends tear at our country's social fabric, and they undermine our common ethic of citizenship because being a free person and being an American isn't just about what you can buy. It is about the pride that comes in supporting a family. It is about contributing something of worth to your community. It is about being able to look a neighbor in the eye and know that you are his equal. It is about respect, and too many Americans haven't been getting it. They are certainly not getting it from our cultural elite. The media, Hollywood, and academia relentlessly press their values and their priorities on the rest of us. They advocate liberation from the duties of family and tradition. They look down on the plain virtues of patriotism, self-giving, and faith. They idealize fame and preach self- realization through consuming more stuff, and as they do, they assault the foundations of the great American middle. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised, then, at the epidemic of loneliness and despair that is spreading across working communities. Fewer young people are getting married and starting families. Drug addiction is surging. The opioid menace has ravaged every sector, every age group, and every geography of working people. It is not only pills. It is heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, meth, and, of course, marijuana that have flooded our streets and our homes. Everywhere, deaths of despair are mounting among farmers and among the young. Most shockingly, the young are the hope of our society, but in America today, they are taking their lives in numbers we have never seen in our history. The well-off frequently note that our Nation has never been richer, but the tragedy of youth suicide betrays a profound poverty of hope. And is that really so surprising? Today's youth must make their way in a society increasingly defined not by the genuine and personal love of family and church but by the cold and judgmental world of social media. A typical young person is bombarded by video games and violence and the relentless status-seeking imposed and modeled by our cultural elite. There is no more shocking illustration of our cultural poverty and no more damning indictment of our cultural leaders than these lost lives. The sum of it all is that too many Americans are losing their standing as citizens. They are losing their voice in the life of this Nation, and with that, they are losing their liberty. To be free is to have a voice. It is to have a say, and it is to have the power of self- government. The chattering class often tells us that all of this--the jobs, the despair, and the loss of standing--is a result of forces beyond anyone's control, as if that is an excuse to do nothing, but in fact, it is not true. Today's society benefits those who shaped it, and it has been shaped not by working men and women but by the new aristocratic elite. Big banks, big tech, and big multinational corporations, along with their allies in the academy and the media-- these are the aristocrats of our age. They live in the United States, but they consider themselves citizens of the world. They operate businesses or run universities here, but their primary loyalty is to their own agenda for a more unified, progressive, and profitable global order. These modern aristocrats often claim to be a meritocracy, and many of them truly believe they are. What they don't see or will not acknowledge is that the [[Page S2850]] society they have built works mainly for themselves. They have effectively run this country for decades, and their legacy is national division and national decline. It is time to reclaim our revolutionary heritage and reassert the democracy of ``We the People.'' To those who despair at the task ahead, I say the hour is not too late and the crisis is not too deep for the determined effort of a great people, and to those who feel forgotten and unheard, I say this is your time. Now we must stand together to renew the promise of our enduring revolution. We must put aside the tired orthodoxies of years past and forge a new politics of national renewal. We must begin by acknowledging that GDP growth alone cannot be the measure of this Nation's greatness, and so it cannot be the only aim of this Nation's policy because our purpose is not to make a few people wealthy but to sustain a great democracy. We need not just a bigger economy but a better society. We need a society that offers rewarding work for every worker who wants it, wherever she is from, whatever degree he might have, whether their ambition is to start a business or to start a family. We need a society that will allow towns and neighborhoods to flourish across the great heartland of this country and not just in the megacities of the coasts. We need a society that puts American workers first, that prioritizes them over cheap goods from abroad and offers them the chance to better their station. All this we must fight for and more. We need to repair the torn fabric of our common life. We need a politics that prioritizes strong marriages and encourages strong families, where children can know their parents and be nurtured by their love. We need strong schools and churches and co-ops because these are the things that make liberty possible, for liberty is more than selling or buying or the right to be left alone. Liberty is the ability to master our own fate and, as a free people, to set our own course. That is the promise of the American Revolution, and we will renew it for our day. Washington has ignored the need for this renewal for too long. It has rested easy with the priorities of an earlier age. Now it must wake up and face the facts of this day. Now we must ask new questions, force new debates, articulate new priorities, and find new solutions to make the great American middle thrive again. This is not the work of a day or a season. It is the work of a generation. We will make it the work of this generation and so do our part to see the success of liberty in our time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Welcoming Senator Hawley of Missouri Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am glad to be joined by my good colleague Senator Hawley. He brings incredible depth to the issues we talked about. He grew up in Lexington, MO, I understand, in smalltown America. He was educated in some of the best schools in our country and had the great good fortune to be assigned as a John Roberts law clerk in the office of another John Roberts law clerk and the good judgment to convince her to marry him. He and Erin are a valuable asset to our State. They have two wonderful little boys. I have enjoyed the time we have had together and look forward to more time with Josh and his family. He clearly thinks deeply about the issues that affect the country. He is focused on not only the present but the future. Those are all good things. We have jointly had the opportunity to represent a State that is as diverse as any State in the country. I think a week, a month, a year in Missouri is probably the closest thing to that same period of time if you could somehow condense the entire United States into one place, where sometimes St. Louis is seen as the westernmost eastern city and Kansas City may be more like Denver than St. Louis. Northern Missouri is more like Iowa. I would state to Senator Grassley that when crossing the border there, you certainly can't tell when you cross from Missouri farmland into Iowa farmland and the small cities and small towns. The Bootheel, Delta South in character where Josh and I live in Springfield has that northwest Arkansas-Oklahoma vitality that is different from anywhere else in our State. As we travel actively around our State, as we both do, I think we have a great sense of so much of what happens in the country. It is still the population center of America, if not the exact geographic center. Missouri is where the country comes together. Josh had an opportunity last year to talk to tens of thousands of Missourians about that and to communicate in other ways with millions of Missourians about that. I am glad he is here and glad to welcome him to the work we will be doing together. We won't agree every single day because if we did, I guess we could have just one Senator and give him two votes. But it gives us a chance to talk about the issues we face and what that means for our State but also what it means to the country. I am delighted he has committed himself to public service. Missourians have now elected him to two statewide offices in less than 3 years, and they have expressed that confidence in him. With great frequency, I run into students both Josh and Erin had when they were both teaching at the Law School at the University of Missouri, and they always tell me Erin was the best teacher they ever had and often tell me Joshua was the best teacher they ever had. They must not have had a class with Erin yet. But I am delighted that they are both part of the discussion that will lead America forward. I look forward to engaging in that discussion with them and partnering in the things we can find to do together and getting a chance to represent our strong, unique State that I think is ready to merge into a greater future, whether that is with all the healthcare and ag research we see happening, the GEOINT focus that is coming into our State because of the new NGA, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency facility being built there. This is a time of great opportunity. I am glad to have the chance to share part of that opportunity and look at that future with my colleague Josh Hawley and certainly want to join others in welcoming him officially to the Senate today as he makes his maiden speech to the Senate. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to join with my colleague, the senior Senator from Missouri, and congratulate the junior Senator from Missouri on some wonderful remarks. I came into the Congress with Senator Blunt from the House of Representatives over 20 years ago, which I guess makes us the old guys around here, but it warms my heart and gives me great hope for the future to see the caliber and the quality of people who are entering public life in the form of people like Senator Hawley. He is somebody who not only brings great intellect, great passion, and great conviction, but he is a principled leader who is here for the right reasons and profoundly wants to make a difference for the future of this country. In his remarks, he touched upon the genius of our Founders, and that is that average Americans--working men and women in this country--have an opportunity to make a difference with their voices and with their votes by entering the public arena and being a part of our democracy. That is really what this is all about. That is what our work should be about every day, is empowering them to do a better job in raising their families and serving their communities. I certainly look forward to continuing our work with the new Senator from Missouri and with the rest of our colleagues here as we embark upon that task. I hope we can be successful in restoring that vision our Founders had for what this country should be and in each day waking up and thinking about the fact that it is not about us; it is about what we do to secure a better and brighter future consistent with that brilliant past we have been so blessed by because of those who have come before and have been willing to enter public life and make a difference. So thank you and congratulations to Senator Hawley. It is a great honor to [[Page S2851]] serve with you, and we look forward to working with you in the days and weeks and months ahead to serve the very people you talked about in your remarks. National Military Appreciation Month Mr. President, May is National Military Appreciation Month, a chance for us to honor the service of those who have kept our Nation free for 243 years. For me, when I reflect on our military men and women, there are always two things in the forefront of my mind: my dad, Harold Thune, and the men and women of Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota and the South Dakota National Guard. My father was a fighter pilot who flew Hellcats off the USS Intrepid in the Pacific theater during World War II. I came to know the ``greatest generation'' through my dad--their humility, their quiet service, their patriotism, and their deep dedication to the cause of freedom. I have come to know the men and women of today's military through Ellsworth and through South Dakota's National Guard and the great work, the extraordinary work they do day in and day out, the professionalism, the skill, the talent, and the dedication they bring to the work of defending America and America's freedoms. Ellsworth has been on my mind in particular this week because right now the Air Force is conducting a large force exercise involving B-1 bombers, B-2s, B-52s, F-16s, C-17s, KC-135s, JSTARS and AWACS, and, for the first time, F-35s. My acquaintance with Ellsworth began during my time as a Member of the House of Representatives, but I really got to know the base and what it meant to the Rapid City area shortly after I became a Senator. Just a few months into my first term in the Senate, Ellsworth found itself targeted for closure by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. That summer of 2005 was a long one as we mobilized to protect the base. I don't think I missed a BRAC hearing in DC that summer. It didn't matter whether Ellsworth was on the agenda; I wanted to be there in case the chance to advocate for Ellsworth arose. Thanks to the efforts of a lot of dedicated people, we were victorious. We demonstrated to the Commission that Ellsworth was a vital national security asset and that moving the B-1 fleet from Ellsworth would actually cost money. We also made the case that the United States shouldn't put all of its eggs in one basket, that it shouldn't consolidate all of its assets in one location. By August, we had succeeded in having Ellsworth removed from the closure list. Since then, the congressional delegation, Ellsworth, and community leaders have worked hard to build up the base so that we never again find ourselves in that same position. In 2007, we saw the Air Force Financial Services Center open at Ellsworth. In 2011, we saw the arrival of the 89th Attack Squadron and its command and control stations for MQ-9 Reapers. In 2015, a decade-long mission paid off with the expansion of the training airspace for the base. The Powder River Training Complex is now the largest training airspace in the continental United States. It is undoubtedly partly thanks to this airspace that Ellsworth was just chosen not only as the home for the B- 21 training mission, the first bombers to the fleet, but operational squadrons as well. Once on the chopping block, Ellsworth is going from strength to strength, and South Dakota is deeply proud to host this crucial base. Ellsworth's airmen have played an essential role in the armed conflicts of recent years. Ellsworth's pilots have engaged targets in the Middle East using Predator and Reaper remotely piloted aircraft for vital reconnaissance, search and rescue, and strike missions. The Thunderbirds of the 34th Bomb Squadron and the Tigers of the 37th Bomb Squadron have flown countless missions, conducting strikes, providing deterrence, and delivering critical close air support. During Operation Odyssey Dawn, B-1s from Ellsworth launched from South Dakota, flew halfway around the world to Libya, dropped their bombs, and returned home--all in a single mission. This marked the first time in history that B-1s launched combat missions from the United States to strike targets overseas. During my time advocating for Ellsworth, I have had the chance to learn a lot about aircraft and the incredible capabilities of the U.S. military, especially the capabilities of the U.S. Air Force. But the greatest part of representing Ellsworth has been the chance to meet with and get to know its airmen, from the wing commanders and other base leaders to the airmen who care for the planes. Ultimately, no matter what technology we have, the strength of our fighting force comes down to our military men and women. It is because of the men and women we have that the United States has the strongest fighting force in the world. Members of the military are a special breed. At an age when many are focused on graduation ceremonies or summer vacations, they take a different path--a path that challenges them mentally and physically, that pushes them to their limits and then asks them to go further, that asks them to forget their own needs and to focus only on what they can do for others, and that asks them to forgo comfort for sacrifice, up to and including the sacrifice of their lives. At 18, at 21, these warriors pledge to lay down their lives for the rest of us, and they make that pledge again every day of their service, every morning when they wake up and head to work, whether that is the repair base at Ellsworth or a battlefield half a world away. I am profoundly grateful for the honor of representing some of the men and women of the U.S. military here in the Senate. We owe our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and Coast Guard a debt we can never repay. As Military Appreciation Month continues and Armed Forces Day approaches, we can take the time to remember--to remember that we go about our lives in peace and freedom every day because of members of the U.S. military who are standing watch for us. May God bless the members of the U.S. military, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Abortion Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to start today by saying I am really appalled by the extreme, cruel, shameful abortion ban that was passed yesterday in Alabama. That legislation is nothing short of an attack on women, and it is part of a larger effort we are seeing today around the country to take away the constitutional right of women to safe, legal abortion and allowing politicians to make decisions for women about their bodies, their health, and their lives instead of trusting doctors and women. I want every woman reading the news this morning and wondering what this means for you, your family, and for your granddaughters to know I am with you, and I am going to keep fighting for you every step of the way. Nomination of Wendy Vitter Mr. President, I want to turn to speak about my opposition to Wendy Vitter's nomination, which is yet another step extreme politicians are taking to undermine women's rights and access to healthcare. I oppose Wendy Vitter's nomination to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. President Trump and Vice President Pence have made it clear that they want to pack the Judiciary with far-right judges who will turn back the clock on reproductive rights, and this nominee is no exception. Time and again, Mrs. Vitter has advocated against women's reproductive rights using inflammatory language and falsehoods. She has demonstrated a keen sense of partisanship and a poor sense of judgment, starting with her initial response to the Senate Judiciary Committee's questionnaire. Mrs. Vitter left out information about her past statements in her response to the committee--the kinds of serious submissions Republicans have objected to with other nominees. I am [[Page S2852]] not talking about a small memory lapse. I am talking about nearly 200 additional pages that had to be added to her response once they were brought to light. I am not talking about insignificant statements, things that are hard to find or easy to forget. I am talking about campaign ads, panel discussions, political rallies. I am not talking about innocent uncontroversial comments. I am talking about the fearmongering of an activist who is entirely unfit for the Federal bench. Mrs. Vitter initially failed to disclose her remarks at a political rally opposing the construction of a Planned Parenthood clinic, remarks where she claimed Planned Parenthood--which, by the way, provides low- cost healthcare like cancer screenings and STI screenings and contraceptive care to millions of people. She claimed Planned Parenthood is responsible for killing 150,000 women a year. That is careless, it is reckless, and it is wrong. It is incredibly poor judgment for somebody who is being considered for a lifetime judicial appointment. She also failed to disclose the time she moderated a deeply dishonest panel called ``Abortion Hurts Women's Health.'' Mrs. Vitter prompted panelists to peddle misinformation about women's health, encouraging a discussion that falsely suggested abortion is linked to cancer and infertility. One panel spoke at length about a deeply inaccurate brochure she had authored called ``How the Pill Kills.'' As you can tell from that title, the brochure was loaded with glaring falsehoods, like the false claim that birth control causes breast cancer or that women on birth control are more likely to die a violent death. In response to that speaker's long string of very dangerous lies about women's healthcare, Mrs. Vitter encouraged the attendees to download the brochure, bring it to their doctors, and ask them to put it in their waiting rooms. It is incredibly alarming that a nominee for the Federal bench would be so willing to voice her support for such dangerous propaganda, especially when that same nominee is unwilling to voice her support for one of the landmark civil rights cases in our country's history, Brown v. Board of Education. During her confirmation hearing, Mrs. Vitter was asked whether Brown v. Board was decided correctly. It wasn't a trick question. Many past judicial nominees, including Chief Justice Roberts, have been able to answer it. Mrs. Vitter refused. This week, we are going to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the Brown v. Board decision. Do Republicans really want to mark this occasion by confirming a judge who has voiced more support for outright lies about women's health than for the historic decision that struck down State-sponsored segregation? This should be simple. Someone whose statements and record fail to support the Brown v. Board decision cannot be trusted with the responsibility of deciding the historic cases of tomorrow. Someone who has worked to spread misinformation about contraceptives and undermine the constitutional right to safe, legal abortion that is enshrined in Roe v. Wade cannot be trusted to fight for the truth or uphold women's reproductive rights. In other words, someone like Wendy Vitter cannot be trusted with a lifetime seat on a Federal bench. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this nomination. While President Trump and Vice President Pence may keep sending us these far- right nominees and Senate Republicans may keep jamming them through under the radar, Democrats are not going to stand by or stand down. They may try to push our courts to the right. We are going to keep pushing back. We are going to keep holding a spotlight on these nominees and making clear just how extreme they are, and we are going to keep fighting for women and men and families in this country. Thank you. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mental Health Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, I knew I wanted to make mental health one of my top priorities. As a Minnesotan, I am proud of the way our Senators have led the way on this important issue, from Paul Wellstone to Al Franken, to Amy Klobuchar. I am honored to have the chance to further our proud legacy when it comes to improving our mental health system, but that is not the only reason I have chosen to make mental health a focus. I am glad it has become a more prominent issue here in Washington, but I have noticed it usually comes to the forefront in the context of some unthinkable tragedy. When a high-profile celebrity takes his or her own life, we immediately want to reach out to other people who are suffering in silence. Of course, we do. That is not a bad thing. We can't repeat the number often enough. If you are having thoughts of suicide, please, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. Even if you aren't suffering from acute mental illness, put that number in your cell phone so you can, someday, help someone who is. On the other hand, when a profoundly disturbed person commits a horrible act of violence, we immediately want to intervene before the next time it happens. Of course, we do. When we bring up the need to improve our mental health system as the answer to the epidemic of mass shootings in America, though, we are making two huge mistakes. First, we are ignoring our responsibility to address a much more direct cause of these tragedies--guns. Second, we are unfairly and falsely stigmatizing mental illness. Here is another thing we can't say often enough: It is exceedingly rare that one's mental illness leads one to commit acts of violence. In fact, one is much more likely to be a victim of violence than to be a perpetrator, and we must not make it harder for people to seek help by falsely tagging them, as we do, as being potentially dangerous. Yes, these tragedies are reminders that we need to spend more time talking about mental health, but let's have the right conversation. For most people who struggle with mental illness in America, the struggle is not about life or death; it is about the quality of the lives we lead. Mental health is a continuum, and many of our fellow citizens fall somewhere along this continuum. These millions of Americans deserve our attention, and these millions of Americans deserve our help. The other reason I want to focus on mental health care while I am here in the Senate is that I am one of them. When it started for me, I thought I was just having a bad day or, really, a series of bad days. While growing up, I had always been a pretty cheerful kid, but at some point during my second year of college, I had started to find it harder and harder to cope with the daily challenges of life. Actually, it had been my roommate who had noticed that I had not been myself and hadn't been myself for a long time. She had suggested that I talk to someone over at the Student Health Services. It had been a completely foreign idea to me, and I had responded in the way a lot of people would have-- ``I have this.'' Eventually, I had realized that maybe I had been wrong about that. It was really hard to make that phone call, walk over to the counselor's office, and sit in the waiting room. I didn't know what to expect, and to be honest, I was embarrassed. The counselor's name was Charlotte. She was nice, had common sense, and wasn't patronizing or judgmental. She just asked me some simple questions about how I was feeling, and I remember what a relief it was just to talk about it. Over the course of a few months, Charlotte gave me some ideas about how to cope a little bit better with the challenges I was facing, and I would always walk out of her office feeling a little bit more courageous and a little bit more hopeful. Did I live happily ever after? Well, not quite. That is not how mental illness works. There isn't a box for when you are healthy and a box for when you are not. Like I said, it is a continuum, and you try to get a little closer to the healthy end every day. At one point in my thirties, though, I found myself sliding back in the wrong direction. There was nothing unusually traumatic going on in my life. [[Page S2853]] I had a career, and Archie and I were raising our two sons. We were busy, and we were tired, but that is the way it is when you are a young parent. Still, something was wrong. All who have suffered from depression have their own metaphors to describe it, but most can identify with the sensation of the color just sort of draining out of your world. The things that used to give you joy don't give you joy anymore. The things that you used to love to do may just make you exhausted. Basically, you are just trying to slog through the day. Of course, when you feel this way, just making it through the day is tough. I found myself struggling to be a good mom, a good wife, a good friend, a good colleague. I just felt off all the time--clumsy and slow. I forgot things and got angry at the drop of a hat. See, the thing is, depression messes with your memory. I will never forget when my young son asked me quietly and cautiously: ``Mom, are you OK?'' It was a spiral. The worse things got, the more frustrated I became, but I couldn't get it together. Down and down I went until I could no longer see hope on the horizon. I was never suicidal, but I struggled to function. I definitely wasn't living my best life. I really wasn't living at all. That is the reality of mental illness for millions of Americans. I am one of the lucky ones. I was lucky that my college had excellent mental health resources and that my roommate cared enough about me to urge me to take advantage of those resources. I was lucky that when my depression came back with a vengeance, I had health insurance that covered treatment. There was a therapist named Susan with the skill and the expertise to help me. Susan asked me a few questions: How are you sleeping? Terrible. Are you forgetting things? All the time. She then suggested that I take a diagnostic test, which basically consisted of answering questions like those. Even then, I was resistant. People often say that depression lies, and the biggest lie depression tells is that what is wrong with you is you. So you resist getting help because you refuse to accept that there is anything happening except that you stupidly forgot it was recycling day again. I went ahead and I did the diagnostic test, and Susan came back and said: Yes, you are clinically depressed, so let's talk about what we can do about it. One thing I would say to people who are resisting going in for that appointment is that even after I got that diagnosis, I was still in control. When Susan brought up the idea of medication, it was a suggestion and not an order. I will admit it--it was a suggestion I had a hard time with. I didn't want to become a different person. I didn't want some pill messing with my brain. What if it didn't work and I got worse? On the other hand, what if it did work? Would I really be better, or would it just be an illusion of feeling better? Susan convinced me to give it a try, and I was lucky again when the first medication we tried worked. I didn't feel better right away. There was no big milestone moment where I woke up and everything was great again. But I remember feeling like I was slowly coming out of a fog. The color started to seep back into my day a little bit more every day. I began to reengage with my family and my friends and my work, and I could see hope on the horizon again. After a couple of years on medication, I slowly ramped down, and I haven't had to get treatment since. As I said, there is no happily ever after when it comes to mental illness, but happier is possible. If anyone needs proof, just talk to me. So that is my story, but really it is the story of millions of Americans. I chose to share mine--first in an op-ed in the Rochester Post-Bulletin and now here on the floor of the Senate--because I want to urge anyone who struggles with depression or anxiety or substance abuse or post-traumatic stress disorder or any other mental health issue to reach out and seek help. Destigmatizing and demystifying mental illness is just the beginning. Everyone can be a friend to those in need by urging them to take advantage of the resources that are available to them, but the 100 of us here in the Senate have a responsibility to make sure those resources are available to everyone. We can't afford to leave holes in the net we build to catch people when they fall, especially when one of the biggest holes is in our schools. I have spent a lot of time over the last months having conversations with teachers and administrators in public schools across Minnesota. Time and again, when I ask them ``What keeps you up at night?'' they come back to the mental health of their students. They talk about the causes--everything from increased social pressure that comes from social media to the trauma of losing a parent to opioids--but they also tell me what the crisis really looks like at ground level. A principal in St. Paul told me about the regular phenomenon of an ambulance pulling up at the school doors, rushing to the aid of a student who has suffered a break. It has happened more than a half a dozen times at his school alone this year. Meanwhile, the principal in Parkers Prairie--a town in Otter Tail County of just over 1,000, people--tells me that she sees students experiencing homelessness and other trauma, students dealing with PTSD, and students with eating disorders. Just this year, she has had three students end up in the hospital for self-harming. They have a heroic social worker who comes in but only every other day because they have to share her with another school in the district. School psychologists across Minnesota tell me they are struggling to keep up with the number of kids who need urgent intervention to make sure that, for example, their behavioral issues don't become so significant that they get them kicked out of school altogether. As for kids whose issues are very real but not so acute--like the ninth grader whose anxiety makes her sick to her stomach every day-- they wind up stuck on waiting lists for treatment. And that is even before psychologists can do any active outreach to the students who haven't reached out for help. That is why last month I reintroduced my Mental Health Services for Students Act. This bill would create a grant program for school districts looking to expand the mental health services they are able to offer to students by partnering with community mental health system organizations. If we are going to get our arms around this crisis, we need to train more teachers, administrators, and members of the school community, including parents, to recognize when kids are struggling and to connect them with help. If we here in the Senate are serious about addressing mental health in our schools, we should pass this bill without delay. A comprehensive approach to mental health means improving the system all along the age continuum. Over in the HELP Committee, we will have an opportunity this year to reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or CAPTA. And I have a bill, sponsored in the House by my friend Representative Dean Phillips, that would improve the delivery of mental health services within our child welfare system. For example, our bill would make sure that young, at-risk children get important developmental screenings when they need it. We are learning that childhood trauma can be a major factor in future mental illness. The more we do to address the underlying trauma, whether it is poverty, the death or incarceration of a loved one or a parent, or sexual abuse, the better we address those issues, the better chance we will have of turning the tide on this epidemic. The mental health crisis isn't only affecting our kids; it is affecting our parents too. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control, one in five adults age 55 or older experiences a mental health issue, and a third of them never receive treatment. Men over the age of 75 have a higher suicide rate than any other age group. The social isolation that too often comes with aging or caring for a loved one isn't just unfortunate; it is a public health risk. Just as we have learned to reach out to the veterans in our lives and in our communities to let them know we are there for them if they are struggling, we should do the same for our elders. As the HELP Committee takes up the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act this year, I will be working to do my part. [[Page S2854]] Our mental health system should be there for people at every age, from nursery to nursing home. It should be there for people everywhere along the mental health continuum, offering everything from preventive care, to ongoing therapy for chronic conditions, to crisis support for those in acute distress. It should also be there for people in every ZIP Code, and unfortunately, some of the biggest holes in our system can be found in rural areas. As a Senator, I am proud to serve on the Agriculture Committee. I frequently meet with farm groups, and today mental health is one of the first topics to come up. Farming is an inherently stressful profession, especially these days, when the numbers for suicide prevention hotlines regularly appear in farm publications. But we need to include the entire rural community, from bankers and pastors to grocers and fertilizer sellers. We need to include them in this conversation, and we need to make sure that when people do reach out for help, there is help there for them. Unfortunately, rural communities in general are often underserved by mental health professionals compared to cities and suburbs. Many still have inconsistent access to the internet, meaning that even online resources can be out of reach for someone who is struggling. That is why, in the last farm bill, we set up a rural health liaison in the Department of Agriculture--someone who understands the specific needs of rural communities and is charged with paying attention to a crisis that has too often lurked beneath the surface. Last year, Senator Murkowski and I worked together to pass a law that would provide mental health professionals in the National Health Service Corps with greater flexibility in where they practice and deliver care, increasing the resources available in underserved rural communities. I hope my colleagues will join me in continuing to take action to address the mental health crisis, and I hope that sharing my own story will make it easier for more Americans to add their voices to this fight. Still, there is no magic cure for depression. There is no magic bill to solve this problem. Mental health is a reality of life for millions of people in our country, and we can't legislate it away. If we work to help more Americans bring their struggles out of the shadows into the sunshine, if we reach out to people in need and connect them with people who can help, and if we understand the factors that make people vulnerable to these problems and focus our energies on making sure the net is there to catch them if they fall--if we do these things, then we can take steps in the right direction, one right after the other and one day at a time. I still remember what it felt like in those weeks and months after I began to treat my depression--the sense of empowerment that came with finally taking my mental health into my own hands, the renewed energy that came with finally feeling like today is better than yesterday and maybe tomorrow will be even better yet, and the joy that came with finally seeing hope on the horizon once again. So even in the midst of this public health crisis, I believe there is hope on the horizon for the millions of Americans who struggle with mental illness, but they are counting on us to make this hopeful vision a reality. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN1029727720190516</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W4C-RVR1-DXCW-D1Y5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12309\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 16, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Aurelia Skipwith, of Indiana, to be Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. recognition of the majority leader The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized. senate legislative agenda Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I have spoken at length about the serious impact the Democrats' impeachment obsession has had on months' worth of important legislative priorities. For months, the Republicans have been calling for bipartisan solutions to the NDAA, to the appropriations process, and more, but only in the last couple of days, here in mid-December, have our Democratic colleagues gotten sufficiently serious about these must-pass bills. In the meantime, while we have waited on the House Democrats to act, the Senate has made good use of our floor time to complete the American people's business with respect to nominations. Last week alone, the Senate confirmed two executive branch nominations and put eight impressive jurists in seats on Federal district courts. This week, we have considered yet another slate of the President's well-qualified nominees. The Senate will consider today John Sullivan, of Maryland, to serve as Ambassador to the Russian Federation, Stephen Hahn, of Texas, to serve as Commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration, and Aurelia Skipwith, of Indiana, to be Director of the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service. Already this week, we have confirmed two more outstanding jurists to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit--Patrick Bumatay, of California, and Lawrence VanDyke, of Nevada. Mr. Bumatay is a graduate of Yale and Harvard Law School. He clerked for the Eastern District of New York and the Tenth Circuit, practiced in the private sector, and served in a variety of roles with the Department of Justice. Mr. VanDyke graduated from Montana State University and Harvard Law School. His career has included a clerkship with the DC Circuit, time as a State solicitor general, and service as Deputy Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice. Both of these jurists are well qualified, and both have widespread respect from legal peers. Now they are the 49th and 50th circuit judges to have been nominated by President Trump and confirmed by the Senate in the last 3 years. As I have said before, these kinds of milestones are emphatically not partisan achievements. It is not one party or the other that benefits when our [[Page S7000]] Federal courts consist of men and women who understand that a judge's job is to follow the law, not to make the law. The entire country benefits from that. Our constitutional system benefits from that as well. If a judge's applying our laws and our Constitution as they are written strikes anybody as a threat to one's particular agenda, it is the agenda that needs to change, not the judiciary the Framers intended. On another matter, as I said, the Democrats' fixation with impeachment has pushed critical governing priorities right into the eleventh hour. Just yesterday, after months of delays and hostage- taking, the House Democrats finally approved an NDAA conference report. Next week, the Senate will pass it and send this overdue legislation to President Trump. Yet, of course, we need to follow up Defense authorization with Defense appropriations so that we actually supply the funding our servicemembers need to carry out their missions and our commanders need to plan for the future. It is not just defense funding that has been hampered by the Democrats' impeachment obsession and reluctance to do anything bipartisan. All Federal funding has been jeopardized by the House's procrastination. That includes critical domestic programs with implications for every one of our colleagues and all of our constituents. Even today, at this late date, the Democratic leadership is continuing to delay a bipartisan agreement on appropriations. Even now, at the eleventh hour, the Democratic leadership is still threatening to potentially tank the whole process and force another continuing resolution. Look, the story is the same as it has been for months--partisan policy demands, poison pills. It is exactly the playbook the Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader had explicitly promised months ago, in writing, they would not use in order to sabotage appropriations. Let me say that again. Last summer, the Speaker of the House and the Senate Democratic leader explicitly promised in writing that they would not use poison pills or changes to Presidential transfer authorities to sabotage the appropriations process. Yet, even in mid-December, they are still using those tactics to jeopardize all of our progress. It doesn't have to end this way. I know earnest discussions are still underway as our colleagues in both Chambers work to fix this. I urge the Democratic leadership to let the committees do their work, to let the Congress do its work, and to let us pass legislation on a bipartisan basis next week. On a related matter, while we hold out hope for a breakthrough in appropriations, we also know there has been one major casualty of Speaker Pelosi's impeachment obsession--Congress's ability to pass the President's USMCA this year. It was more than a year ago that President Trump first signed the draft agreement with the leaders of Canada and Mexico--more than 12 months ago. That is how long the House Democrats have dragged their heels on the USMCA and have kept 176,000 new American jobs on ice. Now, at the eleventh hour, Speaker Pelosi has finally realized it would be too cynical and too nakedly partisan to allow her conference's impeachment obsession to kill the USMCA entirely. So after a year of obstruction, she finally gave in to Republican pressure and struck a notional deal with the White House. But actions have consequences. That entire calendar year that House Democrats wasted has consequences. The Speaker's action was so belated that the administration is still--still--in the process of writing the actual bill. We don't have a bill yet. Once a bill is produced, the House has to take it up first, and then, under trade promotion authority that exists to protect the deals Presidents negotiate, after House passage, the bill spends up to 15 session days in the Senate Finance Committee. After that, there are up to 15 session days for the Senate to vote on the floor. So, unfortunately, the Speaker's 12 months of delay have made it literally impossible for the Senate to take up the agreement this year. And if House Democrats send us impeachment articles, those have to come first in January, so the USMCA will get pushed back yet again. Like I said, actions have consequences. There is just no way the Senate can make up for 12 months of House Democratic delays in just a couple of days. Governing is a question of priorities. Speaker Pelosi failed to make this trade deal a priority for the entire year, and we are now bound by the time requirements of TPA to protect the agreement here in the Senate. On one final matter, speaking of priorities, listen to what the House Democrats are prioritizing. Listen to what they are doing today while all of this crucial legislation goes unfinished: more Judiciary Committee hearings on impeaching the President and on the floor, a vote on yet another far-left messaging bill with literally no chance of becoming law. They are spending floor time on their socialist scheme to micromanage Americans' prescription drugs and put the Federal Government in charge of the medicines so many people rely on. The Speaker wants to take us down the road of nationalizing an entire industry and imposing Washington's stifling influence on the life sciences sector that produces lifesaving cures--never mind the fact that this far-left messaging bill has zero chance of passing the Senate and that President Trump has already threatened to veto it. We know by now that political performance art takes precedence over bipartisan legislation where this Democratic House has been concerned. I hope these stunts--stunts--come to an end soon. I hope the House finds time to finish negotiating the things we actually have to pass-- the funding of the government. I hope we can do that in good faith. I hope our Democratic colleagues join Republicans at the table, and let's get the American people's business that must be done accomplished. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. China Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, this past Sunday, hundreds of thousands of protesters filled the streets of Hong Kong to remind Beijing that totalitarianism will no longer go unchallenged. I was reading a New York Times article about this protest when I came across a particularly striking quote. When asked why she had taken to the streets, a 24-year-old biology researcher named Alice said: We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong. We don't want to become like China. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this article on the Hong Kong human rights protest, that appeared in the December 9 edition of the New York Times and that depicts a beautiful picture of what people will do for the cause of freedom. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the New York Times, Dec. 7, 2019] Hong Kong Protest, Largest in Weeks, Stretches Several Miles (By Javier C. Hernandez and Elaine Yu) Hong Kong.--Hundreds of thousands of protesters, basking in a recent election victory by Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, poured onto the city's streets on Sunday in one of the largest marches in weeks to pressure the government to meet demands for greater civil liberties. The huge turnout was a reminder to China's leader, Xi Jinping, that the monthslong campaign against his authoritarian policies still had broad support in Hong Kong despite a weakening economy and increasingly violent clashes between protesters and the police. Tensions in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, had eased somewhat in recent days, after pro-democracy advocates won a stunning victory in local elections two weeks ago, giving new hope to the movement. On Sunday, demonstrators returned in force, packing city streets to denounce Mr. Xi's government, rail against police brutality and reiterate demands for greater civil liberties, including universal suffrage. They beat drums, sang protest anthems and chanted, ``Fight for freedom.'' Though the march was largely peaceful, some demonstrators vandalized shops and restaurants and lit a fire outside the high court. [[Page S7001]] ``We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong,'' said Alice Wong, 24, a biology researcher who stood among protesters gathered at Victoria Park. ``We don't want to become like China.'' As many as 800,000 people attended the march, according to Civil Human Rights Front, an advocacy group that organized the gathering. The mood at the march was relaxed, with people taking selfies against a backdrop of the vast crowds. Children, some dressed in black, marched with their parents, holding hands as they shouted, ``Stand with Hong Kong!'' A sea of protesters, spread across several miles, filled major thoroughfares as they moved between towering skyscrapers. In some areas, there were so many people that the crowds moved at a snail's pace and spilled into adjacent alleys. Some small businesses encouraged the turnout by promising giveaways if more than one million people joined the march. The protesters said they intended to remain peaceful on Sunday, but some vowed to use more aggressive tactics if the police cracked down. In the evening, the police readied canisters of tear gas as they stood opposite crowds of protesters who had barricaded a street downtown in a briefly tense moment. The large turnout could further embolden the movement's confrontational front-line protesters, who said they planned to disrupt the city's roads and public transportation system on Monday. The call for further action seemed to resonate among some protesters on Sunday. ``If the government still refuses to acknowledge our demands after today, we should and will escalate our protests,'' said Tamara Wong, 33, an office worker who wore a black mask as she stood among the crowd gathered at Victoria Park. The protesters have demanded amnesty for activists who were arrested and accused of rioting, as well as an independent investigation of police conduct during the demonstrations. Despite the show of strength on Sunday, it is unlikely that the protesters will win further concessions from Beijing, which has worked to portray demonstrators as rioters colluding with foreign governments to topple the governing Communist Party. Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University, said that even though Sunday's march showed the protest movement remained strong and unified, Beijing was unlikely to listen to its demands. ``Hong Kong is condemned to live in a permanent political crisis as long as China is ruled by the Communist Party,'' Professor Cabestan said. Mr. Xi, who has cultivated an image as a hard-line leader, has demanded ``unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent activities'' in Hong Kong. He has publicly endorsed the city's beleaguered leader, Carrie Lam, and her efforts to bring an end to the unrest. Chinese officials have suggested that the United States is responsible for helping fuel unrest in Hong Kong, pointing to statements by American officials in support of the protests. Last month, President Trump signed tough legislation that authorizes sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for rights abuses in Hong Kong. The move was welcomed by many protesters but also seen as exacerbating tensions between the two countries. In a possible sign of increased scrutiny of American citizens working in Hong Kong, two leaders of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said on Saturday that they had been denied entry to Macau, a semiautonomous Chinese city. Mr. Xi is expected to visit Macau this month to mark the 20th anniversary of the former Portuguese colony's return to China. Tara Joseph and Robert Grieves, the president and the chairman of the American business group, said they had planned to attend an annual ball put on by the chamber's Macau branch. ``We hope that this is just an overreaction to current events and that international business can constructively forge ahead,'' Ms. Joseph said. The protests, which began in June in opposition to a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, have hurt the tourism and retail sectors, pushing the city's economy into recession. In recent weeks, the violence has escalated, with protesters intensifying their efforts to vandalize businesses they associate with hostility to the movement. The police shot an antigovernment protester last month, inflaming tensions. Then, in some of the worst violence, universities became battlefields, with black-clad students hurling gasoline bombs, throwing bricks and aiming arrows at the riot police, who shot rubber bullets and fired tear gas in return. Many demonstrators acknowledge that a compromise with the government is unlikely, despite recent victories. Mrs. Lam, the city's leader, who is under pressure from Beijing to restore order without weakening the government's position, has brushed aside their demands and has warned that the mayhem could ``take Hong Kong to the road of ruin.'' Government officials have cast the demonstrations as primarily centered on economic issues, arguing that vast inequality in Hong Kong has exacerbated anger among the city's youth. They rolled out emergency measures recently to counter the effects of the turmoil on the economy, including providing electricity subsidies to businesses and expanding job training for young people. The authorities have justified their efforts to crack down on the movement by saying that protesters are endangering public safety. On Sunday, the police said they had found a 9- millimeter semiautomatic pistol, five magazines, 105 bullets and two ballistic vests, as well as fireworks, among other items, during a series of early morning raids. Senior Superintendent Steve Li of the Hong Kong Police said early in the day that officers had received information that the firearm and fireworks would have been used on Sunday to create chaos. The police have in recent months banned many protests and rallies in Hong Kong, citing safety concerns. But the government granted a rare approval for the march on Sunday, which was held to mark the United Nations' Human Rights Day. Demonstrators said they believed that the turnout sent a strong message: The protest movement would not back down. ``If the government thinks that we will give up,'' said Adam Wong, 23, a university student who was waving a black flag, ``today's turnout will prove them delusional.'' Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, Alice's statement is loaded with historical context and correctly implies that what we are seeing now is the culmination of a slow but sure violation of the laws and norms that once defined Hong Kong's semiautonomous relationship with mainland China. These protests erupted after what Beijing argued was a simple proposed change to existing extradition laws, but the people saw it for what it was--a thinly veiled threat to Hong Kong's relative autonomy. It wasn't a takeover. It was just that foot in the door, and China is nearly unparalleled in its ability to turn a foot in the door into a permanent existing condition. Sometimes their power plays are very obvious, and sometimes they are not. On my recent trip to Djibouti, I saw firsthand the influence of China's debt-trap diplomacy. Here is what debt-trap diplomacy is. It is a fancy way of saying that China has increased its influence around the world by offering to struggling nations that they are going to hold their debt in exchange for preferential treatment on trade or maybe a physical presence such as a port or other sweetheart deals. In Djibouti City, I saw this tactic run wild. Now China would say that what they have done is to help the Djiboutians create a ``smart city'' in the Horn of Africa, but in reality they have negotiated their way into creating a full-blown surveillance state. Cameras are everywhere--on every corner and every street, with 24/7 footage--and guess where that footage lands. Beijing. They have even tried to point one of those cameras at our military base, right at the entrance to Camp Lemonnier. Debt-trap diplomacy is bold. It is obvious. If that is all you see of China, it is easy to assume that all of their tactics are that bold and obvious. As I said, they will go after you in obvious areas and also in areas that are not as obvious. Even domestically, China's surveillance state is notoriously the opposite of covert. Their domestic ``smart city'' program has outpaced that of every other country on the face of the Earth and the majority of their $70-plus billion budget for that project has been spent not on intelligent power grids or traffic management systems or on clean air or clean water, but it is being spent on surveilling their own citizens. The greatest danger China has created by engaging in brash and at times absurd surveillance and suppression is that it has created a false sense of security here in the West when we don't see the evidence of what they are doing. In the United States we are not particularly vulnerable to their debt trap, but we are vulnerable to less obvious attempts to get that foot in the door. In some form or another, most Americans have allowed Big Tech to take hold of a portion of their lives. Smartphones and cloud storage once were very novel, but now we assume that even simple transactions come predicated by an additional condition. Everything is free as long as the app or the service has access to--guess what--your data. They want to own your virtual you. Popular apps like TikTok, whose parent company is based in China, have left me with more questions than answers about the platform's business practices, privacy protections, and ideological loyalty to the Communist [[Page S7002]] Party. Consider that the U.S Army has barred soldiers from using TikTok. Everybody needs to understand this. The U.S Army has said: You cannot use TikTok. This very body has expressed our concerns on a bipartisan basis with the platform's censorship and data handling practices. It is no wonder that TikTok's chief executive officer canceled this week's scheduled meetings here in DC with Members of this body. The fact that millions of Americans, especially our American children, continue to offer their personal data to TikTok is beyond disturbing, but we will not be able to roll back the creeping surveillance state without setting our own standards for what is acceptable from both foreign and domestic companies. When I introduced the BROWSER Act earlier this year, I did so not only to give Big Tech solid guidelines regarding data privacy and content but to set a new standard for what consumers expect from Big Tech. Our problem here in this country is pretty much one of awareness and of understanding that the exact same philosophy drives China's surveillance programs and their less obvious but much more personal individual monitoring schemes--their surveillance state scheme. China's Communist Party is after more than just ad revenue and more complete data sets. Their goal, as those Hong Kong protesters put it, is to trick other countries in becoming more like China, which is not tilting toward freedom but tilting away from freedom. My goal with the BROWSER Act and with my focus on what has become the surveillance state is to do the exact opposite--to enable freedom, to encourage freedom, not only here but around the globe--and to make certain that consumers here decide how much of their data they want to be able to share. We must make certain that we continue to support the cause of freedom wherever human beings show up to protect the freedoms they have. I yield the floor. Recognition of Minority Leader The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized. Jersey City Shooting Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I learned yesterday that two of the innocent victims in the shooting in Jersey City earlier this week are from my hometown, my home borough, the great borough of Brooklyn--Moshe Deutsch and Mindy Ferencz--and that the kosher deli where they were all killed in all likelihood was targeted as part of a hate crime. This morning, I stand in solidarity with the Jewish communities of New Jersey and New York as they confront the anti-Semitic poison that motivated that horrible attack, and I stand in sorrow at the loss of innocent lives from my community. May their memory be a blessing. I also salute the great police officer, as well, who fell in the line of duty trying to apprehend these brutal thugs. Impeachment Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on impeachment, the House Judiciary Committee will continue today its markup of Articles of Impeachment against Donald Trump. The articles charge that President Trump abused the Office of the Presidency by soliciting the interference of a foreign power in our elections to benefit himself personally. The articles also charge him with obstruction of justice in the investigation into those matters. Those articles were drafted after a months-long investigation into the President's dealings with Ukraine, which included scores of fact witnesses and expert testimony. Throughout that time, and still today, the White House refuses to participate in the House process. It has blocked key witnesses. It has withheld relevant documents. It has instructed members of the administration to defy congressional subpoenas and not to testify. Those that did testify did so bravely against the wishes of the White House. What is the President hiding? What do these witnesses know? What do these documents show? Those are fair questions that every American could ask and, because neither the President nor Republican Congress Members have presented any refutation of the facts in the impeachment charges or any exculpatory evidence other than grand conspiracy theories, the American people have a right to say the President must be hiding something. If there are documents or witnesses the President believes could provide exculpatory evidence, nothing is stopping the witnesses from testifying and the documents from being sent over, except the President of the United States, who in all likelihood is afraid of what they show because they confirm and corroborate the lengthy factual basis that the House compiled to come up with the Articles of Impeachment. The fact that President Trump is blocking witnesses from testifying and blocking documents from release means that, more likely than not, those witnesses and documents do not and cannot refute the charges against the President. When someone who might be guilty of a crime says he doesn't want witnesses of the crime to come forward, what do you think that means? Why haven't the President and his allies presented exculpatory evidence--evidence that says this is not true? Why, instead, have they created these bobbles, these objects far away, saying: There is a conspiracy here. There is a conspiracy there. It is the old lawyer saying: When you have the facts, argue the facts. When you have the law, argue the law. When you have neither, pound the table. In this case, pounding the table means coming up with diversionary conspiratorial theories. House Republicans, rather than mount a vigorous defense of the President on the merits, have attacked the process. If House Republicans could focus on the merits, could find evidence that said: No, this is not true; that is not true; he did not try to influence Ukraine to help his campaign, they would have presented it. Why has no evidence been presented directly refuting the core of the charge against the President? Because there probably isn't any. In the Senate we have several Members who are swimming in the murky waters of conspiracy to divert attention from the fact that they don't have the facts and the law on their side. The only way they can defend the President's comments is to come up with crazy, out-of-line conspiracy theories that are not based on any evidence. Some Senate Republicans find it so difficult to argue the President's defense on the facts that they resort to fiction. For instance, in the past few weeks, certain Republicans have actually helped spread disinformation invented by Putin's intelligence services. He said that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the election. No one believes it. There is no factual basis of it. Of course, Putin would say he wants to divert attention from Russia, but it is amazing that Senators would traffic in those theories, totally made up, not one bit of fact. It is a low moment for the Senate when their blind obeisance to President Trump overshadows any need to find truth and to defend rule of law. That is not what a democracy is about. That is the edges of dictatorship. Chairman Graham conducted an entire hearing yesterday to give public viewing to the now completely debunked conspiracy theory that the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign began with political motives. Inspector General Horowitz, to his credit, stuck to the findings in the report. He found no evidence of bias. So Senator Graham, as he tends to do these days, put on a big show, a lot of ranting, a lot of raving--no refutation of the fact of what the IG found. So it is just like Ukraine where certain Members are so unable to defend what the President did with Ukraine, they latch on to Russian propaganda, or they come up with these histrionics, again, to try to divert attention, a shiny object to take the American people's attention away from the wrongdoing that the House is accusing him of. In fact, the deputy counsel of the FBI actually said that the department ``would be derelict in its responsibility'' if it did not open an investigation into Trump. She is not a political person. She is a law enforcement officer. If you think President Trump is above the law, go right ahead, but that is not what George Washington or Benjamin Franklin or Thompson Jefferson [[Page S7003]] or Alexander Hamilton thought this Nation was about; that is not what generations of Americans who fought and died for our country thought it was about. We have reached a low moment in American history and a very low moment for the Republican Party now that it has been taken over by Donald Trump. This is not the Republican Party of the last 150 years. All of this is a backdrop to the impending trial of President Trump, where two lines of argument may be presented in a court of impeachment. One line of argument--accusations against the President--has relied on facts, public record, and the sworn testimony of dozens of officials with knowledge of the events. The other line of argument--the defense of the President--has so far relied on conspiracy, innuendo, hyperventilation about the process, with no refutation of the specific facts that the House has found. The American people will be savvy enough over the next several months to tell the difference. Tax Reform Madam President, now, on taxes, this month marks 2 years since President Trump and the congressional Republicans passed a trillion- dollar tax cut for large corporations and the richest Americans. Republicans make many promises to sell this legislation as a boom for jobs and middle class. They were outlandish at the time, and now, recent history has proven them even crazier. Two years later, these phony promises have not come close to living up to their billing. President Trump promised the tax bill would benefit middle-class America, creating a $4,000 raise for every American family. No way. Ask the average American family. The rich Americans will say yes. The top 1 percent will say yes, but, of course, they received a tax cut 64 times the size of the one given to the middle class. President Trump and Republicans promised the bill would prompt businesses to increase investments into their companies, leading to job growth and higher wages. This, too, has proved a fantasy. Less than 5 percent of all workers in America were ultimately promised pay increases or bonuses as a result of the tax cut. Out of 5.9 million employers, only 413 announced bonuses to workers or wage hikes. Do you want to know where the lion's share of that Republican tax cut went? Shareholders, not workers. In the 2 years since the tax bill, the annual total of corporate stock buybacks have shattered records over $1 trillion in 2018. It is impossible to look at the last 2 years with a straight face and say that the Republican tax cut was designed or is helping middle-class families. If anything, the Republican tax bill exacerbated the already staggering inequalities of work and wealth in our country. We need to start moving the needle in a completely opposite direction. Next year, voters will have a chance to make that happen by voting for a change in the Senate leadership. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nomination of Lawrence VanDyke Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Republican majority leader was on the floor a little earlier, and he talked about the business of the Senate and how busy we are in the Senate. I would like to state for the record, so far in the calendar year 2019, on the floor of this U.S Senate, where the greatest deliberative body meets and considers the lofty issues of our time, in the year 2019--currently this year--we have considered 22 amendments in the entire year--22 amendments. Madam President, six of them were offered by the junior Senator from Kentucky. One Senator had six amendments: Senator Rand Paul. They were all defeated. Then some 16 other amendments were offered. To put that into perspective, on a good day in the Senate, when the Senate was the Senate, there would be 10 amendments; bills would come to the floor; we would debate; amendments would be adopted. Some would lose. People would give speeches. We would pass legislation, send it over to the House, go to a conference. We don't do that anymore. Under Senator McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, we do not do that anymore. There were 22 amendments in the course of the entire year. If we were paid for the actual piecework that we do, we would not get a paycheck this year because we haven't done anything. I will take that back. What we have done is to fill as many Federal court vacancies as possible with some of the most unqualified people ever offered by a President of the United States. This week, a man named VanDyke is being named to the court in Nevada. He has such a limited connection with Nevada that both Nevada Senators refuse to approve him for this court appointment. He has no connection to their State, but he was chosen by the White House. He went through a background check by the American Bar Association, and they concluded unanimously that he was unqualified to be a Federal judge--unqualified. He is not the first. Under this President, we have had nine different court nominees found unqualified by the American Bar Association. You say, Well, that is going to happen, lawyers disagree. Do you know how many were found unqualified under the Obama administration in 8 years? None, not one. There are nine unqualified men and women now with lifetime appointments on the Federal bench because, for Senator McConnell, that is his priority: Fill the bench with people of his political stripe at any cost. Take up legislation? No. The Democratically-controlled House of Representatives has sent us over 200 different measures to consider on the floor of the Senate. Senator McConnell has refused. He will not take up any legislation. He is very proud of it. To his credit, he is not ashamed or embarrassed. He says to call himself the Grim Reaper when it comes to measures coming over from the House. He is here to kill them, and he has done a pretty good job of that, if that is his goal in what he wants to achieve. When I hear him come to the floor and say we are not doing enough in the Senate--22 amendments in 1 year. I say to Senator McConnell, you have been in the Senate for a long time. You know that that number tells the whole story. For-Profit Colleges and Universities Madam President, it is the holiday season, and many families are gathering at special meals, giving gifts, with a lot of fond memories, but instead of celebrating, hundreds of thousands of people across America who have been defrauded by for-profit colleges and universities are just trying to get by. There will not be many presents that they will be able to give or probably receive. They have been waiting day in and day out for one person to make a decision. Her name is Betsy DeVos. She is the Secretary of Education. She can provide them relief from their federal student loans that they desperately need, but she refuses to do it. After being lured with false promises, these people I am talking about ended up in programs at for-profit colleges and universities. Who were the for-profits? See if these names ring a bell: Corinthian, ITT Tech, Westwood, DeVry, University of Phoenix, Dream Center. These are for-profit colleges and universities, and these student borrowers were left with mountains of debt, worthless credits, and diplomas that employers laugh at when it was all said and done. Now, Secretary DeVos refuses to provide these students with relief from their student loan debt to which they are entitled under the borrower defense provision of the Higher Education Act. Take Rachel from Missouri who attended Corinthian's Everest College. She says, ``I am not able to buy my children clothes or shoes.'' Pamela from South Carolina owes $140,000 after attending the corrupt ITT Tech for-profit school. Here is what she says: ``I have an autistic daughter that depends on me, and I can't afford to get a decent place to live or buy the things she needs.'' Is that any surprise with $140,000 in debt from one of these corrupt for-profit colleges? Jennifer, who attended the Illinois Institute of Art--not to be mixed up [[Page S7004]] with the Illinois Art Institute, a reputable institution--but the Illinois Institute of Art where she attended, she owes $67,800 in Federal student loans, and she says, ``The stress and anxiety of working 3 jobs to make a living to pay off these loans, feed my kids, and keep a roof over my head, is exhausting.'' For borrowers like Rachel, Pamela, and Jennifer, Secretary DeVos might as well be Secretary Scrooge this holiday season. She continues to deny them a fresh start. She continues to refuse to apply the borrowed defense provision which would allow the discharge of their federal student debt. More than 200,000 borrowers find themselves in similar positions, while Secretary DeVos lets claims back up at the Department. She has failed to approve a single claim in more than a year, not one for all these hundreds of thousands of students facing this fraudulent debt. Why we should give them a break? Why should they have any forgiveness for student debt? Let me tell you why. It is because it starts with the U.S Federal Government Department of Education recognizing the accreditation of these institutions--these worthless institutions. That accreditation says to students applying there: This is a real college. Well, it turns out that they weren't real colleges and universities. But they were real when it came to costs. Some of the most expensive places to attend higher education in America are these for-profit colleges and universities. What kind of record do they have? Well, consider this: just nine percent of all postsecondary students in America go to these for-profit colleges and universities--nine percent. This will be on the final, for the students who are listening. Nine percent go to for-profit colleges and universities. Thirty-three percent of all the federal student loan defaults are from students at for-profit colleges and universities. What does that tell you? Well, if I go to one of these schools, I am going to rack up a lot of debt. Maybe I will not be able to find a job; maybe I will not even be able to finish school; and then I learn my credits aren't even transferable from a for-profit school to a real college or university. It all started with the U.S Federal Government recognizing the accreditation of these schools, saying ``These are real schools,'' with the students depending on that accreditation. Then they backed it up, saying: Oh, incidentally, you can borrow money from the Federal Government to go to these real schools. Then, when these schools went bankrupt, when they defrauded everyone in sight, when they were sued by the State attorneys general and other federal agencies, when it turned out they were big frauds and the students saw the schools crumble in front of them, the students ended up with the debt. We say, under the law, that the Federal Government has some responsibility. We should have done a better job of overseeing these schools. That isn't the way Secretary DeVos sees it. As far as she is concerned, these kids are on their own. They are not kids anymore. They have been hanging on to their student debt for so long, they don't know which way to turn. Despite Secretary DeVos's excuses, the reality is that nothing is legally preventing her from providing borrower defense discharges to these students for the loans they took out at these for-profit colleges and universities. She could do it tomorrow. She could clear the backlog quickly, if she wanted to. We know using her legal authority to provide relief to defrauded borrowers gives her ``extreme displeasure''. We know that because she wrote that in an order she issued for the Department. She was extremely displeased to discharge the student loans of these students who had been defrauded by for-profit schools. Well, I am not surprised. She surrounded herself at the Department of Education with people from that industry who believe that the industry has done no wrong. We know better. We also know from her previous statements that Secretary DeVos thinks many borrowers got some value from their experience, even though they were defrauded into massive debt. She thinks these borrowers are just after ``free money,'' and they don't deserve a full discharge. Yesterday, National Public Radio released a series of internal Department memos showing that the facts don't back up Secretary DeVos's claims. Back in 2017, the Department staff concluded that ``the value of an ITT [Tech] education--like Corinthian--is likely either negligible or nonexistent.'' This was a school whose accreditation was recognized by our Federal Government, Secretary DeVos, and it has turned out to be worthless. The memo went on to conclude, ``Accordingly, it is appropriate, for the Department to award eligible borrowers full relief.'' I agree. It is reasonable for the Department of Education to try to make amends for this miserable failure of oversight of these schools and to give these student borrowers a chance. Nonetheless, this week, Secretary DeVos announced a new scheme to use something called gainful employment earnings data to deny defrauded student borrowers full discharges. Remember, that the gainful employment rule was meant to ensure that programs were actually preparing students for jobs after graduation. But Secretary DeVos delayed and then eliminated the rule. Now, instead of using gainful employment data to hold poor-performing programs accountable, she wants to use it to punish defrauded student borrowers. She has already tried it once, only to be told by a Federal judge that what she did was illegal. While it is unclear if this slightly tweaked version of the scheme will pass legal muster, the result for the borrowers would be the same: ultimate denial in terms of full relief from their student loans from miserable for-profit schools. Not only is Secretary DeVos delaying and denying relief for previously defrauded borrowers, she is rewriting the rules to make it almost impossible for future defrauded borrowers to get relief. She continues to recognize the accreditation of these unworthy institutions. She continues to say to the United States and the world: These are perfectly good schools. Then, when it turns out they are perfectly awful, she wants to accept no responsibility. She released a new version of the borrower defense rule just a few months ago that places unreasonable burdens on borrowers, way beyond their capacity to detect the fraud being perpetrated at the time. The net result is this: According to The Institute for College Access and Success, the new DeVos rule will cancel just 3 percent of all loans associated with misconduct. She is going to cancel 3 percent. In September, I introduced a resolution in the Senate to overturn the DeVos borrower defense rule. Forty-two of my colleagues have joined me. I plan to bring it to a vote on the Senate floor, where it needs a simple majority to pass. Just this week, 57 student, veteran, and consumer organizations released a letter supporting the resolution. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: December 9, 2019. Senator Dick Durbin, Washington, DC. Representative Susie Lee, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Durbin and Representative Lee: As 57 organizations representing and advocating for students, families, taxpayers, veterans and service members, faculty and staff, civil rights and consumers, we write in support of your efforts to disapprove the 2019 Borrower Defense to Repayment rule pursuant to the Congressional Review Act. The purpose of the borrower defense rule as defined by the Higher Education Act is to protect students and taxpayers from fraud, deception, and other illegal misconduct by unscrupulous colleges. A well-designed rule will both provide relief to students who have been lied to and cheated, and deter illegal conduct by colleges. However, the final rule issued by the Department of Education on September 23, 2019, would accomplish neither of these goals. An analysis of the Department's own calculations estimates that only 3 percent of the loans that result from school misconduct would be cancelled under the new rule. Schools would be held accountable for reimbursing taxpayers for just 1 percent of these loans. The DeVos Borrower Defense rule issued in September imposes unreasonable time limits on student borrowers who have been deceived and misled by their schools. It requires applicants to meet thresholds that make it almost impossible for wronged borrowers to obtain loan cancellation. [[Page S7005]] The rule eliminates the ability of groups of borrowers to be granted relief, even in cases where there is substantial compelling evidence of widespread wrongdoing. It prohibits the filing of claims after three years even when evidence of wrongdoing emerges at a later date. It requires borrowers to prove schools intended to deceive them or acted recklessly, although students have no ability to access evidence that might show this intent. And the rule stipulates that student loans taken by students under false pretenses are insufficient evidence of financial harm to allow the loans to be cancelled. Additionally, the 2019 rule eliminates the promise of automatic loan relief to eligible students whose school closed before they could graduate. Instead, the Department would force each eligible student impacted by a school closure to individually find out about their statutory right to relief, apply, and navigate the government's bureaucracy to have their loans cancelled. Many of us wrote to the Department in August 2018 in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking and offered carefully considered recommendations. However, the Department rejected our recommendations that would have provided a fair process that protects students and taxpayer dollars. Instead, the new rule would do little to provide relief to students who have been lied to, and even less to dissuade colleges from systematically engaging in deceptive and illegal recruitment tactics. Moreover, a borrower defense rule that fails to adequately protect students harms the most vulnerable students, including first-generation college students, Black and Latino students, and military-connected students, who are targeted by and disproportionately enroll in predatory for-profit colleges. Meanwhile, the Department refuses to take action on a massive backlog of over 200,000 pending borrower defense claims, having failed to approve or deny a single claim in over a year. We fully support your effort to repeal the 2019 borrower defense rule, and look forward to restoration of the 2016 rule, which took major steps to provide a path to loan forgiveness for the hundreds of thousands of students who attended schools where misconduct has already been well documented.

When our resolution comes to the floor, I hope a handful of my Republican colleagues will take a look at it and realize that we have to give these students a second chance at their lives. We misled them into attending for-profit schools that were worthless. The schools defrauded them. They ended up with a debt to our government, and under the provisions of the Higher Education Act, that debt can be forgiven. Let's give these defrauded student borrowers a second chance. Ultimately, they deserve an opportunity from our government to have a better holiday coming before them and a better life ahead. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott of Florida). The Senator from Ohio. United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor several times over the past year to talk about the importance of passing the U.S -Mexico-Canada Agreement. This is the successor agreement to the 25-year-old NAFTA accord. Yes, it has been a year; in fact, it has been over a year since that agreement was negotiated between Canada and Mexico, and then Congress was meant to take it up. It has been too long. However, I am happy to report today that now we are at the end of that long process. I am told that the legislation is actually going to be voted on in the House of Representatives probably next week and then here in the U.S Senate right after the holidays. We will have a chance, finally, to pass this agreement that is so good for the farmers, for the workers, for the manufacturers, and for the small businesses that I represent. I am really pleased that the President of the United States and his chief trade negotiator, Bob Lighthizer, had the persistence to get this done. I am not sure I would have had the same patience. I also want to congratulate House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for making the decision to move forward with it. This is one of these situations in which, under our law, the agreement has to be voted on first by the House. So the Speaker of the House had an unusual role here, where it couldn't go forward without her approval. Again, finally, we are there. The agreement, which was negotiated over a year ago and languished-- specific language was sent up here in May of last year--is pretty much the same. About 99 percent of it is the same agreement. It is a good agreement because it opens up more markets for us. What has changed is there are new provisions, different provisions, as it relates to enforcing the labor standards that are already in the agreement. In the agreement, what Mexico and Canada were asked to do, in addition to the United States, in terms of higher labor standards, was negotiated over a year ago, but what has happened over, really, the past several months is now there is a mechanism to enforce it that is a little different. I think it will make it easier to enforce potential violations of the agreement we have reached, particularly with regard to Mexico. It doesn't really come back against the United States at all. We can explain this in more detail as we see the exact language that is coming up in the next couple of days. The bottom line is, for a U.S company, the labor standards that are established are the ones we already have in our law. For Mexico or Canada to file an objection to us potentially not following that agreement is simply after there has been a U.S law processed, which would involve the National Labor Relations Board and our existing law, so it really shouldn't affect us at all. By the way, Secretary Scalia, who is the Secretary of Labor, was very involved in ensuring that it wouldn't come back on U.S companies, on U.S workers, and on our economy. At the end of the day, although it took way too long to get there, we have ended up with a very good result--an agreement that does expand trade, and that is the whole idea. We have talked a lot on the floor as to why this is so important. I will tell you, in my home State of Ohio, we send more than half of our exports to two countries, Canada and Mexico. By far, the No. 1 trading partner is Mexico, and No. 2 is Canada. This is really important because these jobs are really important. It is about $28 billion a year. These are jobs that pay higher wages and better benefits--export jobs. For our farmers, this is really important. For manufacturers and workers, it is really important because this lets them be able to do what we do best, which is efficiently and productively make things and produce things that could be sold to other markets. Remember, in America, we are only about 5 percent of the global economy--five percent of the people--so our [[Page S7006]] population is only about 5 percent, but we are about 25 percent of the GDP of the world. We are a relatively small country by population, but we have this big economy. To access that 95 percent of consumers outside of America to sell our products is absolutely essential to our prosperity here, to our jobs here. As I mentioned earlier, those export jobs tend to be better jobs and higher paying jobs with better benefits. What does this agreement do? First of all, it creates a bunch of new jobs. This chart has 176,000-plus new jobs. That is because the International Trade Commission--which is the independent body that analyzes these things--gave us a range. The GDP increased. It increased our economy. The number of jobs is huge, by the way--greater than any other trade agreement we have entered into, greater on the economic growth side than the Trans-Pacific Partnership that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle thought was something we should have entered into and was so important. This is even bigger. Obviously, it is so big because Canada and Mexico are such big trading partners with us. So even relatively small changes to open up new markets have a big impact. These are going to be welcome jobs and, again, higher paying jobs. Second, it really helps us with regard to online sales. One of our advantages as a country is we do a lot of commerce over the internet. When the original NAFTA agreement was written and was currently enforced--the status quo--there really were not any significant online sales--virtually none. So there were no provisions in there. Every modern trade agreement has provisions for online sales or for sales over the internet. Now we have them with regard to Mexico and Canada, which we would not have had under the old NAFTA. So that is a big improvement. For Ohio, that is a lot of small companies because entrepreneurs--some of these new startups are online companies--really like these provisions. By the way, it says a number of things. It says you can't require localization of data. In other words, Canada and Mexico can't say: Hey, you have to have your servers in our country if you are going to do business with us. That is really important to our American online industry. Second, it says that you can't put tariffs on data online. Again, it is very important to establish that, not just for Canada and Mexico but as a precedent for other trade agreements going forward. Third, it actually raises the de minimis level. In other words, to apply customs duties on stuff going to Canada and Mexico, they have a very low level. We have a relatively high level here. That level has increased for Canada and Mexico. That is an administrative burden that is lifted off of a lot of these small businesses but also a costsaver because they don't have to pay customs duty on a relatively small product that goes to another country. These are all good things for American jobs. Again, we have a comparative advantage here because we do a lot of online sales. Third is more U.S -made steel and auto parts. This is really important to Ohio but also to our country. Manufacturing is now finally on the upswing. Manufacturing jobs are actually increasing in this country for the first time in years, and we are getting back on our feet in terms of what has always made America great, which is that we produce things; we make things. So this agreement helps. It says, as an example, that 70 percent of the steel that goes into automobiles--and the automobile industry is a big deal for Canada and Mexico and the United States--has to be from North America. That helps U.S steel mills and steel mills in Ohio, as opposed to steel coming in from China, for example, from Brazil, and from other countries. Second, it changes the rules of origin--how much stuff can go into an automobile that comes from other countries. It is 62\\1/2\\ percent now, and it would take it up to 75 percent in this agreement. That is the highest level of any agreement we have with anybody. Why is that important? Well, think about it. We have agreed with Canada and Mexico that we are going to have this agreement that lowers the tariffs in all these countries and lowers the trade barriers generally. In other words, it gives them an advantage in our market. We get an advantage in their market. That is the idea. If you don't have a rule of origin where you say stuff can't come in from other countries and take advantage of that, then you have basically free riders. As an example, China can send a bunch of their auto parts to Mexico and produce a car that is a Mexican car that therefore gets the benefit of the NAFTA agreement. China has not opened its market at all; it has only provided this product to Mexico. But then the product gets the advantage of the lower tariffs and lower trade barriers generally. That is not fair. Raising it from 62\\1/2\\ percent to 75 percent is really significant. Again, it is the highest number of any trade agreement we have, and it avoids this problem. Some of us say: Gee, that sounds protectionist. I don't think it is. I think what it says to China, Japan, Brazil, or other countries is that if you want to get the advantage of the U.S market that Canada and Mexico are getting and that we get reciprocally from them, then enter into a trade agreement with us. Let's have more trade agreements. Let's lower the barriers for everybody. That actually will expand trade. But we ought not to allow them to do it without that. This is a big deal. It also is true that in this agreement, there is something unprecedented with regard to leveling the playing field. Remember, a basic concept of our trade laws is that you want to have a balanced trade law where you have imports and exports because that makes sense-- keeps consumer prices down and allows us to have good jobs here--but you want it to be reciprocal and balanced. You don't want to have a situation where a country, because of its low wage rates and lack of labor standards or lack of environmental standards, where it is polluting a lot, can take advantage by having lower cost goods coming into America. In this agreement, we do say that there is a minimum wage for between 40 and 45 percent of the auto production. It is $16 an hour. That will end up benefiting us because wages are relatively higher in America and Canada than they are in Mexico. That will be good for auto jobs here and help to level the playing field. This is why you might have seen that some of the labor unions are supporting this agreement and some of the U.S manufacturers are supporting this agreement. They have a lot of facilities here in America, and they like that part of it as well. There are new markets for farmers. I mean, this is kind of a no- brainer that has made it, for me, frustrating over the last year because we haven't been able to move forward on this agreement while farmers have really been suffering because of a few different things. One is weather. We have had some lousy weather, particularly in my State and across the Midwest, where it is too wet to plant and too dry for the crops to grow properly for a harvest, and that has hit us hard. We couldn't plant in Ohio in a number of cases this last year because of the weather being too wet, and so farmers have been hit by that. The second is that prices have been relatively low--not just recently but really over the last several years for different commodities such as corn, soybeans, and wheat. Part of that is because of the global markets. Part of it is because of the third issue, which is China. Because of our ongoing negotiation with China and disputes with China over what they are doing on intellectual property, stealing our technology, and other issues, they have bought less of our farm products. For Ohio, as an example, our No. 1 market overseas for soybeans is China, and one out of every three acres planted in Ohio is planted for export. Think about how that affects your prices if you lose that big market share and that big customer. I am pleased to say that we seem to be making some progress with China right now, incidentally, as an aside. It is great to have this agreement done. The next agreement I hope we get done is with China and get them to play by the rules and open those markets more. This week, they started to buy more soybeans, and that is good. In the meantime, our farmers are desperate for more markets, and in this [[Page S7007]] agreement, that is exactly what they get. So if you are an Ohio farmer--and we are No. 2 in the country on eggs--you can now have access to these markets in Canada and Mexico, on eggs, that you never had before. On dairy, Canada in particular has some very protectionist provisions in place with regard to dairy products--think milk and cheese. If you are an Ohio dairy farmer, you can sell stuff into Canada you couldn't sell before--also pork, beef, wheat, and other products. This is good for our farmers. This is why over 1,000 farm groups around the country have supported this agreement. I mean, I don't know a farm group in Ohio that doesn't support it strongly. Again, part of it is that this is a great agreement for them, and part of it is that they are hurting, and this gives them some light at the end of the tunnel, an opportunity to see new markets and therefore see some prices increase in our ag community. This is a good agreement that is good for jobs, good for small business, as we talked about, good for farmers, good for workers, and good for our economy. It is important that we get it done. I am glad the House is going to go ahead and vote on it in the next week. I wish we could vote here in the Senate right away, too, but under the process called trade promotion authority, we do have some processes we need to go through. It is probably best to have it happen after the holidays. Right after the holidays, my hope is that here on the floor of the Senate, Members will look at this for what it is. This is not a Democratic or a Republican victory; this is an American victory. Again, I appreciate the efforts of President Donald Trump because he was persistent and tough on the negotiations, and then he was persistent and patient in working with the U.S Congress. There were a lot of people saying: Go ahead and send the agreement up and try to jam the Democrats into doing the right thing. He didn't do that. He waited to figure out a way to come up with an agreement, particularly on the labor enforcement provisions we talked about, and as a result, we now have the ability on a bipartisan basis to get this done. I hope the vote in the House will reflect that; likewise, here in the Senate. I know there are some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who think this agreement is not perfect. No agreement is perfect; I will just say that. I am a former U.S Trade Representative. I am a former trade lawyer. I am a former member of the Ways and Means Committee, which is the trade committee over there. I am now on the trade committee here, the Finance Committee. No agreement is ever perfect. It is not the agreement exactly that you would write or I would write, but, boy, this is a good agreement. To make perfect the enemy of the good would hurt the farmers and the workers and the small businesses that we represent that want this agreement badly because they know it is going to help them. The other thing I would say is that it also helps our relationships with our two biggest trading partners in Ohio, Canada and Mexico, and also our neighbors. For North America's future, this is a good idea--to have the certainty and predictability that comes with an agreement we have all been able to coalesce around and improve the status quo. NAFTA was negotiated 25 years ago. A lot has happened in the last 25 years. We talked about how the digital economy has transformed our economy, and we have a competitive and comparative advantage in that. That is one small example. So many things have changed. We have better protections for intellectual property in this agreement, as an example. We have these new trade-opening opportunities in agriculture. We have these opportunities in manufacturing to do more here in North America and specifically in the United States. A vote against this new agreement is a vote for NAFTA, which is this 25-year-old agreement that has these flaws because that is the status quo. My hope is that the next time I come to this floor to talk about this, it will be to ask my colleagues in short order to support a vote, that it will have come out of the Finance Committee with a strong bipartisan vote, that it will have come to the floor with a strong vote from the House, and that we can get this done. Then President Trump can sign it, and the people we represent will be better off, our community of nations here in North America will be better off, and the United States of America will have another victory. I yield back. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Appropriations Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I came to the floor this morning to address what has been an alarming and inaccurate information campaign that is being spread about the international family planning amendment included in this year's State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill. I would note that while this amendment is referred to as the ``Shaheen amendment'' in alarmist and inaccurate blog posts, it is actually bipartisan language that was agreed to by both the subcommittee and full committee chairs of the Appropriations Committee and ultimately approved unanimously by Republicans and Democrats in the committee. Yet articles and op-eds online have condemned the amendment as pro-abortion. I was surprised to hear this given that, despite my objections, the amendment does not address the Mexico City policy--or the global gag rule, as it is known--abortion services, or information. In fact, this is the first time in 18 years--I am going to say that again. It is the first time in 18 years that members of the Appropriations Committee were prevented from offering a bipartisan amendment that would strip the bill of the Mexico City provision. Instead of allowing the established committee process to amend the SFOPs bill with this provision, the entire bill was pulled from consideration. In response to that, in an effort to ensure the bill wasn't endangered, I worked with my colleagues Senator Collins of Maine and Senator Murkowski of Alaska and with Republican leadership to limit the scope of the amendment so we could allow the appropriations bill to go forward. It is false--absolutely, positively false--to say this amendment funds abortions abroad. In fact, it is wrong to say, and inaccurate to say, that any U.S assistance goes to funding abortions at home or abroad. In compliance with U.S law, family planning funding does not and never has gone to abortion services. I hope everyone is clear about that. Under our law, family planning funding does not go to support abortion services. Now that I have outlined what this amendment does not do, let me discuss what it does do. It provides an increase of $57.5 million for a total of $632.5 million for existing international family planning accounts. This money funds programs and services that provide modern contraceptives, which 214 million women around the world who want to avoid pregnancy are not able to access. Again, I don't know when the debate around abortion came to include contraceptives and family planning. It also would allow for the healthy timing and spacing of births, which is very important to the health of infants and it is important to the health of women to be able to space the births of their children to recover between births. It provides education information and counseling about family planning issues. It ensures access to antenatal and postnatal care for a healthy mother and baby. It provides for HPV vaccination and prevention, something very important to the health of children. These are a few of the critical services the assistance provides. The impact of these services is very real. According to the Guttmacher Institute, with each additional $10 million the U.S dedicates to family planning and reproductive health programs, 400,000 more women and couples receive contraceptives services and supplies. With the $57.5 million increase provided for in this amendment, more than 2.2 million women and couples [[Page S7008]] will have that access. That will result in 654,500 fewer unintended pregnancies, 291,500 fewer unplanned births, 280,500 fewer induced abortions. If you care about abortion and you don't believe that is the right alternative, then you should support family planning because that gives families and couples an option to ensure they can have the children they want, and it would provide for 1,320 fewer deaths of women. While these numbers are stark, the transformative effect of simply having access to family planning information and services on the lives of women and their families should not be underestimated. The most vulnerable women who are reached by family planning programs report that learning about family planning options, receiving services to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and ensuring that wanted pregnancies are healthy and happy so the babies they want to have are healthy and happy gives them some control over their lives. Many women are making healthcare choices for themselves and their families for the very first time with help from these programs. These critical programs change lives, and our partners who implement these programs are indispensable. In October, USAID Administrator Mark Green said he could not ``imagine an effective development Agency that doesn't partner with the community of faith.'' Luckily, he doesn't have to. For those people who were worried that family planning programs are not going to be implemented by our faith community, that is just wrong. The family planning account goes to a range of program implementers, including healthcare providers, international NGOs, and faith-based organizations alike. All of these organizations have the goal of saving women's lives and saving the lives of their children. They need more resources, not fewer, to do this work. What else does the international family planning amendment do? It includes an additional $33 million to USAID's family planning account for money that is rerouted away from the U.N Population Fund. Again, unlike what the blogs are mistakenly saying, this is not money that currently goes to UNFPA's lifesaving operations. Instead, it will be redirected back into the family planning account and contribute to the programs I just outlined. Third, the amendment requires the Government Accountability Office to produce a report that evaluates the efficacy of family planning programs and their structure. Again, this was another bipartisan effort with my Republican colleagues to ensure that our U.S dollars are most effective and they contribute to programs and services that are most effective. Again, if you have a concern about how family planning dollars are being spent, then you should support this amendment because it is going to give us data and information to show what is effective and what isn't. Finally, the amendment includes language to reaffirm an existing nondiscrimination policy within USAID. This is an existing nondiscrimination policy. This is not a new policy. That policy within USAID ensures the services funded by these accounts reach all segments of the population. As I said, this is not a new policy. The anti-discrimination policy has existed for several years, and it is not targeted toward faith- based organizations, despite what some of the blogs mistakenly are putting out there. In fact, the complaints I have heard in my office about single women being rejected for services didn't touch on work that faith-based organizations are doing. I hope all of our colleagues in the Senate will not allow misinformation about the family planning dollars that are in the State and Foreign Operations bill to dismantle what has been a very important bipartisan achievement. Its impact is too great and its programs are too important to let them be killed by a campaign to try and mislead people about what is in the amendment. I yield the floor. NOMINATION OF AURELIA SKIPWITH Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to share with the Senate my reasons for opposing the nomination of Aurelia Skipwith to serve as the Director of the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service. Let me begin by saying that I am disappointed to find myself in this position. When I had the privilege of serving as Governor of Delaware, I was able to assemble my own leadership team, so I appreciate how important it is that people in executive positions, including Presidents, have that same ability. However, in article II of the Constitution, our Founders set up a system in which the President would nominate individuals to the top posts in our government and Senators would provide ``advice and consent'' on those nominees. In order for the Senate to fulfill that constitutional role, those nominated individuals must cooperate with the confirmation process. And, unfortunately, Ms. Skipwith has not provided information requested by the Democrats during the nomination process. Despite my repeated requests for the nominee to be more forthcoming-- requests made twice in writing and twice in person. during her nomination process--Ms. Skipwith has refused. Instead, she has given me the impression that she does not take this confirmation process seriously. Her lack of candor has elevated questions that already existed about her qualifications, her commitment to environmental conservation and whether she can ethically lead the Fish and Wildlife Service. Therefore, I cannot support this nomination. Ms. Skipwith first joined the Trump administration in April 2017. when she was appointed as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Fish and Wildlife and Parks, a non-Senate-confirmed political appointment at the Department of the Interior. During her tenure there, the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed and finalized controversial regulations that drastically altered implementation of the Endangered Species Act. The Service has also issued a legal opinion that changes the way the Department of the Interior enforces the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Former senior Interior officials from every administration since the early 1970s, both Republican and Democrat, have strongly opposed this Migratory Bird Treaty Act legal opinion. At her confirmation hearing, Ms. Skipwith vehemently defended it. Prior to her controversial tenure at the Interior Department, Ms. Skipwith had no previous work experience related to conservation or wildlife management--none. By contrast, the 16 individuals who previously served as Fish and Wildlife Service Directors for both Republican and Democratic Presidents had an estimated average of 12 years of experience at the Fish and Wildlife Service before taking on the Director role. They also have an estimated average of more than 22 years of professional experience in fields related to wildlife or fisheries management. Ms. Skipwith has also not seemed to make up for her lack of previous experience while on the job. At her confirmation hearing, when asked to name the conservation scientist who had most influenced her career and her approach to wildlife and fisheries management, Ms. Skipwith struggled to name any conservation scientist. Ultimately, she named a former Monsanto vice president with whom she used to work, but she misremembered his name. This was not an insignificant misstep. To me, it was revealing. Ms. Skipwith's response to my simple question represented a clear lack of familiarity with the basics of wildlife management, a troubling quality for a Fish and Wildlife Director nominee. By contrast, Ms. Skipwith does have significant experience in the agribusiness industry. Before joining the Trump administration, she worked for Monsanto, one of the world's largest agrochemical firms. Monsanto regularly has business interests before the Interior Department. She also worked for Alltech, a Kentucky-based agricultural products company. She also co-founded AVC Global, an agribusiness-technology start up, and was employed by Gage International, a Washington, DC, based lobbying firm founded by her fiance. That is why even before her confirmation hearing, I asked Ms. Skipwith some basic questions about how these companies operate and [[Page S7009]] whether Ms. Skipwith has recused herself from working on those issues. Unfortunately, Ms. Skipwith has refused to answer those questions. She has repeatedly refused to provide her calendars with the appointments she has had as a Department of the Interior official. This information could be made available to any member of the public under the Freedom of Information Act, but she has refused to provide it to me for months within the confirmation process. This information is important because Ms. Skipwith's former employer, Gage International, has represented water utilities that have lobbied Congress to weaken Western water policy and the Endangered Species Act. Unanswered questions also remain about Ms. Skipwith's role in the development of a controversial repeal of an existing ban on using pesticides that have been shown to harm birds and bees in national wildlife refuges. And one of the largest producers of these pesticides is Monsanto, another one of Ms. Skipwith's former employers. Yet when Senator Gillibrand asked Ms. Skipwith about her role in the ban's repeal, Ms. Skipwith defended the reversal but denied any role in the decision. This answer does not appear to be consistent with some of the email records that have been obtained under Freedom of Information Act, which show that she expressed interest in the matter and received materials on the issue from career staff. If Ms. Skipwith was indeed involved with the decision to reverse the pesticides ban, it would constitute a violation of the ethics pledge she signed when she joined the Department. An examination of Ms. Skipwith's calendar entries could clear up these outstanding questions, but her lack of cooperation makes that impossible. This lack of being forthcoming is troubling, not only because it undermines the Senate's advice and consent role for Presidential nominees, but it also because it demonstrates the nominee's may not be cooperative when it comes to congressional oversight. I have found that, when a nominee is unwilling to provide information as part of their confirmation process, they almost always prove to be even more defiant to congressional oversight requests after they are confirmed. I urge my colleagues. especially my Republican colleagues, to take this matter seriously. In fact, I would urge my Republican colleagues to remember these words spoken by my friend, former Congressman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina. In June 2012, during the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee contempt proceedings against Attorney General Holder, then Congressman Gowdy said: ``The notion that you can withhold information and documents from Congress no matter whether you are the party in power or not in power is wrong. Respect for the rule of law must mean something, irrespective of the vicissitudes of political cycles.'' Eventually, whether it is in 1 year or in 4 years or in 8, we will eventually have another Democratic administration. And when that time comes, Republicans in Congress will want officials in that Democratic administration to answer questions and respond to congressional oversight requests. I fear that my Senate colleagues will find the process completely broken by then if we continue undermining our duty as Senators to both provide advice and consent on Presidential nomination and to conduct congressional oversight. This clear defiance of our sworn constitutional duty and congressional oversight role diminishes the Senate, weakens our intricate system of checks and balances, and undermines the trust of the American people. Beyond her lack of qualifications and her questionable role in some of this administration's major conservation policies, there are too many troubling concerns and questions about this nominee that remain unaddressed or unanswered. Therefore, I will be opposing this nomination, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote that was going to start at 11:45 a.m start now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Skipwith nomination? Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. THUNE. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson), and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 39, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 395 Ex.] YEAS--52 Alexander Barrasso Blackburn Blunt Boozman Braun Capito Cassidy Collins Cornyn Cotton Cramer Crapo Cruz Daines Enzi Ernst Fischer Gardner Graham Grassley Hawley Hoeven Hyde-Smith Inhofe Johnson Jones Kennedy Lankford Lee Manchin McConnell McSally Moran Murkowski Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Romney Rounds Rubio Sasse Scott (FL) Scott (SC) Sinema Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Wicker Young NAYS--39 Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Coons Cortez Masto Durbin Feinstein Gillibrand Harris Hassan Heinrich Hirono Kaine King Leahy Markey Menendez Merkley Murphy Murray Peters Reed Rosen Schatz Schumer Shaheen Smith Stabenow Tester Udall Van Hollen Warner Whitehouse Wyden NOT VOTING--9 Booker Burr Duckworth Isakson Klobuchar Paul Sanders Shelby Warren The nomination was confirmed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2736319</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRW-2841-JDG9-Y1KJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"14272\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 14, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read the nomination of Brian D. Montgomery, of Texas, to be Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Recognition of the Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Coronavirus Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the United States has well over a million confirmed cases of COVID-19. We are quickly, unfortunately, approaching 80,000 fatalities. Alongside this great crisis of public health, this shocking and heartbreaking loss of life, there is a looming economic catastrophe. There are now more than 30 million newly unemployed Americans, over one-tenth of the population in the United States and the highest number since the Great Depression. Many believe this number underestimates the real total. Once this crisis is over, there is no guarantee that these millions of newly unemployed Americans will be able to resume their old jobs. How many people will find new jobs? At what salary? Even the most optimistic scenarios predict a period of extended high unemployment. Others suggest we are looking at the kernels of a second Great Depression. Here on the Senate floor, for the second week in a row, we are living in the alternative reality of Republican Leader McConnell's making. He has scheduled no legislative business here on the floor related to COVID-19--none--no measures for the unemployed, no relief for renters or homeowners, no legislation to increase testing capacity, no proposals to help State and local governments retain teachers, firefighters, busdrivers, and police officers. Looking at the Senate calendar, you would never know that we are working in the midst of a national crisis. It looks like any other session--a few executive nominations, hearings on rightwing judges, and legislation from previous months that the leader should not have delayed. It is just totally, totally divorced from reality. Despite the obvious health risks, Senators are ready to do our jobs. Why don't we actually do our jobs and focus on COVID-19? For the sake of common sense and the good of the Nation, the Senate should be focused on COVID-19. We should be holding multiple serious oversight hearings every week. Several of my colleagues on the other side, including the Republican leader, have said they want to see how the legislation we have already passed is working before doing anything else. At the same time, the Republican majority is slow-walking the hearing process. Finally, after a lot of Democratic pressure from myself and many others, the leader is sort of eking out, week by week, hearings. We have just heard that we will hear from Powell and Mnuchin on the 19th. That will be almost 2 months after a bill that let $4 trillion of lending authority be released before there is a hearing. Why didn't we hold a hearing 3 weeks ago, 5 weeks ago, or last week? It is [[Page S2333]] just outrageous. How can the Republican Senators say we want to see how this is working and not have a whole bunch of hearings to exam how it is working, instead of squeezing them out under direct pressure from us Democrats? Now, tomorrow, in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee there will be a hearing conducted remotely with Dr. Fauci. This is the kind of hearing we need, not once a week but several a day. The American people need to hear from experts in a fair, open, and truthful setting. Until now, we have mostly heard from the members of the Coronavirus Task Force through the distorted lens of the White House press conference, where the President often prevents them from answering fully, interrupts their responses, or even contradicts their fact-based advice. This will be one of the first opportunities for Dr. Fauci to tell the American people the unvarnished truth without the President lurking over his shoulder. Dr. Fauci, let it rip. But it shouldn't be this one committee hearing tomorrow, and it shouldn't be Dr. Fauci alone testifying, or even with the two he is testifying with. This is the routine oversight business of Congress, and we are now in a crisis. It should occur in every committee every week. There should be testimony from administration officials, ranging from Dr. Birx to Secretary Mnuchin, to Secretary DeVos and others. We should also be debating another major emergency relief bill. As we speak, more and more businesses are going under, more and more people are losing their jobs, and more and more families don't have enough food to feed their children or are sitting for hours in car lines to get to food banks. Speaker Pelosi and I completely agree. The new bill should be big, and it should be bold, and that is what the House is working on right now, while the Senate, under Leader McConnell's leadership, dithers. Already, however, we have heard that congressional Republicans are telling everyone they want to slow down. Leader McConnell says he wants to hit the pause button. President Trump and administration officials are saying we might not need to do anything more to help the country. This would be a catastrophic mistake. At the outset of the Great Depression, President Hoover was also reluctant to use national resources to attack the problem. He, too, was ideologically opposed to a vigorous and strong response from the Federal Government. President Hoover's failure was likely responsible for extending the length and deepening the severity of the Great Depression. If President Trump and our Republican colleagues go the way of Herbert Hoover, if they oppose or slow-walk government intervention to save the economy that is hurtling downward, I fear the Nation could suffer a similar fate--a second depression. We must avoid that at all costs. Now is not the time for timidity. Now is not the time for small thinking. Now is the time for action--big, bold, continued action. There are so many issues that deserve our attention. On a daily basis, President Trump talks about the need to reopen our country. Well, President Trump, the only way we can safely reopen the country is if we have testing. To finally beat this disease, we need testing. To reopen businesses safely, we need testing. To reopen schools and sporting events, we need testing. To contain a resurgence in the fall or early next year, we need testing. Testing is, by far, the No. 1 priority from a public health standpoint and, maybe, from an economic standpoint as well. For many countries, mastering the challenge of testing and contact tracing their population was their first priority. Here in the United States, unfortunately, the Trump administration is still trying to catch up. Three months ago--3 months ago--President Trump said: ``Anybody that wants a test can get a test.'' That is still not even close to being true. Americans have gotten sick, and because they could not get tested, they never knew if they contracted COVID and never knew if they passed it on to loved ones, colleagues, workers, or friends. For many who could get tested, they had to wait weeks for an answer, long after the disease had run its course and potentially spread to others. We may never know the full extent of the human consequences that resulted from President Trump's administration's failure to rapidly develop a testing plan in the early days of coronavirus, but we do know that countries that did it successfully--such as South Korea, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand--were able to deal with the virus much better than we have. And to think the United States, which has always been the leader in public health, is lagging behind these other countries because of the President's denial and ineptitude should bother every single American, no matter what your politics. Congress provided $25 billion in the most recent relief legislation to increase testing capacity and contact tracing, and we are going to need to do more. If President Trump is so keen on speeding up the process of reopening the country, we should endorse what Democrats have urged him to do: Create a national testing regime immediately. On one final matter, education, in the CARES Act, Congress provided a little over $30 billion to help States, school districts, and higher education systems respond to the coronavirus after many schools were forced to close or to move to remote learning. We need more money than that, of course, and I think Democrats in both Houses agree. It has come to our attention that Secretary DeVos has been using a portion of the existing funding not to help States or localities cope with the crisis but to augment her push for voucher-like programs, a prior initiative that had nothing to do with COVID-19. We have also learned that Secretary DeVos has added restrictions to the fund that weren't included in the law, including guidance that DACA recipients cannot receive aid. Shameful--there is no other word for it. Secretary DeVos is exploiting emergency relief funding to further her own rigid ideological agenda and deprive students of desperately needed Federal assistance. The Secretary of Education should reverse course immediately. Subsequently, DeVos should testify in Congress as soon as possible. As someone who has habitually skipped congressional hearings, Secretary DeVos has a lot to answer for. If our students had the same attendance record as Secretary DeVos, they would have flunked out of school. Secretary DeVos needs to come clean about how her Department is exploiting congressional relief efforts intended to help schools recover and reopen. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. Coronavirus Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as our Nation's war against the coronavirus has waged on, the Senate has taken decisive action to provide the resources we need to win the fight. We sent critical equipment to our frontline healthcare workers, and we have expanded testing resources nationwide. We provided loans to small businesses in order to protect jobs, and we sent direct financial assistance to the Americans who are struggling the hardest to make ends meet. These four bills--now law--passed by Congress have addressed both the public health crisis at the heart of the pandemic and the ensuing economic fallout. Now, with the States beginning to gradually reopen their economies, we are staring down the barrel of a second epidemic, one generated by opportunistic lawsuits, crushing legal fees, and drawn-out court battles. According to a database compiled by law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, more than 950 such lawsuits have already been filed in the United States. We have seen suits against healthcare workers, nursing homes, colleges, governments, retailers--you name it. As our economy begins to reopen, unfortunately, so will the legal floodgates. The litigation epidemic is shaping up to be a big one. [[Page S2334]] Now, don't get me wrong, lawyers aren't all bad. I confess to being one myself. And there will no doubt be some meritorious claims. But many suits potentially serve as the cash cow--a chance to shake down a business for a nuisance settlement due to the cost alone of defending a lawsuit, even if you win. With a pandemic that has affected more than 1 million Americans, you better believe there are some preparing for a gold rush. You can hear the TV commercials now asking if you or a loved one was impacted by the coronavirus, encouraging you to call a 1-800 number to see if you could be entitled to some money. Imagine you are a nurse who is being sued by the family of a patient who tragically passed away at your hospital. Even though you acted in good faith and you took every precaution to save the life of the patient, you could get pulled into a nightmarish legal fight over a case that ends up having no merit in the first place. Let's say you are a small business owner who closed your doors at the start of the pandemic, but then you applied for the loans, and you have done everything in your power to stay afloat until you could reopen. When that time comes, you take every precaution. Your employees wear masks, you reduce the number of customers so as to provide for social distancing, you regularly clean your store, and you have hand sanitizer available for all employees and customers. But then somebody says that they contracted the virus in your store and that they are going to sue you. Well, I have no doubt that, unless we provide for some limitations, there will be businesses that will say: Why bother? Why take on the risk? It is just not worth it We know small businesses provide the lion's share of the jobs in our economy, and they can get roped into spending all their savings--what is left--to defend or settle a nuisance lawsuit. And the fear of these consequences could worsen the toll this crisis has already taken on our economy. We simply cannot allow a flood of frivolous lawsuits to harm our incredible healthcare workers or stunt our economic recovery. As we speak, I am working with colleagues on legislation to address the anticipated lawsuit bonanza. Let me be clear. Not all lawsuits are created equal. Without a doubt, there will be legitimate claims as a result of reckless wrongdoing in the wake of this pandemic. Those are the types of cases we want to make sure are heard. Last week, the Utah Daily Herald reported that one business required staff who tested positive for the COVID-19 to report to work anyway. Almost half of the business's employees tested positive. You don't have to be Perry Mason or Matlock--I realize I am dating myself here--to see that this is an egregious violation of Federal guidelines. There is no desire to impede the effort to hold bad actors accountable, period. That is my guiding principle. The problem is with the expected onslaught of frivolous claims, which will do nothing more than harm the very people already hurt by this virus. Just because a lawsuit is baseless doesn't mean it will be quick, easy, or cheap to resolve, and we can't put our healthcare workers in a situation where, after battling this virus for months on end, they then have to battle a false claim in court. Future legislation should include liability protections for our frontline workers and small businesses that are complying with the very government regulations designed to protect against the spread of the virus. More than a dozen Governors have already provided liability protections to healthcare workers, but we can't just depend on the States to uphold these protections. We can't wait for the dam to break. Congress must act to provide the shield for the healthcare workers who have done everything in their power to save lives during this unprecedented crisis. Again, to state the obvious, this would not interfere with liability for intentional or grossly negligent conduct. As I said before, no one wants to put a stop to meritorious lawsuits. We want to prevent baseless claims from tying up our courts, destroying jobs, and holding our economy hostage. There are several ways to accomplish this, but we need to focus on a solution that provides clarity for our businesses and prevents gamesmanship in the courts. Michael Krauss is a law professor at George Mason University who specializes in tort law. He has pointed out that employees can get workers' compensation benefits if they become sick or disabled on the job. In other words, employees will be covered by existing workers' compensation laws. We are talking about third-party claims, not employees. Defending lawsuits, no matter how far-fetched, is expensive, and litigation costs alone can make the difference between the destruction and survival of a business. Professor Krauss said that in his opinion, the ideal statute would say: ``If you do the following, you may not be sued.'' He said that could include a list of requirements, like wearing masks. There could be specific regulations for restaurants, meatpackers, or other industries. Any liability limitations will only protect the individuals and companies that comply with Federal guidelines and seek to keep their workers and the public safe. My colleagues and I have been in discussions about the best way to do this, and we are actively developing a proposal that I hope will gain bipartisan support. There are fair and reasonable ways to deal with this. We have seen this before. This is not a novel concept. Whether it is the response to the Y2K paranoia around the turn of the century or the attacks of 9/11, there are many more examples where Congress has, on a bipartisan basis, responded to a national emergency and provided these sorts of commonsense legal protections. As we continue to work to support the American people during the crisis we are facing today, we can't ignore the onslaught of lawsuits that could soon bankrupt small businesses and strangle our recovering economy. Congress must act to ensure America doesn't wake up from this pandemic only to find itself in a legal nightmare that we could have and should have prevented I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Russia Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, in the last several weeks, a lot of information relating to the FBI's Russia investigation has been declassified and made public. That is in large part thanks to action taken by Attorney General Barr and action taken by Acting Director Grenell at DNI on declassification of a lot of things that should have been declassified a long time ago. Their acts of transparency are finally shining a light on the dark corners of the Federal Government. The public's business ought to be public. There is too much overclassification in the Federal Government. Barr and Grenell are doing what they ought to do, and I hope they keep it up. In the last several weeks, we have also seen a lot of denial from some quarters in the media about the information that has been released. Also last week, former President Obama said the rule of law is at risk because of the Justice Department's dismissal of the Flynn case. Contrary to what President Obama believes or the media might say, I believe the opposite is true. The rule of law is at risk if the Federal Government can get away with violating the Constitution to do what they did to Lieutenant General Flynn. When it comes to those violations and other misconduct by former government officials, Obama and the mainstream media pundits all seem to be silent all of a sudden. I have heard no comment from Mr. Obama about the independent inspector general's findings that Andrew McCabe lied under oath to Federal investigators multiple times or about how Department of Justice prosecutors falsely told the court that they had produced all Brady material to Flynn. I didn't hear them when the Federal Government surveilled an American citizen connected to the Trump campaign without probable cause and based on intelligence that the FBI knew was questionable at best. There is too much silence on something that now is so obvious. Since 2017, I have aggressively pursued the Flynn investigation to find out more about why the FBI decided to [[Page S2335]] interview Flynn, make him a subject of an investigation, and then why the Justice Department eventually charged him. From the beginning, I wanted to know the facts of the case, and from the beginning, none of what I found looked right. Having done good government oversight for over 40 years, I know a government foul-up when I see it. The public knows a lot more than they did in 2017 when the news first broke about this Flynn case. For example, we know that on January 4, 2017, the FBI wrote a closing memorandum on Flynn, who was code-named ``Crossfire Razor'' by the FBI. That memorandum said the intelligence community could find no derogatory information on the general. On the very same day the FBI was ready to close the Flynn case, Peter Strzok asked another FBI agent something like this: ``Hey, if you haven't closed Razor, don't do it yet.'' So Strzok obviously had another agenda. The case was still open at that moment, and Strzok asked that it be kept open ``for now.'' Strzok then quickly messaged Lisa Page, saying that Razor still happened to be open because of some oversight and said: ``Yeah, our utter incompetence actually helps us. 20 percent of the time . . . '' During the course of my oversight activities of the FBI, I have uncovered and made public large amounts of Strzok's and Page's messages. When reviewing all the faults and disasters of the Russia investigation, these text messages are very, very important. They are the free expression of these top FBI employees' mindset, unencumbered by rules or decorum. They give us a look at what the drivers of the Russia investigation actually believed. In August 2016, just after the FBI opened the Russia investigation, Page said: ``Trump's not ever going to become president, right? Right?!?'' She is the one who edited Flynn's 302 summary along with Strzok, which contradicted the original 302. Strzok responded to the Page quote that I just gave about whether Trump would ever become President this way: ``No. No he won't. We'll stop it.'' Their animus towards Trump helps to explain why they cut corners and why they didn't follow regular protocol in running their inquiry. On January 5, 2017, the day after Strzok moved to keep the Flynn case open, President Obama met with Director Comey, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, Vice President Biden, and National Security Advisor Susan Rice. At that meeting, they briefed President Obama on the Russia investigation. It is unclear to what extent they discussed the details of the investigation amongst each other, but given all that we know now regarding the fake foundation to the inquiry, it is time we asked: What did Obama and Biden know, and when did they know it? During the course of my oversight, I acquired an email from Susan Rice. She sent herself an email on Obama's last day in office, January 20, 2017. That email memorialized the alleged contents of the January 5, 2017, meeting with Obama that I previously referred to. As I noted in 2018 when I made the email public, I found it very odd that among her activities in the final moments of the final day of the Obama administration, that she would write herself an email about a meeting that happened several weeks prior about this investigation. According to Rice, Obama wanted everything done ``by the book.'' Of course, we now know that never happened. She also said, in part: ``The President''--as in Obama--``asked Comey to inform him if anything changes in the next few weeks that should affect how we share classified information with the incoming team.'' Then, 1 week later, on January 12, 2017, somebody in the Obama administration leaked the Flynn-Kislyak call to the Washington Post that, for the very first time, ignited rumors about Flynn's association with Russians and a possible violation of the arcane Logan Act. Now, wasn't this really a perfectly timed leak--one that would help to create a fake foundation to interview Flynn? Well, guess what happened. Twelve days later, on January 24, 2017, Strzok interviewed Flynn in the White House. Prior to that interview, Comey chose not to follow normal protocols to inform the White House that the FBI intended to interview an employee. Now, we all know that the FBI would normally work through the White House counsel to have discussions for approval and who would be present at that interview. You have seen it on television several times this weekend: Comey bragging about getting away with skirting the rules. When he was asked in a 2018 interview about how he did it, Comey said--and this is what showed up in these last weekends: I sent them-- Meaning he sent the FBI agents to interview. I sent them. Something I probably wouldn't have done or even gotten away with in a more organized investigation, a more organized administration. According to Comey's former assistant, Comey said: ``We just decided, you know, screw it,'' in reference to their breaking protocol with the White House. Now, I referred to an email that said the President wanted to do this by the book. Well, what I just described to you is hardly ``by the book.'' Flynn was never told during this interview what he was being secretly interrogated for, and the whole thing was done without Flynn having an attorney present. In fact, I think I recall they even told him he didn't need an attorney. Now, we know that the FBI had no real investigative purpose to interview Flynn. We also know, based upon FBI notes, that agents apparently interviewed Flynn to trick him in a lie so that they could prosecute him or get him fired. That prosecuting him or getting him fired are very clear in some notes that we got from the FBI, handwritten notes. Keep in mind that the FBI had prepared to close this case weeks before, except it didn't quite get closed because Strzok came in and said: Can we keep it open--or something to that effect. The FBI already had the transcript of the Flynn-Ambassador Kislyak call. They knew exactly what was discussed. So what was the point of interviewing Flynn if they already had the transcript? Well, lucky for Strzok, the FBI had not technically closed the Flynn case. So he figured yet they could lay a trap for Flynn, and they did lay a trap. In doing so, they didn't warn him that he was under investigation. They went around the Justice Department, and I made it very clear how they bypassed the White House on interview protocols, because Comey was bragging on television about that. Under Comey's leadership, the FBI abused government powers in ways that our Founders and Framers feared most, because they had had enough of George III. They weren't going to let it happen again in the United States. That is why they wrote the Constitution the way they did. The Russia investigation, in other words, is a textbook example of what not to do. At every step of the investigation, the government sought evidence to advance it, never got the evidence that they needed to advance it, and advanced the investigation anyway. That is pretty clearly an abuse of power. Let's recall that Comey also leaked his memos of his private discussions with President Trump to get the special counsel, Mueller, appointed. Comey is pretty smart. He had a plan. It worked. That plan worked to get Mueller appointed. Mueller did his work for 2 years, and it cost the taxpayers $30 million. In the end, Mueller found no collusion and no obstruction, which is exactly the same information that the House Intelligence Committee's 50-plus depositions told us. Those were done way back--not way back but a little way back--in 2017. Mueller finished his job in 2019. That is more than $30 million just to reinvent the wheel. Now, with respect to Comey, I think it is monumentally important to point out a piece of his testimony from 2017, before the House Intelligence Committee. Comey said the following: . . . we had an open counterintelligence investigation on Mr. Flynn, and it had been open since the summertime, and we were very close to closing it. In fact, I had--I think I had authorized it to be closed at the end of December, beginning of January. Now, Comey leaked his memos so that the public would know the President allegedly said to him that he [[Page S2336]] hoped Comey would let the whole Flynn thing go. That is what the hook was to getting a special counsel appointed. Not once in Comey's memos did he mention that by the time that conversation occurred, he had already authorized the Flynn case to be closed. Don't you think that is a material fact that would put the proper context on his interactions with Trump? Attorney General Barr is exactly right. What the FBI did to Flynn cannot be justified by any angle of review. What the FBI did is to flout the rules, the law, and the Constitution. Entrapment is unconstitutional. That is where the outrage ought to be--not on the dismissal of the case but on facts that the case was brought in the first place and a good man's life was destroyed. Mueller had all these facts. He had documents. He had the Brady material. He had the FBI notes and contradictory 302 summaries. He had the emails. He had all the information that showed Flynn was set up, targeted, and pressured to plead guilty in a secret side deal between the Mueller team and his former lawyers, only because he was running out of money and the government was coming after his son. Flynn did what maybe a lot of people would do when your family is at stake. Flynn did what he did to save his family from financial ruin and his son from reputational ruin. He did what any father would do for his family. If it can happen to Flynn, it can happen to you. It can happen to any American, and, in some ways, this also happened to a person named Carter Page and with the illegal surveillance on Carter Page. You know, in this business of self-government and this business of constitutional safeguards, we still are in a constant battle between liberty and tyranny, and we have seen some tyranny in regard to Flynn. My fellow Americans, let's use the Russia investigation and all of its shortcomings to forever guard against the tyranny of the Federal Government. On one last thing, people are constantly phoning our offices and wanting to know when all the people who did the injustice to Flynn are going to be prosecuted, because they think there are two standards of justice. You know, they announced yesterday that McCabe isn't going to be prosecuted. But Flynn was entrapped to be prosecuted, and how wrong that is. A lot of people want justice brought to the people who did the injustice, and I think they ought to be prosecuted. But even more important than prosecuting him, it is about time that these facts get out so the public knows the injustice that is going on within our government, within the FBI, in the highest levels of the FBI. We aren't finding fault with the people in the FBI who are doing what needs to be done to bring law and order to our country, but when we have these unusual, illegal, unconstitutional, corrupt things that happened to Flynn, it ought to wake up the American people. It ought to wake up those of us in government to make sure it never happens again. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered National Police Week Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the National Police Week in honor of the men and women who serve and protect our communities. The individuals called to uphold the rule of law do so in times of crisis, and they serve their families, friends, and neighbors at a moment's notice. They are selfless public servants who courageously face danger head-on. Law enforcement officers respond to calls for help while not knowing what challenges they will face. We are in a unique time right now and experiencing unprecedented challenges in our country. Law enforcement officers are working to protect citizens while also safeguarding themselves against the unseen enemy of COVID-19. The disease has forced departments in Arkansas and all over the country to change protocols in order to prevent the spread of the disease, but that hasn't stopped the resolve, the determination, and the passion of officers to defend the community. Despite this new challenge, they continue to serve with the same level of professionalism and integrity. We are working to provide departments and agencies with additional resources to safeguard these public safety officers. I am pleased the Department of Justice recently awarded Arkansas near $7 million so we can better serve the safety needs of officers in the State and get them personal protective equipment--gloves, masks, and sanitizer--that they need in order to perform their job safely. This funding is vital as the calls for assistance keep coming and police officers continue to respond to these emergencies. I want to thank our law enforcement officers for their bravery today and always. It takes a special person to put their life on the line every day to protect our communities. We are fortunate to have some of the very best in Arkansas. National Police Week is a time that we honor the sacrifices of individuals who selflessly serve their community and give their lives, if necessary, while in the line of duty. We preserve their legacies by adding their names to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC, to serve as a reminder of their sacrifices. This year, the names of 307 fallen officers will be added to the memorial, including five Arkansans. The names of Game Warden Ollie Mitts, Deputy Sheriff George Rogers, Deputy Sheriff Ulyss Baldwin, Fayetteville Police Officer Stephen Carr, and Stone County Sergeant Michael Stephen, Sr. are new to the memorial. We will remember forever them as heroes. I am a proud cosponsor of the Senate resolution marking National Police Week because we must always remember the brave officers whose lives were cut short because of their public duty and recognize those who continue to selfishly serve to keep us safe. I am proud to honor the individuals who are called to serve and protect and will advocate for policies that provide our communities and officers with the resources they need to protect themselves. Thank you to the officers in Arkansas and those all across the country for upholding the law, protecting the community, and saving lives. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). Without objection, it is so ordered. Protecting Human Rights During Pandemic Act Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, to all of my colleagues and to our staff here in the Chamber, those who are mothers, I hope they had a wonderful Mother's Day weekend, and it is a joy to return to work today. I will tell you, I am really blessed to have some of those moms. They are policy experts, and they are a part of my staff. I listen a lot to what they have to say. Like with all of our staff, I admire their dedication and their focus--especially now and especially when it comes to discussing how this COVID crisis is affecting their children, how they are learning and how they are utilizing technology to communicate and practicing distance learning and hearing what schools are doing as they are all going through a learning curve. We are all going through a learning curve on how to utilize technology. The thing that is so significant, as I talked to so many of these working moms and dads, what we realize and they realize and what they highlight with me is that embodied in this technology, we have a lot of dangers that exist and vulnerabilities that are being created to the privacy of our children. Long before students were forced to attend classes via webcam, Congress began taking a hard look at how the companies providing digital classrooms were protecting what I term the ``virtual you''--you and your presence online--how they were protecting that virtual you of underage users. [[Page S2337]] As it turns out, what we found in the work that we were doing--some of it I did while I was in the House, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology of Energy and Commerce, and some of that work I continued here. But back in 2015, as we started doing a deeper dive on what was happening with protecting privacy and presence online, the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a complaint with the FTC against Google, alleging that their Google for Education platform was exploiting students' personal information and potentially exposing it to third parties. Think about this. The Google for Education program--kids were logging on, and they were using this. Google--what were they doing? Data mining. What were they doing with what they were data mining, which is your information? They were then sharing that with third parties. And guess what. You didn't know. The parents didn't know, and the children didn't know. What we found out was that one wrong click, and any program administrator could expose a student's virtual you to potential outside websites. A 2017 report from the Electronic Frontier Foundation confirmed and expanded on these concerns. Even free products can come at the cost of student privacy. Last month, Google donated 4,000 Chromebooks to students in rural California--4,000 Chromebooks. That sounds like a very generous donation, a way to help close that digital divide, a way to connect students to the internet, to open up the world and bring the world in to them. The problem is that this year, the State of New Mexico sued Google over a similar program, alleging that Google was using Chromebooks to track students. Well, how about that? Here you go. Here is a free Chromebook. Use it. But what happens? All of that research work you were doing via Google is being data-mined, tracked, and shared. We need to be wary of these free programs because what we now know is that when it is free, you and your information and your child's information is tracked, it is data-mined, and it is shared. That means that you and your information are the product--the freebie, if you will. The Chromebook is simply the way, the mechanism to take your information from you and allow Google or Big Tech to have it, and then they sell it to somebody over here who is going to do what with it? Guess what. They are going to be marketing back to you. That data is a valuable resource, and what do they do once they have data-mined it? They are going to sell it to whoever is willing to pay the highest price so they can use it and market back to you and your kids something that they want you to buy. Now, that is what is happening. I am sure everyone remembers the video platform Zoom. Many of us have probably used it in meetings even today. Zoom was thrust into the spotlight as we started this COVID crisis, and after watchdogs uncovered not only a research and development presence in China but protocols that allowed data, including--now, I want you to listen to this. This is one of those buyer beware things--user beware. We are talking about Zoom. What was discovered was that Zoom allowed data, including screen captures and video--that means you on screen; you, your face, and video; what you are saying; the presentation you are making; the question you are asking--all of that to flow in and out of China. Schools, corporations, and even Senate offices have all been forced to question this platform, to give up this platform and to find some other way to communicate. We know that many of our children are going to school in Zoom classrooms every day. In our churches, our choirs are singing on Zoom, and sermons are being delivered on Zoom. The rise in mandatory use of technology by students prompted me, along with Senators Markey, Hawley, Blumenthal, Cassidy, and Durbin, to ask the FTC to launch a major investigation into how these platforms are protecting student privacy. What we are wanting to know is, what are you doing to put that wall there so that the information of these underage users, these children, is not going to be shared? What are you doing to make certain that their faces, their images, their voices, and their questions are not going to be captured? Can you imagine anything more frightening than to think your child is sitting in a Zoom classroom, and this data is flowing to China, and somebody is capturing these images, and then that is going to be shared with somebody you don't know. You don't know what they are going to do with it, and you don't know why they want it, and you, as a parent, have chosen to completely stay off social media because you don't want that kind of intrusion into your child's life. Don't you think that these corporations ought to figure this out, that this is an area of concern for moms and dads and grandmoms and granddads, to protect these children? Oh, but it doesn't matter to China, does it? All China is interested in is making a buck off the American consumer. They feel like, if you use our service, we have got that right. I think we need to be sending a message to them. Both the education technology and the digital advertising industries are notoriously opaque about their privacy policies. I am joined by other members of the Judiciary Committee Tech Task Force in having conversations with many of these companies, and I will tell you, we have made some progress. I have been pleased with many of the companies' willingness to share with us some of these policies and to look for ways that we can protect unsuspecting consumers and our precious children Since the FTC is preparing to consider revisions to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, COPPA, now is the perfect time. It is the necessary time for a deep dive into the data collection and processing practices of these firms. You know what, sometimes we hear the phrase ``Oh, let's do it for the children.'' ``This is for the children.'' ``We have to do this or that for the children.'' Let me tell you something right now: This is one of those things that are absolutely for the children, to protect them online so that Big Tech and some of these China-owned companies--and bear in mind, colleagues, if you are doing business in China and if you are a company in China, who are you owned by? Who do you answer to? You answer to the Chinese Communist Party. I will tell you right now, I do not want them to have images of our children, data on where they sit, where they go to school, and what their interests are. These privacy policies have to be reviewed. We want to make absolutely sure that the FTC has all the facts they need to be certain we keep children safe online. Section 6 of the FTC Act empowers them to do this. I urge agency officials to make use of that authority. This is an imperative. The pandemic has shown us that it only takes a little disruption to prompt bad actors to take advantage of a situation. Here in the U.S , even during a pandemic, we have the right to challenge laws that we feel are unjust. But in many places around the world, the pandemic has provided an opportunity for oppressive regimes to enact so-called emergency laws that restrict human rights without justification or oversight. China and Russia--two of the big offenders--have used the crisis to ramp up their use of surveillance to restrict privacy and freedom of movement. ``We have to do it. We have a pandemic.'' That is what they say. In Bolivia and the Philippines, government officials are using the pandemic as an excuse to silence their legislative bodies and punish critics. ``Oh, leave it to us. We are going to be able to solve this. You don't need to weigh in.'' That is what they are saying. In Cambodia, Venezuela, Belarus, Egypt, Turkey, South Africa, and many other countries, officials are following China's playbook and preventing the journalists from publishing news that contradicts official propaganda. ``Don't bother with the truth. We are going to make up a version of the truth and then that is what we are going to tell people. Don't listen to anything else. Listen to us. We have truth coming at you. We are making it up as we go.'' That is what they are saying. The way they are using surveillance to limit freedom and to craft a message is something that should frighten everyone. It is all happening under the guise of ``combating COVID-19.'' So last week, Senator Markey and I filed a bill that will help address these [[Page S2338]] abuses. I thank Senator Markey for the great work he does on human rights and also the work he and I did on the House on online privacy. The Protecting Human Rights During Pandemic Act would require the State Department and the U.S Agency for International Development--or USAID--to take actions to prevent human rights abuses in the name of coronavirus response. The bill authorizes funding through 2025 for programs that support human rights defense during and in the aftermath of harmful responses to the pandemic. Congress would receive strategic plans from the State Department and USAID detailing how those funds are being put to use, as well as regular reports on human rights violations perpetrated in the name of pandemic response. The spread of COVID-19 has forced businesses, families, and governments to take extraordinary measures to protect human life. Some have proven effective; unfortunately, others are missing the mark. We still have much to do in terms of pandemic response, and we continue to work on it every day. But I encourage my colleagues not to let the severity of our situation distract from our responsibility to set an example for the rest of the world. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized. Nomination of Brian D. Montgomery Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to confirm Brian Montgomery as the next Deputy Secretary of the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Montgomery is among the most respected voices in the housing market, as well as one of the most experienced. His breadth of experience includes service as the head of the Federal Housing Administration--or FHA--during the Bush administration, the Obama administration, and the Trump administration. Mr. Montgomery guided FHA through the 2008 financial crisis and has provided steadfast leadership at the FHA through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, arguably the two most turbulent times for the housing market in a generation. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, he oversaw the return of FHA's insurance fund to its strongest financial position since fiscal year 2007, while continuing to provide affordable homeownership opportunities to tens of thousands of first-time homebuyers each year. Since the outbreak, he has worked to make sure that FHA performs its traditional countercyclical role of maintaining liquidity and credit access in the mortgage market where traditional sources of home financing may have dried up. For over a year now, Mr. Montgomery has also served in the capacity of Acting Deputy Secretary at HUD, where he has managed the day-to-day operations of the Department under Secretary Ben Carson. Mr. Montgomery knows the Department inside and out and has been intimately involved in carrying out HUD's mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable housing opportunities for millions of Americans. He has been described by the National Multifamily Housing Council as ``a housing policy veteran with deep expertise and experience across a wide variety of policy areas.'' The National Association of Homebuilders has noted that ``throughout his government and private sector career, Brian has proven himself to be both an expert in affordable housing policy, as well as an outstanding Federal agency administrator and communicator.'' This confirmation vote comes at a critical time. In the wake of COVID-19, we have already seen a huge number of mortgage borrowers enter forbearance, while many landlords are struggling to make ends meet, and countless renters are unsure where their next rent payment will come from. Homeless shelters are at or near capacity and facing novel issues related to social distancing, and the homeless community, who may be particularly exposed to the risk of contracting COVID-19, is leaning on HUD for help. HUD has a central role to play in addressing these challenges and more. The CARES Act acknowledges this important role, entrusting HUD with over $12 billion in additional funding to provide immediate relief and to address emerging issues. Bold leadership is especially needed during this critical time for HUD, and Mr. Montgomery is a trusted voice who fits the mold perfectly. Fifteen years ago, this body confirmed Mr. Montgomery on a voice vote to serve as FHA Commissioner. Two years ago, we confirmed him as FHA Commissioner, again, on a strong bipartisan vote of 74-23. I support Brian Montgomery, and I urge my colleagues to join me today in voting ``yes'' on his nomination. Thank you. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Cloture Motion Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of James H. Anderson, of Virginia, to be a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Loeffler). Without objection, it is so ordered. Recognition of the Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Protests and Business of the Senate Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, this has been a very difficult week after what has been a very difficult few months. A nation, beleaguered by disease and economic depression, has once again come face-to-face with the racial injustice that infects our society. The death of George Floyd in police custody was a searing reminder of a long list of unarmed African Americans whose lives have been taken under similar circumstances--Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and too many others--a well of grief and loss and pain too deep to express. It was a searing reminder of the bigotry and discrimination that African Americans encounter as part of their daily reality. That is why so many Americans of all ages, colors, and faiths are out in the streets protesting right now. They are fed up with racial injustice in this country and want to see some change. Here in the Senate, Member after Member has come to the floor to share support for the same cause. Yesterday, our caucus held a somber, emotional, and very personal meeting, during which our Members shared their own lived experiences of racism and spoke about what we need to do next because the truth is, while speeches and protests are vital, they will never be enough. We need greater accountability and transparency in police departments and reformed police practices so these events don't happen in the first place. We need to reform the criminal justice system that is still too short on justice and begin chipping away at the racial disparities that exist in healthcare, housing, education, and in the economy. These issues will not be solved in a week or a month or in a year. Let's hope they can be solved in this decade. But I will be damned if we don't at least try to make some progress. Already, my colleagues Senators Booker, Harris, Cardin, Klobuchar, Duckworth, Schatz, Smith, and others are working with the Congressional Black Caucus in the House to develop legislation to address a number of issues related to police violence and racial justice. Senate Democrats will not wait to propose and push for bold, bold change. Will our Republican colleagues join us? Leader McConnell, commit to put a law enforcement reform bill on the floor of the Senate before July 4. [[Page S2661]] I have made this request for several days without an answer from the Republican leader. Even more disappointing, the Republican leader blocked a simple resolution I offered last night that reaffirmed Americans' constitutional rights to peaceful protest, condemned the violence that is occurring in too many places, and condemned the President as well for having gas and rubber bullets used on a peaceful protest in Lafayette Park, where there were families and children protesting in the grand American tradition of peaceful protest. There was no partisan rhetoric in this resolution. It was three simple concepts, a recitation of the facts, but because Senate Republicans are so afraid--shivering--at the thought of criticizing the President, even when they know his actions are way out of line, Leader McConnell came and blocked this resolution. Shame, shame, shame. We all know there are very few checks on the President, especially a President who believes he can do anything he wants--and he said it. One of the most effective checks on President Trump could be the caucus of Republican Senators for once standing up to him when he is way out of line. Where are they? Where are they? Even a columnist like George Will has shown a disgust at the Republican Senate, and he is a conservative, for their failure to stand up to Donald Trump on issues like this. All too often on thorny issues such as gun safety, racial justice, and police reform, my Republican colleagues sort of say what is necessary to get through the day, when there is an immediate crisis, and then wait for public attention to fade. Leader McConnell called us back into session in early May during the height of the COVID pandemic, but we still have not considered a single piece of legislation on the floor. Now listen to this. Yesterday, when Leader McConnell was listing legislative priorities for June, he did not mention COVID legislation. Let me repeat for those who may have missed it in the swirl of news and events of the day. When listing his June priorities to reporters, Leader McConnell did not mention COVID- related legislation. Other Republican Senators have said that another relief bill might come in late July--might, might. This is shocking. This should be a wake-up call to the American people. Americans of all ages, races, creeds, and philosophies, call your Republican Senators. Demand action. The recession will get deeper. It could develop into a depression if we don't have relief. We have not done enough in the eyes of every economist I have looked at and respected. Governors and mayors across the country in red States are slashing budgets in advance of the new fiscal year, which for most States starts July 1. States will be forced to cut millions of jobs and critical services. These cuts mean increased school class sizes, longer emergency response times, fewer services to keep the elderly at home and out of nursing homes. These cuts not only exacerbate the recession but the wrath of the coronavirus itself. That is what is happening while Senate Republicans wait until July, maybe, to consider another relief bill. America, look at what our Republicans are doing: not giving the relief you need for your safety, for your schools, for the services that local government provides. The Republican majority doesn't seem to have time to address a cascading series of national crises--no time. Why is that? Where is President Trump? Where is his Cabinet? They all know that we need more. They all know we haven't solved the economic problem--far from it. They all know that we have to do a lot more on testing. So our Republican majority doesn't seem to have time to address the COVID national crisis, but do you know what it does have time for? Chasing President Trump's wild conspiracy theories. It sounds like the death knell of the Republican Party as we know it. They can't deal with the two major crises of the day--racial justice and the COVID crisis-- and they are busy pursuing conspiracy theories, some of them emanating from Russia, to go after President Obama and Vice President Biden. This makes no sense. This, again, sounds like the death knell of the Republican Party. The Republican Party we used to know would have some principles but not be afraid to run to every major issue--to any major issue almost. But that is what they are doing. Today, in the Judiciary Committee, the Republican committee chairman has called in Rod Rosenstein to dredge up the President's favorite conspiracy theory related to the 2016 election. It is an egregious misuse of the institution--the Senate. Nearly a quarter of our workforce is unemployed. Over 100,000 Americans are dead from a strange and contagious disease; Americans are in the streets demanding racial justice; and shopworn, discredited conspiracy theories are what the Republican majority is focused on? What alternative universe do they live in? What alternative reality are they in the midst of? One detached from the real reality that the American people face: conspiracy theories to help President Trump's reelection, rightwing judges, many of whom have antipathy to the civil rights we are talking about now. The Republican Party in the Senate has moved so far into a corner, the corner that Donald Trump is in, that they can't address two of the most important and major issues that have affected this country in decades. The American people should be furious with the Republican Senate majority, and the American people and historians will record with sadness how this once great party, even though I didn't agree with it, has declined so--no courage, no principle, but simply cowering for President Trump and his crazy theories that even they know are crazy. The American people, of course, should be furious with the President as well. On Monday night, Americans watched Federal officers, under the direction of the President and the Attorney General, use gas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters in a public park so that the President could stage a photo op in front of a church, waving the Holy Bible as a prop. Last night, Americans saw an even more haunting image on the internet and their televisions: rows of camouflage troops standing at attention on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, like an occupying force defending a critical position. When you see the image of troops dressed for combat flanking the Lincoln Memorial, an altar of freedom, you cannot help but think of Tiananmen Square. This administration ordered Federal officers to gas peaceful protesters and charge on horseback and defend our monuments like battlefield positions. What is President Trump doing to this grand democracy? What is he doing? And why are our Republican colleagues just going along? President Lincoln's second inaugural address is engraved in that building where armed soldiers stood. During a moment of extreme political division and civil strife, President Lincoln urged malice toward none, charity toward all, and sought to bind up the Nation's wounds. There could be no greater contrast between Lincoln and this President, this President who seems to have malice toward all and charity for none, who seeks to deepen our Nation's wounds rather than bind them up. Our Nation is crying out for leadership, for direction, for some healing and some unity. Will this President even try to provide it? I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip is recognized Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I want to speak here in just a moment to the issue of internet traffic and how that has been impacted by the coronavirus, how it has impacted our lives during the coronavirus. Before I do that, though, I want to just respond to a few things the Democratic leader mentioned. He again pointed out that the Republican Senate isn't doing work here. It is hard to fathom how he can possibly come to that conclusion. The Democrat-run House of Representatives is out of session for the entire month--the entire month of June. They are not even here. The Democratic House of Representatives isn't even in town. The Senate is here doing work, and important work, I might add. He said [[Page S2662]] we haven't passed any legislation. Well, the week before the Memorial Day break we passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reauthorization, a critical piece of national security and intelligence legislation that all our intelligence experts tell us is critical to fighting the war against terrorists. Pretty important legislation, I would say. He pointed out that the agenda for the month of June doesn't include much. Well, that is only if you don't think that the National Defense Authorization Act is not important. Funding the military, authorizing the weapons systems, paying the personnel, the technology, the intelligence, all the things that go into protecting the country seem to me to be pretty important. So the National Defense Authorization Act is a piece of legislation that the Senate will process during the upcoming weeks here in the month of June. In fact, that will probably take a good week to move across the floor of the Senate. It typically does. It is something we have to do on an annual basis, but there is nothing more important and more critical to the national security of the United States than the National Defense Authorization Act. We will be passing a major parks bill this next week, which will help fund the backlog in a lot of our national parks--something that has been a priority for many Democrats here in this Chamber for a long time. In fact, it is a great bipartisan bill. In fact, I think, out of the Democratic caucus, there are somewhere on the order of 43 of the 47 Democrats who are cosponsoring the piece of legislation that will be called up later this week and be on the floor most of next week. So it is something that has been around here for a while. It is going to be a major legislative accomplishment. It will be a bipartisan accomplishment when it passes. So I would just say that the fact that we aren't doing the things the Democratic leader wants to do doesn't mean the Senate isn't very busy. The things he wants to do, the things he talks about wanting to do, are things that we are doing. We are dealing with the coronavirus on a daily basis around here. I am a member of the Senate Finance Committee. Yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee had a hearing in which officials from the FDA, for example, critical agencies when it comes particularly to pharmaceuticals in this country, attended, and the subject of the hearing was the pharmaceutical supply chain and what we need to do to shore that up, to make sure that in future pandemics, with lessons learned from this one, we aren't dependent upon unreliable supply chains in places around the world that, frankly, may not be dependable. That is a pretty important issue when it comes to dealing with the effects and the impacts of the coronavirus. Today, in the Senate Commerce Committee, another committee on which I serve, we are going to be examining the impact of the coronavirus on our transportation infrastructure and how important this transportation has been throughout the course of the coronavirus in ensuring that we keep commerce going, that we keep food in the grocery stores. We are going to be looking at both the highway aspect, the rail aspect--all of those--and how they are impacted by the coronavirus and what we might need to do to ensure that they continue to be able to provide the services that they do going forward. So we are consistently looking at, on a daily basis, the coronavirus, the impact it is having on our economy, the impact it is having on the health of people in this country, the health emergency, and putting measures in place that would deal not only with that health emergency but also with the economic crisis created by it. In the meantime, we are seeing the economy start to open up again, which I think is a very good thing. I am hopeful we will see, as the economy opens up, that people will get out, consumers will spend, investors will invest, and we will see that economy start to grow again, jobs to come back. Obviously, we have very high unemployment right now--a major concern. We also have a major unemployment insurance piece of legislation that was moved by this Congress earlier to provide assistance and help for those who, through no fault of their own, have had to go on unemployment. To suggest for a moment that we aren't focused on the coronavirus is completely missing the point--as is to suggest, also, that we haven't done a lot already. We passed four major pieces of legislation, totaling almost $3 trillion, and that is $3 trillion if you don't include the amount of leverage we gave to the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to extend credit and create liquidity out there. With the power of that leverage, it is somewhere on the order of about $6 trillion in assistance that we have put out there through different legislative vehicles to the American people. So you are seeing that translated into the Paycheck Protection Program, which is keeping people employed, keeping jobs in this country, keeping businesses functioning and operating. It has been a very successful program. You are seeing it in the form of direct assistance to State and local governments. And $150 billion has been put out there, much of which hasn't been spent, and that is on top of a lot of other assistance to State and local governments, which totals somewhere on the order of about $500 billion. Almost half a trillion dollars, so far, sum total, has gone out to State and local governments. Much of that, as I said, is in the pipeline, hasn't been spent yet. It can be used, as the Treasury has pointed out, given the States' flexibility, for emergency personnel, first responders, police, all the things that the Senator from New York talked about. That is flexibility the States have now to be able to meet the needs that they have and to work with their local governments and meet the needs of the local governments. So there is a lot of money in the pipeline, not to mention, of course, first and foremost, the money we put out there for investment in therapeutics, in vaccines, in diagnostic testing, and all the money that has gone out to hospitals and nursing home providers and long-term care facilities to help them get through this crisis in the form of direct assistance. So there is a lot of money in the pipeline--as I said, about $2.9 trillion that has already been authorized, and I think about 40 percent, maybe, has been spent. So there is still a lot of assistance going out there. My friend, the Democratic leader, would just want to put a whole bunch more money out there without knowing what the need is, and I think, at a time when we are already running a $21 trillion--now $25 trillion--debt, we ought to be very circumspect and pay attention to what is happening in our economy, what the needs are, what we need to keep the economy opening up and responding, what we continue to need to do to help people who are unemployed, what we continue to need to do to help families in this country who are struggling through this crisis. But we ought to do that based on the need, not just somebody saying: Well, let's just throw a bunch more money out there and hope that it has an impact. We have done that. We have flooded the zone with dollars. There is a tremendous amount of resources out there right now, a lot of which has yet to be spent, and it strikes me, at least, that, in the eyes of most Americans, they would view it as pretty important, before we spend more tax money--all of which, I might add, is going to be borrowed money--that we see how what we have done already is working, if it has been effective and is having the desired impact. There is so much going on around here dealing with the coronavirus, it just completely defies any sort of logic to what the Democratic leader suggested was happening here in the Senate. He made one other comment, which I think I have to respond to. He said that the Senate is in the process--Republicans in the Senate are processing rightwing judges who have antipathy for the very civil rights issues that we are dealing with right now. I don't know how you can make a statement like that. I don't know how you can ascribe motive or intent to judges. You don't know who these judges are. We have a judge we are going to be processing here for the DC circuit. It is [[Page S2663]] a pretty important circuit in this country. He is the district judge from Kentucky. He has been rated as very ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association. The American Bar Association isn't a rightwing group at all. In fact, many on our side think they certainly drift the other direction. Yet they have said this judge is a well- qualified judge. Do you think they would be saying something like that about a judge who had antipathy for civil rights? I mean, that is just, I would say, a reckless and irresponsible statement unless you have something to back that up and support it. So I just thought it would be important to respond to some of the things that the Democratic leader just said with respect to the agenda here in the Senate, which, as I pointed out earlier, is a very full one. If you compare it to the agenda of our colleagues in the Democrat- controlled House, which is zilch because they are not here for the entire month, it seems to me the Senate is getting a lot of work done. 5G So, Madam President, what I came here to talk about--I came down to the floor a couple of weeks ago to talk about how the coronavirus is highlighting the importance of strong internet networks. Despite the surge we have seen in internet traffic that the coronavirus has produced, with Americans using the internet for everything from work to school to family dinners, U.S networks have held up tremendously well. Americans have been able to enjoy the same speed and streaming quality that they typically enjoy, something that hasn't happened in a lot of other countries, and that is a direct result of the United States' light-touch approach to internet regulation, which has encouraged American companies to invest in the latest communications infrastructure and new technologies to make more efficient use of spectrum. Our Nation is currently preparing for the widespread adoption of the next generation of internet technology--what is known as 5G. We need to make sure that our 5G networks will be as strong as our current networks, but we still have some work to do to get to that point. I come down here frequently to the floor to discuss that work, which includes paving the way for the widespread installation of the small cells that are necessary for 5G networks, enhancing the availability of the mid-band spectrum that is necessary for 5G deployment, and investing in a 5G workforce. But there is also another aspect we need to think about when it comes to 5G, which is sometimes not talked about as much, and that is network security. With its incredible speed and connectivity, 5G will usher in a new era of innovation: advances in medical care, the large-scale deployment of precision agriculture, safer transportation technologies. 5G will bring all of these things and more. But like any new technology, 5G networks will present new risks and vulnerabilities. And because 5G will mean a vastly greater number of connected devices, the risks with 5G will be greater. That is the why a central part of deploying 5G networks has to be looking at how we can mitigate security risks. We need to ensure that our component parts of our devices and, critically, the component parts of telecommunications networks, like cell towers and the small cells that will be required for 5G, are secure. A primary way to do that is by ensuring that 5G equipment comes from trusted vendors. Currently, one of the biggest suppliers of 5G equipment worldwide is a Chinese company, Huawei, which is supported by the Chinese Government. China's 2017 national intelligence law requires Chinese companies to support the Chinese Government's intelligence activities. American security officials have raised concerns that much of Huawei's equipment is built with back doors that give the Chinese Government access to global communications networks. I don't need to tell anyone that we should be wary of China's motives and that China's interests are frequently opposed to those of the United States. China's handling of the coronavirus is a striking current example of the Chinese Government's prioritizing its own interests or pride over the public good. As a New York Times article noted in February, ``The [Chinese] government's initial handling of the epidemic allowed the virus to gain a tenacious hold. At critical moments, officials chose to put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis to avoid political alarm and political embarrassment.'' Whether it was driven by the hubris of the Communist Party or merely the callous indifference the Communist state has for the well-being of its own citizens, China was not transparent about the grave danger of COVID-19. It failed to release accurate information about the nature and spread of the virus, and it took active steps to make sure the truth did not get out in other ways. Whistleblowers were punished; the centers were censored; and journalists were expelled. Despite the fact that its negligence undoubtedly contributed to the global spread of COVID-19, China still continues to be less than forthcoming about the virus. Unfortunately, this is run-of-the-mill governing in China, as we saw with the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s and as we have seen in many other instances. Not content with its role in aggravating the spread of the coronavirus, the Chinese Communist Party has also taken advantage of the pandemic to strip Hong Kong of its autonomy and freedom. China's hope is that our Nation is too preoccupied with this pandemic to notice its efforts to undermine what should be Hong Kong's autonomy under the one state, two systems construct. We have noticed. As many of my colleagues and I have expressed, we stand with Hong Kong. We must carefully consider an appropriate response, one that will rebuke the Communist Party of China without negatively affecting the people of Hong Kong, their well-being, and their democratic aspirations. We didn't need COVID-19 or China's recent actions in Hong Kong to know that giving the Chinese Government a backdoor into American communications networks is a bad idea. But it certainly underscores the need to make sure that 5G infrastructure is not made by companies beholden to the Chinese Government. The United States has taken a number of steps to prevent equipment from Huawei and another suspect Chinese company, ZTE, from being used in U.S communications networks, but these companies still pose a risk to the United States. For starters, some U.S broadband providers, often in rural areas, still have equipment from Huawei and ZTE in their communications networks. A number of our allies and trade partners--entities with whom we regularly share information, including sensitive national security information--have used or are using technology from Huawei and ZTE. What can we do? An initiative is already underway to replace suspect telecommunications components in U.S networks with hardware from trusted companies. In March, the President signed legislation developed by the Commerce Committee chairman, Roger Wicker, the Secure and Trusted Communications Network Act, to help speed up this process. This legislation, which I cosponsored, will help small telecommunications providers with the cost of replacing network components that pose a security risk. Also, In March, I introduced legislation to help address the other part of the problem, and that is the use of Huawei technology by our allies and our trading partners. We regularly exchange information, including sensitive national security information, with our allies and trading partners. And this information can only be secure if networks on both ends are secure. That is why the United States has called for other countries to reject telecommunications technology from Huawei and ZTE. A number of countries have committed to using trusted companies to build out their telecommunications networks, but other countries are still planning to make use of Huawei's technology. My legislation, the Network Security Trade Act, would make telecommunications security a key objective when negotiating future trade deals. We should be using trade agreements to push for enhanced network security globally, which would benefit not only our country but every country with which we do business. [[Page S2664]] We recently opened negotiations on a new trade deal with the United Kingdom, which has been using Huawei technology to build its 5G networks. I am pleased that it now looks like the UK is reconsidering its use of Huawei components. I hope they will decide to reject the suspect technology. I hope the trade negotiations will emphasize the importance of using trusted companies to build out the UK's telecommunications networks. The security of our communications with our trading partners and allies--particularly those allies like Britain--needs to be a priority. As we move forward into the 5G future, we need to make sure that our technological advancements are matched with advancements and network security. That starts with keeping Huawei and other suspect technology out of our networks and, if at all possible, out of the networks of our allies. I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that we have not only the infrastructure but the security needed to keep American networks at the forefront of the telecommunications revolution. Before I close, let me just say one more word about China. As I said earlier, China's coronavirus deception is undoubtedly partly responsible for the fact that this virus has now spread to every corner of the world. China's recent actions with regard to Hong Kong underscore the hostility of the Chinese Government to the values that freedom-loving countries hold dear. China has a lot of work to do if it ever hopes to rebuild trust with other nations. At a bare minimum, we expect China to uphold its recent trade commitments, which are critical to America's hard-hit farmers and ranchers. I will be looking, and our entire government will be looking, to see if China's word on trade agreements can be relied upon. I hope that the Chinese Government will live up to its commitments. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the senior Senator from Oklahoma is recognized. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered Coronavirus Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I note with some interest that one Republican colleague after another comes to the floor--their ``protect the President at all costs'' colleagues, no matter what he does, no matter what he says, no matter how he acts, no matter how incompetent, no matter how divisive--and continues to point their fingers at the Chinese for the coronavirus. God knows, China deserves heaps of blame for the outbreak in the early spread of the coronavirus. There is no question they deserve a lot of blame for the outbreak in the early spread, and they are lying about it. But keep in mind that we are 5 percent of the world's population, and 30 percent of the deaths from the coronavirus have been Americans. This President continues to make excuses and point fingers. And the compliant, always obedient, sheeplike Members of the Republican caucus conference of the Senate continue to stay quiet, continue to do nothing about this President's behavior and the 105,000 deaths from coronavirus in this country. Protests Mr. President, the protests around our State, throughout our country, are an expression of fear and grief and frustration and of anger. Black communities led the Nation in mourning the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor over the last week. They are now leading calls for justice and long-term changes to dismantle the systems of oppression that hold them back. Instead of listening to those calls from the people who built this country, instead of offering leadership and rising to meet this moment--as every one of his predecessors of both parties did in times of trouble for our country--President Trump fails yet again. Instead of uniting, he divides. Instead of comforting, he stokes fear. He points fingers. He places blame. Instead of healing, he rubs salt in the open wounds of Black Americans. On Monday night, the President of the United States turned the arm of the state on peaceful protesters--we saw the video--tear-gassing the citizens he is supposed to serve, all so he could walk across the street and stage a photo op at a church he doesn't attend and hold up a Bible that he doesn't read. The timid--you choose the adjective--timid, cowardly, spineless Republican colleagues in this Senate just remained silent. How offended they would have been if a Democratic President had done what this President does and fails to do--the tear-gassing of citizens he is supposed to serve, the photo op at a church, the holding up of the Bible he doesn't read, the excuses, the divisiveness, all of that. People are tired. People are angry: more Black sons and daughters and mothers and fathers killed by police officers--the very people who are supposed to protect all Americans; more death, when many are already grieving--so many in the Black community already grieving the loss of family members and friends for the coronavirus, grappling with the economic stress this pandemic has caused. The pandemic has been the ``great revealer.'' We know Black and Brown communities have been hit hardest by the coronavirus. They are more likely to get sick. They have less access to healthcare. They make up the communities hurt by Jim Crow laws and redlining and now the locking in of those rules and regulations by the Trump administration. Black and Brown communities disproportionately make up our essential workers. It is not because they don't work as hard. It is not because of individual choices. We all work hard. We are all trying to do something productive for our families and our communities. We all want to build a better country for our daughters and our sons. No; it is because of a racist system that is making it harder for their work to pay off and putting at risk their lives for generations, long before this virus appeared. A grocery store worker in Cincinnati said to me: They tell me I am essential, but I feel expendable. I don't feel safe at work, and they don't pay me very much. I feel expendable. Long before this pandemic, millions of Americans knew we had a system that treats them like they are expendable. Their hard work isn't paying off. For some, it feels like the system is broken. For Black and Brown workers, it never worked to begin with. In the midst of the trauma and the grieving, millions of those same Americans still go to work day after day, week after week, in grocery stores, as delivery people, in drugstores, as busdrivers, and the people who do the linen and change the beds in hospitals, the food service workers, the custodians, the security people, the first responders. In the midst of the trauma and grieving, those same Americans--millions of them--still go to work day after day, week after week. Our job is to show the victims of systemic racism at the hands of their own government that the same government can and will protect them from this pandemic. We hear them. We see them. We fight for them. Their lives matter. Our response to this crisis must be to stand behind all the people who make this country work, all workers, whether you swipe a badge or punch a clock, whether you earn a salary or make tips, whether you are raising children or caring for an aging parent; all workers, whether your hard work isn't paying off now or whether it never paid off the way it should. Dr. King said: One day our society will come to respect the sanitation worker. For the person who picks up our garbage, in the final analysis, is as significant as the physician, for if he doesn't do his job, diseases are rampant. All labor has dignity. It is Black and Brown workers who have too often, far too long, far too often been robbed of their dignity on the job. If we want to be a country where all people have dignity, we need to start by recognizing that all labor has dignity. But so far, our response to the crisis is not the response of a government that believes that. This Senate, this President, can always find trillions of dollars for corporations--for tax cuts, for bailouts. But when hard-working families need help with rent or to put food on the table, President Trump and Leader McConnell say we can't afford it. The President and the administration have already made racial and economic inequality worse and undone [[Page S2665]] civil rights protections. They have been pretty clear that they are willing to put American workers' lives at risk--to reopen stockyards or just to juice the stock market. President Trump and his administration believe that millions of Americans are expendable. It is not a coincidence that many of the people they consider expendable are Black and Brown workers. Since the President is unwilling to protect people--whether that is protecting their lives or protecting their financial future--we in the Senate must fill the leadership void. As we do that, we work for change. We need to be clear that part of leading is listening. The best ideas don't come out of Washington--the solutions we need to fix the justice system, to address wealth inequality, to reverse disparities in healthcare, to help communities that have been hurt by redlining and Jim Crow laws and so much more. Whenever we talk about this, whenever people bring up the ways the system has failed so many Americans on the Senate floor or at a protest march, there are always naysayers--almost always White, usually men, often pretty well-off--who say: How can you be so negative? Why do you want to dwell on all the worst parts of our history? Don't you love our country? My response to our country's naysayers and sunshine patriots is this: How can you be so pessimistic as to believe that this is the best our country can do? Do you really think the American people, with our ingenuity and our optimism and tenacity--do you really think the American people can't create a fair economy and a more just government? Do you truly believe we can't have a society that works for everyone-- Black and White and Brown, women and men--no matter who you are, no matter what kind of work you do? Protesting, working for change, organizing, demanding our country do better--those are some of the most patriotic things any of us can do. I love my country. If you love this country, you fight for the people who make it work, all of them. I yield the floor The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would remind Senators that under rule XIX, it is provided that ``no Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.'' The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized. Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I want to respond to the accusations that were made. And I worded that carefully not to violate any rules. I am going to do that. I see kind of an active desperation that is creeping in on statements and things that are said about other people. And right now, we are experiencing some things that actually are a success. I want to respond to some of the accusations that were made. First, I have something else to do that is kind of an awkward thing to be doing at this time because I am going to go back to talk about something that happened not yesterday or this week but back in 1983. I think it is important that we do this. About every 10 years I do this. And we are going to be successful now because I have a commitment from the President that he is going to stay hitched on an issue--a huge issue in the past. In 1983, not much was known about Iran's efforts to train and arm the radical proxies and to kill Americans and to kill our partners and our allies. People know now. In fact, only a few years earlier, Ayatollah Khamenei led a violent revolution in Iran. Khamenei's regime introduced himself to the world by taking American diplomats hostage for 444 days--444 days. We all remember when that happened. That was something unprecedented. It was all tied into Khamenei. Of course, he used other people. Nothing has changed since that time. Nonetheless, for the next decade, until his death in 1989, Khamenei was the ruthless face of an Iranian regime that applied a brutal version of religious law, murdered innocent people, suppressed religious and ethnic minorities, and supported radical Islamists. He hated Western value, and he hated the freedoms that we enjoy. Almost 4 years into his rule as Supreme Leader, October 23, 1983, 241 Americans, both U.S marines and other service personnel serving a peace mission in Beirut, were attacked at their barracks by a truck that was carrying 2,000 pounds of explosives by terrorists who were armed and trained by Iran. That was in 1983. Two hundred and forty-one died. These terrorists later became what we know as Hezbollah. That is the first time they surfaced and were identified as they are today, as an arm of Iran. Hezbollah struck. In 2003, 20 years after the attack on our marines, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in a civil suit brought by the families of the victims--the 241 who were killed--that Iran had used Hezbollah as a proxy to bomb the Marine barracks in Beirut on that October day. Not much has changed with Iran, unfortunately. It is the same way they operate now. They don't play by the rules. They never have. They are terrorists. They are worse than terrorists. They are the ones who are training the terrorists. That became even more apparent when we began to learn more about their ties to Islamist terror organizations and how they use proxy organizations, with no true allegiance but on behalf of a twisted interpretation of Islamic religious text, to murder and then sneak back into the shadows. That is the way they operated, and that is the way they operate today. It happened under Ayatollah Khamenei, and it happens under the current Supreme Leader as well. Nothing has really changed. A lot of years have gone by. A lot of people have died. As I speak here on the floor, Iran is providing weapons and cover for the Houthi rebels, who are committing unthinkable atrocities in Yemen. Iran has continued to support terrorist groups that threaten our personnel in Iraq. It has repeatedly attacked our partners across the region. What is even worse is Iran seeks a nuclear weapon capability, and President Obama's Iran deal would have, ultimately, let it have exactly what it wanted. Fortunately, we now have a President who takes a strong stance against Iran with the imposing of sanctions and the pulling out of the flawed Iran nuclear deal that the previous administration put us in. By the way, I had a joyful conversation for a half an hour yesterday with Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel. He was reminding me that I was in Israel and in the Prime Minister's office at the very moment that President Trump pulled out of the Iran deal, and I had never seen him so jubilant. We just talked about that yesterday. Go back now to October 23, 1983, when 241 Americans were killed by an Iranian-backed suicide bomber. It was a terrible day in U.S history, and, in 2003, a U.S court ruled that Iran was responsible. That suit against Iran, brought by the victims' families--the families of the 241 who died--provided punitive and compensatory relief in the form of Iranian assets. In 2007, the district court judge awarded just over $2.5 billion to the families of those murdered in that atrocity. Our work isn't done now. You would think that it would be, but it is not because there is nearly $1.7 billion in laundered Iranian assets in a Luxembourg bank named Clear Street, and we need to make sure that it stays there. Yet I have this gnawing feeling that, once something is over in Luxembourg or someplace like that, all of a sudden, you wake up and find that Iran has $1.7 billion it is not entitled to in order to spread terrorism throughout the world. In last year's NDAA--now, the NDAA is the largest bill we do each year. I chair the defense authorization. It is called the National Defense Authorization Act. We pass it every year. We included language that made those assets available to the victims' families, and the President signed it. I talked to the President, and he is anxious to do this. We have one obstacle that we have to get past, which is some activity by the second circuit where it is now being played out. President Trump has been a firm leader against the aggressive Iran, and I certainly stand with him. That is why this is a clear opportunity to continue President Trump's maximum pressure campaign against the current Iranian regime so as to ensure these assets do not return to Iran, where they would surely be used to help the proxy organization, such as Hezbollah. [[Page S2666]] I trust our Department of Justice with this, and I am glad we have a President who has made this a top priority--making sure the families of those 241 victims who were killed in Beirut receive this money as opposed to having the money go back. Protests Mr. President, in responding to a couple of things that were said a few minutes ago, we all know this is a really trying time for our Nation. I begin with the obvious, which is what happened to George Floyd was a crime. It was a horrible crime, and it has caused a groundswell of people joining together and standing against injustice and hate, not just for George Floyd but for so many others. Protests are meaningful and positive events--standing up for dignity and respect for all people. Protesting is a cherished part of our democratic society that is enshrined in the First Amendment. The rights of peaceful protest should be supported and celebrated, period. We understand that. Yet those protests are not the same as the dangerous, destructive activity we have seen in many of our cities just in the last couple of days. Emotions are high, and tensions are high, which is understandable. We need law and order if we are going to move forward, and I think every reasonable person agrees with that. We are trying to have tough conversations about inequality, but we are facing a lot of misinformation, especially when it comes to our military. If we let this misinformation spread, it will just make things worse. All of the people out there--I am talking about the ``hate Trump'' people--are using this to try to lie to the American people. So I would like to correct the record, and I hope every American here understands and believes these words. This is very important. Here is what is happening. Right now, the National Guard has not been federalized for response. Right now, Active-Duty troops have not been sent into any city, including DC. I was here last night. I was visibly looking around and making sure that this was not the case, and it was not. There were no Active-Duty troops in spite of things you have heard to the contrary. Right now, local and State law enforcement are being supported by the National Guard but only when they are requested by their States. The Department of Defense believes that, and by and large, they are doing a fine job. I agree with that. Our military is prepared to step in if the situation deteriorates dramatically and only if our President finds he has to step in. To be crystal clear, the President hasn't done that yet. I ask my fellow Americans to slow down and understand what will happen if and only if the President does so. It doesn't mean that our streets will immediately be flooded with uniformed and armed troops. There is a process that has to be followed just as it was in 1992 with the LA riots, in 1998 after Hurricane Hugo, and at every other time before that. First, this is the process. What has to happen is the President must issue a proclamation ordering any insurgents to disperse within a set period of time. Now, that is really important because that is the warning shot. He says this is going to happen, but only you can keep this from happening. The President has to issue the proclamation ordering any insurgents to disperse within a set period of time. It will mean that our Nation's military and security leaders, including our Commander in Chief--the President--will have determined that the situation will have deteriorated in a way that local officials will not have managed on their own. In virtually every case, local officials have agreed with that. We are not there now. We are not there at all, and I hope we don't get there. This will only be as a last resort. If we do, I am confident this decision will be made with the advice of the top civilian and military officials who have all been confirmed with wide bipartisan support and margins General Mark A. Milley Mr. President, I would like to say a little something about simple military relations. This is something I care a lot about as chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services. In particular, I want to speak about General Milley. General Milley is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In this job, General Milley is the President's top military adviser. Don't forget he doesn't have any command authority over the military forces. This is important. This is not what you hear people talking about when they misrepresent the situation. This is very important. He is there as the adviser to the President of the United States, and he doesn't have any command authority. There has been a lot of criticism about his wearing his battle dress uniform--his BDU, as they call it--on Monday when the President spoke. Here is another area in which I want to set the record straight. General Milley was getting ready to visit with troops around DC--I know that. I was talking to him that day--who were also in their BDUs. That was the dress uniform for their function at that time. Then he was called to the White House. We all know why he was called to the White House. He is the adviser to the President. I think everyone can agree that we want that voice at the table in situations like this to provide the best military advice, as is his statutory authority and responsibility. On Monday, after General Milley walked outside with the President, he assessed the situation and immediately removed himself. Now, this isn't just me talking. I know that he did because I was with him shortly before that and also after that. So that was a fact. He also told me that he intended to honor his oath and uphold the delicate balance between civilians and the military. I fully believe him. He has always done that in the past and always will do that. The accusations against General Milley are especially troubling to me because I know, from working with him, of his commitment to our Nation, to the Constitution, and to the American people--of keeping them safe and giving his best military advice. It is striking below the belt to make these accusations and to try to scare the American people. It is my duty as chairman of the Committee on Armed Services to have strong oversight over this issue. We have oversight over it. If what they are saying is true, we still have the oversight. I assure you, right now, we are watching what our military is doing and what it has always done, which is its duty within the law and constitutional limits, and that is exactly what General Milley has done and is doing right now. We are seeing a lot of finger-pointing and blame going around. We owe it to ourselves and our neighbors to believe the very best in each other, not assume the worse. We need to recognize everyone's inherent value and dignity and treat each other with respect and dignity as Christ calls us to do. Only then can we listen with both of our ears and with our hearts. That is what I am asking the American people to do. Many of those in the protests are in a group that has been referred to as antifa. Certainly, George Floyd's death was a tragedy and went beyond unthinkable dimensions, but did any of them know who he was? I suggest, no, they really didn't. So I would only say this: I think, in answer to the accusations that were made, that I would quote only one or two sentences out of a speech that our President made 2 days ago in the Rose Garden. This is very self-explanatory and does explain the situation in response to the accusations that have been made falsely about him. We cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drowned out by an angry mob. The biggest victims of the rioting are peace-loving citizens in our poorest communities. And as their President, I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your President of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Tennessee Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I first thank my friend, Senator Leahy, for allowing me to speak, for we are all dealing with the Committee on the Judiciary. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Leahy be recognized as soon as I finish my brief remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I want to say just a couple of things to Tennesseans and to Americans. All are expressing their rage and grief over the murder of George Floyd [[Page S2667]] in Minnesota. I will tell you that this event of May 25 cannot be written off as a simple use of force or as being unfortunate or regrettable. We all know that, on that day, George Floyd was killed by a police officer while other officers looked on and heard his begging for life and his cries for help. The officers responsible should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I offer my prayers and condolences to the Floyd family, just as so many other Members of this Chamber have done, and I support the President's call for the Justice Department to investigate this death. Censorship Mr. President, our country was built on the premise of dissent, and we have seen the power that peaceful protests have in their ability to bring change to every level of government. Unfortunately, over the past week, we have also seen what happens when criminals and shadowy professionals exploit these public expressions of frustration and pain. Every single day, Americans are waking up to find that their neighborhoods have been destroyed, and they watch news reports that are dominated by lawlessness. Many activists and members of the mainstream media have attempted to force us into choosing between solidarity and maintaining law and order. This is a false choice. It is one that we ought to reject. Instead, we should fight for accountability, compassion, and understanding. At the same time, we must condemn racism, hatred, and the violence that has torn apart so many neighborhoods this very week. We should also celebrate and defend our right to peaceful disagreement in the streets, in the classroom, and online just as well as in this very Chamber. Unfortunately, too often, this right is not celebrated. Over the years, we have documented Big Tech's history of censorship, particularly the censorship of dissenting conservative voices. During the 2018 election cycle, a series of pro-life ads that I sponsored on social media were taken down for having content the platform labeled as ``inflammatory.'' For years, conservatives have been fighting a losing war against content moderation policies that act as a dragnet for dissenting opinions. Last week, Twitter rolled out a new ``fact-checking'' feature and almost immediately botched a fact check on one of President Trump's tweets. Unfortunately, for Twitter, the President was not afraid to point out how easy it is for private companies to make mistakes that turn moderation into speech policing. We know that social media companies have subjectively manipulated their algorithms to capture conservative opinions and conservative elected officials. They have been doing this for too long for it to just be a mere mistake. These are not unintended consequences. Last week, President Trump signed an Executive order to bring some much needed attention to the issue, and we thank him for that. As head of the Judiciary Committee's Tech Task Force, I look forward to working with the White House and the Justice Department to preserve free speech online for all Americans. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Protests Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we know that America is hurting. It is reeling from a deadly pandemic that has taken more than 100,000 lives and then from witnessing the broad daylight murder--murder--of yet another Black man by an officer of the law. It seethes with rage and sorrow about the racial injustices that still plague our society. America is suffering from unprecedented political divisions that are routinely worsened and deepened by a President whose every utterance only tears us further apart. In my decades in the U.S Senate, I have never seen our country so in need of healing. I was a prosecutor. So, when I first saw the video of George Floyd's murder--a human being who was pinned down by the neck, cried ``I can't breathe,'' and desperately called out for his mother--I was shocked to my core. For millions of Americans and for me, that shock swiftly turned into anger. How could a police officer, who has sworn an oath to protect and serve, so casually take a human being's life? Why did his fellow officers who witnessed the murder that we all witnessed on video stand there and do nothing to stop it? How could this happen in plain sight when multiple onlookers begged the officer to relent--stop his murderous conduct--as George fell unconscious? I was left sickened and shaken. I do not know and did not know George Floyd, but imagine if he were your neighbor or your friend. Imagine if George Floyd were your brother, your son, your husband, or your grandchild. Imagine if George Floyd simply looked like your loved one and shared the same skin color. Imagine the concern you would have for such a person who lived in constant fear of those who are responsible to protect us all. So it is no surprise that protests swept our Nation in the wake of this murder. Communities of color and all those who sympathize with them are fed up. They are sick and tired of the fact that African Americans are nearly 2\\1/2\\ times as likely as White Americans to be killed by police officers. No one of good conscience can sit idly by while African- American lives are treated with less worth. Our country long ago promised equal rights and equal justice. Now protesters are aching for real accountability for officers of the law who engage in lawless violence. It is not simply justice for George Floyd; it is justice for Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice. The list goes on and on, which is why the protests go on and on. Too often, people feel the police officers who take Black lives are treated like they are above the law. They feel the justice system has been fueled by a culture of impunity that shields the same officers who abuse the public's trust. Too often the accountability comes after incontrovertible evidence, such as a damning video, happens to surface and the public demands justice. I can say, as one who served proudly in law enforcement and has served proudly in the Senate, ultimately accountability will require dismantling this culture of impunity, as well as ensuring that law enforcement agencies have training and policies in place to serve to rebuild trust in communities of color. The protesters demand more from our justice system. They demand more from a nation that promises that nobody is above the law. Well, I stand with them, and Congress has to, too. None of us condone, and indeed I have strongly condemned, the looting and violence that has sadly taken place alongside the peaceful protests and the extremists and opportunists who have co-opted the peaceful process. They are not serving justice. They are not going to bring the change our country so badly needs. My hero, a dear friend who has called me his brother, Representative John Lewis, said just a few days ago: [L]ooting and burning is not the way. Organize. Demonstrate. Sit-in. Stand-up. Vote. Be constructive, not destructive. I hope everybody will listen to what Representative Lewis said. I hope our fellow Americans will heed his wise words. I refuse to partake in efforts seeking to delegitimize all protesters and create even more distrust and division. Demonstrators demanding accountability are not thugs, as President Trump has called them. No one should threaten state-sanctioned violence against protesters, as this President and some of his allies have. I strongly oppose any efforts to invoke the Insurrection Act to unleash our military against these domestic demonstrations, as President Trump has absurdly threatened. Our military is one of our Nation's most sacred institutions. It serves to safeguard our constitutional rights against enemies abroad. They should never be ordered to American streets as the battlefield, which would only incite further chaos and deprive Americans of their right to peacefully assemble. That is not the America we know and love. It is not the America I know and love. Unfortunately, President Trump has proven that he is incapable or perhaps he is uninterested in healing and uniting our Nation. At every turn his instinct is to divide and escalate. During every crisis he manages to manufacture another of his own making. When Americans are in desperate need of a consoler in chief, a role that I have seen every past President play during my years in the Senate--every one of [[Page S2668]] those Presidents, Republican and Democrat alike--President Trump, instead of being consoler in chief, shows that he knows only how to be instigator in chief. He has revealed himself really to be a President of his country in name only. I never imagined I would say that of any American President of either party, certainly not of all the predecessors I have had the honor to know. So we must instead look to ourselves and each other. How do we heal our country? At the local, State, and national levels, we must carry on the cause of criminal justice and police reform. We must push for systematic law enforcement reform. We must elect leaders who will prioritize racial justice and work tirelessly to achieve some measure of that. We must work to build bridges in communities so that we better empathize with the struggles faced by those who have been marginalized for decades on end. On Monday, Terrence Floyd, George's brother, stood on the spot where his brother died. He made an emotional appeal to the hundreds of people watching and to the Nation. He pled for the protests to remain peaceful. He pled for those who believe they are marginalized and disenfranchised not to give up hope, that their voice matters, and he pled for justice. His brother died because he needed a breath. His family now asks to take a breath for justice, a breath for peace, a breath for our country, and a breath for George. We should honor his memory by heeding their anguished advice. There is so much to do. Congress must get to work. During my years in the Senate, I have seen America in crisis. But every time, without exception, I have seen America emerge a more just and stronger nation. The crises America faces today feel overwhelming, historic--some would say existential. But if we stay true to the values that define our Republic--equality, justice, the rule of law--I am hopeful we will make it through as a slightly more perfect union. I weep for our country; I pray for our country; and I look for better days. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon Nomination of Michael Pack Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this week our majority leader is asking the Senate to vote on the nomination of Michael Pack to serve as Chief Executive of the U.S Agency for Global Media. Mr. Pack's nomination should trouble all of us in this Chamber. It raises the question of whether the U.S Senate is committed to being the check and balance on the qualifications of those potentially vested with substantial responsibility into positions in our executive branch. His nomination draws into question the challenge we have, the responsibility we have to ensure that only individuals of talent, experience, and of integrity serve America in the executive branch. Hamilton commented on this in the Federalist Papers. He said: To what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate? I answer, that the necessity of [the Senate's] concurrence would have a powerful though, in general, silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon the spirit of favoritism in the President, and tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters. Those words should resonate in this Chamber now. The individual who will come before us, Michael Pack, set up a nonprofit called Public Media Lab, or PML, apparently for the sole purpose to channel contracts to his for-profit operation known as Manifold Productions. Over a period exceeding a decade, he channeled $4 million from the nonprofit to the for-profit. Not a single contract went anywhere else--no other contracts. Utilizing a nonprofit to launder for-profit contracts, in the process of which providing tax subsidies to your customers and advantage over your competitors, raises both ethical and legal issues. The legal issues, including potential criminal conduct, have not been resolved. Mr. Pack is, at this moment, under investigation by the attorney general of the District of Columbia. Mr. Pack, in tax filings to the IRS in 2011 through 2018, did not accurately disclose a relationship between his nonprofit and his for- profit. When he was asked if, in fact, there were common officers between the two, he answered no when the answer was clearly yes. He did not disclose that his for-profit benefited from the setup of the nonprofit. Mr. Pack did admit to the Committee on Foreign Relations that he made oversights; that is the term he used--``oversights.'' But he has refused to correct his tax filings. Mr. Pack, when he was renominated in 2020, inaccurately stated in the records to the committee that his tax returns were complete and accurate. He has refused to provide critical documents to the committee and, in that sense, to the Senate to examine these significant issues. He has refused to provide the agreements between PML and Manifold, his nonprofit and his for-profit, to examine the propriety of the relationship. He has said simply that those documents are confidential and proprietary. But we should realize that serving in the executive branch is a privilege. We asked for information so that we can exercise our constitutional responsibility. When an individual confronted with substantial ethical and legal issues simply says ``I will not provide them'' and if the Senate committee says ``That is OK,'' then we are failing in our constitutional responsibility to examine the qualifications of the individual. This is no light responsibility we bear in this Chamber. This is a very significant check and balance of the U.S Constitution, which each and every one of us swore to uphold when we took our oath of office. Mr. Pack, when he was president of the Claremont Institute, directed significant funds to his for-profit company for fundraising. His company is not a fundraising company; his company is a film company. So we have asked him to provide the details and documents related to that work to see if there was an inappropriate transfer of funds from a position of responsibility to the personal profit of Michael Pack. But Mr. Pack has refused to provide details. He has refused to provide documents related to that work. In addition, he prematurely resigned from his role at the Claremont Institute, and it is shrouded in mystery. We do not know if the board found ethical issues. We do not know if they found criminal conduct because he has not responded to our request for documents related to his premature resignation. Given the gravity of these issues, it makes sense, when he was renominated, that he would reappear before the committee to help clear up these concerns and these issues. Well, we have not had such a hearing. To summarize, when an individual makes false statements to the IRS and refuses to correct them, when they make false statements to the committee, not in the first time before the committee but the second time before the committee, when they refuse to provide relevant documents to provide significant issues of ethical conduct or potential criminal conduct, when there is an active investigation into that potentially criminal conduct, then we should simply say to the President: Send us a different name. This man may be well qualified, but he does not wish to provide the information necessary for the Senate to do its responsibility as a check and balance on potentially unfit individuals. To exercise advice and consent in accordance with responsibilities charged to us, we must insist on upholding the standards for records and documents and truthfulness to the committee. We must insist that outstanding investigations be completed when they involve potentially criminal conduct. We must insist that verifiably false statements be corrected. These are not high or exceptional standards; these are fundamental, basic, elementary responsibilities that we carry. That is why I have written a resolution declaring that the Senate should not vote on a nominee who has made verifiably false statements to Congress or the executive branch and who refuses to correct those statements. Until those statements to both the Foreign Relations Committee and to the IRS are corrected, Michael Pack's nomination should be set aside. We should simply tell the President and exercise our responsibility, for which we have taken an oath of office, to send us someone else. This individual is not prepared to provide the information necessary for the Senate to proceed with his nomination. That is what we should be saying, and we should still be [[Page S2669]] saying it at this late date. I urge my colleagues to do the right thing by supporting this resolution Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 604 Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 604, which was submitted earlier today. I further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott of Florida). Is there objection? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho. Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what you are seeing here today is a pure, unadulterated exercise in politics-- politics that are steeped with the difference of political philosophy between the two parties. With relation to the complaint that my colleague has just made that this nomination hasn't been adequately vetted, this nomination was made 2 years ago tomorrow, June 4, 2018. Mr. Pack came before the committee. He has been before the committee twice. He has produced numerous documents due to the complaints of the Democrats on the committee. He has been looked at by the White House. His business dealings have been looked at by the Justice Department, by the Internal Revenue Service, and he has been cleared of anything. The U.S Agency for Global Media is an important agency because it is charged with supporting international broadcasting outlets around the world in the face of the kinds of misinformation and things that are put out by other countries that are untrue. The real reason for the objection to Mr. Pack's nomination is that this man is a patriot. This is a man who makes documentary films that portray the greatness of America. Anyone who disagrees with that ought to spend the time to look at the documentary he just made, which was run on public TV within the last 30 days, regarding Clarence Thomas and what he had to go through to get on the Supreme Court. It was a superb representation of what happened in that. If you watch that, you will see why the Democrats are absolutely opposed to Mr. Pack. But don't take our word for this. RealClearPolitics, after this whole thing started, did its own investigation into this, and they noted that the business arrangements of Mr. Pack used to make these documentaries are very common for documentary filmmakers and, like Pack, filmmakers and television producers also use nonprofits to collect contributions from donors and then set up a for-profit company to make these films. This is exactly what Senator Merkley was objecting to. Having said that, they went on to interview others, including attorneys and everything else. Another producer with no business ties to Pack told RealClearPolitics ``that he set up the same two-pronged way of funding films last year on the advice of counsel, who told him it was standard operating procedure.'' This has been looked at. It has been reviewed. Look, the committee has had this in its hands for almost 2 years. I have been really patient. Every time that I set this for a hearing and they wanted more time, I let that go. Finally, the last time, I was really, really disappointed in the Democrats' engagement of the political system, enjoining it with the potential criminal justice system, to try to stop this. The night before the business meeting, I got a letter from the attorney general for the District of Columbia--obviously a partisan individual--that says that he is going to look at this and, therefore, he is investigating it. The Democrats then said: Well, we can't go ahead with this because he is being investigated by this partisan person from DC. Look, I am on the Ethics Committee. There are six of us. Half of us sit on the Foreign Relations Committee. In every instance I can think of on the Ethics Committee where the U.S Justice Department has asked us to stand down because they were doing a legitimate criminal investigation, we have done so. In this particular case, it was a partisan agency of the District of Columbia that noticed that they were going to do this investigation. I started my career as a prosecutor. I have always felt that the justice system and the prosecuting system should be above politics, but to get a partisan individual to send a letter--after 2 years--on the eve of the business meeting, that he was going to open a business meeting again, after many delays, was just too much. But I did delay the business meeting for 1 week, and after that 1 week we had a business meeting. The Democrats made motion after motion to delay. Again, I was as patient as I could be. I said during these motions that we were only going to go on so long with this. Finally, as was noted by some of the attorneys in the room, had this occurrence happened in a court of law, the attorneys would have been held in contempt of court for making repetitive motions that were obviously delay motions and done spuriously. So, after the eighth motion, I declared the motions out of order, and we went to what democracies do. We went to a vote. To no one's surprise, it was a straight party-line vote: 12 votes to send Mr. Pack's confirmation to the floor for confirmation and 10 votes against that. This is a democracy. The way we do this is we have disagreements, particularly when it comes to political matters such as this, but to try to engage the justice system in this I find just really, really disheartening. We are going to have a vote on Mr. Pack, and it is very simple. If you don't want Mr. Pack to take this job, then you vote no, and if you do, then you say yes. But this has been investigated back and forth. Regardless of the breast-beating and the rending of garments over what an awful person he is and how awful his businesses have been, keep in mind, this is all politics. If you see the kind of work that he has done, he makes America proud when he makes a documentary. So I would object to the resolution that has been proposed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from New Jersey Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask to speak for up to 5 minutes before the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, thank Senator Merkley for his leadership on the resolution and for his thoughtful and substantive contributions as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and to express our deep disappointment that our Republican colleagues are blocking his resolution, which basically says that we should not move forward on a nominee--in this case, this nominee--when there are false statements to the IRS and to the Foreign Relations Committee for which he refuses to correct the record, which would have consequences. Those are indisputable. It is abundantly clear that we need to formalize some standards that apply equally to all nominees, Democrat and Republican alike, and we should think of it as a floor beneath which the Senate should not fall. Now, it is amazing to me that I know my Republican colleagues used to care about tax issues. As a matter of fact, they denied a previous distinguished majority leader of the Senate--on some arcane issue--the opportunity to become the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They have done it a bunch of times. This issue is a $4 million tax issue in which Mr. Pack took his nonprofit, totally controlled by him--totally controlled by him--and had all the moneys that were solicited to the nonprofit then sent to his for-profit company, totally controlled by him--totally controlled by him. And no other disbursements were made from the nonprofit for anyone else, for any other entity. I didn't hear until now that the Justice Department and the IRS has reviewed this. It should be forthcoming, then, that they have cleared this, that this is now in the course of business. We can create a nonprofit; go ahead and get moneys from people; they will get their deductions; and then we can send it to ourselves for profit. That is one heck of a process. Now, the chairman continues to say ``2 years.'' Well, 2 years ago there was a Republican chairman of the committee--our colleague Bob Corker. He [[Page S2670]] did not move this nomination 2 years ago. So with this constant refrain of 2 years, I guess you want to blame former Senator Corker for not moving it during that period of time. At the chairman's request, I met with Mr. Pack. While he may not have been my nominee, I agreed to have a hearing, which is one of the standards we have in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. There is an agreement between the chair and ranking. That has been violated for Mr. Pack. He actually went to a vote before the committee without my agreement, so that comity has been violated for the future. At the end of the day, we have someone who will not ultimately--he says: Yes, I made a ``mistake''--it is a $4 million mistake--and, yes, I should have answered differently. Well, why not correct it? If it is so simple, if it is so benign, why not correct it? The reason you don't want to correct it is that there are consequences that flow from that correction, including probably an IRS investigation. Finally, it is interesting that, I guess, when Attorney General Barr does something, it is not political, but when the attorney general of the District of Columbia does it, it is political. I didn't know we were going to start choosing and picking which law enforcement entities are political in this country. The attorney general of the District of Columbia had an investigation that was preceding before any action of the committee--preceding before any action of the committee or any information brought to the attention of the attorney general. Evidently, he considers it significantly serious enough--potential IRS violations on taxes. So here are our Republican colleagues who, in the past, railed against anyone who had violations of the IRS Tax Code, saying they are not worthy of being a nominee, to going ahead and ramming through someone who ultimately has some serious issues to the tune of $4 million, and that is not a problem. Under investigation--that is not a problem. So I urge my colleagues to consider what you are doing here. Not only was a precedent set at the committee, but you will set a precedent on the floor, and it will be very hard for you to get up and rail about somebody's tax liabilities and what they did and didn't do honestly with the taxes at the end of the day. With that, I yield the floor. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The bill clerk read as follows Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination of James H. Anderson, of Virginia, to be a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense. Mitch McConnell, David Perdue, Jerry Moran, Rob Portman, Michael B. Enzi, Deb Fischer, Kevin Cramer, John Thune, John Boozman, Shelley Moore Capito, Marco Rubio, Todd Young, John Barrasso, James Lankford, Tim Scott, James E. Risch, Cindy Hyde-Smith. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the nomination of James H. Anderson, of Virginia, to be a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. THUNE. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Hoeven), and the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Hoeven) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith), and the Senator from Montana (Mr. Tester) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote or change their vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 74, nays 18, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 108 Ex.] YEAS--74 Alexander Barrasso Bennet Blackburn Blunt Boozman Braun Brown Burr Capito Carper Casey Cassidy Collins Coons Cornyn Cortez Masto Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Duckworth Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Gardner Graham Grassley Hassan Hawley Hirono Hyde-Smith Inhofe Johnson Jones Kaine Kennedy King Lankford Lee Loeffler Manchin McConnell McSally Menendez Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Peters Portman Reed Risch Roberts Romney Rosen Rubio Sasse Scott (FL) Scott (SC) Shaheen Shelby Sinema Stabenow Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Warner Whitehouse Wicker Young NAYS--18 Baldwin Blumenthal Booker Cantwell Cardin Gillibrand Harris Heinrich Klobuchar Leahy Merkley Murphy Murray Schumer Udall Van Hollen Warren Wyden NOT VOTING--8 Cramer Hoeven Markey Rounds Sanders Schatz Smith Tester The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 74, the nays are 18. The motion is agreed to. The Senator from Illinois. Unanimous Consent Request Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I came to the floor of the Senate to ask for consent on the simple, timely Senate resolution sponsored by nearly half of the Members of this Chamber. What did the resolution call for? Well, it urged the United States to join global coronavirus vaccine and treatment efforts. That doesn't sound like a radical idea, does it? In the midst of a global pandemic that is causing so much suffering and so many deaths, it would seem that asking the United States to join other countries of the world in searching for therapies and vaccines is just common sense. We don't know where or when a vaccine will be discovered. We don't know if an effective treatment will be discovered in the United States or in some other place. Certainly, with the respected medical and scientific leadership in the United States, you would hope that it would be here, but let's be honest. If a safe and effective vaccine against the coronavirus is discovered in some other country, the United States would want to be there and be part of the discussion about its production and distribution. Wouldn't we? That is all this resolution says. Why not team up with allies around the world since we are all looking for the same thing--a safe and effective vaccine. Whether that vaccine is stamped ``Made in the USA'' or is made in some other country is secondary. Is it safe? Is it effective? Will it save lives? Do we really want the American people to be left out of such an effort? It was a global effort to eliminate smallpox, Ebola, polio, and so many other deadly diseases we took for granted. We were all in it together. These viruses and diseases don't know any boundaries. People around the world have the same fears and concerns that we have in the United States about what we are paying in price of suffering and death until we find a way to avoid it. This resolution would just call on the United States to be part of a global effort to find a therapy and a vaccine, but this resolution was blocked here in the Senate. Since then, since the 2 weeks that have passed, we have lost over 100,000 American lives. Sadly, the number still grows. This has been 100,000 lives in just a few months--the same number of American casualties in the wars of Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined. What was President Trump's response? Was there empathy or a message of national unity or healing during this tragic moment? No. Once again, President Trump refused to take any responsibility for leadership during this crisis. Sadly, he has cast blame in every direction and ignored his own responsibility amid a deadly global pandemic that has had devastating consequences for the American people. [[Page S2671]] Sadly, we lead the world in infections and death, but President Trump has decided that now is the moment in history for the United States to pull out of the World Health Organization--the same body that is heading the global pandemic response. What is he thinking--that we would walk away from the organization that has called to the table countries from around the world in an effort to find a safe and effective vaccine? Here we are, on the 40th anniversary of the World Health Organization's historic achievement in eradicating small pox, stumbling along with a President who is more interested in settling a score, casting blame, and finding ways to divide us. Once again, the majority of his party here in the Senate is not chiming in and joining us in this effort to pass this resolution. While we continue to have some of the world's best researchers and experts, it is plausible that a vaccine will be found and developed elsewhere. In a rush to research and validate a vaccine, ramp up production, address global allocation and supply needs, ensure affordability and access worldwide, and make sure the United States gets its fair share of any safe and effective vaccine, where will we stand if the President insists on being on the sidelines, unengaged? When the United States pursues this Trump go-it-alone approach while the rest of the world is working together, where does that leave us? Pride cometh before the fall. Just as with the smallpox effort, a global, collaborative approach makes obvious sense, and it will save American lives. Joining forces with other countries around the world will help to speed the development and eventual distribution of the coronavirus vaccine we desperately seek. Do you want to know what one Republican Senator from Tennessee said about this? He said: ``I disagree with the President's decision.'' Withdrawing U.S membership from the WHO could, among other things, interfere with clinical trials that are essential to the development of a vaccine. No one knows where this vaccine will eventually be perfected or produced. God willing, it will be soon. Yet why shouldn't we be joining in this global effort? Why? Why, at this moment in history, has President Trump said we are stepping away from the organization that leads this effort? Given this President's--sadly, I hate to use the word--``obsession'' with blaming everyone but himself for mishandling this situation, maybe his dereliction of duty should come as no surprise, but what a bitter, bitter disappointment it is. I return to the floor to ask unanimous consent on a straightforward resolution--a simple resolution that should have passed without any fanfare by a voice vote unanimously in the Senate. This resolution calls on the United States to join in the global effort to find a safe and effective vaccine--something that we have done consistently throughout our history until this President took office. Ultimately, let's remember that this is a pandemic that affects the world, and any solution has to be a worldwide solution as well. We cannot isolate ourselves from the international ways of finding treatments and the development of a vaccine. Doing so not only wastes time but risks there being a loss of life. Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 579 Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign Relations be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 579, a resolution encouraging the international community to remain committed to collaboration and coordination to mitigate and prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and urging renewed United States leadership and participation in any global efforts on therapeutics and vaccine development and delivery to address COVID-19 and prevent further deaths; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Romney). Is there objection? The Senator from Idaho. Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. First of all, let me commend my good friend from Illinois for bringing this. I know he is frustrated, as all of us are, with what has happened with this pandemic that came out of China and swept the world and caused all the grief that it has for America and for every other country on the planet. It is important to note, I think, as we start, that the United States has been the single most generous donor of global health assistance around the world. We do hear people, from time to time, criticize the foreign assistance that America gives out. Probably the pandemic that we have just gone through, with this COVID-19 from China, is the best indication that there is for why certain foreign assistance is so crucial. This foreign assistance we give in the healthcare area is given, amongst other reasons, to keep those things from spreading to the United States. Last year alone, we, the United States of America, we American taxpayers, provided over $9 billion in global health assistance through the State Department and USAID. That $9 billion does not account for the amount that the CDC spent in global health efforts. So it is well over $9 billion that we Americans have put out there. We strengthen health systems; we train health workers; we build supply chains; we connect health networks; we support cutting-edge research and innovation; and, yes, develop and expand access to therapeutics and vaccines, which is what my good friend from Illinois is addressing here when it comes to vaccines. I am going to talk about that in a minute. We led the international efforts to combat AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, polio, Ebola, and other viruses that came out of China. We are the single largest donor to the Global Fund and U.N agencies, including UNICEF. I hope that there isn't a suggestion that we are withdrawing from collaborative efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine because we did not directly participate in the EU pledging conference. In reality, leading partners in that effort include the Global Fund and Gavi, where we are the major donors, so we will be participating in the collaborative effort to develop vaccines for COVID-19. I think it is also important to note that the President has made a historic--a historic 3-year pledge and is strongly supporting Gavi's COVID-19 efforts. Gavi stands for the global alliance for vaccines. It was essentially the brainchild of Bill Gates. He and Melinda, of course, in my judgment, are on an equal level with Mother Teresa for what they have done with global health. We are participating with Gavi and, like I said, the President has made a historic 3-year pledge to that. I appreciate the feelings the good Senator from Illinois has about the President of the United States, and he did indeed put the brakes on WHO because he felt there were shortcomings with WHO when it came to WHO's work with China and their failure really to get after China at the very beginning of this to do what it really should have done. I am going to object to this resolution not because the effort by the good Senator from Illinois isn't well-taken. It is well-taken. We had a similar one 2 weeks ago and they came out here and objected to it and the Senator is frustrated because he feels we should be doing more. First of all, during the 2 weeks--we obviously were gone for 1 week-- but let me tell you what was going on during that week and the subsequent week. I promised, at that time, that the Foreign Relations Committee was going to take this issue on because it is of such importance that we don't go through this again, and there is a lot more that we can do than simply pass a resolution. It is my ambition to create a very significant piece of legislation that will be bipartisan, that creates a vehicle to address a fast- moving virus like this. We can all argue about the WHO and what they did or didn't do, their connections to China and that sort of thing, but that is not going to help us as we go forward. What we do know is that WHO has done good work in the past. They were a really good partner with us, as the Senator knows, when it came to implementing PEPFAR and doing great things in the battle against AIDS. They were very helpful with Ebola and very helpful with smallpox, but this was a different virus. This was [[Page S2672]] a house on fire. WHO is simply not, at this time, geared to be a fireman. When the fire bell rings, we need a vehicle to address a virus. This is going to happen again because in the Wuhan district, there is a vast bat population, and they are carrying about 2,000 different species of virus. Unfortunately, and frighteningly, we don't know what all those viruses can do. Heaven help us if we get one out of there that is worse than COVID-19 that we have had, but we need a fire department that can address this. I hope we are going to be able to engage China. If not, we are going to have to find ways of dealing with this. Where is that vehicle going to be carried? Is it going to be a new part of WHO? Is it going to be part of the CDC? Is it going to be a new international organization? I can't answer that, but I can tell you this. On a bipartisan basis, Senator Murphy, who is also on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I have introduced a bill to address a number of these things, including the vaccine question and including working on getting a vehicle to do what I have described. I think everyone is working on this in good faith. The bill that will be introduced is written on paper. It is not written on stone. We are wide open to suggestions as to what kind of a vehicle it is that will address this like firemen and not in a slower fashion like other health challenges have presented. Senator Murphy and I have had a number of discussions on this. We are both committed to reach the goals that I know Senator Durbin and that I think this whole body wants to reach. We are going to hold a series of hearings as to how to do this, how best to do it, how it should be funded, how it should be organized, and how the management should take place. What it is not going to focus on is the finger-pointing for what happened after COVID escaped from a bat into a human being in Wuhan, China, and what happened after it left Wuhan, China, and went around the world. We have really good information on that already. There is going to be a lot of other investigations and hearings and that sort of thing. We want to talk about, what do we do when this happens in the future? How can we create an agency that just like the fire department, when the bell rings, they pull their boots on; they slide down the pole; they get on the truck; and they go put out the fire. I guarantee Senator Durbin that we will continue to work on this. My staff tells me--and I am glad to hear that Mr. Durbin's staff is working with them on the language on this particular resolution, and I thank the Senator for that and I invite him and commit to him that we will work with him as we develop this new legislation and as we go through the hearings. So, again, please don't take this as combative. It is not. It is intended, in the best spirit, to help us all move forward to get to a piece of very significant legislation that will hopefully take us forward like PEPFAR did and as some of the other monumental pieces of legislation did that can address this incredibly difficult situation and hurtful situation not only for America but for the world. And I state to the Senator that I invite your participation, encourage your participation, and assure you that we will work in good faith to try to reach these goals. With that, I object for the reasons stated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have respect for my colleague and thank him for his positive statement about the work to be done in the Foreign Relations Committee. There is nothing in this resolution that preempts or tries to impact on anything he mentioned. The operative language is a few words, ``urging renewed United States leadership and participation in any global efforts on therapeutics and vaccine development and delivery to address COVID-19 and prevent further death.'' How we do that, whether we create an agency or not, this is simply an expression of policy that I hope we can embrace. I will be back if we don't move forward with alternatives. Lives are at stake, and we should be part of the international conversation to avoid it. Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a few moments? Mr. DURBIN. Certainly. Mr. RISCH. Thank you. I appreciate these comments. There is nothing that the Senator just stated that I disagree with. One point, in passing, and I say this in the spirit of trying to get to the objective that I laid out, and that is, it is my intent to engage the second branch of government, not only the agencies that are responsible for this--Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the State Department, USAID--but also the White House. The President has to have a role here. He has obviously undertaken the role. I have already spoken to him about this. I intend to have other lengthy conversations about this. I am engaging the President to assist us. This is not a partisan issue. As Mr. Durbin has pointed out, and rightfully so, this virus doesn't care whether you are a Republican or Democrat; it doesn't care whether you are an American or not an American. It doesn't care if you are a President of the United States or, in the case of some countries around the world, a member of the highest authority there is in that country. The virus just doesn't care. In order for us to accomplish this, it is going to be a bill--it is not going to be a resolution--and it has to be approved by the second branch of government. They fully understand what we are trying to do here. They have committed their resources and their input to this, and I am convinced they are working in good faith, just as everyone here is, to try to reach these goals of doing something better in the future than what we have experienced just recently. Senator, again, thank you for your attention to this. Thank you for your input, and I commend to you that we will work together on this as we go forward The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois. Protests Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Monday, President Trump stood in the Rose Garden and called for the use of military force against individuals who have been gathering across the country protesting racism and police brutality against Black Americans. This historic call for empowering the Commander in Chief to militarize law enforcement in our Nation pushes this President's reach for new Executive authority to the most extreme level. This follows the President's tweets since last week, threatening to turn ``vicious dogs''--his words--on protesters outside the White House and quoting the racist phrase from the 1967 Miami police chief, stating: ``When the looting starts, the shooting starts,'' bringing to mind, sadly, for many, shameful moments in our Nation's struggle for civil rights. President Trump said nothing to address the anguish felt by many in this country, particularly people of color, and instead called on Governors to ``dominate the streets,'' as though the Americans, who peacefully exercise their right to protest, are an enemy force. Initially, Defense Secretary Esper went even further when he referred to cities as a ``battlespace.'' I am heartened by the fact that he has made it clear that he does not support the President's suggestion of militarizing the police forces and police across America. These calls by the President to militarize cities across America ignore that for far too long he urged law enforcement to ``dominate,'' as the President often says, rather than to protect and serve, which is exactly what is contributing to the challenge we face today. The other night, minutes before Mayor Bowser's 7 p.m curfew came into effect, the President used law enforcement personnel to use tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful demonstrators in LaFayette Square across the street from the White House. They even beat these peaceful demonstrators with batons and shields. There are conflicting reports as to whether the National Guard participated in the violence. I have made a direct inquiry to the Department of Defense, and they have denied it. According to press reports, the assault began with law enforcement kneeling, not to express any solidarity [[Page S2673]] with any racism efforts as we have seen some police officers do across the country; instead, they were kneeling to put on gas masks to protect themselves from the weapons they were readying to fire. As soon as this gathering was dispersed, the President marched across LaFayette Square to St. John's Episcopal Church. The Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff all followed--only the battle that they were witnessing was against Americans using their voices to stop racism who got in the way of a Presidential photo opportunity. I simply cannot understand what the President and each of these senior officials were thinking, if they were consciously deciding to be part of this by taking a stroll in the aftermath of the violence in Lafayette Square and whether they approved of that treatment of their fellow Americans. The Rt. Rev. Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, DC, said she was not even given a courtesy call by the White House ahead of the President's action. In fact, the bishop was outraged by the use of physical force and tear gas in the shadow of her church to remove peaceful protesters so that the church and the Bible could be used for some photo opportunity. President Trump has ``not acknowledged the agony of our country right now,'' she said in an interview. ``Everything he has said and done is to inflame violence.'' President Trump's actions violate the sanctity of our First Amendment freedoms and represent an abuse of his authority. We know this President well after more than 3 years. As shocking as Monday night's events were, they represent through and through who this President really is. It is wrong. The American people will have the last word in November, but I am encouraged to see that in my home State of Illinois officials have rejected the use of military force and are committed to American's right to protest. Governor Pritzker said the President's call to send troops to Illinois is ``illegal'' and ``ridiculous.'' Chicago Mayor Lightfoot has called to ``turn our pain into purpose'' and to ``learn from this moment and move forward together.'' In my hometown of Springfield, IL, on Tuesday, three high school students, young African-American women, sponsored a Black Lives Matter rally, and 1,000 people in Springfield, IL, gathered peacefully to demonstrate against racism in law enforcement. No windows were broken. No one was arrested. They exercised their constitutional rights, and I am damn proud of them. They speak for me and for America; that we still have the right to stand up and express ourselves, and they did so effectively. Right now those around the President should look themselves in the mirror and ask whose agenda they are serving and whether it is the right agenda for America. The collective leadership of our military, civilian and uniformed alike, needs to decide what kind of leaders they want to be for the men and women in uniform they command and what legacy they want to be associated with. Monday night was not the legacy this country deserves. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article and the statements of the Episcopal bishop of Washington be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Washington Post] Episcopal Bishop on President Trump: `Everything He Has Said and Done Is To Inflame Violence' (By Michelle Boorstein and Sarah Pulliam Bailey) The Right Rev. Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, was seething. President Trump had just visited St. John's Episcopal Church, which sits across from the White House. It was a day after a fire was set in the basement of the historic building amid protests over the death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police. Before heading to the church, where presidents have worshiped since the days of James Madison, Trump gave a speech at the White House emphasizing the importance of law and order. Federal officers then used force to clear a large crowd of peaceful demonstrators from the street between the White House and the church, apparently so Trump could make the visit. ``I am outraged,'' Budde said in a telephone interview a short time later, pausing between words to emphasize her anger as her voice slightly trembled. She said she had not been given any notice that Trump would be visiting the church and did not approve of the manner in which the area was secured for his appearance. ``I am the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and was not given even a courtesy call, that they would be clearing [the area] with tear gas so they could use one of our churches as a prop,'' Budde said. She excoriated the president for standing in front of the church--its windows boarded up with plywood--holding up a Bible, which Budde said ``declares that God is love.'' ``Everything he has said and done is to inflame violence,'' Budde of the president. ``We need moral leadership, and he's done everything to divide us.'' In a written statement, Presiding Bishop Michael Curry, head of the Episcopal denomination, accused Trump of using ``a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes.'' ``This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our country, and his action did nothing to help us or to heal us,'' Curry wrote. ``The prophet Micah taught that the Lord requires us to `do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with our God,' '' he continued, calling on Trump and others in power to be moral. ``For the sake of George Floyd, for all who have wrongly suffered, and for the sake of us all, we need leaders to help us to be `one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.' '' Budde and Curry are among the pantheon of progressive religious leaders who have long been critical of Trump's political agenda. The Episcopal Church's policies include supporting abortion rights, refugee resettlement, an expansion of health care and other issues that Trump has opposed or not embraced. According to the Pew Research Center, 49 percent of Episcopalians are Democrats or lean Democratic, compared with 39 percent of church members who are Republican or lean Republican. Trump's longtime religious allies, who are far more conservative on both domestic and foreign policy, saw his walk to St. John's much differently. ``What kind of church I need PERMISSION to attend,'' tweeted Pastor Mark Burns of South Carolina after Budde and others said Trump should have let them know he was coming. ``Jesus welcomes All.'' Johnnie Moore, a spokesman for several of Trump's evangelical religious advisers, tweeted favorably about the incident as well. ``I will never forget seeing @POTUS @realDonaldTrump slowly &amp; in-total-command walk from the @WhiteHouse across Lafayette Square to St. John's Church defying those who aim to derail our national healing by spreading fear, hate &amp; anarchy,'' he wrote. ``After just saying, `I will keep you safe.' '' Trump did not enter St. John's on Monday evening. No one associated with the church was present for his visit. Andrew Whitehead, a sociologist at Clemson University who studies Christian nationalism, said the president's appearance was an attempt to promote the idea of America as a distinctly Christian nation after his Rose Garden speech. ``Going to the church, not going in it, not meeting with any clergy, holding up a Bible, but not quoting any scripture, after an authoritarian speech, was about using the religious symbolism for his ends,'' Whitehead said. ``It was a signal to the people that embrace the idea of a Christian nation, that he will defend Christianity in the public sphere,'' Whitehead said. ``He said he'll make America safe. That raised the question, for whom? It's largely for white, mostly Protestant America.'' Budde--who spent 18 years in as a rector in Minneapolis before being elected bishop of the Washington diocese--said the Episcopal Church disassociates itself from the messages offered by the president. ``We hold the teachings of our sacred texts to be so so grounding to our lives and everything we do,'' she said. ``It is about love of neighbor and sacrificial love and justice.'' Following a tradition set by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Trump attended a service at St. John's before his swearing-in ceremony in 2017. He visited the church again that year to mark a national day of prayer for victims of Hurricane Harvey and in 2019 on St. Patrick's Day. Budde said she learned he was headed back to the yellow, 19th-century building on Monday by watching the news. ``No one knew this was happening,'' she said. ``I don't want President Trump speaking for St. John's.'' The Rev. Robert W. Fisher, the church rector, said he felt blindsided by the visit. Usually, the White House gives the church at least 30 minutes' notice before the president comes by. ``We want St. John's to be a space for grace, as a place where you can breathe,'' he said. ``Being used as a prop, it really takes away from what we're trying to do.'' Earlier in the day, Fisher said, he and other clergy were outside the church handing out water bottles and granola bars to protesters, and expressing solidarity with their cause. He said he left the area to be interviewed on television about the damage from the fire the previous night and later watched images of the protest being dismantled ``with disbelief.'' Fisher, 44, became the rector of St. John's in June 2019 and has not yet hosted a presidential visit. The church usually draws [[Page S2674]] about 400 people on a typical weekend. But it has been closed since mid-March due to the broad shutdown restrictions in place to combat the novel coronavirus. Damage to the building from Sunday night's fire and vandalism will cost at least $20,000, Fisher said. But he said the destruction should not become the focus of what has been happening in the streets outside the White House. Fisher said that when people have talked about the church being burned, he has tried to redirect them, saying it was likely one person who does not represent the majority of people protesting. ``That has pulled away from the more important message that we have to address racism in this country,'' he said. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. Protests Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise at a time of crisis. For several months now, our Nation has been dealing with two simultaneous crises: a global health pandemic that has claimed the lives of over 100,000 Americans, over 300,000 people across the globe, and an economic crisis that has cost over 40 million Americans their jobs. And in the midst of these two crises, we are now faced with yet another crisis: a crisis of anger, a crisis of racial division, flames that are pulling this country apart. This crisis was precipitated by the wrongful death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, MN. At this point, most, if not all, of us have seen that horrifying video: Mr. Floyd, in handcuffs, facedown on the pavement, incapacitated, not posing a threat to anyone, and a police officer with his knee on the neck of Mr. Floyd, pressing down hard on the neck of Mr. Floyd and keeping that knee there for 8 long minutes. Mr. Floyd begs the officer, pleads with the officer, says he can't breathe. He is in obvious and serious physical distress. Other officers are standing there, watching a defenseless, handcuffed man, pinned to the ground for 8 long minutes, with a knee pressing down on his neck. As we all know, those actions took the life of Mr. Floyd, and, rightly, following what happened, the U.S Department of Justice opened a civil rights investigation into the police officers' conduct. Also rightly, I believe, the local prosecutor opened--began--a criminal prosecution, a homicide prosecution, against the officer for his conduct. Now, anytime you have an officer-involved shooting, it is easy for people to let rhetoric get carried away. It is easy to jump to conclusions. And too many players in the political world, I think, quickly move to demonize the police officer and assume the officer is wrong in every circumstance. That is not how responsible leaders, that is not how responsible Americans should behave. We should wait to see what the facts and circumstances are. But here we have a video, and we can see what the facts and circumstances are, and there are zero legitimate law enforcement justifications for what happened to George Floyd--none. We witnessed police brutality and abuse of power, and that is why the officers are being prosecuted. Those should be propositions that bring all of us together. Watching the death of Mr. Floyd, for so many Americans, brought forth the long history in this country of racial discrimination, a history that began with centuries of slavery in America, a history that has seen Jim Crow laws, that has seen the Ku Klux Klan, that has seen overt and also implicit discrimination. Young African Americans too often fear interactions with law enforcement, fear that their rights will not be protected. Our Nation's journey toward civil rights has had many troubled stops along the way, but I, for one, agree with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that the arc of history bends toward justice. I also agree with the vision that Dr. King put forth standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, to an assembled crowd and an assembled protest, that he wanted to live in a nation where we would be judged--all of us would be judged not by the color of our skin but by the content of our character. That is a vision that has animated America on our journey toward justice, and outrage at what happened to George Floyd prompted Americans across this country to speak out, to exercise their First Amendment right to speak out for racial justice, to speak out against police brutality, to speak out against abuse of power. All of that is legitimate. All of that is protected by the Constitution. But then we saw things take an ominous turn, a dangerous turn. What, for some, was legitimate First Amendment speech, speaking out for justice, became co-opted, became taken over by violent criminal radicals. Now, let's be clear because so much of the news media does not like clarity in this regard. When I say that, I am not saying that everybody speaking is a violent criminal radical. Indeed, there are a great many people speaking out whose heart cries for justice, cries for the justice that has been the many-centuries-long journey of this country. But there are radicals who cynically took advantage of these protests to sow division, to sow fear, to engage in murder, to engage in violent assaults, to engage in looting, to engage in theft, to engage in intimidation, to engage in fear. The First Amendment protects your right to speak; the First Amendment protects your right to peaceably protest; but none of us has a right to violently assault another person. None of us has a right to murder another person. None of us has a right to burn the cars of police officers, to shatter the shop windows of shops throughout this country, to engage in acts of terror, threatening the lives of our fellow Americans. To those radicals who cynically tried to co-opt these protests, I will say their actions were profoundly racist because they were making a decision to take what should have been a unifying moment to say this will not stand in our Nation. Our law protects everyone, regardless of the color of their skin. Every American--African American, Hispanic, White, Asian American--it doesn't matter; our laws protect everyone. That should have been a unifying moment, and the cynical, violent, radical criminals decided to co-opt these protests to turn them into, in far too many instances, riots--violent riots, terrorizing their fellow citizens. George Floyd was a native Houstonian--my hometown. I love the city of Houston. George Floyd was active in his church in Houston. Next week, Mr. Floyd will be coming back to Houston for the last time to be buried in Houston. I am proud that last night, in the city of Houston, thousands came out to protest, and there wasn't violence last night; that the people of Houston demonstrated that you can speak, you can speak for racial justice, you can speak out against brutality without engaging in violence. But there has been too much violence across the country and, sadly, too many politicians who are complicit in violence, who have made the political judgment to turn a blind eye to rioters, to thugs, to murderers, to those terrorizing communities. The riots must stop. The violence must stop. The first responsibility of government is to keep people safe. Right now, in too many of our cities, government is failing in that task. Across the country, we see the lives which have been taken. To date, 6 U.S States and 13 U.S cities have declared a state of emergency because of the riots they are facing. Chicago police superintendent David Brown said that over the weekend, 132 police officers were injured, there were 48 shootings, and 699 arrests. In Las Vegas on Monday night, rioters shot a police officer who is right now on life support. Over the past 3 days, Las Vegas police officers have arrested 338 rioters. In St. Louis, four police officers were shot on Monday night. Fortunately, their wounds appear not to be life-threatening, but a beloved retired police captain, David Dorn, was shot and killed by looters at a pawn shop that same night. Mr. Dorn joined the St. Louis police force in 1969. He was a dedicated law enforcement officer for nearly 40 years. His wife and the St. Louis community are grieving his loss. Mr. Dorn was also African American. The phrase ``Black lives matter'' has become fraught with politics. It is absolutely true that Black lives matter. We should be horrified at what happened to George Floyd, but we should also be horrified at what happened to David Dorn. To those with political agendas seeking demagogue that tear this country apart, somehow David Dorn--another Black man, a different [[Page S2675]] Black man--who doesn't fit the political story they are trying to tell, disappears from their narrative. It has become politically controversial to make a statement that every life matters. How far have we gone? Our country was founded on that proposition. The Declaration of Independence tells us we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men--not some men, not just White men or White women, but all men--of every race, of every creed, of every religion--are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that, among them, are the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Now, our country has not always delivered on that promise for every American, but that is the journey we have traveled toward that vision. David Dorn's life matters. For every reporter fanning up division who doesn't stop to honor David Dorn, shame on you. His life mattered, and he didn't need to be murdered by violent looters exploiting the tensions and division. In protests Monday night in Buffalo, NY, three police officers were run over by a car, breaking a leg and shattering the pelvis of one of the officers. In New York City, almost 2,000 people have been arrested since the rioting started, and 700 people were arrested just on Monday night. At least two New York City police officers were hit by cars on Monday and nearly 50 New York Police Department officers have been injured since the protests began. In Salt Lake City, 21 police officers were injured over the weekend, including an officer who was hit in the head with a bat. On Sunday, during the riot that took place outside the White House when the historic St. John's Church was burned, when arsonists burned the church, 14 Secret Service agents were injured. In San Francisco over the weekend, at least 20 fires were set, 33 people were arrested for looting, and 2 police officers were attacked. On Friday night, David Patrick Underwood, an officer in the Department of Homeland Security, was shot and killed during protests in Oakland, CA. David Patrick Underwood, like David Dorn, was African American. George Floyd's life matters. So does David Dorn's. So does David Patrick Underwood's. No elected leader should sit idly by while David Patrick Underwood or David Dorn or George Floyd is murdered. If Black lives matter, then all Black lives matter, not just those which are politically convenient for politicians. It has been reported that at least 25 cities in the United States have seen deadly, destructive riots in the last week. According to the Claims Journal, which reports and analyzes the property claims industry, 75 businesses in Madison, WI, have been looted; 50 businesses in Seattle; 50 businesses in Pittsburgh; and 45 properties in Chicago have suffered damages. In New York City, iconic stores up and down Broadway and Fifth Avenue have been vandalized and looted. In Atlanta, everything from big-box stores to small businesses have been destroyed, looted, and damaged. In Atlanta, a Black-owned small business, a clothing store, was completely looted in the wee hours of a Saturday morning. To store owner Kris Shelby, the loss was devastating. Mr. Shelby told the New York Times that ``as a black man, and this is a black-owned business, it's just sad.'' Looting and destroying Mr. Shelby's business does not further the cause of racial justice. It is the act of a cynical, violent thief and a thief willing to be a bigoted racist on top of it. In Philadelphia over the weekend, nearly 250 businesses were burglarized, over 375 fires set ablaze. Pause and think about that number. One city, Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love--370 fires. This is wrong. This is shocking. This is horrifying. You are not exercising your First Amendment rights when you are lighting a police car on fire. You are not exercising any constitutional rights when you are burning and terrorizing and assaulting your fellow citizens. Eighteen law enforcement officers were injured in Philadelphia--some hit by Molotov cocktails, others by rocks and bricks. Ross Martinson, the owner of a small business called the Philadelphia Runner, told the Philadelphia Enquirer: ``What is left is mush'' after rioters attempted to light three fires in his store, stole clothes, stole shoes, smashed the windows, and left the store flooding from the sprinklers. In Los Angeles, the rioting and looting has brought back painful memories of the 1992 Rodney King riots that resulted in 50 deaths, thousands of arrests, and the destruction of over 1,000 businesses and buildings. One Santa Monica furniture store, the owner named Roman, told the L.A Times that over the weekend, ``we lost everything in 10 minutes.'' Roman said that 10 minutes of looting resulted in $6 million in damages. Mind you, all of this is happening after months of small businesses being on the verge of bankruptcy from the coronavirus pandemic and the economic catastrophe we are facing. Now we have local politicians saying: We are not going to let police officers protect your store. We are not going to let police officers protect your livelihood. Everything you own can be taken and destroyed by violent criminals. In New York, according to ABC7 New York, businesses, such as delis, pharmacies, beauty supply stores, were destroyed and multiple fires set in Fordham in the Bronx on Monday, while the flagship Macy's store and scores of other retail stories were burglarized, looted, damaged, in downtown Manhattan over the weekend and Monday. And throughout it all, New York police department officers are calling for the politicians to take the handcuffs off them, to let them actually protect their city and protect their fellow citizens. But too many politicians have a different agenda. If you are not willing to say that what happened to George Floyd was wrong, it was unacceptable, it was criminal, then you should get the hell out of public office. But if you are also not willing to say that what has happened to these store owners, what has happened to these police officers--the stores that have been looted, the officers who have been murdered and assaulted--if you are not willing to say that is wrong, it is criminal, it is unacceptable, and it must stop, then you need to get the hell out of public office. This ain't complicated. Protect people's lives. Protect their rights. In Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed, Tiwana Jackson, an African-American small business owner with an eyelash extension studio, told a Business of Fashion reporter that her store had been looted and vandalized during the riots. Tiwana said: ``Burning stores down, stealing things--how is that going to get justice for George Floyd?'' She continued: ``It almost took my focus away on why this whole thing started in the first place, which was racism.'' In Richmond, VA, David Waller saw the jewelry store that he runs-- that his grandfather founded in the year 1900--ransacked by rioters over the weekend. Waller and Company is one of the oldest Black-owned businesses in Richmond. How is that justice? In Washington, DC, not only was the historic St. John's Church burned--where every President we have had has worshipped--but the Lincoln Memorial was vandalized, as well as the World War II Memorial was vandalized, and the Victims of Communism Memorial was vandalized. That is not standing up for justice. The Lincoln Memorial--Abraham Lincoln led this Nation during the bloodiest war we have ever encountered, the Civil War. Six hundred thousand Americans died in the Civil War. And Abraham Lincoln's vision, restoring this country and ending the abomination of slavery--I have to say, the Lincoln Memorial is my favorite place in all of Washington to go and stand and read the words etched in stone, to read the Gettysburg Address, to read the second inaugural of the President who signed the Emancipation Proclamation, the President whose leadership through that Civil War, whose leadership to end slavery cost him his life at the hands of an assassin. Yet vandals defaced it. The U.S Park Police reported that the protests on the National Mall and at Lafayette Park across the street from the White House resulted in 51 injured U.S Park Police officers. Eleven of those injured officers had to go to [[Page S2676]] the hospital for treatment, and three had to be admitted because of their injuries. In my home State of Texas, we have seen riots in Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, and Houston, my hometown--the hometown of George Floyd. In Austin, over the weekend, protesters tried to block a highway and destroyed multiple businesses, including a gas station, a Food Mart, a hotel, a Target, a Foot Locker, and other stores and businesses. In Houston, another group of protesters closed down Highway 59, and rioters destroyed businesses and injured police officers. This must stop. There are a host of tools that can be used to stop it. The first lines of defense when it comes to violent crime are the brave men and women of our police departments who are risking their lives every night as they engage with rioters and violent criminals. Just as it is a slander to say that every protester is a violent rioter, it is also a slander--an absolute vicious lie--to paint every police officer as a racist, to paint every police officer as someone who commits abuse of power and police brutality, as we saw with George Floyd. Yes, there are some who break the law, and that is why the officers are being prosecuted. The rule of law extends to everyone. If a police officer breaks the law, he or she should be prosecuted. But when we are looking to protect our own families, when we are looking to protect our spouse, when we are looking to protect our children--the people we call on to be our first line of defense are the men and women in blue. Local officials who have decided politically that they are not going to let the police officers arrest the rioters, but they are going to release the rioters; the media that turn a blind eye and don't report on the police officers being murdered; the Hollywood celebrities who virtue signal and raise money to pay the bail for the people being arrested for violent looting--every one of them is contributing to this problem. We also have Federal resources. I have spoken with U.S attorneys in the State of Texas who are directing Federal resources. There are Federal laws on the books against rioting: 18 USC, section 2101, makes it a crime to travel in or use interstate commerce to incite a riot or participate in a riot; 18 USC, section 231, makes it a crime to ``obstruct, impede, or interfere'' with a law enforcement officer performing his or her duties ``in any way'' that affects commerce; 18 USC, section 844, makes it a crime to ``maliciously [damage] or [destroy], or [attempt] to damage or destroy, by means of fire or an explosive, any building, vehicle, or other real or personal property used in interstate or foreign commerce''; 18 USC, section 1962, the RICO statute, makes it a crime for anyone associated with an enterprise to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity where racketeering activity includes arson and robbery; 26 USC, section 5861(d) makes it a crime to possess a destructive device, which is defined in a way that includes a Molotov cocktail; and 18 USC, section 2314, makes it a crime to transport interstate or sell goods that are stolen. All of those are Federal laws that are available for Federal prosecutors, that are available to the FBI. The message that needs to come clear--loud and clear--from every elected official is if you engage in violence, if you engage in looting, if you destroy shops, if you shatter windows, if you light police cars on fire, if you commit acts of violence, if you physically assault your fellow citizens, if you physically assault police officers, if you kill your fellow citizens, if you kill police officers, you will be prosecuted. You will be prosecuted, and you will go away to jail for a very long time. There are organizations that are promoting this, that are funding this, that are coordinating this--organizations like antifa. For 2 years, I have been calling on the administration to designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. They have engaged in acts of violence all across this country. But this past week has been antifa's most shameful act. This week, the President rightly announced that antifa would be designated as a terrorist organization. That means we can use law enforcement resources to track down--if you are providing funding and organizing, you will be prosecuted. We will use the RICO laws against you, the same laws that take down drug dealers. If you are handing out bricks to young African-American men, trying to incite them to commit acts of violence, that is a criminal activity. It is also a cynical, bigoted activity. This must stop. Our first responsibility is to protect our fellow citizens, to protect their lives, to protect their safety, to protect their rights. The President has that responsibility. The Attorney General has that responsibility. Every U.S attorney in the country has that responsibility. The FBI has that responsibility. The Governors of all 50 States have that responsibility. Mayors have that responsibility. Police chiefs have that responsibility. It is time for this to stop. It is time for us to come together. And it is time for the demagogues who peddle the vision, who seek personal benefit in fanning the flames of racial animosity, to stop playing games with people's lives. If you are a Hollywood celebrity and want to make a contribution, make a contribution to a fund rebuilding the small businesses, the African-American businesses, the Hispanic businesses that have been looted and burned and destroyed. Make a contribution to a fund to the families of the police officers murdered. Don't pay to bail out the criminals assaulting those police officers, burning those African- American small businesses, looting those African-American small businesses. You are not a social justice warrior. If you are lining up, seeking accolades for your support of violent criminals who are deliberately targeting the African-American community, I will tell you right now, you are not advancing racial equality if you are supporting violent criminals who are destroying far too many African-American communities and Hispanic communities. That is not helping the problem. We need to keep America safe. We need to protect every American, regardless of race, regardless of skin color. We need to come together and keep America safe I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Loeffler). The Senator from Iowa. Coronavirus Ms. ERNST. Madam President, for months, as our Nation has confronted this pandemic together, everyone in America--every single one of us-- has been asked to make serious sacrifices, whether that has meant working overtime in a hospital caring for the afflicted, temporarily closing a family business, euthanizing hogs and cattle, or forgoing important life events like a high school prom or a college graduation. COVID-19 has brought with it very challenging times. While we have missed milestones and time together, Americans across the country have stepped up to help slow the spread of this virus and its toll on the lives of our fellow citizens. While we cannot return to life as usual just yet, we are entering a new phase. Step by step, State by State, America is safely reopening. In Iowa, Governor Kim Reynolds has led our State with a steady hand during this critical time. Under Governor Reynolds' thoughtful plan and guidance from public health officials at the local, State, and Federal level, Iowa communities and businesses are starting to safely reopen, and many activities are carefully resuming. Iowans can once again participate in America's great pastime and play golf. Places of worship are opening for services while taking smart precautions. And while they will not be as crowded as they once were, restaurants and bars are taking the first steps in opening again, as well as are places that we all grew up going to in Iowa--our amusement parks, racetracks, outdoor performance venues, movie theaters, and museums--all with important public health guidelines in mind. All of this is contingent, of course, upon having smaller groups of people and continuing to practice social distancing--simple precautions that can make a big difference. While we all yearn for life to return back to how it was a few months ago, we must be smart about taking the appropriate steps. Certainly, we want to see our elderly relatives, gather with our family and friends once again, and [[Page S2677]] return to work and school. But, folks, the pandemic is not over. Let's take this one step at a time and keep in mind that while restrictions are being loosened, they are not eliminated, and there is a good reason for that. As this process moves forward, Washington can make this transition more safe and successful. Working in partnership with the administration, State leaders, and the private sector, we can continue to increase testing and ensure those who may be infected are following proper guidelines and getting the care and information they need to limit the spread of the virus. We need to make sure our essential workers and others returning to the workforce have the personal protective equipment--the PPE--necessary to allow America to get back to work while ensuring the safety of our great workers. In addition, these frontline essential workers should absolutely be able to keep more of their hard-earned paycheck--something I am working on closely with the administration and my colleagues. Our small businesses must be protected from predatory lawsuits so that Iowa's mom-and-pop shops can continue to provide paychecks to their hard- working employees. Of course, we must continue to support our families--our moms and dads who are struggling to purchase diapers; our childcare providers and workers who have continued to look after our kids; our family caregivers who are helping Iowa seniors and those who are most at risk during this pandemic--and make sure we are prepared for whatever might come next. Let's not only focus on the immediate needs but on the long-term national priority for critical medical supplies and other materials to be produced right here in the United States of America. We should never again depend on a foreign nation to protect our citizens, especially one like the Communist Party of China, which has been continually and unsurprisingly deceptive about this threat from the very beginning. Folks, while we still have a ways to go before we can return to life as we know it, we will get through this, and when we do, we will revive the great economy we have built together and prepare for an even stronger future together. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from West Virginia. Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague from Iowa to highlight the need to responsibly reopen America and our economy as we continue to fight this COVID pandemic. Protests Mr. President, before I talk about reopening America, I would like to address a deep tragedy--the brutal death of George Floyd. It is clear that our entire country is united in horror and opposition to the violent killing. Racial discrimination has absolutely no place in this country whatsoever. This senseless murder is unacceptable, and those responsible should be held accountable. I am anguished at the death of George Floyd. I am anguished at the violence we are seeing all across our streets today. There is no question that we must do our part to change racist attitudes that, unfortunately, exist today, and this must be done in a peaceful way. Looting and violent riots are not the way to do this, and it is not the way to honor George Floyd or those who are protesting peacefully, which is the great majority of people. The other day, George's brother encouraged all of us to peacefully protest. He said that violence will not bring his brother back. No, it will not bring his brother back. It makes me sad to see businesses and monuments that honor some of our bravest heroes destroyed and violence happening in cities across the Nation. In my State of West Virginia, there have been protests. However, they have been peaceful. I commend my West Virginians for peacefully protesting, and I encourage them to continue this. Instead of violence, we need to come together as a nation, to listen to one another, and to learn from one another. This is how real change can happen. President George W. Bush and Mrs. Laura Bush published a statement yesterday, and I would like to read the last paragraph because I found it really quite moving as to how we are going to address this issue. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all. This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way--the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice. I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way. I appreciate so much the entire statement. Those last several words, as I said, really touched me. On the matter before us today, many communities in our country are beginning to open, including in my State of West Virginia. As everywhere, COVID has had a terrible impact on many of our communities all across the country. The disease has affected every part of our lives. More than 105,000 of our fellow Americans have lost their lives because of this terrible virus. That includes 78 West Virginians. The unofficial unemployment rate is 14 percent in this country, but in my State of West Virginia, it is a shade over 15 percent, and we expect those numbers to rise when the May numbers are published later this week. State and local officials across the country closed much of our economy in order to slow the disease. Our goal as a nation was to bend the curve in order to prevent our hospitals and other medical providers from being overrun. In West Virginia, as in most of the country, we have been successful in bending the curve and reducing the spread of this terrible disease. It is important, as we move now to responsibly reopening our economy, to continue to follow the guidelines that have been prepared by our public health experts--washing our hands, social distancing, avoiding touching your face, and wearing your mask. Following these guidelines will help to make America's reopening successful. It will protect your health and the health of your community. Hindering the spread of the disease while allowing businesses to remain open as they follow the guidelines will aid in our economic recovery as well. Most Americans understand there is no way to choose between public health and a strong economy because you cannot have one without the other. We can't have a strong economy if we are not protecting people from becoming sick, and we will not be able to make the necessary long- term investments in public health if we don't have a strong economy. That is why a responsible, step-by-step approach to reopening the economy that is driven by the data in States and local communities is so very important. West Virginia's cumulative percentage of positive tests now stands at 2 percent, which is less than one-fifth of the national average. As of this morning, our daily positive test percentage was 0.88 percent. This is despite the fact that West Virginia has tested a higher percentage of our residents than the national average and all of our neighboring States. Even more encouraging is that, even as we began reopening our businesses in May, our cumulative percent of positive tests has remained below 3 percent since April 25. Yet we have faced challenges. Outbreaks at our long-term care facilities in Monongalia County, Wayne County, Jackson County, and Kanawha County have resulted in 43 deaths, but do you know what? Our State responded quickly and tested every resident and every staff member in the nursing homes in our State. We were the first State in our Nation to do this and set the example that many have followed. Just last week, we had an outbreak at one of our prisons, where we had 118 positive tests. So we know that this is still there and that it still presents a danger, but I am really proud of the way we have pulled together during this crisis and addressed these challenges. The progress reflected by the statistics is only possible because our State's residents have followed the guidelines. I thank all of the medical professionals, the first responders, and the frontline workers who have gone beyond the call of duty to protect public health and keep our communities running during this most difficult time. Opening our economy is paramount, and opening it responsibly must be [[Page S2678]] done. Even though the COVID is still with us, we must continue working together and following the guidelines so we can protect both our economy and our health. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana. RESTART Act Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, last week, I traveled around the great State of Indiana on my RESTART tour. I visited small businesses up and down the State--eight cities, in fact--where we have seen so many Hoosiers adversely impacted by this pandemic. Like many other States, Indiana is starting to open up our economy, and I know so many Hoosiers welcome that. Our Governor, Eric Holcomb, has been implementing a five-stage plan for safely reopening Indiana's economy. The cities on my tour have businesses that are in various stages of reopening. Restaurants like Catablu Grille in Fort Wayne, Arni's in Lafayette, and Woody's Library in Carmel are open at 50-percent capacity right now. The nonprofit Terre Haute Children's Museum remains closed, unfortunately, and is struggling to pay its employees. I visited Zimmer Biomet Hibbard, which is a medical device company in Valparaiso. I enjoyed the tour and visiting with the employees, but I discovered that its sales had dropped 95 percent in March. Fortunately, it received a Paycheck Protection Program loan, and that enabled it to keep all 23 of its employees on the payroll. It is clear that we need to continue evaluating additional relief measures for small businesses and Indiana's nonprofits. My RESTART Act is a viable approach to help keep our hardest hit businesses and nonprofits going. The RESTART Act is a bipartisan measure I introduced with Senator Bennet. The effort here is to build upon the success of the Paycheck Protection Program. We have seen that more than 74,000 Hoosier businesses have benefited from PPP, with loans totaling nearly $9.4 billion in the State of Indiana. Just for context, that is an average loan of about $130,000. These are for small businesses like those that we see up and down our State. The Paycheck Protection Program requires funds to be spent in just 8 weeks, but most restaurants, gyms, boutiques, and so many other businesses were not permitted to be open during part or all of that 8- week period. So the first part of the RESTART Act merely extends the timeframe to 16 weeks for our Nation's hardest hit businesses. Secondly, we know that the PPP was meant to be a bridge to reopening the economy, but many small businesses have much longer bridges to cross. That is why our new RESTART Program would provide loans that would cover up to 6 months of payroll and fixed operating expenses. That is just for those businesses that have taken a substantial revenue hit during this coronavirus pandemic. My RESTART initiative would provide needed funds with the flexibility for employers to pay bills and to implement social distancing measures, like with those Plexiglas dividers I have seen at so many businesses. Most importantly, it would bring employees back to work, which is exactly where they want to be. Over the last several weeks, I have spoken to more than 22,000 Hoosiers by using Zoom teleconferencing capabilities, having conference calls, and other means. I have to say I am truly inspired by the way Hoosiers have come together to help one another during this pandemic. Everyone has done his part. Hoosiers want to work, and business owners are eager to pay them. The RESTART Act can help make sure this happens, and I hope my colleagues will give it strong consideration in the coming days I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Braun and I be allowed to complete our remarks prior to the rollcall votes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Coronavirus Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I have to say that Tennesseans are enjoying being out and about. They are so thrilled to see the restart of our economy. Whether you are going to hair salons, restaurants, shopping centers, office parks, or manufacturing facilities, what we are hearing from Tennesseans is: Thank goodness we can get back to work. They are grateful that they have had the PPP to help them bridge from the shutdown to the restart. There has been $8.8 billion that has made its way into our State through the PPP program, and our Governor, our Tennessee General Assembly, and our mayors are really working diligently to be certain that our economy opens up, that people are at work safely, and that we continue to defeat this COVID-19. Over the past few months, we have seen Congress push forward, putting about $3 trillion into the economy for a restart, and State and local governments have already put over $139 billion worth of aid to good use by supporting local healthcare, helping to rescue businesses, and keeping companies working and local payrolls going--keeping people on the job. Our Governor and general assembly in Tennessee have just announced a new program that they are doing in conjunction with local businesses. Now, imagine for a moment what it was like to watch the economy tumble from the perspective of a community that was already struggling and trying to make ends meet. The pandemic caused catastrophic damage to the traditional economy and also to many of the service organizations that were there to meet needs. In Tennessee, as in many States, struggling communities depend on these nonprofit groups. This is why we fought so hard to include eligibility for nonprofits in the rescue funding packages. I will tell you that this is making a difference in Tennessee for some of our nonprofit organizations, like the East Tennessee-based Appalachia Service Project. ASP teams travel throughout Central Appalachia. They repair homes for low-income families. Mayors in the communities that ASP visit are running on tight budgets, and they depend on volunteers to fix up unsafe or uninhabitable homes. You can only imagine how it felt to the people at ASP to watch their funding evaporate, knowing that the leaky roof that needed attention over in Sneedville would end up turning into a rotten floor and a moldy wall and would be a safety hazard for the individuals who lived there. Fortunately, ASP was able to get an SBA loan that gave it a little bit of breathing room. Although it has had to cancel its volunteer program, its essential staff and contractors will be able to continue working all through the summer. The various rescue programs that Congress agreed to implement were not perfect by any means, but did they have a positive effect? From what we are hearing in Tennessee, they did, and they have been put to good use. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana. Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I am a Main Street entrepreneur. I have spent my career building a little business into a large one over many years in my hometown. My wife, as well, has operated a home accessory and gift store on Main Street, literally. I am elated to see the American economy starting to get off to a smart restart. I addressed, in a couple of floor speeches before we left in March, the question of how to reopen our economy. I believe businesses are disciplined and ready to pay attention to the rules--the new normal--to make sure their employees and their customers stay safe. Business owners will follow the rules. It is in their own best interests to do so. They have much to lose from a new spike in the coronavirus. Businesses are always more adept, more agile than government, and I am heartened to see the innovative approaches many businesses are taking across our country to address this challenge. The virus does not affect all populations, industries, and areas of our country in the same way. So, naturally, the reopening in Indianapolis will be different from that on Main Street in Jasper, IN. We should remember that although this presents challenges, a one- size-fits-all is rarely the best policy course of action, and decisions that affect citizens are best made by the level of government closest to them--mayors, [[Page S2679]] town councils, and State governments. We cannot use the blanket approach the government took in shutting down the economy to reopen it. Instead, we need to provide the tools to empower local leaders and businesses who know their communities best to reopen safely so that our country can function again. I believe that through the perseverance and innovation that American business has always exhibited, we can get our economy back on the path to recent heights without yielding back any territory to the virus. I yield the floor. Vote on Anderson Nomination The PRESIDING OFFICER. All postcloture time has expired. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Anderson nomination? Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith), and the Senator from Montana (Mr. Tester) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 78, nays 17, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 109 Ex.] YEAS--78 Alexander Barrasso Bennet Blackburn Blunt Boozman Braun Brown Burr Capito Carper Casey Cassidy Collins Coons Cornyn Cortez Masto Cotton Cramer Crapo Cruz Daines Duckworth Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Gardner Graham Grassley Hassan Hawley Hirono Hoeven Hyde-Smith Inhofe Johnson Jones Kaine Kennedy King Lankford Leahy Lee Loeffler Manchin McConnell McSally Menendez Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Peters Portman Reed Risch Roberts Romney Rosen Rounds Rubio Sasse Scott (FL) Scott (SC) Shaheen Shelby Sinema Stabenow Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Warner Whitehouse Wicker Young NAYS--17 Baldwin Blumenthal Booker Cantwell Cardin Gillibrand Harris Heinrich Klobuchar Merkley Murphy Murray Schumer Udall Van Hollen Warren Wyden NOT VOTING--5 Markey Sanders Schatz Smith Tester The nomination was confirmed The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Here, he explains why his firm has allied with several InsurTech firms and made significant investments in technological advancements. Key to his vision for the future is an ecosystem in which carriers seamlessly interact with customers-including agents and brokers-and with numerous third parties to better understand risks and provide superior experiences and service anywhere and at any time.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As smart carriers continue to leverage cognitive and digital computing technologies to better understand, mitigate and absorb customers' property and casualty risks, the insurance industry is primed for transformative changes.</p><p>Absent this metamorphosis, however, the industry confronts a threat given the expressed intent of major technology companies to carve inroads into the property and casualty insurance market. To maintain customer share, carriers must do what large tech firms are planning to do-only better.</p><p>As insurers pursue this goal, startups in the growing InsurTech sector also promote innovation, disrupting traditional insurance norms and practices. These companies are undertaking parallel research into the use of artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, telematics, machine learning, image recognition software, robotics processing automation and other tools to enhance operating efficiency and forge closer connections with customers. Carriers that stay on top of these innovations will enjoy a competitive edge, while those that maintain the status quo and do little-or nothing-will fall by the wayside.</p><p>That is a provocative prediction, of course. But studies affirm that embracing change is critical for insurers to preserve their value as the industry trails behind the broader financial services sector in providing customers with technology-based, personalized experiences. For instance, a stated that \"[n]on-life insurers are struggling to engage with customers.\"</p><p>want the ability to use web-based solutions-i.e., an app-to compare insurance pricing, buy policies, receive risk management advice, and file and review claims, according to the PwC report. The repercussions for not responding to these interests are serious. Consultancy EY's cites such rapidly shifting customer expectations as \"hindering the business of less agile insurers.\"</p><p>The industry at large is starting to make strides, introducing fully mobile and frictionless app-based customer-facing technology. For example, at QBE North America, we recently partnered with an innovative technology company to launch a customer conversation platform easily connecting people with their insurance companies on any mobile device. (Editor's Note: The author declined to disclose the identity of the InsurTech.) The solution combines intelligent messaging and human touch to offer a frictionless customer experience.</p><p>Other carriers are undertaking similar technological enhancements, as are large technology companies and InsurTech startups. Customers are likely to be interested in their wares. According to , nearly one-third of insurance customers would consider buying insurance from a big tech firm. Many InsurTech startups, on the other hand, have had no trouble attracting both interest and capital to refine their innovations into novel insurance solutions. We are all in a race to develop the best technology solutions first.</p><p>A Team Effort</p><p>As new competitors take on traditional industry players, EY has offered smart advice to carriers, urging insurers to relinquish their traditional role of \"just being a capital supplier\" and transform into \"owning the relationship\" with customers. To achieve this state, carriers must align their strategies with the innovations coming out of the InsurTech sector. The good news is that many tech startups are eager to collaborate with insurers to help strengthen the value chain-from sales and distribution through underwriting, pricing and claims administration.</p><p>While insurers have made progress implementing technology to make operations leaner and more efficient, there are equally exciting opportunities to deploy tools that enhance the customer experience. Paramount in these aims is the development of a digital ecosystem, in which insurers seamlessly interact and transact with customers, partners such as brokers and numerous other third parties on any mobile device, anywhere and at any time.</p><p>Certainly, more customers are looking for insurers to be technologically savvy and equipped. They want to do business with carriers able to connect with them in the ways in which they are accustomed-real-time, frictionless chatbots, social messaging, texts and apps.</p><p>The opportunities to build a more future-focused industry are endless. Imagine an ecosystem in which data from image recognition software reduces the time it takes to underwrite property risks or quickly settle a claim? Or cameras equipped with telematics on board a truck that can detect evidence of driver weariness to reduce the risk of an accident? Or a range of sensors in a smart home connected to the Internet that can spot a moisture problem before it results in mold contamination? Or a data analytics tool that can ferret out possible evidence of workers compensation fraud in one-tenth the time it takes human beings to unearth these crimes?</p><p>In our increasingly interconnected world, a digital ecosystem is imperative for another reason. Insurers, brokers, customers and third-party organizations like claims administrators, weather bureaus, smart-home appliance makers, news organizations, government agencies and regulators, among many others, can gather in a trusted environment to share their data. Routine insurance interactions and transactions that take days or weeks to commence and conclude can occur on such a platform in near real time.</p><p>Here's an example of what this might look like: Say a commercial truck is in a collision. Sensors on board the vehicle detect the accident and instantly send this data over the Internet to the insurer, agent and claims adjuster, as well as other parties in the ecosystem, such as law enforcement, a tow truck operator and a partnering repair shop. Armed with the insurer's app, the driver takes photographs of the damage and the accident scene, triggering the first notice of loss claims process. The onboard cameras simultaneously upload images of the events leading up to the accident. Claims can be paid within minutes.</p><p>This is the sophisticated service that many customers want from their insurance carriers. They also want greater choice when it comes to buying insurance policies, with coverages tailored and priced to their specific needs. Successful carriers can achieve these aims by partnering with customers in using technology to better understand their risks and provide superior experiences and service, as opposed to just providing stellar coverage.</p><p>This is tomorrow's insurance industry from the vantage of today. The best carriers will embrace the technological output of the InsurTech sector at an increased pace. The reason is clear: One cannot win without innovation. Toward this end, we've allied with several InsurTech firms and made significant investments in our own technological advancements, implementing customized solutions into our processes to provide customer experiences in line with their expectations. And we continue to see technology as an enabler of future growth and prosperity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRMNGT-cm194526</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRMNGT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC2-DFT1-DY07-D210-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465779</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1242\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Wells Media Group, Inc.

The alliance called the Center for Humane Technology seeks to spread awareness of its campaign calledThe Truth About Techamong students, parents, and teachers from a large swath of public schools across the United States. </p><p>The coalition will carry out the initiative in partnership with theCommon Sense Media, anonprofit media watchdog organization which will donate $7 million to fund the campaign. The goal of the campaign is to tell the intended audience about the harmful effects of social media and the internet as a whole on the overall well-being of a person. Also, astudy conducted by Jean M. Twenge, a San Diego State University professor with a major in psychology, recently revealed thatexcessive screen time[3] is causing a lower level of happiness among teenagers who spend more time on digital activities such as chatting, gaming, social networking, and texting than among young users who invest more of their time in physical interactions, sports, and reading print materials.On top of the ad campaign, both groups also plan to advance a lobbying effort intended to fight tech addiction. It is perhaps worth noting that Common Sense Media is backed byComcast and DIRECTV, among other partners, with$50 million in donated media and airtime. As part of efforts to reform the tech landscape, the coalition intends to launch a website calledLedger of Harms, whose objective is to educate tech professionals about the pros and cons of the products big tech firms ask them to create. The website will feature content that will tackle the impact of a wide variety of technologies on an individual's health as well as a guide on how to build healthy tech solutions. On the regulatory front, theCenter for Humane Technology andCommon Sense Media will initially support two bills, including the one authored by Senator Edward J. Markey which seeks to fund research on the effects of technology on children's health, as well as another legislation introduced by Senator Bob Hertzberg with the goal of making unidentified digital bots unlawful.

The <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/tag/department-of-justice/\">Department of Justice</url> revelation Monday of its plan to roll back decades-old regulations governing studios and movie theaters pushed beleaguered exhibition stocks higher Tuesday as investors saw the upside of the move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/tag/wall-street/\">Wall Street</url>, shares in AMC Entertainment, the No. 1 theater owner, gained 6% in the first part of the trading day before returning to near break-even and closing at $8.48, up a fraction. Cinemark also rose a fraction to $34.31; and Imax - not in most respects an exhibitor, but seen as a proxy for theater chains - climbed 3% to $21.51. On the London Stock Exchange, Regal Cinemas owner Cineworld added more than 4% to finish at $199.25. Regal, AMC and Cinemark together control roughly half of the 40,000 screens in the U.S.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/tag/makan-delrahim/\">Makan Delrahim</url>, head of the DOJ's antitrust division,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/2019/11/justice-department-paramount-consent-decrees-1202789185/\">outlined his thinking</url> on the Paramount decree of 1948 in a speech to the American Bar Association in Washington. He said the rules have become antiquated, with the theatrical window less prominent than it was when the rules were established decades ago, before megaplexes, streaming and Big Tech. Delrahim's regulatory team will be moving to undo the decree in the coming days, incorporating a two-year \"sunset period.\"</p><p>The National Association of Theater Owners fears independent theaters could suffer from the change, but Wall Street analysts view the rollback as fundamentally good news for major chains. While the original decision in 1948 separated studios from theaters, it's not the case that they would automatically be drawn back together in the absence of rules preventing joint ownership of distribution and exhibition assets. Nevertheless, the mere existence of new options for theaters is a positive in the view of Wall Street.</p><p>AMC shares have fallen to a multi-year low in recent weeks as it and other major circuits have faced new threats from streaming services. The official stance of theater owners is that streaming is actually good for business, with data indicating heavy streaming consumers are also frequent movie ticket buyers. AMC recently launched its own on-demand streaming service for home and mobile movie rentals.</p><p>But deep-pocketed tech companies - notably Netflix, Amazon and Apple - have been taking aim at the traditional movie window. Netflix in particular has gone on a movie offensive of late, releasing The Irishman, Marriage Story and other titles in limited theatrical runs. The streaming giant negotiated unsuccessfully for theatrical engagements shorter than the typical 11-week window. As it has battled for its place in the box-office picture, Netflix has also taken control of the Egyptian Theater on Hollywood Boulvard and is in talks for a long-term lease of the Paris Theater in New York.</p><p>After decades of withstanding innovations such as television, video tape and the internet, movie theaters remain vulnerable. Even if they don't combine with studios, finding new ownership configurations could help circuits stay financially viable.</p><p>\"Although we would not anticipate that acquiring a theater circuit would be on the top of the strategy road maps for the major film studios - especially with the increasing focus on the growth opportunities and recurring revenue potential of streaming subscriptions - we cannot completely rule out the possibility of this driving additional industry consolidation,\" B. Riley's Eric Wold wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>Eric Handler of MKM Partners, told Deadline he was a bit more circumspect about the notion of M&amp;A activity resulting from the DOJ move. \"The Paramount decree is outdated,\" he said, but \"I don't think much will change if the regulations are eliminated.

SPECIAL REPORT is up next. Hey -- Bret.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR: Hey -- Kimberly. Thank you.</p><p>President Trump kicks out dozens of Russians. As this continues -- the Russian situation over the British spy poisoning incident, the Kremlin vows to retaliate.</p><p>The fallout over the Stormy Daniels interview as the porn stars attorney says there is more evidence to come.</p><p>And the stock market soars with the Dow having the biggest point gain since 2008.</p><p>This is SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>Good evening. I'm Bret Baier.</p><p>The U.S. and more than a dozen European nations are expelling more than 100 Russian diplomats/intelligence officers/spies tonight in a unified show of condemnation over the poisoning of a former Russian spy earlier this month in England. The Kremlin which has steadfastly denied involvement says it will proceed from a principle of reciprocity.</p><p>Correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight from the White House. Good evening -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening there -- Bret.</p><p>This wave of expulsions comes after officials both in the U.S. and in Europe pointed to strong evidence that suggested, they say, that the Russians were behind that deadly, certainly dangerous, nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy on British soil. And that, they say, was the solid basis for further action.</p><p>In expelling 60 Russian diplomats the U.S. joined governments across the globe in punishing the Kremlin for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy on British soil, an action the White House today called brazen and reckless.</p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: We think that this is not just an important message to send to the Russian government but it's also, you know, significant in degrading their intelligence capabilities around the world, not just in the United States.</p><p>Along with the U.S., more than a dozen European Union countries, Ukraine, and Canada all took action affecting more than 100 individuals in the biggest western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War.</p><p>British Prime Minister Theresa May called the international response the clearest indication yet of world solidarity against Moscow.</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: It is part of a pattern of increasingly aggressive Russian behavior. But also represents the new and dangerous phase in Russia's hostile activity against Europe and our shared values and interests.</p><p>CORKE: Kremlin officials have denied being behind the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. But they remain in critical condition.</p><p>Also today, the White House announced the closure of a Russian facility in Seattle, just the latest in a series of actions directed toward the Kremlin by the Trump administration countering a frequent narrative from critics who often accuse Mr. Trump of being soft on Moscow.</p><p>The President previously ordered a cruise missile attack against Syria's Bashar al-Assad. He expanded sanctions on Moscow, gave lethal aid to neighboring Ukraine, sent troops into Poland over Russian objections and expanded oil exports into eastern Europe -- a crucial Russian economic market.</p><p>ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. (through translator): What the United States of America do today is they are destroying the little that is left from the Russian-American relations. The United States is wholly responsible for the destruction of Russian-American relations.</p><p>JON HUNTSMAN, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: The bonds between our people remain strong. The United States is ready to cooperate and forge a better relationship between our two countries. But that will only be possible when Russia chooses to become a more responsible partner.</p><p>CORKE: Joel Rosenberg, author of the bestselling book \"the Kremlin Conspiracy\" warns the latest moves by the White House are only a solid first step.</p><p>JOEL ROSENBERG, AUTHOR: President Trump has to do much more. He needs to toughen up economic sanctions and really hit Putin's money, the oligarchs' money. And he needs to start putting more deterrent forces in Europe close to Russia's border.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE: Very interesting conversation there. By the way, Bret, we also heard from the Russian Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Paskov. He says that his country would be guided by the principle of reciprocity in reaction to what happened today, which is a not-so-subtle way of saying that dozens of American diplomats could soon be making their way home -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Kevin Corke, live on the north lawn. Kevin -- thank you.</p><p>Let's talk about the effects of the diplomatic expulsions. Senior political analyst Brit Hume is here with us tonight.</p><p>Good evening -- Brit. Your thoughts on this and what it means.</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, this is another example of, I think a key lesson that people need to learn about the Trump administration which is that what the President says and what he does are frequently very different indeed.</p><p>All those things that Kevin just ticked off that the President has done undermine Russian interests in many ways. Indeed our whole energy policy undermines Russian interest because it holds oil prices down and the Russian economy really is built on that. It has been described, as you know Bret, as a gas station with nuclear weapons.</p><p>So that's but one example.</p><p>These expulsions today are another. You know, that follows the closing of the consulate in San Francisco earlier still. And meanwhile, of course, the President is calling Putin on the phone to congratulate him on his victory. And in many ways he's acting as if he's got a deep hunch that he and Vladimir Putin are going to compose their relationship and have a real cooperative arrangement.</p><p>But the actions he has taken do not indicate that he is pursuing that, at least in terms of what he is doing. So this is one example.</p><p>There are many others. But that is something that we need to keep an eye on. Watch what he does, not so much what he says.</p><p>BAIER: Yes. As you said, the critics are very loud and boisterous that the President is not saying the right things and that he is not communicating the message publicly. But yet the list of things we just saw in Kevin's piece obviously is action.</p><p>HUME: Yes. And look at another area here. The President comes out and says, you know, trade wars are easy to win. And he imposes these sanctions on steel and aluminum. And the next thing you know, of course, he's exempting allies right and left from that. And now despite the fact that there is supposed to be in effect with China we learned today, and the stock market certainly noticed today, that negotiations are now underway to work something out with China.</p><p>Again a case of saying one thing and the actions tend to point in another direction, proving that as in so many instances, the President's bark is worse than his bite.</p><p>BAIER: Where do you think this goes with Russia? Do you think, Brit, this is the beginning of another Cold War in essence?</p><p>HUME: Well, I think that, you know, relations are pretty tense. And I think it's almost certainly true that there will be expulsions of Americans or other measures taken by Russia to respond to this.</p><p>But the question then becomes, all right, once that's done, what is the message that Vladimir Putin takes away from these actions? I think he will probably take away the notion that President Trump, while he would like to have a good relationship with him, is not really going to be pushed around and that could lead in a positive direction.</p><p>Putin is a hard-eyed man who I think understands actions do obviously speak louder than words. And there may be a chance after this settles down a little bit to forge a more cooperative relationship that would have to be based on Russian behavior.</p><p>And as the analyst that you quoted in the earlier piece noted, there are still further actions the U.S. could take that are well short of any military action or I think, you know, truly, deeply belligerent that would make a difference in Russia. So we will see but we've got a long way to go here.</p><p>BAIER: Brit -- as always, thank you.</p><p>HUME: You bet -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Do you agree with the expulsion of the Russian diplomats? Let us know. Do you think the Trump administration has been strong enough when it comes to Russia? Let me know on Twitter @BretBaier, you can use the #SpecialReport; or on Facebook at facebook.com/BretBaierSR.</p><p>Back here at home, stocks surged today on Wall Street. The Dow jumped 669 -- that is its biggest one-day point gain in ten years. The S&amp;P 500 was up 70. The Nasdaq finished ahead 228. It is the best day in 17 years.</p><p>Let's talk about that. Where the market is today, why, and maybe where it's going.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton of the Fox Business Network joins us from New York. Good evening -- Deirdre, big day.</p><p>DEIDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Good evening -- Bret, it certainly is.</p><p>So today's high highs make up about half of last week's low lows. You said it -- the Dow posting its biggest one-day point gain in about a decade, so more than 650 points up, and all three indices logging their biggest rally since August 2015.</p><p>So investors saw evidence of trade solutions instead of a trade war and that helped sentiment.</p><p>ON Sunday U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has said the administration was quote, \"working on a pathway to see if we, the U.S. can reach an agreement as to what fair trade is for them, meaning China. So it seems as if U.S. officials are meeting with Chinese officials behind closed doors, away from the press, quietly seeking trade agreements and a completely different tone to what we had last week which was angry public rhetoric on both sides.</p><p>So tech stocks closed higher today as well. That also helped overall sentiment. Even Facebook closed slightly higher after losing about 10 percent in the past five trading days.</p><p>So Facebook has a tough road ahead though. For the second time since 2011, the FTC is investigating the company's privacy practices. The Senate Judiciary Committee also inviting, but that means they probably can't say no, the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, and Google to testify in D.C. on April 10. So more to come on privacy, big tech, and potential regulations.</p><p>In the meantime, Bret -- back to you.</p><p>BAIER: All right. Deirdre - -thank you.</p><p>The chief law enforcement officers for 37 states and territories are demanding to know when Facebook learned of a huge breach of privacy protections. Meanwhile the social media site is going old school, using newspapers, of all things, to try to express its sorrow and commitment to change.</p><p>National correspondent William La Jeunesse reports tonight from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data.</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That statement by CEO Mark Zuckerberg carries new meaning today with the announcement on the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into the social media giant.</p><p>SAM LESTER, ELECTRONIC PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER: Facebook represented to its users that it had certain privacy protections in place when in fact, it didn't.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: In 2011, Facebook agreed with an FTC mandate to obtain user permission before sharing personal data with third-party apps. Critics say the company repeatedly violated that and the watchdog until now has shown no teeth.</p><p>LESTER: If Facebook had complied with this consent order and if the FTC had done its job and enforced it, then this whole mess with Cambridge Analytica never would have happened.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: This weekend, Zuckerberg apologized in a full-page ad though polls show many users already lost trust.</p><p>SATITA (PH), UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: This isn't really a personal issue of personal apology. It's really about public policy, consumer harm, consumer protection.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Last week the House Energy and Commerce Committee asked Zuckerberg to testify on Capitol Hill. Today Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley did as well in a data privacy hearing scheduled for April 10.</p><p>SENATOR MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA: I think Mr. Zuckerberg needs to come and testify before Congress, not just put an advertisement in the newspaper.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Any inquiry will also involve Cambridge Analytica which according to the \"Washington Post\" allowed dozens of foreign nationals to work in 2014 U.S. election campaigns in violation of U.S. law.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: And the latest controversy for Facebook, an allegation that it kept logs of phone calls and texts of Android users using the Facebook messenger without their explicit consent. The company claims by simply signing up, users opted in -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: William -- thank you.</p><p>The President does not believe anyone threatened adult movie actress Stormy Daniels who alleges a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. That came from the President's spokesman this afternoon after last nights interview with Daniels on \"60 Minutes\". The President's lawyers demanding an apology for the implication he might have been involved.</p><p>Tonight Fox News media analyst and host of Fox's \"MEDIA BUZZ\" Howard Kurtz has a recap of the Stormy Daniels interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STORMY DANIELS, DONALD TRUMP ACCUSER: This is not a \"me too\". I was not a victim. I've never said I was a victim</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST: Stormy Daniels, as expected, told CBS' Anderson Cooper that she had a one-time sexual encounter with Donald Trump a dozen years ago.</p><p>But some journalists are saying today that the porn actress failed to prove her other allegations and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, drew criticism on the morning shows including \"The View\" for overhyping the \"60 Minutes\" appearance.</p><p>Avenatti had tweeted a picture of a CD, implying his client might have photos or texts involving Trump but she refused to discuss that on CBS.</p><p>Daniels said that back in 2011 when she was going to tell her tale to a magazine, a man confronted her in a parking lot and told her to leave Trump alone and forget the story.</p><p>DANIELS: And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said that's a beautiful little girl. It would be a shame if something happened to her mom.</p><p>KURTZ: But Daniels says she can't identify the man and didn't go the police making the account impossible for others to verify.</p><p>Daniels said she accepted a $130,000 nondisclosure deal from Trump attorney Michael Cohen because she didn't want the story to come out. And she said she later felt pressured, as recently as January, into releasing statements denying any affair.</p><p>DANIELS: As a matter of fact, the exact sentence used was \"They can make your life hell in many different ways.\"</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: \"They\" being --</p><p>DANIELS: I'm not exactly sure who \"they\" were. I believed it to be Michael Cohen.</p><p>KURTZ: That speculation led Cohen to strongly deny any involvement in any pressure and his lawyer to send her a cease-and-desist letter.</p><p>And today -- a White House denial.</p><p>SHAH: He's denied the accusations that she made last night and has been consistent in doing so. She is not.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ: And late today in California, Stormy Daniels' attorney expanded her legal complaint to include (ph) presidential attorney Michael Cohen of defamation.</p><p>\"60 Minutes\" scored its biggest ratings in a decade. And the Daniels suit and litigation by other accusers might lead to legal complications for the President. But in the court of public opinion, the Stormy sit-down didn't seem to move the needle -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Howie -- thank you.</p><p>Up next, is the U.S. being drawn in further to the Yemen civil war? We will take a look there.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 40 in Sacramento where the family of an unarmed African-American man shot 20 times by police is calling for an independent investigation of his death. Twenty-two-year-old Stephon Clark was killed in the backyard of his grandparents' home last week. Police say they thought the cell phone he was holding was a gun. Clark's grandmother asked why officers did not use a taser or other nonlethal force.</p><p>WDRB in Louisville as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will try to bring hemp production back into the mainstream. The Kentucky senator says he will introduce legislation to legalize hemp as an agricultural commodity. Kentucky is one of several states using hemp for research.</p><p>And this is a live look at Orlando from Fox 35, our affiliate there. The big story there tonight, lawyers for the wife of the Pulse Nightclub shooter asked for a mistrial after learning her father's -- her husband's father rather, was an informant for the FBI for 11 years. The judge denied the ruling late this afternoon. Noor Salman is accused of aiding her husband in the attack that killed 49 people in June of 2016. Her attorneys say the information about her father-in-law should have been disclosed earlier.</p><p>That is tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: This is a Fox News alert.</p><p>A senior U.S. Defense official confirms to Fox News federal agents have found several suspicious packages delivered to military locations in the Washington area. The official says the destinations include Fort Belvoir, Fort McNair, and the Dahlgren Naval Service Warfare Center. One of those packages reportedly tested positive for black powder and residue. The packages are being examined at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia.</p><p>We will bring you any late breaking details.</p><p>There are reports tonight a high level North Korean official is in Beijing. Bloomberg, citing three sources, has even said it is North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. There has been no confirmation of this at this hour, including from the White House. Kim Jong-un has not made an international trip since taking power in 2011 in North Korea.</p><p>There is considerable confusion tonight about just how effective Saudi Arabia's U.S.-supplied missile defense system has been against rocket attacks from Shiite rebels in Yemen.</p><p>Correspondent Conor Powell is watching that story from our Middle East newsroom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CONOR POWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yemen's Houthi rebels celebrating as they fired a barrage of missiles into Saudi Arabia. At least three made it as far as Riyadh, the Kingdom's capital. One person was killed and two injured.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At 11:00 p.m., we woke up to a loud sound. We rushed and ran out of the room as the explosion took place over the house.</p><p>POWELL: Saudi state TV claimed all the missiles were intercepted but this video shows a U.S.-made Patriot antimissile changing course in midair and crashing.</p><p>Last night's attack comes on the third anniversary of the Saudi-led coalition launching military operations against the Houthis in what many see as a proxy fight between Tehran and Riyadh. The State Department condemned the attack, saying \"We support the right of our Saudi partners to defend their borders against these threats.\"</p><p>The conflict in Yemen though is turning into a humanitarian disaster with more than 10,000 people dead and eight million now on the verge of starvation.</p><p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is in the U.S. trying to shore up support for the war. America is a major arms supplier to Saudi Arabia. And the Pentagon has advisors in Riyadh. But there are growing concerns on Capitol Hill about America's participation in the conflict.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POWELL: A bipartisan congressional effort to remove U.S. forces from the conflict in Yemen was recently defeated, and President Trump has developed a close working relationship with the Saudi Crown Prince with an eye towards ramping up the pressure on Iran -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Conor Powell in our Middle East newsroom. Conor -- thank you.</p><p>Two al Qaeda militants have been killed in the first U.S. drone strike in Libya against the terror group. The U.S. African command says no civilians were hurt in the city of Ubari located in the Sahara desert. The Pentagon says al Qaeda has used southern Libya as a staging point for operations for some time.</p><p>Back here in the U.S., gun maker Remington is filing for bankruptcy protection. The company makes the Bushmaster AR-15 style rifle that was used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. AR-15 style rifles have been used in other mass shootings like the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida as well as the Las Vegas massacre. Remington has faced falling sales and lawsuits tied to that massacre since 2012.</p><p>Over the weekend, survivors of the school shootings in Parkland, Florida, led a nationwide effort to promote gun control. The epicenter of the movement was Washington, D.C., but the effects could be felt all over.</p><p>Correspondent Garrett Tenney looks at what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GARRET TENNEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets this past weekend to protest gun violence. Organizers of the student-led March for Our lives rallies are calling it the start of a movement and a wake-up call for Congress ahead of this year's midterm elections.</p><p>DELANEY TARR, DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR: UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The pressure is on for every person in power, and it will stay that way because they know what is coming. They know that if there is no assault weapons ban passed then we will vote them out.</p><p>TENNEY: The latest Fox News poll found overwhelming support for specific gun-control measures, including 91 percent of voters who are in favor of universal background checks on all gun buyers; 72 percent support raising the minimum age to buy a gun to 21; and 60 percent in favor of banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the motion is adopted --</p><p>TENNEY: Congress did include several reforms in its $1.3 trillion spending bill last week. Strengthening background checks and providing funding for school safety measures. But activists argue those measures aren't enough and Democrats are hoping that frustration will help them in November.</p><p>SENATOR TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA: The activism in these young people is actually changing the equation.</p><p>TENNEY: Gun control will be a complicated issue for Democrats particularly in the Senate where they're defending seats in states like West Virginia, North Dakota, Missouri, and Indiana where there is strong support for the Second Amendment.</p><p>GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM: They have to be careful about embracing gun control on a national level when there are going to be states and districts that are not going to go for that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TENNEY: Retaking the House won't be easy for Democrats either though. The latest Fox News poll found a tightening race in voters' candidate preferences with 46 percent saying that they back the Democratic candidate in their district compared to 41 for the Republican. That is a very different picture from October though when Democrats were up by 15 -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Garrett -- thank you.</p><p>Keeping first responders safe during school shootings and other incidents is becoming a focus for law enforcement.</p><p>Tonight correspondent Laura Ingle shows us how medical personnel and law enforcement are learning to work together.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Trying to save lives while protecting your own.</p><p>This is rescue task force training as close to a real-life active shooter incident as it gets.</p><p>This drill being run by the National Center for Security and Preparedness is using local EMS and law enforcement agencies in Poughkeepsie, New York. The goal of this training is to bring rapid triage to victims under the protection of armed officers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have to stop the killing and we also have to stop the dying.</p><p>INGLE: Paramedics learning the language and timed movements of armed entry has been going on nationwide for years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think I hear gunshots.</p><p>INGLE: And recent shootings like Parkland, Florida, some paramedics reported being frustrated when they were held back until a scene is declared safe or a cold zone. A hot zone is when a shooter can directly fire at you. And these teams say a lot of good work can be done in the warm zone when police are present and the danger level has dropped.</p><p>SGT. PATRICK BARRY, POUGHKEEPSIE, NEW YORK: That's why we call in a warm zone, you know, it's not totally, let's say, a safe environment. We are still on guard.</p><p>CHRIS STRATHAM, NATIONAL CENTER FOR SECURITY AND PREPAREDNESS: I need the police officers focused on the threat and the medics focused on the medicine.</p><p>INGLE: Both the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA have issued guidelines for active shooter incidents but there is not a federal mandate on how agencies should work in tandem. With more active shooter situations unfolding across the U.S., some agencies are ramping up their own training so that victims aren't waiting any longer than they have to.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>INGLE: Those who run rescue task force training say these drills will keep evolving as paramedics and law enforcement continue to learn to work together to save lives -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Laura -- thank you.</p><p>Does President Trump have any chance of resurrecting the line item veto? We will look at that next.</p><p>But first, the woman behind the Supreme Court case that ended school segregation in the U.S. has died. Linda Brown was a little girl in Topeka when she became the center of the 1954 Brown versus Board of Education landmark decision. Linda Brown -- dead at the age of 76.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: An unusual coalition is putting pressure on Senate Democrats to move ahead with one of President Trump's most high- profile ambassador nominations. It involves longtime U.N. spokesman Rick Grenell who is gay, a Republican, and supports the president. Correspondent Rich Edson looks at the battle from the State Department.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: More than a year into the Trump administration, senior positions at the State Department and high profile ambassador posts remain vacant. Though last week as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to initiate a vote on the president's choice as ambassador to Germany, Rick Grenell, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley objective.</p><p>SEN. JEFF MERKLEY, (D) OREGON: I cannot in good faith support a nominee who has a lengthy track record of tweets attacking both prominent Democratic and prominent Republican women.</p><p>EDSON: Grenell has since apologized for tweets and comments he said were intended to be funny and he says he regrets it. In October the Senate Foreign Relations Committee cleared his nomination.</p><p>CHRISTIAN WHITON, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: It's a surreal environment up there were the people who profess to care the most about diplomacy, often Democrats, are holding up the most qualified would-be diplomats.</p><p>EDSON: Republicans also point out the growing importance of the relationship with Germany. The United States is negotiating with the Germans and other Europeans to change their policies towards Iran. Without an agreement President Trump says he is withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>WHITON: Germany right now is at a very important crossroads. You have Merkel in her final term, a coalition there that involves leftwing elements where we really want to be pushing them away from their worst instincts.</p><p>EDSON: If confirmed Grenell would also be the highest profile openly gay official in the Trump administration. He served as the U.S. spokesman at the United Nations during the Bush administration. Though even as Democrats slowed Grenell's confirmation, they point out the administration still has no nominees for other significant State Department positions. Beyond Germany about 40 ambassador jobs remain officially vacant with no pending nominee for South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Cuba, the European Union.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EDSON: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson frequently argued with the White House over staffing. He is gone now and it's unclear if his successor, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, if the Senate confirms him, will find better success finding nominees. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Rich Edson at the State Department. Rich, thanks.</p><p>President Trump and his advisors are restarting an old conversation about something called the line item veto. The president says it's the only way he can get his economic objectives past a democratic filibuster in the U.S. Senate. Correspondent Doug McKelway tells us tonight it is a road we as a country have been done before.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: And tonight I ask you to give me what 43 governors already have, give me a line item veto this year.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Generations of presidents wanted a line item veto. None had it until the Clinton administration when Congress passed the line item veto act of 1996. Clinton used it 82 times before the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional two years later. That didn't stop future presidents from wanting it.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I think there is not a president out there who wouldn't love to have it.</p><p>MCKELWAY: Including President Trump who was clearly frustrated at the Democratic leverage in the omnibus spending bill. While that bill gave him defense spending, it gave them domestic spending, and it gave taxpayers more deficit spending.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm calling on Congress to give me a line item veto for all government spending bills.</p><p>MCKELWAY: Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin repeated the president's call on Sunday, paying no heed to its unconstitutionality.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: I think they should give the president a line item veto.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: That was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, sir.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Again, Congress could pass a rule that allows them to do it.</p><p>MCKELWAY: But it would take a constitutional amendment, not just a rule. Congress tried it in 2011 after the high court ruling. It tinkered with a more moderate version of a line item veto that attempted to maintain the balance of power.</p><p>BOB CUSACK, \"THE HILL\" EDITOR IN CHIEF: The president would propose cuts and then Congress would have to approve those cuts. So the president couldn't go in and strike everything that he wanted out.</p><p>MCKELWAY: That bill ultimately died in the Senate. So where does that leave President Trump?</p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: He wants to fix the budget process, and his message to leaders in Congress of both parties is that if something similar happens again he is much more inclined to veto it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKELWAY: So look out for September 30th. That's the date that the current funding bill runs out and the process then begins all over again with a new impediment, the midterm elections just six weeks away. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Doug McKelway up on the Hill. Doug, thanks.</p><p>Up next, the panel on expelling Russian diplomats and what retaliation may look like. First, beyond our borders tonight. Sixty-four people, many of them children, are dead tonight following a fire at a shopping mall in Siberia. Officials say four people have been detained. They say it appears the fire alarms did not work and employees did not arrange for evacuation there.</p><p>Israeli police meantime again today questioning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in their ongoing corruption probe. This was the second time Netanyahu had been interviewed about allegations he promoted favorable regulations for the country's telecom giant in exchange for favorable coverage. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>And Egyptians are voting in an election that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is virtually guaranteed to end. His only challenger is a little-known politician who joined the race at the last minute to spare the government the embarrassment of a one candidate election after several hopefuls were forced out or arrested.</p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We will be right back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: Today 18 countries have announced their intention to expel more than 100 Russian intelligence officers from their countries. This is the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history.</p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: The president ordered the expulsion of dozens of Russian intelligence officers and the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle.</p><p>ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S.: What the United States do today is destroying the little that is left from the Russian-American relations.</p><p>SHAH: We stand ready to cooperate to build a better relationship with Russia, but this can only happen with a change in the Russian government's behavior.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Big moves today as the U.S. has an expulsion of Russian diplomats. In fact there were 60 Russian diplomats being expelled, described as aggressive intelligence collectors. Forty-eight are now at the Russian embassy, 12 at the U.N. The Russian consulate, as mentioned, in Seattle ordered closed due to a proximity to a submarine base and to Boeing, but there's no specific threat or activity at that facility.</p><p>Individuals and their families have been given seven days to leave the U.S. But the U.S. is not alone. Actually 133 Russian diplomats have been expelled from 20 countries. And again, this is in response to the attack on British soil, the poisoning of that U.S. -- of that spy, the British spy, and his daughter.</p><p>Let's bring our panel, see where this goes from here, Steve Hayes, editor in chief for \"The Weekly Standard,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and David Catanese, senior politics writer for \"U.S. News and World Report.\" Steve, thoughts on today's action?</p><p>STEVE HAYES, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"THE WEEKLY STANDARD\": I think it's a big deal. This is an impressive move. The fact that the U.S. did it in conjunction not only with the British allies but more than a dozen other countries sends I think a pretty strong message to Russia that this kind of behavior is not going to be tolerated, at least not tolerated for very long without repercussions. So I think it's a good move full stop.</p><p>I think it would be better, the president could enhance this move or strengthen it by saying something in his own voice. Just last week he was tweeting that we need better relations with Russia and that people who were calling for him to confront Vladimir Putin on these poisonings or on election meddling in the United States or calling on him not to congratulate Vladimir Putin for a sham election, the president pushed back on that and said that these are people who don't want good relations with Russia, between the United States and Russia, and we are all better off if there are good relations with the United StatesRussia.</p><p>I think it's pretty clear Russia has no intention of behaving the way that a civilized country would behave, and the president ought to make it clearer still by saying something directly in his own voice.</p><p>BAIER: The kremlin's response, Mollie, is this, \"We deeply regret the taken actions. We are to analyze the situation following the decision by number of countries to expel our diplomats. The main analysis will be done by our foreign ministry. After that the president will seek proposals for taking retaliatory steps. A final decision will be made by the head of state. We have said more than once and we say once again, Russia has had nothing to do with this affair whatsoever. Naturally as before we will proceed from the principle of reciprocity,\" Kremlin spokesman.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Russia made this decision to do this poisoning of a British citizen and his daughter, and they also made the decision to not really respond to the concerns of the world when they raised them. And so now you have this action, more than a dozen, almost two dozen countries expelling diplomats. And it is a strong action, and as Steve says, it does send a message.</p><p>It's very difficult when you're doing with nuclear power to do much more than send a message without risking nuclear conflict, but this is something that so serious that more action really is needed. I understand this is the U.K.'s situation and we are in a supportive role even if we expelled more diplomats than they did, but there are other actions that can be taken. Even the intelligence community report last year said anti-fracking movements were something that the Russian government was funding and trying to affect U.S. policy. Doing something policy-wise they can really Russia, or hurt them economically, might be a good way to ramp things up without risking nuclear war.</p><p>BAIER: David?</p><p>DAVID CATANESE, SENIOR POLITICS WRITER, \"U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT\": This alleviates some of the critics that have pounded the Trump administration for not acting on Russia, for not being forceful enough. This is the toughest action of the Trump administration has taken to date against Russia.</p><p>But I think you also have seen in statements today out of the Senate, particularly from John McCain, that this is an opportunity to do more, that this is an opportunity to move forward with economic sanctions and really hit them hard.</p><p>I also think it's going to be striking to watch, what is Putin's next move. I already saw on social media today the Russian government putting out polls saying how should we retaliate? Which consulate of the Americans should be close? And I know there was talk even just last week after the president's call with Putin that there was going to be maybe another meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. That probably puts a chill on that I think at least for the near term.</p><p>BAIER: Mollie, I just want to point out these FOX News polls. The first one is the president's job approval, job performance. We have the latest poll up to 45 percent approve, disapprove at 52 percent. And there you can see their previous track there. And the second question, Russia's main goal in election meddling -- chaos, doubt, U.S. democracy, sowing chaos, 57 percent helped Trump win, 21 percent helped Clinton win, five percent.</p><p>As you look at these polls and how people are perceiving the actions of the president based on what Steve said, the want for the president to vocalize it a little bit more or a lot more than he is about what's happening on Russia, the actions are different than the voice.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I actually think this kind of shows how silly this entire narrative about the president not being strong against Russia. Objectively speaking he's been stronger than either of his two predecessors against Russian aggression. And it's not just with actions like today's which came at the direction of the president. They are not separate from the president. They were his actions that he recommended taking, and the White House said that.</p><p>It's also true that he's been really tough. Even on the Iran deal which is something Russia really wants the U.S. to stay in. Actions in Syria, missile-defense, any number of actions the president has actually been quite tough. And this narrative that he's not been tough, yes, people might want rhetoric that is stronger, but actions count a lot in this matter.</p><p>BAIER: I just want to play this one other sound bite. This is Kevin Corke asking the spokesman today about these actions and what they mean.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Does an attack on the soil of the valued ally rise to the level of an active war? Is that the administration's policy?</p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: We have been joined at the hip with U.K. on this matter, with the U.K. on this matter. We stand firmly with our ally. Again, I'll classify this as brazen and reckless. I don't want to get ahead of anything the president may or may not announce or declare later on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Where is the line, though, Steve, for an act of war against a country?</p><p>HAYES: That's a good question. It's something that comes up in the context of our NATO alliance is. Obviously Raj Shah I think for very understandable reasons didn't want to answer that question directly, certainly not in the affirmative. That might present him some problems.</p><p>BAIER: Exactly. Next up, the effort to break the diplomatic logjam in the Senate, and more on that interview with Stormy Daniels.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF MERKLEY, (D) OREGON: I cannot in good faith support a nominee who has a lengthy track record of tweets attacking both prominent Democratic and prominent Republican women. Since his nomination, these tweets have continued, showing a complete disregard for the Senate confirmation process and a disregard for the seriousness of the position to which he is nominated.</p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO, (R) WYOMING: Today Democrats deliberately delay in ways that limit us to a couple nominations in a typical week.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: There is one nomination that is pending, and a lot of talk about what's not been filled. But Rick Grenell is the nominee to be the U.S. ambassador to Germany. He is a former U.S. spokesman for -- at the U.N. He's the Trump administration's first openly gay nominee. He cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in October, awaiting a confirmation vote. There are a number of positions that have not been nominated yet, but confirmed, 127, some career holdovers, nominated 18, and vacant without nominees, 44. The ambassador for Germany position is not one of them. Mollie?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I think it is absurd to say that Rick Grenell is facing trouble because of tweets that he made, and I don't take anyone really believes that. It is part of a larger anti-Trump or Democratic strategy to keep Trump from having the people he needs in positions that are key so that bureaucrats can continue to wield the power in those seats. It's really dangerous, though, when you have situations like the ambassador to Germany. This is a very key post, and particularly if the new national security advisor, John Bolton, moves forward in getting out of the Iran deal, you really need someone in Germany. Germany is becoming a much more important place. And it is something where the Trump administration and United States in general could use a strong advocate such as Rick Grenell. So this delay is getting to the point of absurdity.</p><p>BAIER: David?</p><p>CATANESE: We don't have ambassadors and three dozen countries. So this is the focal point this week because of a \"New York Times\" story, and I think it also has to do because he would be the highest qualified or highest serving openly gay official in the Trump administration. But we don't have ambassadors in South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt.</p><p>And if we are frank about this, a lot of these ambassador posts are rewards to campaign donors. So I think in different countries they matter at different -- it's more significant in some countries that it is other countries. There's a lot of reports out there that staffing can do a lot of these jobs. And remember when Rex Tillerson, I know he is the outgoing secretary of state, he was asked about this a couple weeks ago, and he said, look, this isn't that big of a deal. We can still move forward with policy.</p><p>And on foreign policy I think the one thing we have learned out of the Trump administration is there is one man setting it, and that's President Trump. So look, this is a procedural battle, and I think there is also a case to be made that Mitch McConnell, if he wanted to, hold the Senate open all week long, have the debate, have a 30 hours. But if Richard Grenell is very important in Germany, you could also make the case for why don't we have ambassadors and really key Middle East countries like I named, Saudi Arabia, Egypt.</p><p>BAIER: Or even Korea.</p><p>CATANESE: South Korea.</p><p>BAIER: OK, so big interview last night, \"60 Minutes,\" the fallout today. Take a listen to a part of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STORMY DANIELS: I was in a parking lot going to a fitness class with my infant daughter, taking the seats facing backwards in the backseat, diaper bag, getting all the stuff out, and a guy walked up on me and said leave Trump alone. Forget the story. And then he leaned around looked at my daughter and said, a beautiful little girl. It would be a shame if something happened to her mom. And then he was gone.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER: Did you ever see the person again?</p><p>DANIELS: No. But if I did, I would know it right away.</p><p>COOPER: Did you go to the police?</p><p>DANIELS: No.</p><p>COOPER: Why?</p><p>DANIELS: Because I was scared.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: The White House engaging, saying they don't believe that there was a threat made. Michael Cohen, the president's attorney, saying he doesn't believe it. Where does this go from here, Steve?</p><p>HAYES: Well, I don't think it goes away. Stormy Daniels is not the most credible accuser that President Trump has had. She's lied specifically about this incident. She has said that she lied about this incident. I think the problem for President Trump is that there are many others who have made similar allegations, whether we are talking about aggressive behavior towards women or we are talking about his folks making thuggish threats on journalists or others who could potentially do him harm.</p><p>I don't think the story goes away in part because of the campaign finance aspect of it. Some people are shrugging that off and saying it's not a big deal. Really we're just talking about $130,000. But if you stop and think about what the substance of the case is, what the center of the case is, it's that the president had, or the president's top lawyer allegedly paid $130,000 in hush money shortly before the election because he had an affair with a porn star. That's a big deal. No matter how you look at it, it's a big deal. And I think we'll learn more about how she wants to substantiate her case if she's able to do so in the coming days.</p><p>BAIER: We will follow all aspect of it. Panel, thank you very much. When we come back, a new kind of peacemaking.</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, a power play that even hardcore politicians can appreciate. When the Colorado Mammoth took the on Vancouver Stealth in a box lacrosse match Saturday in Denver, yes, lacrosse, things got a bit testy between two of the players. That's when referee Todd LaBranche stepped in with an unusual penalty call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These two are clearly having issues with each other, could not restrain themselves, so we're going to give them two minutes to think about what they have done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: To think about what they've done, two minutes of reflection in the box triggered plenty of comments on Twitter, fans praising LaBranche for keeping the peace. Maybe LaBranche should come to Washington, get the deal makers to borrow a page from his playbook in solving that penalty issue.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. \"The Story\" hosted by Martha MacCallum, with reflection, starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018032601cb254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYS-0P81-JB20-G1JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7851\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 26, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Espionage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lawsuits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Weapons</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Youth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Law Enforcement</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Presentment &amp;
