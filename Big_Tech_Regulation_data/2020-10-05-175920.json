In recent years, however, Asia has tilted the scale, delivering game-changing growth and innovations in banking services. This reflects not only the increasingly central role of diverse Asian economies in global trade and economic growth, but also Asia's renewed leadership in scaling innovative technologies and new business models. Now, as the pace of growth slows, Asia's banks face serious challenges and must reinvent themselves to survive. This paper, in which we summarize the current status of Asia's banking industry and outline one possible plan of action by which banks may reinvent themselves for the digital age, is part of McKinsey's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-asia\">Future of Asia</url>\u00a0research program.</p><h>The rebalancing of East and West</h><p>It wasn't so long ago that banks in Asia looked to the West as they developed products, services, and business models. The relationship between East and West is changing rapidly, however, as the emerging markets of Asia have become a major engine of growth in global banking. More than 40 of the world's 100 largest banks by assets are Asian and account for approximately 50 percent of the market capitalization of the top 100 banks globally. Asia has been the world's largest regional banking market for a decade, generating pre-tax profits in excess of $700 billion and accounting for 37 percent of global banking profit pools in 2018 (Exhibit 1). We estimate that as incomes continue to rise and the middle class grows to include two-thirds of Asian households, personal financial assets in the region will total $69 trillion by 2025, representing approximately three-quarters of the global total.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured Insights/Asia Pacific/How Asia is reinventing banking for the digital age/SVGZ-DigitalAsia-Ex1.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>Not only have Asian banks caught up and begun to surpass their Western peers in scale, but consumers' tech-savviness has created opportunities for banks to deliver new innovations and leap ahead. Asia's best-known fintech innovators, including Alipay and WeChat Pay, lead the world in scaling digital payments. According to McKinsey's Global Payments Map, digital payments in China account for approximately 99 percent of the country's non-cash transaction volume and 45 percent of digital payments worldwide.</p><p>Across Asia, incumbent banks are partnering with fintech start-ups to promote digital payments. In Thailand, Kasikornbank and Grab have teamed up to launch GrabPay by KBank, a mobile wallet. BRI\u00a0(Bank Rakyat Indonesia) has partnered with Alipay to expand point-of-sale acceptance of mobile payments for Chinese tourists visiting\u00a0Indonesia.</p><p>Asia has also proven to be fertile ground for the development of digital banking, with numerous   companies making the transition from technology platform to digital bank. In China, Tencent's WeChat offers loans through WeBank; in South Korea, Kakao Talk launched a digital bank\u2060-Kakao Bank\u2060-in 2017; and the Japanese e-commerce group Rakuten has expanded into credit cards, digital banking, investments, and insurance. Not to be outdone by fintech disruptors, traditional banks have launched stand-alone digital banks, (e.g., The State Bank of India's YONO, BTPN's Jenius in Indonesia, and DBS digibank in India and Indonesia) as a way to reach new markets and to acquire new customers at lower cost.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/winning-in-a-world-of-ecosystems\">The rise of ecosystems</url> as a new way of organizing economic activity is another area where Asia is leading. For example, a diversified ecosystem for trade, including banking and payments, has emerged from Alibaba's platforms for B2B and B2C commerce. Ping An, one of China's largest financial conglomerates, has reinvented itself as a \"tech + fin\" ecosystem company, providing loans and investments, as well as insurance, across platforms for healthcare, housing, and more.</p><p>Banks in diverse markets are also building digital platforms as a way to integrate financial services into the everyday activities of consumers and small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), e.g., HDFC Bank has broadened services for small farmers in India; DBS Marketplace enables consumers to search for cars, auto loans, and more in Singapore.</p><p>While digitization and advanced data analytics are creating important opportunities for Asian banks, they also render long-standing business models obsolete, as new entrants compete aggressively to steal market share from incumbents. What is more, Asia is facing a tougher macroeconomic environment as growth slows, asset quality declines, and uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook increases. The storm over Asia is gaining force, and banks must act quickly to counter attackers stealing market share.</p><h>Asia banking braces for consolidation</h><p>For most of the past decade, Asia banking has been the darling of the world, but this is no longer the case, as the industry converges with global averages on margins, returns on equity (ROE), and price-to-book (P/B) multiples. And things are likely to get worse for Asia's banks before they get better.</p><p>Banking industry revenue growth in Asia has slowed from double digits in the early years of the decade to five percent per annum for the period from 2014 to 2018. And while Asia today accounts for more than a third of global banking profit pools, this has shrunk from nearly half in 2010, as banks in developed markets have recovered from the global financial crisis. Margins are also thinning, as banks in both emerging and developed markets contend with fierce competition from digital attackers and peer banks. Average banking ROE for Asia decreased from 12.4 percent in 2010 to 10.1 percent in 2018. In emerging markets, rising capital costs and declining asset quality have also taken their bite out of returns, pushing the average ROE down from 19.5 in 2010 to 11.4 percent in 2018, converging with the global average. Investors have shown strong support for the region's fintech and big tech disruptors, but their outlook for Asia's traditional banks is, on balance, pessimistic, pushing P/B ratios for Asia banking down from 1.4 in 2010 to 0.7 in 2018\u2060-trailing the global average of 0.9 (Exhibit 2).</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured Insights/Asia Pacific/How Asia is reinventing banking for the digital age/SVGZ-DigitalAsia-Ex2.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>Not only have growth in revenues and profit slowed and returns weakened for Asia banking, but rising headwinds pose significant challenges for banks at the dawn of the new decade. If, as forecasts suggest, GDP growth continues to lose steam across emerging Asia, banks will be challenged to find new avenues of growth and will likely have to deal with deteriorating asset quality and rising risk cost. Already in 2018, risk cost provisions for Asia rose to approximately 0.30\u00a0percent, the highest level of loan losses for the region since 2002. Slower GDP growth in China\u2060-compounded by ongoing trade friction with the US and the rapid increase in real estate prices relative to household income\u2060-could weigh heavily on the country's trading partners, as the effect of a correction could potentially destabilize banks in neighboring markets.</p><p>In addition to these headwinds, open banking is taking hold, with diverse markets moving toward broader participation in the banking system. India, for example, allows non-bank service providers direct access to the United Payments Interface; Hong Kong and Singapore have recently introduced new procedures for licensing digital-only banks. Australia and Singapore\u2060-among others\u2060-have adopted open banking rules requiring banks to allow qualified third-party service providers to link to banking systems to access account information and initiate transactions on behalf of customers. We expect that as regulators consider ways to promote lower costs and better products for consumers, as well as improved system efficiencies and controls, open banking will likely become the norm in most Asian\u00a0markets.</p><p>This will undoubtedly increase pressure on the margins and market share of incumbent banks as they go to battle with fintech attackers over payments, lending, and investments. Scale plays a bigger role in this challenging environment, with positive implications for margins, cost efficiency, and productivity, and open banking could prove a boon to forward-looking banks that can leverage their scale and core assets\u2060-customer relationships, data reserves, and proven expertise in risk management\u2060-to deliver better products, services, and pricing.</p><p>Most banks, however, will be challenged to increase their returns adequately to win investors over and execute the transformation required to remain competitive. Well-capitalized institutions generating market-leading returns will likely seek to cement their advantage by acquiring smaller (less well-capitalized) organizations to increase scale inorganically. Weighing these dynamics, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/bracing-for-consolidation-in-asia-pacific-banking-the-quest-for-scale\">Asia's banks are bracing for\u00a0consolidation</url>.</p><h>Reinventing for the future</h><p>Just as iron sharpens iron, we believe that the region's banking industry will emerge stronger and leaner than ever. To remain relevant, however, each bank must reinvent itself\u2060-a difficult task requiring strong commitment. At the same time, banks must balance short-term goals\u2060-in particular strengthening the core and capturing pockets of growth\u2060-with priorities for the long term\u2060-e.g., articulating anew the bank's purpose for the digital age, redefining its value proposition, and rebuilding the operating\u00a0model.</p><p>Increasingly, banks will both acquire new customers and interact with ongoing customers through digital ecosystems, requiring new approaches to branding and relationship management as well as changes in business model and technology architecture. Top performers must remain vigilant and maintain their lead in products, customer base, and returns by augmenting their data assets and analytical capabilities. Organizations that generate returns below the average cost of capital\u2060-approximately two-thirds of Asian banks\u2060-will face an existential choice: Either reinvent to stay relevant or lag behind and eventually disappear. Banks must \"disrupt themselves,\" shifting from old to new models and ways of working, all while increasing revenue and extending\u00a0market\u00a0share.</p><p>Asia's banking leaders have already taken decisive steps to strengthen the core, focusing on productivity, risk, and capital optimization. Many have reduced operating costs by 30-40 percent across sales and service, support functions, and back-office operations through extensive digitization. The full potential of this opportunity lies in adopting zero-based budgeting to transform mindsets and redesign processes to achieve radical gains in productivity. For risk management, banks are finding that they can reduce loan losses while allowing a broader population to qualify for loans by developing machine learning algorithms to analyze a combination of traditional underwriting data and unstructured data from internal and external sources. Capital allocation is another area where banks can leverage new strengths in data analytics to reduce waste. For example, some banks are able to allocate capital consumption to the level of products and individual accounts, which in turn leads to highly accurate risk weightings at the portfolio level. As a result, these banks have been able to free up between 10\u00a0and 20 percent of capital.</p><p>To achieve such radical improvements in performance, banks must leverage all the new tools, technologies, and capabilities available today, including digitization, advanced data analytics, robotics, and AI. Banks can deploy these same capabilities in pursuit of strategic growth, focusing on four fast-growing businesses: wealth management, consumer and SME lending, and transaction banking. Together, these businesses hold the potential for US $100 billion in new revenue for Asia's banks each year.</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">wealth management</emphasis>, the key is to strike the right balance between self-guided digital tools and high-touch consultation. Within high- and ultra-high-net-worth segments, this means delivering portfolio offerings tailored to individual client needs. Use of voice recognition and AI can support a high degree of personalization at scale for the mass affluent segment. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Consumer and SME lending</emphasis> are also poised for strong growth. Retail lending in Asia, which totaled $12.8 trillion in 2018, is on track to reach $21.2 trillion in 2025 (Exhibit 3). The loan book for SMEs\u2060-already bigger than retail and corporate lending\u2060-is expected to grow nine percent each year, totaling $23 trillion in 2025. Banks can use this strong growth as a foundation for developing new value propositions and multiplying revenue streams.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured Insights/Asia Pacific/How Asia is reinventing banking for the digital age/SVGZ-DigitalAsia-Ex3.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>In the consumer lending market, regulators in several countries are wary of mounting consumer debt levels, and banks should use sophisticated risk models to identify the most qualified customers within segments where product penetration is low relative to GDP. Similarly, by combining traditional and non-traditional data, leading banks and fintech attackers have built risk-scoring engines to speed up loan approvals for SME customers, even those with limited or no credit history. One example is HDFC's \"Milk-to-Money\" program in India, which tracks regular ATM deposits to establish a credit profile for dairy farmers, many of whom have only recently opened bank accounts.</p><p>Finally, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">transaction banking</emphasis>, which already accounts for approximately a third of all banking revenues in Asia and captures more than half of transaction banking revenues globally, holds significant potential for further growth. Banks can potentially increase transaction banking revenue by 10-20\u00a0percent across four main business lines: cash management, trade services, securities, and cross-border flows. Competition is fierce and margins are thin, making it crucial for banks to combine scale with sophisticated analytics capabilities to eliminate waste, create new products, and deepen relationships. While it is often assumed that demand for a superior digital experience is higher among retail banking customers, corporate and SME customers expect an equally high level of seamless integration and ease of use. In response, leading banks are using APIs to integrate banking functions more deeply within corporate systems, enabling them to provide a dashboard view, for example, of intraday cash position across multiple currencies, investments, working capital, and payables. What is more, advanced data analytical models are helping banks enhance their liquidity management services, optimize netting arrangements for on-us transactions, and implement dynamic pricing.</p><p>In order to succeed in this broad effort to strengthen the core, build new business models, and increase revenue, banks will need to deploy cutting-edge tools, technologies, and capabilities. Succeeding in this requires both new thinking about and reinvention of the way banks operate across four pillars: technology architecture; advanced analytics; talent management; and partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Flexible technology architecture:</emphasis></emphasis> To compete with big tech companies on speed, productivity, and customer experience requires modular platforms, which allow developers continuous integration and interoperability with core systems. While core systems may be transformed gradually, the modular applications or microservices supporting specific use cases can be updated frequently as the market changes and new innovations become available. Beyond architectural and system changes, banks should also learn to adopt new ways of working. This requires not only flexibility in acquiring, upskilling, and integrating new talent profiles, but also shifting to a new operating model and culture in which business and technology competencies are more closely\u00a0intertwined.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Advanced data analytics:</emphasis></emphasis> Advanced data analytics form the cornerstone of superior customer experience, and many banks now focus on data as a core enterprise asset. This entails the articulation of an enterprise-wide data strategy and investment roadmap so that data-and-analytics projects can be tightly linked to value creation. Banks should focus first on advanced analytics use cases with the greatest impact on customer experience and value to the bank. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), for example, has built a customer engagement engine that analyzes more than 30 billion data points to generate upwards of 40 million offers each month. Developing a top-notch data-and-analytics program requires vision and commitment, and to earn a good return on the investment, it is crucial to give employees the tools and skills they need to formulate their own data queries for strategic planning and day-to-day management of strategic goals. This requires a combination of strong governance and autonomy to enable individuals across the entire organization\u2060-from sales and service to risk management and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/six-digital-growth-strategies-for-banks\">digital innovation</url>\u2060-to excel in a data-driven environment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Talent management:</emphasis></emphasis> With automation expected to disrupt up to 40 percent of all banking activity and affecting half of banking jobs by 2030, banks are today evaluating how to combine recruiting, reskilling, and redeployment to build the workforce of the future. Malaysia's Maybank (Malayan Banking Berhad) has launched a learning program to help employees acquire relevant skills for the next phase of their careers, with sessions on coding, algorithm programming, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Aiming to enhance their appeal to millennials with superior digital skills, many banks are building a reputation for leadership in technological innovation, forging ties with fintech and academic communities, and developing a culture where talented and ambitious employees know they can make a difference. It is critical to understand the shifts required in the bank's composite talent profile, and to succeed in this transition, top leaders must commit not only to recruiting new talent but also to helping existing employees acquire the skills needed to thrive in the new culture.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions:</emphasis></emphasis> In this age of open banking and digital ecosystems, many banks are finding that partnerships are critical to success in extending their footprint, delivering superior products, and gaining access both to new customers and to new types of data (Exhibit 4). As\u00a0an example, three of Australia's big four banks\u2060-ANZ, NAB, and Westpac\u2060-have invested in Data Republic, a data hub through which organizations can store, exchange, and collaborate on aggregated data projects in a secure environment. In Thailand, Siam Commercial Bank and Julius Baer have partnered to deliver global investment opportunities to customers. In Indonesia, Bank Central Asia (BCA) has linked with leading e-commerce sites, enabling the bank to expand its lending business while keeping risk costs low. And in Singapore, OCBC Bank (Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation) offers home mortgages through the personal finance portal MoneySmart.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured Insights/Asia Pacific/How Asia is reinventing banking for the digital age/SVGZ-DigitalAsia-Ex4.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) are another way to acquire crucial capabilities and extend market reach. DBS, for example, has acquired ANZ operations in five countries. Kotak Bank has extended its footprint into southern India by acquiring ING Vysya and entered the lower end of the market with its acquisition of BSS Microfinance. Given the importance of scale in achieving higher returns\u2060-and, consequently, higher valuations\u2060-carefully executed mergers and acquisitions offer an attractive option for increasing market share and consolidating scale, capabilities, and talent. If they have not done so already, now is the time for banks to establish a dedicated group responsible for planning and managing M&amp;A, as well as partnerships. Banks should remember that 90 percent of the value of a merger is realized within the first two years and establish early on a plan for post-merger integration to ensure that synergies are realized\u00a0promptly.</p><p>The world is rebalancing, giving rise to challenges and opportunities that are pushing Asian banks to embark on a path of radical transformation. The way forward, however, is fraught with existential challenges for every banking organization, bank and non-bank, incumbent and new entrant: Asia's banks must reinvent themselves or risk disappearing. In order to maintain their status as preeminent providers of financial services, banks need to develop best-in-class digital-and-analytics capabilities and achieve new levels of productivity through greater scale, market-leading cost-efficiency, and data-driven models to increase revenue across the franchise, focusing especially on wealth management, retail and SME lending, and transaction banking.</p><p>In addition to new business models, banks must define anew their sense of purpose. As stewards of the system of financial intermediation, banks are vital to society. In the years following the global financial crisis, however, many banks seem to have lost their sense of purpose and the perception of the industry has not fully recovered. As they reinvent themselves for the digital age, banks must also be clear about their \"why,\" emphasizing their role as responsible stewards in promoting sustainable growth and building for a stronger tomorrow.</p><h>About the authors</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=26D685B2470A42A8B78EC5AD4BCB751E&amp;_z=z\">Jacob Dahl</url></emphasis> is a senior partner in McKinsey's Hong Kong office.\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ervin Ng</emphasis> is an associate partner in the Singapore office, where <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=92133790A40645D6A8C7D63806157E92&amp;_z=z\">Joydeep Sengupta</url></emphasis> is a senior partner.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCKNSY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCKNSY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y66-JVV1-DXH6-F254-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470364</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 McKinsey &amp;

If you buy something featured, we may earn an affiliate commission which helps support our work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An app called Blue Map, created by environmentalist Ma Jun and backed by Chinese retailer Alibaba, has found that a number of Apple's suppliers were violating its environmental guidelines.</p><p> The app aggregates pollution data from government websites to help companies identify suppliers not in compliance with their policies.</p><p> Ma claims his app identified 830,000 cases where companies were polluting excessively or falsifying emissions data, across thousands of parent brands. The database is publicly available for the general public to report violations, as well as for all large brands who use suppliers in China.</p><p> Bloomberg recently reported Apple has \"taken action\" against the manufacturers in violation. The company told Bloomberg it used the app to identify and resolve almost 200 cases where suppliers were violating environmental rules.</p><p> Some have been removed from Apple's list of suppliers, though it's unclear how many. Those whose contracts remain intact could still be denied desired credit ratings or be deprived of loans.</p><p> Companies can often more effectively deter pollution through these mechanisms, Ma told Bloomberg, than by seeking environmental recourse from the Chinese government, which has historically been reluctant to crack down on big tech manufacturers. Large brands like Apple can use Blue Map to hold their suppliers to environmental commitments without expensive and time-consuming audits of every manufacturer.</p><p> It's not surprising that Apple took these actions: The company has made large strides in renewable energy. in the past few years, it has championed a number of green initiatives, including bond offerings on wind and solar power plants and energy-efficient buildings, a pivot to become 93% reliant on alternative energy, and a program, called Liam, that uses robots to disassemble and recycle iPhones.</p><p> But the company certainly still has work to do.</p><p>Apple has consistently pushed against \"right to repair\" legislation \u2014 policies that would decrease the amount of raw materials needed for replacement units. The company has also opposed measures to reward the production of smartphones with removable batteries, which some of its its competitors backed.</p><p> And while it's up to the government to set environmental standards, it's relatively easy for big companies to ensure those standards are favorable to them given their lobbying power. So getting suppliers to comply with Apple's standards is an important victory, but it's equally important to keep in mind the whole picture and not just a single part of it.</p><p> Big tech companies aren't the only ones who can benefit from Blue Map. Nonprofits, activists, and advocates for the environment can also use it to get a sense of current standards and practices, and how companies are adhering to them.</p><p> Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that almost 200 Apple suppliers had been caught violating the company's environmental regulations.

In February 1986, high-tech lawyer Jim Paul had just exited the Queensway in Kanata and was waiting at the first set of traffic lights. A blue Cadillac pulled up beside him and Paul instantly recognized his former boss at the wheel. Matthews motioned for Paul to roll down his window. \"I've been meaning to call you,\" he shouted. \"Let's get together.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the six or seven minutes it took him to drive to Matthews' gated compound, Paul had pretty much figured out what was coming next. The Welsh-born entrepreneur would make him an offer he'd find difficult to refuse. Matthews had been talking around town about forming a private R&amp;D company -- something to do with a new class of communications networking gear. \"Just me and some ideas,\" Matthews would say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Paul, the former chief legal counsel for Matthews' first company, Mitel, knew his host very well. But Paul wanted to know whether Matthews viewed the new venture as a post-Mitel hobby, or something more serious. Matthews quickly set him straight. He told Paul that the startup would quickly reach $1 billion a year in sales -- something Mitel had not been able to achieve -- and would become a public stock company within three years.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>The Ottawa Citizen</p></bodyText></section><p>In those days, such targets were almost absurdly ambitious -- especially for a startup not operating out of California or Boston. But Matthews was persuasive. Paul signed on as secretary of the R&amp;D company in May and set to work creating the legal framework for Newbridge Networks -- which Matthews launched in June. It took Newbridge little more than ten years to reach $1 billion in annual sales. Matthews didn't quite make his three-year target for going public but he came close. Newbridge shares began trading in Toronto and New York on July 28, 1989. The $46.7 million initial public offering valued Newbridge at $417 million.</p><p>This was the country's first big tech IPO since the stock market crash of 1987. It was also one of the most successful. If you were smart enough to buy Newbridge shares during the IPO, and then held them until the Alcatel buyout, you would have done extremely well. An investment of just $55,000 would have made you a millionaire, representing an average annual gain of roughly 30 per cent per year. Newbridge employees, who were awarded thousands of options to acquire shares at a small fraction of the IPO price, would have done much, much better if they played their cards right -- and some of them did.</p><p>By 2000, when France-based Alcatel paid $10.4 billion to acquire it, Newbridge had morphed into a multinational with 5,300 employees and annual sales of nearly $2 billion.</p><p>Matthews was forced to sell in the end because even bigger corporations such as Nortel Networks were lending their customers billions of dollars with which to buy gear. Newbridge couldn't compete on that scale. But for 14 years, Matthews set the tone by fiercely resisting moves that would have compromised Newbridge's independence.</p><p>\"Terry made it clear from the beginning that he wanted to build a self-sustaining, public company,\" says Rainer Paduch, one of Newbridge's earliest employees and today an angel investor. \"Terry delivered but we in this town failed to follow his example.\" Not for want of trying in some cases. Paduch founded iStar Internet and took it public in the mid-1990s. But he was unable to keep the operation going.</p><p>And it's not to say that Newbridge's example won't be repeated one day. Matthews and his allies are even now readying half-a-dozen startups for going public over the next 18 months. One company in his stable, Newport Networks of Wales, started trading earlier this year on the London AIM exchange.</p><p>Viewed from the perspective of today, Newbridge's rise from a standing start is an improbable tale. Other tech firms -- including JDS Fitel and Lumonics -- later had bigger IPOs. And, following its merger with Uniphase, JDS for a time achieved valuations well in excess of Newbridge's strongest showing.</p><p>But no tech startup, except possibly Mitel, displayed more entrepreneurial verve or later gave rise to so many spinoff firms. Nearly one in three of Newbridge's first 50 employees are running startups or financing them in a significant way.</p><p>A handful have gone on to manage some of this region's biggest tech firms. Jim Roche, who Matthews hired straight out of university in 1986, has been running Tundra Semiconductor for the past two years. Bruce Rodgers, the Toronto native who managed Newbridge's plant from the earliest days, is CEO of BreconRidge, an electronics manufacturer in Kanata. Conrad Lewis, Mike Pascoe, Pat Power and Rainer Paduch are all re-investing their Newbridge profits in other startups -- and, in most cases, have taken on the job of chairing them.</p><p>The common link, of course, is Matthews -- who set out from the beginning to create a special kind of incubator.</p><p>\"I did something I'd never done before,\" Matthews said in a recent interview. \"I hired brand new grads who learned the hard work ethic very quickly, and only a couple of seasoned pros. It worked.\"</p><p>There was much more to it, of course. Matthews' 13-year stint at Mitel gave him a ton of contacts at the highest levels of the telecommunications industry. He also had a lot of good ideas about the future direction of data communications and was able to differentiate Newbridge's earliest products from those of other competitors already in the data networking market.</p><p>But when Matthews talks about a work ethic, he means it. \"We would often work to midnight and come back early the next morning,\" says Paduch, the company's 30th employee.</p><p>\"The hours were long,\" adds James Watt, employee No. 9, \"but it wasn't restricted to the new grads.\"</p><p>Indeed, Matthews seemed to enjoy putting maximum pressure on all his staff. During the first few months, he was annoyed that his engineers would leave the building for lunch. Matthews sent a memo suggesting employees eat sandwiches at their desk. Matthews' family and friends got into the business of making sandwiches and bringing them into the office.</p><p>Matthews also changed his firm's fiscal yearend to April 30 (from March 31), so that each financial quarter would end during a month when engineers with young families didn't typically take vacations.</p><p>Matthews assembled his starting lineup by drawing deeply on his Mitel connections. He moved carefully because he didn't want to be accused of raiding his former company (where he would serve as director until 1988). But fortunately for him, Mitel's new owners were sacking workers and closing units.</p><p>Matthews' network was extensive. John Barsellotti, Newbridge's 13th employee, says that in the spring of 1986 he wasn't even aware Matthews had started a new firm. However, a few days after complaining to a fellow Mitel employee that he was thinking of quitting, Barsellotti got a call from Matthews.</p><p>Matthews' first hire was Dan Rusheleau who he says was let go by Mitel. Rusheleau, Mitel's director of advanced technology, provided the key engineering for what would become Newbridge's first flagship product. This was the 3600 MainStreet -- a clever combination of software and chips that allowed companies to blend voice and data traffic on the same network at tremendous cost savings.</p><p>Matthews never forgot Rusheleau's contribution. When Rusheleau (and Barsellotti) left Newbridge in the early 1990s to start West End Systems of Arnprior, Matthews was a significant investor. After West End went belly up early in 1999, Rusheleau and Barsellotti went on to a series of new assignments -- all of them financed in some way by Matthews. Their latest venture is MKC Networks, which is developing Internet Protocol telephony products. Rusheleau's office is just steps away from that of Matthews who these days is managing his many business interests through Wesley Clover, a holding company with headquarters in Kanata and Wales.</p><p>Matthews, who would sink nearly $14 million of his own money to fund Newbridge's initial R&amp;D effort, was well aware of the engineering talent available in 1986. For one thing, he had interviewed nearly all prospective employees at Mitel.</p><p>Early on, Matthews telephoned James Watt, an electrical engineering grad from Queen's who had worked one summer at Mitel. He offered Watt a job in Newbridge's R&amp;D shop, then asked him for a list of his brightest classmates at Queen's University. That piece of intelligence led to the hiring of Jim Roche, Angelo Bovolotto and Theo Mavraganes. Watt today is the chief operating officer of Alcatel's IP Division -- which includes most of what used to be Newbridge. Mavraganes works there as a manager. Roche and Bovolotto are at Tundra.</p><p>Matthews hired talent wherever he found it. Mike O'Malley in 1986 was an independent contractor who had installed electronic equipment in Matthews' Kanata house. Matthews convinced him to join Newbridge's radio products group. O'Malley stayed the course until 1989 when he left because \"I wasn't equipped to deal with the politics of a bigger company.\" O'Malley recently became the first employee at another startup -- Canica Design, the medical instruments firm founded by one of Ottawa's more colourful entrepreneurs Leonard Lee.</p><p>Matthews included a few seasoned loyalists among his earliest hires -- people he trusted to manage his growing pool of young Turks. Don Mills, his old friend from near Swansea, Wales, negotiated salaries and looked after administration while James Mackie, who had run Mitel's product management group, helped out with marketing. George Smith, another old Mitel hand, looked after Newbridge's European sales effort. Mills, Mackie and Smith have all recently passed away.</p><p>It was an eclectic mix held together by the energy and evangelism of its founder. Very few of the earliest employees believed they were on the verge of hyper-growth.</p><p>\"It was an interesting engineering project for a lot of us,\" says Paduch. \"We were a SWAT team trying to solve problems.\"</p><p>Typical of a young startup, engineers were working on an assortment of projects -- some of which never saw the light of day. There was an effort aimed at producing a \"high reliability mountain-top radio repeater\" and another R&amp;D project involving paging equipment.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was clear that Newbridge's main bet lay with the development of the 3600 MainStreet. Matthews would closely question potential customers about what features they were seeking -- and Rusheleau and his engineering team would try to incorporate the key ones.</p><p>The name of the product provided the first clue about Matthews' real ambition. He says he named it after the IBM 360 mainframe computer -- one of that firm's all-time best sellers. \"The 360 put IBM on the map,\" says Matthews. \"It was an incredible product that changed computing forever.\"</p><p>The MainStreet portion of the name was pure sentiment. Matthews grew up on Main Street, a short strip of miners' cottages in the heart of Newbridge, Wales. Matthews says that Mackie was also raised on Main Street -- in Saskatoon.</p><p>Guy Dubuc, who managed the development of the software for the 3600 MainStreet, recalls some initial hesitation about what kind of product it was meant to be. He says the marketing literature touting the 3600 at the company's first trade show in Europe cited \"all kinds of voice features\" -- which prompted Newbridge's more data-savvy competitors to smile. \"They seemed to think we were neither fish nor fowl,\" says Dubuc, who is currently dabbling in a new venture involving custom graphics.</p><p>Nevertheless, Newbridge's top guns at that trade show caught the attention of an executive with the East Midland Electricity Board, which placed the first order for the 3600 early in 1987.</p><p>Newbridge engineers' familiarity with voice technologies would later prove an immense advantage when telephone companies became the biggest consumers of multiplexing gear such as the 3600 which mixed voice and data together. Dubuc notes that Newbridge's technology took a dramatic leap in the spring of 1987 when it hired a group of ex-Mitel employees who had been working on data networking technologies. These included Scott Marshall, Jim Ghadbane, Steve Bews and Dave Farrar.</p><p>\"I thought Mitel's decision to get out of data networking was a dumb one and I told them so,\" says Matthews. \"I promptly hired these guys and suddenly had a lot of data competent people to help Dan (Rusheleau).\"</p><p>Had you wandered by mistake into Newbridge's headquarters in early 1987 -- when it occupied space in the Baxter Centre just off the Queensway -- you would have received little hint of the firm's wealth-creating potential.</p><p>A one-hour video tells the tale. Pat Power, one of the first two dozen employees (today a partner with James Edward Capital), interviewed Newbridge's Ottawa area employees early in 1987 to introduce them to other company workers.</p><p>With only a few exceptions, what emerges is a portrait of tongue-tied, media-shy geeks completely focused on tasks ranging from soldering line cards to writing software code. Although Power's video tour had obviously been sanctioned by Matthews, several employees resented the intrusion. One flipped Power a bird.</p><p>The smoothest presenters were Peter Madsen, the executive in charge of the U.S. sales effort and, of course, Matthews, who talked about getting Newbridge's new headquarters in Kanata ready by summer. He also noted that he was looking forward to an initial public offering. \"Let's go for it!\" he urged.</p><p>It's difficult to escape the impression that what followed would have been impossible without Matthews. He was the firm's main recruiter, salesman, banker, cheerleader and energizer all rolled into one.</p><p>Above all, he exhorted employees to think big. Every six weeks he would offer them complete updates of the business -- customers, prospects, engineering developments, you name it. Matthews wanted them plugged in.</p><p>He also gave them plenty of incentive to work hard by including stock options in employees' pay packets. The formula varied by seniority and responsibility but even the most junior workers received enough options to make them potentially quite wealthy. Consider that a grant of just 1,000 share options -- a not unusual amount to receive upon hiring -- would have multiplied into 4,000 shares by 1997, when they would be worth $380,000 at the peak.</p><p>But of course life's not like that. Not only were many of the engineers and office workers less than savvy when it came to managing their Newbridge wealth, but the general context of the times wasn't very helpful either. Tech stocks in the late 1980s did not have a track record of stellar growth.</p><p>The result in some cases was a near financial disaster. When Newbridge went public at $12.45 per share (pre-split), employees sitting on options that cost them only $1 per share suddenly felt wealthy. Initially, there were restrictions on their ability to sell shares but, when Newbridge shares flew past $20, some engineers borrowed heavily against the increased value of their holdings.</p><p>When company shares then fell as low as $3.55 late in 1990, their lenders demanded fresh collateral. Newbridge suddenly had a few profoundly troubled workers on its hands. When Matthews discovered the problem, he offered financial assistance out of his own pocket, in some cases by supplying the additional margin requirement, in others by pledging some of his own Newbridge shares as collateral.</p><p>\"Why wouldn't I help people who have been working their asses off for the company,\" Matthews says.</p><p>Other Newbridge employees avoided financial distress but failed to take advantage of the Newbridge rocket. For example, one office worker accumulated 12,000 share options but cashed them in as soon as she earned them. (One-third of the options would vest on each anniverary.) And all this happened before 1993, when company shares finally began taking off. The employee realized thousands of dollars in profits when she might have reaped millions.</p><p>Patient employees -- and ones with senior responsibilities (which regularly received additional options) -- did very, very well. Many became millionaires.</p><p>Matthews, of course, was utterly convinced of the value of the enterprise he was creating. Even during Newbridge's darkest days of late 1990 and early 1991 he refused to entertain thoughts of being bought out. Throughout the company's history he sold off only small slices of his total holdings -- which is why he still controlled nearly 22 per cent of the company's shares in the end.</p><p>His determined drive to take Newbridge public wasn't grounded so much in a desire to extract cash. Matthews wanted a vehicle capable of playing in the majors. With publicly traded shares, Matthews would have currency for rewarding loyal employees, acquiring other tech firms if necessary and for reassuring his largest customers that he was for real.</p><p>Which is why the late spring and early summer of 1989 offered its own peculiar version of hell for Matthews. \"Terry has a healthy disrespect for investment bankers and lawyers,\" laughs Jeremy Farr, a partner with Ottawa-based Borden Ladner Gervais. In 1989 Farr was the second lawyer on the Lang Michener team respresenting Newbridge during its IPO.</p><p>Matthews had to deal with a small army of suited professionals. Unusual for the times, he had decided to execute two simultaneous IPOs -- one on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the other on New York-based Nasdaq. This necessitated claustrophic meetings in mid-town Manhattan involving four underwriters, U.S. and Canadian legal counsel, auditors and Newbridge's senior financial executives.</p><p>The main objective was to draft what turned out to be a 69-page prospectus to be distributed to clients interested in investing in Newbridge. The document contained a description of Newbridge's business strategies, share ownership, customers, among other pertinent details.</p><p>The lawyers naturally quibbled over the fine print, driving Matthews to distraction. However, Matthews wasn't helping matters. The prospectus was meant to provide a snapshot of a point in time, but Matthews was moving on a series of fronts simultaneously. Newbridge was landing significant new customers, tweaking its marketing strategies and acquiring other small firms in the midst of proceedings.</p><p>More generally, there was a huge disconnect between Matthews and the other professionals in the room. \"You have to remember that Newbridge was a sales organization of incredible optimism,\" says Farr, \"while U.S. regulators had very significant restrictions on any pre-marketing activities by companies wanting to go public.\"</p><p>Newbridge counsel Jim Paul says Matthews was frustrated by what he viewed as the excessive caution of the lawyers. \"The IPO schedule kept slipping,\" says Paul, \"and he fought it every step of the way.\"</p><p>Certainly the lawyers felt the pressure from Matthews. In the final five-day runup to going public, Farr checked into a hotel in the World Trade Centre but wound up spending only two hours there.</p><p>Most hours he was at the printer's reading one revision after another of the Newbridge prospectus. The venue was civil enough. This was a high-end printer that offered clients special drafting rooms, recreational facilities and menus from the finest restaurants in Manhattan.</p><p>Finally, the deal looked done. Farr was getting ready to leave the printer's when a representative of Burns Fry, one of the Canadian underwriters, told him that the Canadian prospectus had to be printed using a certain font size. Farr delivered the instructions to the printer and waited for the final version of the document.</p><p>To his horror, he discovered the new font size had resulted in a much different look to the Canadian document. Pages were numbered differently compared to the U.S. version, financial tables were split in two and many references no longer made sense.</p><p>\"All I could think was that the U.S. documents were done and Terry wants this ready by morning,\" Farr recalls.</p><p>Farr spent the entire night fixing the problem and double-checking all the references in both documents. He caught the 7:30 a.m. flight to Toronto where he presented the prospectus to the Ontario Securities Commission just in time to set the clock in motion to complete the IPO that week.</p><p>\"There was never any doubt in my mind that we would go public,\" says Matthews. At times, he may have been the only one who believed that. But in late July 1989, he made believers of them all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Colour Photo: Newbridge engineers raced to complete the first version of their flagship product (left) in time for a leading trade show .

Big ISPs like Comcast and Verizon drew support from almost every Senate Republican and conservative groups backed by Charles and David Koch. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They also got a surprising assist from groups representing big tech firms like Google and Facebook, which feared that similar regulations could someday curtail their own ability to harvest their users' data. </p><p>The powerful telecom industry moved fast to capitalize on Trump's election victory. Just a week into the Trump administration, ISPs and their trade groups began to position the Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules, passed days before the 2016 election, as an example of government overreach ripe for repeal. Out of hundreds of late Obama-era rules that could be vulnerable to congressional rollback, the FCC regulation is one of several that lawmakers have moved to kill through resolutions that have reached Trump's desk.</p><p>\"We've been very active on this since November,\" one broadband industry lobbyist told POLITICO. \"We put together this broader ad hoc coalition that basically represented the entire ecosystem. That's, to me, the seminal thing that really gave us momentum.\" </p><p>To consumer advocates who supported the FCC rules and urged internet users to weigh in against the GOP effort, Congress' swift repeal was yet another example of corporations outweighing the interests of ordinary Americans.</p><p>\"I'm fairly certain there was not one call from a constituent that said pass this [resolution] right away,\" said Dallas Harris, policy fellow at consumer group Public Knowledge. \"Clearly, internet service providers and tech companies pulled enough muscle to kind of overthrow the will of the people.\"</p><p>Another factor, she acknowledged, was that the public had already been inundated with warnings about eroding civil liberties in the first few months of the Trump administration. </p><p>\"It was really hard to get this message across in such a noisy environment,\" she said.</p><p>Trump is expected to sign off on the repeal in the coming days. That means the nation's strongest-ever internet privacy rules are about to be history, before they could even take effect.</p><p>Tech and telecom groups fought against the FCC rules as soon as they were first proposed last March, but prospects for blocking them appeared dim as long as Democrats dominated the FCC and Hillary Clinton was favored to take the White House.</p><p>Once Trump won, however, the industry turned its focus to Capitol Hill, in a campaign led by groups such as the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, which spent $1.2 million on lobbying in 2016, according to federal disclosures. </p><p>Trade groups like NCTA-The Internet and Television Association, the Information Technology Industry Council and the Data &amp; Marketing Association also pushed for lawmakers to make the privacy rules a top target for the Congressional Review Act - the once-obscure legislative tool that Republican lawmakers were eager to leverage to undo Obama administration legacies. </p><p>The industry effort was bolstered by free-market organizations, including Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform and the Koch-backed American Commitment, as well as advertising industry groups and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Consumer groups and Democrats tried to fight back, painting the repeal as brazenly anti-consumer and arguing it will allow telecom companies to run amok with user data. (Other privacy regulators, like the Federal Trade Commission, are barred from policing broadband companies' privacy practices.)</p><p>The telecom industry, though, said the FCC rules are overly strict and could confuse consumers, and repeatedly sought to quash what they saw as liberal \"myths.\"</p><p>\"It's always easier for one side to create a parade of horribles, but when you track back what the charges are they almost never reflect what ISPs are actually doing,\" NCTA Executive Vice President James Assey told reporters before the House vote on Tuesday. </p><p>Industry groups felt they had an ace up their sleeve: For once, a broad coalition of groups representing various parts of the internet ecosystem were all aligned against the FCC's rules. Telecom companies and Silicon Valley firms often find themselves feuding on policies like net neutrality, but their alliance on privacy was key in helping the measure advance, multiple lobbyists said.</p><p>\"In our meetings there was no daylight between our focus and the telecom folks',\" said one tech industry lobbyist who pushed the resolution.</p><p>Lawmakers such as Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who were on record as opposing the rules, introduced resolutions in their respective chambers to ax the regulations, and they found their GOP colleagues eager to go along. In a sign of the broad Republican support for the measure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signed his name to Flake's measure in early March.</p><p>Consumer groups and other supporters of the FCC's privacy rules responded with an aggressive campaign to oppose the repeal. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), one of the House's top privacy advocates, blasted the Republican effort earlier this week in a voter-directed Facebook live chat. And organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation drove tens of thousands of calls to Congress in the day before Tuesday's 215-205 House vote, according to people familiar with the effort.</p><p>But none of that was enough, a factor that the rules' opponents attribute to their months of campaigning.</p><p>\"We'd been talking to congressional offices on this for six months and we weren't going in blind,\" said Vince Jesaitis, ITIC's vice president of government affairs. \"We'd laid that groundwork.\"</p><p>Margaret Harding McGill and Theodoric Meyer contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-236773</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N75-4T31-F118-91PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1021\"/><timeReceived>11:11 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 1, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Big ISPs like Comcast and Verizon drew support from almost every Senate Republican and conservative groups backed by <person><nameText>Charles and David Koch. </nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They also got a surprising assist from groups representing big tech firms like Google and Facebook, which feared that similar regulations could someday curtail their own ability to harvest their users' data. </p><p>The powerful telecom industry moved fast to capitalize on Trump's election victory. Just a week into the <person><nameText>Trump administration, </nameText></person>ISPs and their trade groups began to position the Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules, passed days before the 2016 election, as an example of government overreach ripe for repeal. Out of hundreds of late Obama-era rules that could be vulnerable to congressional rollback, the FCC regulation is one of several that lawmakers have moved to kill through resolutions that have reached Trump's desk.</p><p>\"We've been very active on this since November,\" one broadband industry lobbyist told POLITICO. \"We put together this broader ad hoc coalition that basically represented the entire ecosystem. That's, to me, the seminal thing that really gave us momentum.\" </p><p>To consumer advocates who supported the FCC rules and urged internet users to weigh in against the GOP effort, Congress' swift repeal was yet another example of corporations outweighing the interests of ordinary Americans.</p><p>\"I'm fairly certain there was not one call from a constituent that said pass this [resolution] right away,\" said Dallas Harris, policy fellow at consumer group Public Knowledge. \"Clearly, internet service providers and tech companies pulled enough muscle to kind of overthrow the will of the people.\"</p><p>Another factor, she acknowledged, was that the public had already been inundated with warnings about eroding civil liberties in the first few months of the <person><nameText>Trump administration. </nameText></person></p><p>\"It was really hard to get this message across in such a noisy environment,\" she said.</p><p>Trump is expected to sign off on the repeal in the coming days. That means the nation's strongest-ever internet privacy rules are about to be history, before they could even take effect.</p><p>Tech and telecom groups fought against the FCC rules as soon as they were first proposed last March, but prospects for blocking them appeared dim as long as Democrats dominated the FCC and <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>was favored to take the White House.</p><p>Once Trump won, however, the industry turned its focus to Capitol Hill, in a campaign led by groups such as the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, which spent $1.2 million on lobbying in 2016, according to federal disclosures. </p><p>Trade groups like NCTA-The Internet and Television Association, the Information Technology Industry Council and the Data &amp; Marketing Association also pushed for lawmakers to make the privacy rules a top target for the Congressional Review Act - the once-obscure legislative tool that Republican lawmakers were eager to leverage to undo <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>legacies. </p><p>The industry effort was bolstered by free-market organizations, including Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform and the Koch-backed American Commitment, as well as advertising industry groups and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Consumer groups and Democrats tried to fight back, painting the repeal as brazenly anti-consumer and arguing it will allow telecom companies to run amok with user data. (Other privacy regulators, like the Federal Trade Commission, are barred from policing broadband companies' privacy practices.)</p><p>The telecom industry, though, said the FCC rules are overly strict and could confuse consumers, and repeatedly sought to quash what they saw as liberal \"myths.\"</p><p>\"It's always easier for one side to create a parade of horribles, but when you track back what the charges are they almost never reflect what ISPs are actually doing,\" NCTA Executive Vice President James Assey told reporters before the House vote on Tuesday. </p><p>Industry groups felt they had an ace up their sleeve: For once, a broad coalition of groups representing various parts of the internet ecosystem were all aligned against the FCC's rules. Telecom companies and Silicon Valley firms often find themselves feuding on policies like net neutrality, but their alliance on privacy was key in helping the measure advance, multiple lobbyists said.</p><p>\"In our meetings there was no daylight between our focus and the telecom folks',\" said one tech industry lobbyist who pushed the resolution.</p><p>Lawmakers such as Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who were on record as opposing the rules, introduced resolutions in their respective chambers to ax the regulations, and they found their GOP colleagues eager to go along. In a sign of the broad Republican support for the measure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signed his name to Flake's measure in early March.</p><p>Consumer groups and other supporters of the FCC's privacy rules responded with an aggressive campaign to oppose the repeal. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), one of the House's top privacy advocates, blasted the Republican effort earlier this week in a voter-directed Facebook live chat. And organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation drove tens of thousands of calls to Congress in the day before Tuesday's 215-205 House vote, according to people familiar with the effort.</p><p>But none of that was enough, a factor that the rules' opponents attribute to their months of campaigning.</p><p>\"We'd been talking to congressional offices on this for six months and we weren't going in blind,\" said Vince Jesaitis, ITIC's vice president of government affairs. \"We'd laid that groundwork.\"</p><p>Margaret Harding McGill and Theodoric Meyer contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-236756</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N6Y-5K91-F118-9137-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1021\"/><timeReceived>5:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 31, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The President also tweeted that the escalating trade barriers could raise the prices of Apple[2](NASDAQ:AAPL)products in the U.S. while also calling on the company to build more plants in the U.S to keep costs low.Although we believe that the odds of a full-blown trade war remain low, considering the magnitude of trade between the two countries and also due to China's massive U.S. dollar holdings, Apple investors could be concerned given that the company is dependent on China both as an important manufacturing hub and also as a lucrative market for its products. Below we take a look at the potential impact of a trade war on Apple's stock. </p><p>Although we are in the process of updating our Apple model and price estimate for Wednesday's special event, where the company is expected to launch its three new iPhones, we will use our existing model and price estimate to get a sense of how a potential trade war could impact the company. Margins Could Take A Hit On U.S. Tariffs Apple does a bulk of its manufacturing in China via contract manufacturers such as Foxconn. Although the net value added in China is not very large for most Apple products (for instance, these manufacturing costs on the $800 iPhone 8 Plus are estimated at under $8[3], or 1% of the selling price), Apple's landed costs in the U.S. could rise if tariffs are imposed as its finished goods are shipped from China. In order to circumvent these duties, Apple may be compelled to move production to the U.S. or other markets. While the impact on device assembly costs per se is unlikely to be very significant, the disruption in the company's well-oiled supply chain could be a larger issue as Apple may have to rework its logistics and suppliers. Apple could continue importing products from China even if duties are imposed, although this would increase the company's landed costs and hurt gross margins. Alternatively, the company could rethink its manufacturing strategy (although this is likely to take several years to put into effect). If we assume that Apple's gross margins decline by about 2% from 38% to 36% in FY'19, it could result in a downside of just over 5% to our price estimate for the company based on its forecast FY'19 earnings.A Retaliation Could Hurt Apple's Greater China Operations Another issue is likely to be Apple's business in Greater China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan). The company shippedover 41 million [4]iPhones to China over 2017 and sales to the country over FY'17 stood at about $44.8 billion, accounting for about 20% of total revenues. If a trade war escalates, the Chinese government could make it more difficult for Apple to operate in China, via regulatory pressures and taxes, treating the company as a proxy for the broader United States, making it more difficult for the company to sell its devices in the country. For instance, if iPhone sales in China were to fall by 10 million units in FY'19, it could impact Apple's valuation by close to 5%. That said, it's possible that the Chinese government could be circumspect about retaliation, considering that the Apple supply chain indirectly accounts for roughly 3 million jobs[5] in the country through contract manufacturers.

The complex financial structuring used by the investors essentially moved money around in circles and right into Hailey\u2019s pocket.</p><p>The FT\u2019s Tabby Kinder delved deep into the saga to write this detailed explainer.</p><p>The most controversial element was the \u00a3186m charge Hailey took over all of Comet\u2019s assets, making it a secured lender. This meant it would rank above other creditors in the event of an insolvency.</p><p>In the eight years since Comet went into administration, Hailey has so far been paid \u00a362m. Meanwhile, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HM Revenue &amp; Customs</emphasis>, which is owed \u00a326m, and Comet\u2019s landlords and suppliers, which are owed in excess of \u00a3200m, have received a total of \u00a3500,000.</p><p>That\u2019s despite the fact that the investors behind Hailey had absolutely no skin in the game because they hadn\u2019t put a dime in. They had no incentive to keep Comet from imploding. If they called the loans, the company would go into administration and guess who could pick up from there? Deloitte.</p><p>Moreover, had Kahn investigated the financing, it\u2019s possible he would\u2019ve found it to be illegal. If established, that could\u2019ve cost the Hailey investors millions in profits.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales</emphasis> this month found that Deloitte had failed in its duty to be independent and objective because of its close relationship with the retailer\u2019s acquirers. It was fined \u00a31m.</p><p>Deloitte said it recognised and regretted that its appointment as administrators of Comet fell \u201cbelow the professional standards expected of us, as were certain elements of our work during the administration\u201d.</p><p>Tabby reveals that part way through its investigation, the ICAEW tried to block Deloitte from making more payments to Hailey, but the firm took the matter to court to stop the ICAEW \u201cinterfering in the liquidation when they have no right to do so\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThe demise of Comet is a tale of how cynical corporate greed was aided and abetted by some of the UK\u2019s leading professional services firms,\u201d one person involved in the inquiry said.</p><p>Kahn himself was fined \u00a350,000 for his role in the Comet scandal. He told the Financial Times: \u201cThroughout my career I have always tried to achieve the best result for all involved, often in difficult circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Kahn has a new line of business now \u2014 a turnround fund called <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blandford Capital</emphasis> that buys up distressed companies. Greybull co-founder <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nathaniel Meyohas</emphasis> is his partner.</p><p>Barclays\u2019 Staley faces the Epstein question</p><p>In a call with reporters today, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barclays</emphasis> chief executive <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jes Staley</emphasis> discussed the UK bank\u2019s strong results for 2019. But, if anyone was interested, they didn\u2019t show it.</p><p>When question time came around there was only one topic that came up: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeffrey Epstein</emphasis>.</p><p>Staley (pictured below) has become the latest powerful figure to be investigated over his ties with the disgraced financier who died last year while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>The UK\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Conduct Authority</emphasis> and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bank of England</emphasis>\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prudential Regulation Authority</emphasis> are investigating Staley\u2019s \u201ccharacterisation\u201d of his relationship with Epstein.</p><p>Staley told reporters that he had developed a professional relationship with Epstein dating back to 2000 when he took over <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase</emphasis>\u2019s private bank, which counted the disgraced financier as a client.</p><p>Staley insisted that he had cut ties with Epstein in 2015, but not before he visited the sex offender\u2019s Caribbean island on his yacht.</p><p>\u201cObviously, I thought I knew him well and I didn\u2019t and, for sure, with hindsight, I deeply regret having had any relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d he said.</p><p>UK regulators are trying to figure out whether the relationship was strictly professional, as Staley has indicated. A cache of emails supplied by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase</emphasis> may suggest otherwise.</p><p>It\u2019s the second time during Staley\u2019s tenure that his judgment has come into question. He managed to hold on to his job by the skin of his teeth over a 2017 scandal that saw him fined \u00a3640,000 for trying to unmask the identity of a whistleblower.</p><p>Barclays\u2019 board has insisted it will stand by its CEO and will recommend him for re-election at this year\u2019s annual meeting. But it may be too soon to tell how this will play out.</p><p>Staley\u2019s peers over the Atlantic have struggled to shake Epstein from their past. Hedge fund veteran <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Glenn Dubin</emphasis> severed ties with the fund he founded as concerns were raised over his ties to Epstein. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">L Brands</emphasis>\u2019 billionaire founder <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leslie Wexner</emphasis>, who was Epstein\u2019s only known client for decades, is in talks about giving up his role as chief executive.</p><p>Our colleagues at the Lex column conclude that after his earlier mis-step with regulators, the risk is real that Staley loses his job this time.</p><p>Tesla announces a capital raise Musk said didn\u2019t make sense</p><p>You have to be really bold to ask investors for billions of dollars in fresh funding in the same breath as disclosing that regulators are going over your \u201cfinancing arrangements\u201d. But this is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tesla</emphasis> we\u2019re talking about.</p><p>Just a matter of weeks after chief executive <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elon Musk</emphasis> said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make\u201d sense for the electric car maker to raise more cash, Tesla is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009raising more cash \u2014 $2.3bn to be specific, through a new public offering. \u203e\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u203e</p><p>Musk (pictured below) swore off raising money back in 2018 even as analysts insisted Tesla may have to since the company was burning through billions of dollars. And on a call last week, Musk said: \u201cDiluting the company to pay down debt doesn\u2019t sound like a wise move.\u201d Yet here we are.</p><p>Who can blame him? Tesla is riding a stock market high. The company\u2019s shares have been on a vertiginous rally over the past few weeks that has seen the price inch ever closer to the $1,000 mark.

The report opened with an anecdote meant to illustrate the problem. A Texas-based freelancer suddenly found her inbox flooded with spam, from sale promotions to fake job offers, and realized that someone had subscribed her to dozens of email lists; she suspected that the culprit was a bigoted commenter previously banned from a website for which she wrote. It was, the report quoted her as saying, \"kind of scary.\"</p><p>Given that CPJ deals with issues that range from censorship to beatings, kidnappings, and even murders of journalists, junk-mail bombing seems like the epitome of a First World Problem. (I say that as someone targeted by a similar prank a couple of years ago.) Yet such trivial annoyances show up quite frequently in accounts that treat online abuse as an extremely grave social problem.</p><p>CPJ is far from the only organization to address the issue. A 2018 report from Amnesty International, a globally revered human rights advocacy group, was titled Toxic Twitter and examined \"violence and abuse against women online.\" The same year, PEN America, the nearly 100-year-old nonprofit that promotes freedom of speech, issued a statement describing online harassment as a \"clear threat to free expression.\" The United Nations has also weighed in, holding its first hearing on the subject in 2015.</p><p>Some of the behavior that falls under the general umbrella of \"online harassment\" is not only noxious but genuinely frightening and even criminal. The article by journalist Amanda Hess that set off the current panic--\"Why Women Aren't Welcome on the Internet,\" published by Pacific Standard in January 2014--discussed Hess' own experience of being cyberstalked by a man who progressed from tweets to emails to threatening phone calls. In other cases, harassment in cyberspace crosses over into real life via \"swatting\": prank emergency calls that dispatch law enforcement to handle a supposed dangerous situation. In 2017, police in Wichita, Kansas, shot and killed an unarmed 28-year-old man after one such fraudulent 911 call.</p><p>The rapid evolution of the internet has often outpaced the law's ability to deal with cybercrime, including stalking and threats. Unfortunately, as with many other issues, the discussion of online harassment easily lends itself to catastrophizing. Every \"go jump off a cliff\" tweet becomes virtual terrorism, grounds for social media banishment if not criminal investigation. The sense of urgency is amplified by shoddy analysis, politically driven double standards, and \"do something!\" calls to action--action that often involves speech suppression.</p><p>THE GREAT THING about the internet is that you can reach just about anyone, anywhere, in an instant. The awful thing about the internet is that just about anyone, from anywhere, can reach you in an instant. As a journalist, you can reach vast numbers of new readers, connect with fans, and find information that would once have been out of reach; you can also get nasty messages from hundreds of haters who no longer have to take the effort to mail a letter.</p><p>Online harassment is far from the first internet-related panic--remember sex fiends lurking in chat rooms? But while earlier alarmism about online horrors usually came from the right and was not overtly political, the panic about internet harassment has come primarily from the left and is transparently politicized in its selection of \"deserving\" victims.</p><p>Hess' Pacific Standard article came just two weeks after a woman named Justine Sacco watched her life fall apart because of an internet mob. On her way from London to Cape Town, Sacco tweeted a joke meant to mock the privileged \"bubble\" of affluent Americans: \"Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!\" The tweet went viral, and by the time Sacco landed she was not only jobless but so infamous some hotels canceled her bookings.</p><p>This was a textbook example of online harassment. Yet neither Hess' article nor the ensuing conversation mentioned Sacco's ordeal. When British journalist Jon Ronson wrote about it a year later in So You've Been Publicly Shamed (Riverhead Books), many faulted him for being too sympathetic. A Washington Post essay by academic and author Patrick Blanchfield chided those who would turn this \"30-something, well-educated, relatively affluent white woman\" into the \"martyr of choice\" for internet abuse. Blanchfield's own martyrs of choice included successful white feminists targeted by right-wing trolls.</p><p>\"People are much more likely to view things done or said to their side as harassment and to view what happens to people they don't like as just something they should deal with, or not that bad, or maybe made up,\" says Ken White, a Los Angeles -- based criminal defense attorney and First Amendment litigator who blogs and tweets under the handle \"Popehat.\"</p><p>In the case of online harassment, narratives from the progressive tribe have dominated mainstream media coverage and advocacy. That means concerns about online harassment don't usually extend, for instance, to outrage cycles targeting alleged bigots, even when the outrage is misplaced.</p><p>In November 2018, a Portland, Oregon, woman nicknamed \"Crosswalk Cathy\" had to scrub her online presence after a viral video pilloried her for calling the cops on a black couple over a bad parking job. But subsequent reports revealed she called a parking hotline about a car partially blocking a crosswalk while the owners, who were getting takeout food nearby, were away from the car--meaning she had no idea they were black.</p><p>Nor do progressive concerns about harassment extend to victims of online vigilantism for ostensibly noble causes. A few years ago, in the wake of a teen girl's highly publicized sexual assault by two high school football players in Steubenville, Ohio, many locals experienced egregious harassment by members of the \"hacktivist\" group Anonymous. Emails were hacked and personal data posted online. Jim Parks, the webmaster of the football team's fan site, was accused of being the mastermind of a teen porn ring because of supposed photos of nude underage girls found in his email account. (The subjects all turned out to be adult women, and the principal hacker, Deric Lostutter, who was later identified and questioned by the FBI, issued a public apology to Parks for the \"embarrassment\" he had suffered.) Others--adults and teenagers--were smeared as accomplices to rape and barraged with threats. Yet when Lostutter faced possible criminal charges several months later, much progressive opinion treated him as a hero. Parks, who described Anonymous as \"terrorists,\" would no doubt have disagreed.</p><p>In late 2014, a few months after Hess' influential article, the internet conflagration known as GamerGate--in which various members of the video game community battled over sexism in the gaming industry and press--broke out. Death threats eventually forced feminist video game critic Anita Sarkeesian to temporarily leave her home and cancel a lecture.</p><p>Yet progressive critics of GamerGate quickly began to conflate actual threats with mere disagreeable speech. Perspectives on Harmful Speech Online, published in 2017 by Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society, includes a discussion of \"sealioning,\" defined as \"persistent questioning [combined] with a loudly-insisted-upon commitment to reasonable debate.\" (The term originates from a 2014 web comic in which a couple is pestered by a talking sea lion.) Testifying before a 2015 U.N. panel, Sarkeesian insisted that \"cyberviolence\" includes not only actual threats but \"the day-to-day grind of, 'You're a liar,' 'You suck,'\" as well as \"hate videos\" attacking her critiques of sexism in video games.</p><p>GamerGate spurred on anti-harassment measures by many big tech companies, usually developed in close collaboration with social justice activists. A roundtable discussion of Silicon Valley's efforts to curb online harassment, published in Wired in late 2015 and prominently featuring Twitter Vice President for Trust and Safety Del Harvey, was notable for its explicit assumption that solutions to harassment should focus on \"marginalized\" victims--\"women, people of color, and LGBT people\"--and should help progressive causes. In early 2016, Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency website was officially listed as part of Twitter's Trust and Safety Council--along with about 40 other organizations, many of which have a censorious bent.</p><p>Some anti-harassment measures by social media platforms have been uncontroversial. Twitter, for instance, has made it easier to ignore hostile messages by blocking and muting or receiving notifications only from known accounts. But other, more heavy-handed measures--account restrictions, suspensions, and bans--have resulted in pitched battles over double standards, political biases, and uneven enforcement.</p><p>In February 2016, Twitter abruptly perma-banned far-right blogger Robert Stacey McCain for \"targeted abuse,\" without ever pointing to actual abusive tweets. McCain, who has peddled racist fare and posted rants against homosexuality, is not a sympathetic figure. But unlike, say, former Breitbart writer and professional troll Milo Yiannopoulos, who joined him in Twitter exile a few months later, McCain neither instigated nor participated in online attacks. Plenty of people who found his views abhorrent nonetheless felt that his banishment was a clear sign of biased enforcement; some wondered if it was related to his vitriolic polemics against Sarkeesian, newly elevated to Twitter's Trust and Safety Council.</p><p>McCain's ban boosted complaints on the right about the social media platforms' left-wing bias--a theme incessantly flogged by Breitbart but also echoed by more moderate conservatives. Around the same time, First Amendment attorney and blogger Marc Randazza reported an unscientific but plausible experiment in which he tracked both actual Twitter users and his own \"decoy\" handles and found that conservatives were disciplined for nasty tweets far more than social justice or feminist accounts.</p><p>The online wars have since escalated to an even higher pitch, with Donald Trump and the Trumpian right on one side and the \"Resistance\" and hyper-\"woke\" left on the other.</p><p>The alt-right's manic trolling, which included bombarding anti-Trump journalists with grotesque racist and anti-Semitic memes, has solidified the view that online harassment is something that comes predominantly from right-wingers and bigots. Meanwhile, on the left, new clashes over free speech and social media harassment have focused on the battles between transgender activists and radical feminists who believe that allowing trans women access to single-sex female spaces jeopardizes women's safety. In November 2018, shortly after Twitter amended its policy to prohibit \"misgendering\" as a form of \"hateful conduct,\" Canadian feminist author and activist Megan Murphy was banned for using male pronouns to refer to Jessica Yaniv, the notorious litigant in British Columbia who (unsuccessfully) demanded that beauticians who wax women's pubic hair be forced to serve transgender women with intact male genitals.</p><p>Does biased enforcement on social media platforms pose a free speech problem? To free speech advocates such as White, the answer is a clear no: Twitter, Facebook, et al. are private entities with their own free association rights. \"If they don't want Nazis, or they don't want vegans, that's them and that's part of their expression,\" White says. If social media companies restrict too much legitimate speech, he adds, \"the best remedy is for people to create their own communities or vote with their feet.\"</p><p>White emphatically rejects the idea--advanced, for instance, by current Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai--that speech policing by social media platforms weakens essential liberal values and norms. Pai, then an FCC commissioner, told The Washington Examiner in 2016 that \"there are certain cultural values that undergird the [First A]mendment that are critical for its protections to have actual meaning.\" White sees it very differently: If anything, he says, voluntary speech moderation by social media companies is a \"safety valve\" that protects \"a culture of legal free speech\" by letting people have online spaces in which they don't have to deal with verbal abuse or overt bigotry.</p><p>At the other end, people as politically different as conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham and the Electronic Frontier Foundation's William Budington believe that big social media companies should be regulated as public utilities. Facebook and Twitter, Budington writes by email, are \"closed platforms with no socially viable alternatives.\" While he would much rather see them \"exchange freely with newcomers\" in a competitive environment, he says, the realistic option is to regulate them to ensure fair access.</p><p>Somewhere in the middle, legal scholar and author Nadine Strossen, a former head of the American Civil Liberties Union whose most recent book is Hate: Why We Should Resist It With Free Speech, Not Censorship (Oxford University Press), agrees that the internet giants are not obliged to abide by First Amendment speech protections and have the right to moderate content without government interference. But she also believes that powerful institutions have a moral responsibility to safeguard speech. \"It would behoove them from abusiness perspective\" as well, she says, since politically fraught speech restrictions will never satisfy everyone and will only invite attack from both sides. (And so they do.)</p><p>At worst, the policing of broadly defined internet harassment can cross the line into the suppression of speech by law--particularly in countries without First Amendment-type speech protections.</p><p>In England, where the Malicious Communications Act of 2003 prohibits electronic messages that cause \"annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety,\" several people have faced criminal charges for alleged online harassment of transgender activists, based largely on \"misgendering.\" One defendant was self-described transsexual Miranda Yardley, whose case was dismissed on the first day of trial. (Yardley was accused of outing an activist's transgender child, but evidence showed that the activist herself had frequently mentioned the child on Twitter.) Others, including prominent Irish comedian Graham Linehan, have been questioned and warned by the police for using the wrong pronouns.</p><p>In Canada, Toronto-based graphic artist Gregory Alan Elliott was prosecuted for criminal harassment over Twitter fights with two local feminists, Stephanie Guthrie and Heather Reilly--which started, ironically enough, when Elliott criticized Guthrie for proposing to \"sic\" internet mobs on the creator of a video game that allowed players to digitally \"beat up\" Sarkeesian. Elliott created a #FascistFeminists hashtag to denounce Guthrie and Reilly; they and their supporters monitored his tweets and repeatedly blasted him as a misogynistic creep. There was a lot of mutual sniping and name-calling, but even the police conceded that none of Elliott's tweets were threatening or sexually harassing.</p><p>When Elliott was finally acquitted in January 2016 after a three-year legal battle that destroyed his business, Canadian and American feminists deplored the verdict as a failure to take online harassment seriously. (Disclosure: I participated in a fundraiser for Elliott's defense in 2015.)</p><p>In the U.S., the First Amendment remains a strong bulwark against criminalizing speech in the war on internet harassment (despite a couple of cases in which misguided judges have issued unconstitutional restraining orders forbidding someone to \"harass\" a public figure by writing about him or her online). One potential weak spot, however, is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which rightly exempts internet platforms from liability for user-posted content.</p><p>\"That's the thing that people are taking the most shots at, and I think people underestimate how important it is to how the internet works,\" White says.</p><p>As often happens, the pressure is coming from both directions. In 2015, left-wing commentator and self-styled \"social justice stormtrooper\" Arthur Chu wrote an article for Tech-Crunch urging the repeal of Section 230 to combat the scourge of online harassment. Four years later, Sen. Josh Hawley (R--Mo.) introduced legislation to amend Section 230 by requiring large tech platforms to be \"politically neutral\" in moderating content, largely in response to conservative complaints about unfair enforcement of harassment policies.</p><p>HOW BAD A problem is internet harassment? The Pew Research Center's most recent study, in 2017, found that over 40 percent of Americans had experienced online harassment and nearly one in five had been subjected to \"severe\" harassment, defined as physical threats, sexual harassment, sustained harassment, or stalking. Yet the Pew report also acknowledged that its conclusions were complicated by subjective definitions. Notably, even among people classified as victims of \"severe\" online harassment, 28 percent did not consider their experiences to be harassment and another 21 percent were not sure. Gender makes a difference: Only 31 percent of men who had experienced online harassment as defined in the report felt that the term applied to their most recent incident, but 42 percent of women did.</p><p>This gap points to the complex gender dynamics at play--and the trouble with framing the problem as a particular burden on women. \"You would have to show pretty extensive evidence about disproportionate impact and intent,\" says Strossen, who cautions against the notion that \"women are inherently more vulnerable to this kind of attack because of who we are.\"</p><p>In fact, studies consistently show fewer women than men saying they experience internet harassment of every kind, except for sexual harassment. Counterintuitively, even so-called revenge porn--nonconsensual exposure of intimate images--may happen to men more often, according to the 2017 Pew survey. And while women in the survey were considerably more likely than men to rate their online harassment experiences as extremely or very upsetting, they were no more likely to report negative consequences ranging from mental and emotional stress to problems at work or school. More women--70 percent vs. 54 percent of men--saw online harassment as a major problem, but only 36 percent of women (compared to a quarter of men) wanted stronger laws to deal with it.</p><p>There is no question that online harassment can be terrifying, or at least severely disruptive. In 2016, a Jewish real estate agent in Whitefish, Montana, was deluged with threatening calls after the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer targeted her--and posted her phone number--for supposedly trying to pressure the mother of white nationalist Richard Spencer into selling her home. Last November, a Honolulu man was arrested for using both online ads and the telephone to direct hundreds of unwanted service calls and food deliveries to the home of his former girlfriend over the course of a year.</p><p>Most of what is commonly labeled \"online harassment\" is far less extreme, though some of it, like other human conflict, can be extremely stressful and injurious. The internet makes both a negative and a positive difference: Malicious gossip can now spread much faster and wider than before, but its targets also have many more opportunities to learn about it and counter it.</p><p>Some supposed harassment is vaguely and subjectively defined: One person's \"callout\" is another's \"cyberbullying.\" Even \"doxing,\" or public disclosure of private information, turns out to be a flexible concept: A Twitter user once accused me of doxing her because I mentioned a job listed in her public Twitter profile. Ultimately, most so-called internet harassment is simply trash talk--a minor annoyance that we can learn to handle by, as Strossen puts it, \"developing resilience.\"</p><p>The current panic has also made it possible to use accusations of harassment as a weapon to silence criticism--and even to harass one's critics. In February 2016, I watched a blow-up in which a male Twitter user repeatedly asked a fairly big-name progressive female journalist to correct a tweet containing erroneous information; the journalist responded by tweeting at the man's employer to accuse him of \"hounding strange women on Twitter during work hours\" (and by mobilizing her followers to dogpile him as a harasser).</p><p>At its core, the online harassment crusade is a push for political control over speech. It is happening in the midst of growing authoritarian sympathies on the right and growing hostility to First Amendment protections for \"harmful\" speech on the left. Legally, those protections remain as robust as ever--for now. But in these unpredictable times, it would be reckless to assume that the erosion of basic freedoms is something that can't happen here.</p><p>Contributing Editor CATHY YOUNG is the author of Ceasefire: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality (Free Press).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-617286071</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 617286071</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDV-WVP1-DYTM-90SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Reason Foundation</copyright><publicationName>Reason</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0048-6906</issn><volume>Vol. 51</volume><issueNumber>No. 11\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 1, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Humanities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Philosophy and religion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political science</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cyberbullying</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Freedom of the press</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Harassment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Harassment (Law)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Communications Decency Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZFRThGRDIyOERDNDRBNzlCRUMzNkNBMDIzRDU5NTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkEyQUE3Q0ZGNTBBNDZBQkI4Qjg5MjlFREFGQjZENDM</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjJBNjQ3RjNENTI2NEVCQkJFMTI4RTMxNzIyM0QyNjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

However, in recent years, banks have faced tremendous upheaval in the face of advancing technology, political uncertainty, and economic instability. And now, coronavirus is disrupting everything further. How can banking leaders deal with constant disruption while maintaining allimportant customer focus?</p><p>The onset of fintech innovative technology disrupting traditional banking methods has really shaken up the banking industry. The major players still dominate, but they now coexist in an increasingly crowded market alongside startups, challenger banks and other recent entrants which include big tech companies such as Apple and Google. Customers are demanding more in an era of unprecedented convenience and speed.</p><p>Faced with unprecedented change, leaders in agile organisations need to be both enablers and disruptors, creating a joinedup business while at the same time challenging how it operates at the most fundamental level\"</p><h>Leading in an age of uncertainty</h><p>Today's most successful banking leaders are adept at building organisations which can adapt quickly to changing competitive conditions. These organisations tend to be agile: innovative, good at meeting customer needs, and highly productive.</p><p>Agile leaders can accelerate action when needed, as they and their teams sense the opportunities and threats around them. This results in entrepreneurial opportunism making the right choices, understanding where to invest innovation efforts to meet current or future customer needs, quickly.</p><p>These leaders appreciate the need to experiment, to fail fast if that is the result of the experiment, and to learn to improve the odds the next time. They obsess about getting better, about continuous improvement, with an intolerance of waste and a desire to minimise time to serve the customer.</p><p>In an era of big data, they practise the critical interpretation of data to see the patterns, to learn about what colleagues and customers want, and what motivates their behaviour. This focus on learning, getting better every day, and assimilating new ways of thinking and performing, is at the heart of the agile leader's mindset.</p><h>Fostering innovation</h><p>Many major banks have responded to increased competition by developing innovative new products and services to attract new customers and retain existing ones. Innovation can be challenging in huge organisations with layers of bureaucracy and legacy systems to navigate.</p><p>An aversion to risk is a huge barrier to innovation and agility. The banking industry is heavily regulated. It is of course important for banks should remain legal and compliant with relevant regulations risk management is important. However, in some large institutions, the legacy of process and procedure can become a blocker and create a culture of caution. This inhibits experimentation and slows down innovation and improvement. If we fear making mistakes, the only thing we will learn is how to avoid them.</p><p>Some banks have successfully introduced innovation hubs or 'incubators' where groups of people can collaborate, experiment, and spark new ideas in a safe environment. Many have invited startups in to help create this spark.</p><h>Enable and disrupt</h><p>So how can banking leaders get the balance right between creating cohesion while also challenging the assumptions which underpin it? Faced with unprecedented change, leaders in agile organisations need to be both enablers and disruptors, creating a joinedup business while at the same time challenging how it operates at the most fundamental level.</p><p>On the enabler side, agile leaders create organisations that can respond quickly to changing customer demands and competitor behaviour. They are good at empowering the people around them, devolving responsibility so that decisions can be made as close to the customer as possible. They create connected organisations, able to move as a whole with ease.</p><p>At the same time, agile leaders are skilled at identifying the need for pivotal changes. They look for opportunities to reinvent their operating model to create or anticipate disruption in their industry. They encourage new ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to events among their colleagues developing a shared disruptive mindset.</p><p>Innovation is a disruptive process, creating novelty and changing how things work. Through it, businesses can create new value for customers by adapting existing products and services or creating new ones that either revolutionise or disrupt existing markets.</p><h>Focus on customers</h><p>Successful innovation is customer driven. It is focused on what customers want most (whether they realise it now or not), and prioritising activity to concentrate on the activities that will meet that \"want\" as fully as possible, as quickly as possible.</p><p>Agile innovation begins without knowing necessarily the outcome, focusing on the highest priority customer problems to solve, and working intelligently to solve these together.</p><p>If leaders are more open to learning and experimentation, they are more likely to boost innovation across entire organisations which benefits customers and colleagues alike.</p><h>L&amp;D job opportunities on Personnel Today</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://jobs.personneltoday.com/jobs/learninganddevelopment/\"> Browse more L&amp;D jobs </url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PTODAY-250127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PTODAY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD7-09H1-DYX4-935K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">249302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"908\"/><timeReceived>00:02Invalid date found for VDI: (VDI not available) XCEDOCID: 9 LNI: 5YD7-09H1-DYX4-935K-00000-00.

Representing one-fifth of global banking revenues, SMEs generate around $850 billion of annual revenue for banks-a pool expected to grow by approximately 7 percent annually over the next seven years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a customer segment, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/reinventing-small-and-medium-size-business-banking-in-the-us\">SMEs offer vast potential</url>. However, the profits of SME-focused banks have traditionally lagged behind those that specialize in other customers, often because of highly varied credit quality in the portfolio. Finding the optimal balance between providing a great customer experience and managing the cost to serve has also proven to be difficult. As a result, many banks have not prioritized SMEs-forsaking the vast potential value and leaving many SMEs feeling that their needs are ignored.</p><p>But now, new customer propositions and better service models enabled by technology are creating opportunities for much more lucrative returns. Fintechs are entering the business, as are the big tech companies, with innovative service models that reduce costs and increase revenue (Exhibit 1). Their offerings include traditional banking products and many other business services, such as invoice management, payroll support, tax preparation, and inventory management. Such beyond-banking ecosystem offerings target customers' fundamental needs in a single, easy-to-use service. Even better, they answer the primary challenge of SMEs, as identified by our survey of more than 500 business owners: giving entrepreneurs more time to focus on their core business activities.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial Services/Our Insights/How banks can use ecosystems to win in the SME market/SVGZ-How banks use ecosystems-ex1-revised.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>Digital companies are staking a claim on the opportunity. But ecosystems are an attractive play for any service business that can claim ownership of the primary customer relationship. Those that have the strongest relationship with the customer enjoy the highest profit margins in ecosystems and thus the most sustainable and lucrative business model. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/winning-in-a-world-of-ecosystems\">Participating in an ecosystem, or organizing one</url>, provides the opportunity to boost otherwise shrinking banking returns.</p><h>Taking a strategic role in an ecosystem</h><p>Banks enjoy competitive advantages compared to other relevant players, such as tech giants and telcos. As banks contemplate an ecosystem play, they should consider three strategic roles they might assume.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Participate</emphasis></h><p>Banks can provide financial services to at-scale competitors that are building ecosystems from bases in other industries. This strategy can bring in revenue by reaping spillover benefits as banks add new customers from other business systems. While this role grants the lowest financial opportunity overall, it helps banks monetize their product portfolios with minimal additional investments. A typical example is GoBank in the United States, a company that teamed up with Uber Technologies to offer certain banking services to the entrepreneurs on the ridesharing platform. In this setup, the bank gains access to a vast customer base, while the platform operator earns revenue from connecting the parties.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Orchestrate</emphasis></h><p>Banks can also become the primary integrators of partnerships and thus reduce the scale of investment and complexity of execution. In this case, the bank becomes the primary-and ideally the only-provider of financial services. One example is Idea Bank in Poland, a company founded in 2015 that provides end-to-end financial- and business-services support for SMEs and start-ups through a cloud-based platform. Beyond-banking services offered by Idea Bank include concierge support in dealing with the state, accounting services through a subsidiary company, cash-flow analytics tools, and promotion support. As part of this ecosystem, in 2017, the bank launched a bookkeeping application for Uber driver-partners, offering lower costs and higher security than rival services.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Build</emphasis></h><p>Finally, banks can build new businesses within and across ecosystems. This role provides the most significant financial and nonfinancial benefits; however, it is also the hardest to pull off. OTP Bank in Central and Eastern Europe launched a state-of-the-art solution called eBIZ, which is essentially an online financial-management tool for SMEs. In Canada, Royal Bank of Canada introduced a cutting-edge, end-to-end online platform called Ownr, which offers a comprehensive set of services that assist in setting up and managing a new business in Canada. Ownr helps with tasks such as registering a business as a sole proprietorship or incorporation, building a logo and brand, and bringing together information from marketing campaigns, website traffic, and sales activity to get a better understanding of the business.</p><h>Building an ecosystem platform</h><p>Partnerships are an important component of all three roles. But for banks that choose to compete with a beyond-banking ecosystem, partnership is only the first step. Orchestrating or building a successful ecosystem platform requires banks to rethink their value proposition and develop an operating model that is different from their traditional business. In our review of several ecosystem efforts recently tested by global companies, we identified five principles to consider when building an ecosystem platform.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Focus on customers' biggest challenges</emphasis></h><p>Across markets, pain points for entrepreneurs vary from basic lending needs to office and factory space to marketplace access (Exhibit 2). Hence, before embarking on the ecosystem journey, banks must research the pain points specific to the market and assess their ability to offer services to allay those pain points. In some markets, we have found that issuing invoices and tracking incoming invoices can be the most significant way financial institutions create value for SMEs. Addressing any other needs at this stage in the cycle could unnecessarily increase the complexity of building such a platform.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial Services/Our Insights/How banks can use ecosystems to win in the SME market/SVGZ-How banks use ecosystems-ex2-revised.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Start with a minimum viable product and scale rapidly</emphasis></h><p>Starting with a minimum viable product (MVP) is straight out of the start-up playbook but not an obvious choice for banks. Most product launches in banks are mass marketed from inception. Further, most new products are variations on current products, rather than totally new products. But an ecosystem offering should start with testing an MVP on a small segment of customers, getting feedback, and then building a full proposition in an agile way. MVPs help in debugging and incorporating feedback, and they accelerate the speed to market.</p><p>Once the MVP has been tested with real customers, banks have two main paths to scale the solution. With larger, established SMEs, one feature (such as invoice tracking) can serve as a hook product to establish a relationship. For newer companies, banks should offer a comprehensive beyond-banking solution built around three to four key features.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Make key IT-design choices early</emphasis></h><p>In parallel to designing the prototype, banks need to think through IT implications at the outset. The design choices will significantly affect the speed of development and the potential reach of the new solution. A design based on integration with an existing banking app might command a larger audience than a new stand-alone application-yet the latter typically offers more flexibility. The choice of a platform should be wedded to the monetization approach (see the \"Think early about monetization\" section). If the bank wants to retain the option of spinning off an ecosystem platform in the future, or listing it separately, its IT should not be enmeshed with the bank's legacy systems. Nor can it be completely divorced: efficient transfer of information between the two systems is needed to maximize value for both banking and nonbanking offerings.</p><p>IT is a key driver of costs and of the ecosystem design and business model. For instance, a Western European bank decided to integrate its ecosystem solution with its mobile banking platform. This caused substantial implementation complexity and delayed the launch but opened up the solution immediately to hundreds of thousands of SMEs.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Think early about monetization</emphasis></h><p>Organizations considering a beyond-banking ecosystem run the risk of offering additional products and services and increasing complexity without necessarily realizing material benefits. An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/deep-insights-broad-solutions-how-banks-can-win-in-the-vast-housing-ecosystem\">ecosystem should be viewed as means to add new forms of value</url>\u00a0and not just a pure customer-acquisition or -retention vehicle. Ecosystems can generate platform revenues in the form of lead generation, recurring fees (such as registration, listing, or subscription fee), and data monetization. If successful, a beyond-banking entity could significantly surpass the valuation of the institution that hatched it, as shown by the likes of Ping An Insurance of China.</p><p>While proper monetization of a beyond-banking offering is difficult, pioneer banks have typically succeeded by building the following revenue streams:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Subscription fees.</emphasis> SMEs that use the platform pay a monthly fee for the services. Typically, there are two or three bundles with a varying number of transactions included in the fee. Fees are often set in comparison with similar solutions on the market (for instance, one European bank charges between (EURO)6 and (EURO)15 per month). To attract users, most banks offer a free trial of three months or so.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Commissions.</emphasis> If a bank is an orchestrator but not a builder of the ecosystem, the actual services will be provided by third parties. In such cases, the bank is entitled to a share of the fees that the providers receive from clients. As billing is done through the platform, the bank administers all financial flows.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Data for better decisions.</emphasis> Banks we have worked with plan to leverage the data and insights they gather about their customers to provide more relevant and tailored offers to recommend products (financial and nonfinancial), optimize pricing, and prevent customer attrition. Yet, it is important to note that few companies build their business case on this lever.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Data monetization.</emphasis> Certain ecosystem orchestrators aim to share the customer-data insights with external parties to generate value. Most banks do not quantify the impact of this lever. Any sales of data will need to abide by relevant regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>The key factor behind the revenue streams is the number of customers. Hence, the go-to-market strategy should focus at first on building a critical mass of clients. Banks will need a clear perspective on how the ecosystem progresses versus the business case.</p><p>Investment need is also a critical driver of the business case. The ambition level defines the investment need. Some banks have spent between (EURO)5 million and (EURO)20 million to build their MVP, depending on the breadth of services offered.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Build a separate digital organization</emphasis></h><p>One pitfall is to house the ecosystem initiative within the bank, typically by giving additional responsibility to the SME-product team. This unit usually lacks the focus required in a start-up, the right governance structure to ensure top-management attention, and the relevant skills needed to execute.</p><p>On these grounds, too, banks need to establish a separate entity with clear governance for interaction with the parent company. Once established, the new digital organization must develop a new talent proposition. Our experience suggests that the bulk of new management will likely be sourced externally. Key industries from which to source platform talent include e-commerce and other technology companies.</p><p>Creating an ecosystem offering for SMEs is a high-risk, high-reward bet. Success will not be a simple task. Yet, done right, it offers immense value for business owners and banks. Those who can find the right recipe for their markets will be able to establish a far-reaching competitive edge and solidify their standing with their small-business customers-both in financial services and beyond. Banks that invest early have a strong starting point to unlock the potential.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Download\u00a0</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial services/our insights/how banks can use ecosystems to win in the sme market/how-banks-can-use-ecosystems-to-win-in-the-sme-market-vf.ashx\">Beyond banking: How banks can use ecosystems to win in the SME market</url>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the full report on which this article is based (PDF-1 MB).</emphasis></p><h>About the authors</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chira Barua</emphasis> is a partner in McKinsey's London office, where <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Balazs Gati</emphasis> is an associate partner, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tara Lajumoke</emphasis> is a consultant, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=FF9453D2ADA1429BBD06017E8D6195DD&amp;_z=z\">Zubin Taraporevala</url></emphasis> is a senior partner;

Barclays hope to end up with more engaged and happy customers, who feel they get something out of being with the bank.</p><p>The service for small firms is called Local Inisghts, and can give firms information about local economic activity that will help them improve.</p><p>\"What you're basically saying to a small business is 'let us help you grow, because by understanding your business you can grow'\" says Simon. The bank's aim is that customers will grow, stay with Barclays , bringing in increased deposits and fees.</p><p>For individuals, there is the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.barclays.co.uk/SmartSpend/P1242688010266\">Smart Spend</url> programme, which aims to reduce items such as utility bills by comparing what is paid by people of similar demographics.</p><p>\"The average customer that's done that [changed fuel bill] and we have a few hundred a month that go through that process, have saved an average of \u00a3260 a year,\" said Simon.</p><p>The product can also do things like giving customers money back on things they want, such as holidays booked through Expedia.</p><p>Simon said that people says \"I want the bank to help me make sensible decisions about my life and my money. I don't want my bank throwing stuff at me, i.e. making me impulse purchase,\" and this is what these products aim to do.</p><p>Barclays has also become the only bank to to sign up as an idap provider of identity for the Government, as part of the .gov.verify programme.</p><p>It is fairly obvious then that even the most prominent fintech firms would not yet have the capacity to do the all this, at the scale an institution like Barclays can. However, just three years ago, Barclays did not have the capacity either.</p><p>Simon said that historically the firm would have had to use a huge Oracle database, and \"to process across all our small business customers on a daily bases it's about six weeks work of processing data.\"</p><p>Six weeks is hardly useful for a small business under daily pressure to survive and trying to grow.</p><p>Things have changed now though, Simon explains, thanks to the increased processing speed, and reduced cost of a Hadoop stack.</p><p>\"What we have done to do this now is we've started to implement 2m rows of data here. So that six week query in terms of why do this now versus why we couldn't do this three years ago, we can now generate those insights for customers in about 21 minutes. We can run that overnight. Can tell something relevant to the customer every day.\"</p><p>It is a significant time shift that turns the data from something the bank holds onto, to something that can be of genuine use to a customer.</p><p>\"There is a technology capability that exists now that didn't exist two or three years ago that lets us do stuff that is timely, relevant and insightful for the customer,\" said Simon.</p><p>The kind of technology that is helping more and more data driven fintech firms to spring up is now allowing a big beast like Barclays to stay ahead of them too.</p><p>Is Simon worried about a big tech beast like Google coming into banking though, and would that pose Barclays with bigger challenges thank the Starlings, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cbronline.com/news/mobility/security/digital-bank-atom-to-secure-banking-apps-with-biometrics-4756447\">Atoms</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cbronline.com/news/cloud/aas/metro-the-bank-built-on-as-a-service-offerings-4738568\">Metro Banks</url> of this world?</p><p>He is personally not convinced that Google would have any interest in taking on many of the burdens a traditional bank does, like carrying cash.</p><p>\"It is more likely, like you see with Amazon, about being able to offer instalment credit, because you can make a 20-30 per cent return on that with the data you have, without necessarily having to open a branch,\" he said.</p><p>What's clear from speaking to Simon is the environment around financial institutions is changing.</p><p>\"Every startup bank, and most of the established players are mobilising to one degree or another around the opportunity\" of data, he said</p><p>Regulatory changes have also prompted a shift. You look at things like the open bank working group which is this whole view that there is a democratisation of data, he said.</p><p>For Barclays it was also about internal learning how to be agile, said Simon: \"We've done all of this agile, with a capital A in terms of software development. I.e heavily engage with customers, rapid prototyping, and actually by doing this in somewhat new frontier the bank can learn and the bank can be more agile in its core.\"</p><p>Customers are becoming more aware of the firms that hold their data, and are prepared to give it up that information for something in return.</p><p>Simon believes that banks now have to prove they are using that data in a way that is relevant to customers to engage with them and stay relevant, especially with fintechs coming up the outside to challenge them:</p><p>\"To some extent if you think about a world where historically an advantage a bank had was about the data it held about customers, roll forward in a world where customers can choose who holds that data, who can see that data, what they want that data used for. Just the fact that we can as a bank hold data doesn't actually make us relevant to the customer in the future. \"</p><p>As with so many industries these days, the battle between old and new in financial services has data as its key weapon. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PDMNEW-4785259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PDMNEW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HWH-M561-JCF9-2557-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1134\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Progressive Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Progressive Media - Company News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33806\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 14, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000210N</classCode><className>BARCLAYS PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>TAPR (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BCS (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BARC (LSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGF</classCode><className>LIBERAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

One of the most alarming revelations was that the U.S. had nowhere near the number of ventilators and other life-saving medical equipment it needed to fight the virus. That's largely because of a surprising culprit: the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In April 2020, theNew York Timesreported[2]on medtech giant Covidien's 2012 acquisition of Newport Medical Instruments, a small company tasked by public health officials to produce portable ventilators to replenish the Strategic National Stockpile, an integrated collection of secret, federally-controlled warehouses stocked with critical supplies in case of an emergency, such as a terrorist attack or pandemic. Since the two companies have consolidated, however, some problems have arisen. </p><p>Most notably: Covidien canceled Newport's government contract in 2014, meaning that almost eight years after the initial push, the federal government has yet to receive any ventilators. My colleagues and I at the Revolving Door Project recently investigated the merger and found that all of the FTC officials known to be involved in the case have sincemoved on[3]to private law firm positions; many of these law firms, such as Ropes &amp;#38; Gray, pushed hard for the acquisition's approval at the time. This calls into question their interests back when they oversaw the FTC and allowed a deal that would unquestionably crush competition in the ventilator manufacturing sector, leading to the problems we're now facing. We have identified at least one of the lawyers who worked behind the scenes of the merger: Ropes &amp;#38; Gray's Michael McFalls, whoboasts[4]in his professional biography of advising Covidien in this deal. McFalls' professional history, starting with a role at the FTC after years at private law firms, exemplifies the revolving door trajectory of successful antitrust lawyers and their role in economic consolidation. And yet, despite his role in this debacle, one could easily imagine McFalls as a prospective appointee in Biden's FTC or Justice Department. Historically, presidential appointees to the antitrust enforcement agencies have been attorneys with private sector experience. Career civil servants, meanwhile, rarely ascend to top posts. Former Obama administration Bureau of Competition DirectorDebbie Feinstein[5]came to the FTC from a long career at Arnold &amp;#38; Porter, one of the largest law firms in the country, and returned to the same firm when her stint ended.Ian R. Conner[6], the current Bureau of Competition head, started his career at the DOJ's Antitrust Division as a trial attorney, but climbed in rank after years at two private law firms, Hunton &amp;#38; Williams and Kirkland &amp;#38; Ellis. As a private sector antitrust lawyer with FTC experience, McFalls has used his history of working in government to push his pharmaceutical and med tech clients' merger deals through antitrust enforcement agencies. At least one of the cases\u2014the Covidien-Newport merger\u2014had serious, indeed fatal, consequences for American consumers. The world of antitrust law, both in private practice and government, habitually relies on such lawyers. If Joe Biden really hopes to address increasing concentration in the U.S. economy, he must first address the revolving door between government, private law firms, and their corporate clients that consolidate their power through anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions. That means people like McFalls shouldn't have a seat at the new administration's antitrust table. McFalls launched his career as an attorney advising the late Democratic FTC commissioner Robert Pitofsky, the 'apolitical[7]' mentor to many of today's influential antitrust actors across party lines, including current FTC chair Joseph Simons and the former top DOJ Antitrust enforcer Christine Varney. After 'accomplishing[8]pretty much all he set out to do' at the FTC, McFalls leveraged his experience into a position at Jones Day. There, he waspromoted[9]to a partner in the firm's antitrust practice and worked on merger deals, including Google's acquisition ofDoubleClick[10], a merger whose knock-on effects cemented Google's place as the king of search. Allowing Google to acquire DoubleClick\u2014and its early tech which would lead to today's targeted advertising\u2014has grosslyhurt[11]consumer privacy and accelerated the struggles of independent journalism to this day. McFalls' strategies for securing merger approvals draw on his insider experience; in an interview on a 2004 tobacco industry merger, hedescribed[12]his predilection to encourage his client to pose a 'credible threat' of litigation, an exploit aimed at the FTC's general reluctance to go to court. At Ropes &amp;#38; Gray, McFalls helped bring about the 2010'sspike[13]in medtech mergers: Currently, McFallslists[14]more than 18 mergers he advised on, almost all of which fall into the medtech or pharmaceutical industries. McFalls never fails to note when a case proceeds 'without Second Request,' including the Covidien-Newport merger. This means the FTC or DOJ Antitrust Division sought no additional information on how the transaction might be anti-competitive. In other words, he's taking credit for the FTC's failure to meaningfully investigate the competition-harming merger. McFalls also touts his co-chairmanship of the Intellectual Property Committee of the American Bar Association's Antitrust Section. While he ran one of the most influential publications in his legal specialty, McFalls' work mostly fell in line with his clients' interests. For instance, while he was still at Jones Day, he helped write an article on the 'tragedy[15]' of the FTC allowing for increased competition to incumbent pharmaceutical monopolists, i.e. his main clients. Ironically, promoting competition is ostensibly the whole point of antitrust law. McFalls did not respond to multiple requests for comment. If you are a prospective employer\u2014whether public or private\u2014who values antitrust insiders, McFalls' resume is phenomenal. His experience at the FTC, his role in influential mergers, his connections to other antitrust lawyers, and his ABA committee chairmanship all indicate his deep knowledge of antitrust law and precedent. What's more, his many successes and Democratic alignment (McFallsmaxed out[16]donations to the 2012 Obama and 2016 Clinton campaigns) mean that Biden would seem lucky to have him as an antitrust employee. But this view reflects a misguided outlook that Democrats are finally starting to recognize as deeply flawed. In fact, it has led to the high rates of economic concentration that have battered the U.S. economy. If progressives really want more antitrust enforcement from Washington, they will need to pressure a future Biden administration to exclude figures with such experience. That may be an even easier argument to make now\u2014since a lax approach to competition policy has made it all the more difficult to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already taken more than 110,000 American lives. The same people who defend corporate clients are often entrusted with enforcing the very laws they've spent their careers trying to neuter from the other side of the bench. These laws are supposed to safeguard the economy and the rights of workers and consumers. But to actors like McFalls, the goals of antitrust law become secondary tohow they can use their experience at enforcement agencies to more successfully advocate on behalf of harmful consolidation when they go back into higher-paying private firms. As the Covidien-Newport merger highlighted\u2014and plentiful statistical dataproves[17]\u2014the revolving door at the FTC thrives because of an institutional culture. Future revolvers are influenced by like-minded private sector attorneys like McFalls. As a result, an agency designed to protect the nation from monopolistic practices instead fails miserably at defending the public interest. Biden says he wants to reverse the inequities that stem from a highly concentrated economy, like thedecline[18]of small businesses andrising[19]drug prices. If he wins, he will have to prove it. He will need to recognize that 'personnel is policy.' As such, his team must reorganize the antitrust enforcement agencies around experienced, public-interest-focused regulators rather than smart lawyers biding their time until they can make a lucrative rotation through the revolving door.

From the moment our smart phones wake us up, to our watch tracking our morning run, every time we use public transport, every coffee we purchase with a bank card, every song skipped or liked, until we return to bed and let our sleep apps monitor our dreaming habits - all of these technologies are collecting data. This data is used by tech companies to develop their products and provide more services. While film and music recommendations might be useful, the same systems are also being used to decide where to build infrastructure, for facial recognition systems[2] used by the police, or even whether you should get a job interview[3], or who should die in a crash with an autonomous vehicle[4]. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/07/07/how-big-biased-datasets-make-social-inequalities-worse/#Every\">https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/07/07/how-big-biased-datasets-make-social-inequalities-worse/#Every</url> digital device collects data on you and your habits. Fizkes/ShutterstockDespite huge databases of personal information[5], tech companies rarely have enough to make properly informed decisions, and this leads to products and technologies that can enhance social biases and inequality, rather than address them. Microsoft apologized after its chatbot started spewing hate speech[6]. 'Racist' soap dispensers[7] failed to work for people of colour. Algorithm errors caused Flickr to mislabel concentration camps as 'jungle gyms'[8]. CV sorting tools rejected applications from women[9] and there are deep concerns over police use of facial recognition tools[10]. These issues aren't going unnoticed. A recent report[11] found that 28% of UK tech workers were worried that the tech they worked on had negative consequences for society. And UK independent research organisation NESTA has suggested that as the darker sides of digital technology become clearer, 'public demand for more accountable, democratic, more human alternatives is growing[12]'.Traditional solutions are making things worseMost tech companies, big and small, claim they're doing the right things to improve their data practices. Yet, it's often the very fixes they propose that create the biggest problems. These solutions are often borne from the very same ideas, tools and technologies that got us into this mess to begin with. The master's tools, as Audre Lorde said, will never dismantle the master's house. Instead, we need a radically different approach from collecting more data about users, or plugging gaps with more education about digital technology. The reason biases against women or people of color appear in technology are complex. They're often attributed to data sets being incomplete and the fact that the technology is often made by people who aren't from diverse backgrounds. That's one argument at least - and in a sense, it's correct. Increasing the diversity of people working in the tech industry is important. Many companies are also collecting more data to make it more representative of the people who use digital technology, in the vain hope of eliminating racist soap dispensers or recruitment bots that exclude women. The problem is that these are social, not digital, problems. Attempting to solve those problems through more data and better algorithms only serves to hide the underlying causes of inequality. Collecting more data doesn't actually make people better represented, instead it serves to increase how much they are being surveilled by poorly regulated tech companies. The companies become instruments of classification, categorizing people into different groups by gender, ethnicity and economic class, until their database looks balanced and complete. These processes have a limiting effect on personal freedom[13] by eroding privacy and forcing people to self-censor - hiding details of their lives that, for example, potential employers may find and disapprove of. Increasing data collection has disproportionately negative affects on the very groups that the process is supposed to help. Additional data collection leads to the over-monitoring of poorer communities[14] by crime prediction software, or other issues such as minority neighborhoods paying more for car insurance[15] than white neighborhoods with the same risk levels.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/07/07/how-big-biased-datasets-make-social-inequalities-worse/#Big\">https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/07/07/how-big-biased-datasets-make-social-inequalities-worse/#Big</url> Data is watching you. Enzozo/Shutterstock People are often lectured about how they should be careful with their personal data online. They're also encouraged to learn how data is collected and used by the technologies that now rule their lives. While there are some merits to helping people better understand digital technologies, this approaches the problem from the wrong direction. As noted by media scholar, Siva Vaidhyanathan[16], this often does little more than place the burden of making sense of manipulative systems squarely onto the user, who is actually often still left powerless to do anything. Access to education isn't universal either. Inequalities in education and access to digital technologies[17] means that it's often out of reach from just those communities that are most negatively affected by social biases and the digital efforts to address them.Social problems need social solutionsThe tech industry, the media and governments have become obsessed with building ever bigger data sets[18] to iron out social biases. But digital technology alone can never solve social issues. Collecting more data and writing 'better' algorithms may seem helpful, but this only creates the illusion of progress. Turning people's experiences into data hides the causes of social bias - institutional racism, sexism and classism. Digital and data driven 'solutions' distract us from the real issues in society, and away from examining real solutions. These digital tasks, as French philosopher Bernard Stiegler noted[19], only serve to increase the distance between technological systems and social organizations. We need to slow down, stop innovating, and examine social biases not within the technology itself, but in society. Should we even build any of these technologies, or collect any of this data at all? Better representation in the tech industry is vital, but their digital solutions will always fall short. Sociology, ethics, and philosophy have the answers to social inequality in the 21st century.

So what can be learned from how big online businesses operate?</p><p><br/> Below, 15 entrepreneurs from the Young Entrepreneur Council weigh in on what lessons business owners can take away from how big brands run their business. Their best answers are below. 1. Focus on Customer Service<br/> I'm always impressed by Amazon's commitment to customer service: It's rare for such a huge company to be so responsive to the needs of its customers. Amazon doesn't dominate e-commerce just because it sells everything, but because its customers are confident of being treated well where support, returns and refunds are concerned - a lesson any smaller retailer should take to heart.  -Vik Patel, Future Hosting 2. Understand Your Users<br/> First and foremost, Amazon and Facebook invest heavily in understanding and catering to their users. They leverage the likes of RegTech - or regulation technology - not only to ensure they meet Know Your Customer compliance standards, but to also give their users want they want. Large brands want to provide a positive experience for their users: simplicity and ease of use are key.  -Stephen Ufford, Trulioo 3. Have a Robust, Long-Term Vision<br/> Jeff Bezos maintained a strategic long-term vision for Amazon. Amazon started only selling books online, but had larger ambitions to be the everything store. Despite huge investor pressure, Amazon delayed profitability in favor of growing market share and customer trust. Being disruptive takes time. Bezos recognizes this and has stayed true to what he wrote in annual reports from over a decade ago.  -Adelyn Zhou, TOPBOTS 4. Reinvest Profits Strategically<br/> Amazon has been a master class on taking no profit and investing whatever profit there would have been into strategic new areas. By diligently reinvesting for 20 years, Amazon is one of the world's most powerful companies.  -Brennan White, Cortex 5. Solving Hard Problems Creates a Sustainable Moat<br/> Both Facebook and Amazon have solved incredibly difficult business and technical problems. Now that their businesses are moving, it's very hard for any other competitor to jump in and compete. Even when a rival does something innovative (see: Snap), Facebook can adopt the feature to extend its lead. As a startup, don't only go for quick wins. Do the work that truly differentiates you.  -Aaron Schwartz, Modify Watches<br/>  6. Add Value to Your Target Audience<br/> Facebook solves the problem of helping people connect. Amazon solves the problem of delivering low-cost products fast. Both businesses continue to tap into areas they can add value to the world. Fundamentally, business is adding value to your target audience.  -Ismael Wrixen, FE International 7. Stay Hungry<br/> Jeff Bezos has a quote I love: \"Our customers are loyal to us right up until someone offers them a better service.\" It shows the mindset of CEOs in highly competitive markets. They simply do not stop charging hard because they understand that the only reason they're on top is a superior product that they relentlessly protect through innovation  -Mark Krassner, Expectful 8. Understand That Acquisitions Fuel Momentum<br/> Amazon bought Whole Foods, and Facebook bought Instagram: These are just a couple of the acquisitions that these companies have made to maintain momentum. Maintaining growth at their size is hard. They keep the momentum going by innovating, but also by acquiring companies doing things they hope to do. For a small business, if things get stale, look for complementary opportunities around your industry.  -Shawn Schulze, CallerCenter.com 9. Listen to Your Markets<br/> Make sure you're able to hear your market speak and see their wants. Letting go of the \"my way\" mindset and keeping an open mind, with the will to adjust on demand of those loyal to you, will really allow you to explore more space and stay tuned into the ever-changing tech world!  -Nathalie Lussier, AmbitionAlly 10. Use Data to Drive Actions<br/> We can learn from Amazon and Facebook on using data to optimize our websites better for higher conversion. Tools like Google Optimize and Crazy Egg can help with conducting A/B tests and visualizing how users are interacting with your site.  -Syed Balkhi, OptinMonster 11. Keep Changing<br/> These companies did not stick with the status quo but have continued to evolve in relation to their audience to stay relevant and maintain their benefit for customers. This has included more value-added features and ways to work and use these businesses.  -Drew Hendricks, Buttercup 12. Dominate a Niche<br/> Dominate one niche before expanding into other areas. Amazon was just an e-commerce site. Facebook was just for Harvard students. Google was just a search engine. Careful calculation and strategy made them the go-to for a niche, then they expanded. Fill the void in your product or service. Work backward to make your business the only competitor that solves one problem with the most efficiency.  -Matthew Capala, Search Decoder 13. Manage Your Logistics<br/> Many consumers find it easier to purchase products from Amazon because the platform is able to get their product delivered to them in a minimal amount of time. Successfully managing the logistics of your operation can make all the difference between having a happy, recurring customer and a disgruntled one who leaves bad reviews.  -Patrick Barnhill, Specialist ID, Inc. 14. Sell What You Use<br/> The most interesting thing about Amazon is the way it develops systems for internal use and then turns them into products. AWS and Fulfillment by Amazon are the clearest examples. Amazon needed world-class data centers, developed the expertise to build them and turned that expertise into a product. They did the same with fulfillment and warehousing.  -Justin Blanchard, ServerMania Inc. 15. Keep Looking for Ways to Increase Conversions<br/> Big tech brands are always looking to increase their website conversions. For example, Amazon found that 100ms (milliseconds) of latency cost them 1 percent in sales. Keep up with how they are increasing their conversions and see where you can make improvements on your own site.  -Jared Atchison, WPForms<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-n10172344</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PF4-3J51-DYDW-735W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1074\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 8, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC000591M</classCode><className>HUGE CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000439</classCode><className>CUSTOMER SERVICE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000916T</classCode><className>CUSTOMER RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST00096SA</classCode><className>BRAND EQUITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000916U</classCode><className>CUSTOMER SATISFACTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000469</classCode><className>MARKET DEMOGRAPHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009RQI</classCode><className>ONLINE MARKETING &amp;

That is prompting some policymakers and legal experts to ask: How big is too big? It's a key issue for an economy being rapidly reshaped by e-commerce, a sector where Amazon and the merchants operating on its platform account for up to a third of all U.S. sales, according to some estimates.It's also critical for Seattle, a city that has hitched its wagon to the e-commerce titan, and that once saw another local champion, Microsoft, mired in a lengthy antitrust battle. That fight,[1] over Microsoft keeping a rival internet browser off PCs running Windows, almost led to the split-up of the Redmond software giant. </p><p>E-commerce is not Amazon's only game. It also dominates cloud computing, and it may soon have a significant brick-and-mortar presence, with its pending acquisition of Whole Foods Market. The unexpected $13.7 billion deal announced in June[2] spurred an outcry among critics of the company and some members of Congress who asked the Federal Trade Commission to take a close look at the deal. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[3]Last month Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents grocery workers, wrote to the FTC that Amazon's proposed takeover of the organic food purveyor 'is a competitive threat to our economy that will hurt workers and communities.' Legal experts say it's really hard to build an antitrust case against the Whole Foods deal, which would give Amazon just a small percentage of the U.S. grocery market. Amazon's budding dominance in other markets, too, is likely to remain unchallenged in the long term, unless the philosophy underlying antitrust regulations changes. In fact, U.S. regulators have sided with Amazon against its rivals' anti-competitive moves \u2014 such as when they charged Apple and top New York publishers[4] with conspiring to raise prices for e-books, a market Amazon dominates.Under the current U.S. antitrust view, how consumers are treated is the prime factor, not the company's dominance in a market. To take antitrust action against Amazon, regulators would have to prove that the company somehow harms shoppers \u2014 for example, by conspiring to make the products they buy artificially more expensive. Another way Amazon could run into trouble is by undermining rivals with strategies such as sustained predatory pricing or forcing suppliers to lock out competitors. But rather than using tactics like that, some experts say, Amazon has built its empire just by giving customers what they want \u2014 products at low prices with lots of choices \u2014 which is not against the rules, no matter how big it grows. 'Antitrust law doesn't make it illegal to get market power,' provided it was done properly, said A. Douglas Melamed, a professor of antitrust law at Stanford University and a former U.S. Department of Justice antitrust official.Amazon's humongous size is 'politically important,' but not an antitrust issue. 'Not if they got there by being more innovative and more creative than the next guy,' he said.At the same time, the huge role occupied by Amazon \u2014 and other big tech firms such as Google and Facebook \u2014 is fostering a rethinking among policy wonks about how government can oversee the power of these large tech companies.'A lot of people are waking up to the fact that Amazon has positioned itself as a central piece of infrastructure for the 21st century economy,' said Lina Khan, a fellow at the New America Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank. She is also author of 'Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,' which has attracted widespread attention since it was published in January by the Yale Law Journal. 'We need to rethink how to go about preserving competition,' she said in an interview.Amazon downplays the antitrust issue. During a recent call with reporters, Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said that 'the businesses we are in are all very large market segments with lots of very serious competition.' Nevertheless, the company last year hired a veteran D.C. antitrust adviser, Seth Bloom.Making rivals quake Amazon's North American retail sales, which include Canada, totaled about $80 billion in 2016. That doesn't include sales by third-party merchants operating on Amazon's site, which some experts estimate to be about the same, or more. Together, Amazon and its merchants account for about a third of all online sales. But e-commerce is a tiny part \u2014 about 8.15 percent \u2014 of the huge U.S. retail sector. Amazon grows fast, however. In the latest quarter, the company's sales grew 25 percent, to $38 billion, and the company is on track to becoming the second-largest U.S. employer among the Fortune 500, after Wal-Mart. It dominates some markets, such as e-books. In others, it's growing so quickly that it makes incumbents quake. For instance, analysts with Cowen estimate that Amazon might surpass Macy's as the biggest seller of clothes this year. When a rumor arises that Amazon might dip its toe in a new market, stocks for potential rivals tremble, as happened to Zillow in June amid reports of a potential Amazon service for real-estate agents. Even more important than its retail power, in the eyes of some policymakers, is Amazon's increasingly central role as a platform widely used by other retailers. Brands now feel compelled to hawk their wares on Amazon's site, the biggest destination for online shoppers.Many merchants also pay to use Amazon's logistics, having their products stored and shipped by the Seattle giant. Amazon, the largest purveyor of cloud computing, even rents competitors the computing capacity they need to operate their businesses. Khan, the New America fellow, likens Amazon to the 19th century railroad empires that farmers and manufacturers relied on to get their products to market \u2014 and whose power generated public concern that led to the creation of the first federal antitrust laws. 'Today you have to ride Amazon's rails,' she said. Current antitrust laws, which focus on protecting efficiency and consumer prices, are ill-suited to regulate that type of power. They also don't fully take into account how Amazon's bevy of mutually reinforcing businesses can undermine competition, Khan argues. But that regulatory framework could change. In the past year, the attention the issue has been getting from the media and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle 'has been mind-blowing,' Khan said. In a recent Op-Ed in The New York Times[5], Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., pointed to more strict oversight of corporate giants as one of the main points of the Democratic Party program.'We are going to fight to allow regulators to break up big companies if they're hurting consumers and to make it harder for companies to merge if it reduces competition,' he wrote.Clear runway in U.S.Experts say the Whole Foods deal is likely to sail through, despite the initial controversy. Melamed, the Stanford professor, said that the grocery chain and Amazon today barely compete. Whole Foods, with annual sales of about $16 billion, represents a tiny sliver of the $600 billion U.S. grocery market. And Amazon's U.S. grocery and pantry sales totaled just $400 million in the first quarter of 2017, according to calculations by One Click Retail, an e-commerce consultancy. In the longer term, too, Melamed sees a relatively clear runway for Amazon, as long as it behaves. He acknowledged there is some restlessness among experts regarding the relative passivity of antitrust regulators in recent decades. 'There's an increasing sentiment, even among the antitrust technocrats, that perhaps antitrust law has not been aggressive enough,' he said. That laxity has allowed, in the eyes of critics, a series of gigantic deals across the U.S. economy that have increased market concentration.But Melamed expects any regulatory changes that may occur to be relatively minor \u2014 perhaps closer scrutiny of upcoming deals, or looking at a longer-term horizon when projecting whether a merger might result in competitive harm. A bigger challenge to Amazon might come from Europe. Last June, the European Commission fined Google[6] some $2.7 billion for allegedly giving its own price-comparison service an illegal advantage by featuring it prominently in search results. Melamed said European regulators don't like the creation of monopolies, even if they result from disruptive practices that would be considered acceptable in the U.S. 'If you wind up driving your only competitor out of business, it's going to land you in trouble in Europe.' It's hard to know how this could impact Amazon. But the company has already had run-ins with European antitrust regulators. In 2015 the European Commission began investigating Amazon's e-book distribution agreements with publishers, which required the publishers to share with Amazon information about the terms they struck with Amazon's competitors, and to give it the same or better terms. Amazon agreed not to enforce those clauses and to drop them from future contracts, a commitment the Commission made legally binding in May[7].Back in the U.S., even though building a case against Amazon might be hard, it doesn't mean rivals or critics won't try. The disruptive effect of Amazon's expansion on competitors could force some politically connected firms to ask regulators for help, said David Teece, director of the Tusher Center for the Management of Intellectual Capital at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley. 'The greater the disruption, the more likelihood the antitrust agencies are going to stick their nose in it,' he said. Communication will be key for the titan. 'Amazon's not there yet. But when it gets to be dominant, it has to be careful, make sure all its conduct is pro-competitive and the public understands it,' he added. 'You can't ignore Washington, D.C. Bill Gates learned that[8].'

During a recent call with reporters, Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said that \"the businesses we are in are all very large market segments with lots of very serious competition.\"<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the company last year hired a veteran D.C. antitrust adviser, Seth Bloom.<br/><br/>Amazon's North American retail sales, which include Canada, totaled about $80 billion in 2016. That doesn't include sales by third-party merchants operating on Amazon's site, which some experts estimate to be about the same, or more.<br/><br/>Together, Amazon and its merchants account for about a third of all online sales. But e-commerce is a tiny part - about 8.15 percent - of the huge U.S. retail sector.<br/><br/>Amazon grows fast, however. In the latest quarter, the company's sales grew 25 percent, to $38 billion, and the company is on track to becoming the second-largest U.S. employer among the Fortune 500, after Wal-Mart.<br/><br/>It dominates some markets, such as e-books. In others, it's growing so quickly that it makes incumbents quake. For instance, analysts with Cowen estimate that Amazon might surpass Macy's as the biggest seller of clothes this year.<br/><br/>When a rumor arises that Amazon might dip its toe in a new market, stocks for potential rivals tremble, as happened to Zillow in June amid reports of a potential Amazon service for real-estate agents. Even more important than its retail power, in the eyes of some policymakers, is Amazon's increasingly central role as a platform widely used by other retailers. Brands now feel compelled to hawk their wares on Amazon's site, the biggest destination for online shoppers.<br/><br/>Many merchants also pay to use Amazon's logistics, having their products stored and shipped by the Seattle giant. Amazon, the largest purveyor of cloud computing, even rents competitors the computing capacity they need to operate their businesses.<br/><br/>Khan, the New America fellow, likens Amazon to the 19th century railroad empires that farmers and manufacturers relied on to get their products to market - and whose power generated public concern that led to the creation of the first federal antitrust laws.<br/><br/>\"Today you have to ride Amazon's rails,\" she said.<br/><br/>Current antitrust laws, which focus on protecting efficiency and consumer prices, are ill-suited to regulate that type of power. They also don't fully take into account how Amazon's bevy of mutually reinforcing businesses can undermine competition, Khan argues.<br/><br/>But that regulatory framework could change. In the past year, the attention the issue has been getting from the media and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle \"has been mind-blowing,\" Khan said.<br/><br/>In a recent Op-Ed in The New York Times, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., pointed to more strict oversight of corporate giants as one of the main points of the Democratic Party program.<br/><br/>\"We are going to fight to allow regulators to break up big companies if they're hurting consumers and to make it harder for companies to merge if it reduces competition,\" he wrote.<br/><br/>getty images  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times A worker tapes a box while packing items at the Amazon Fulfillment Center In November in San Bernardino, Calif.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NAPDNW-uscpcent02-6w7j9a99h44ly63wpqe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NAPDNW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P7B-8W11-F0BC-M1JM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Collier County Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Naples Daily News (Florida)</publicationName><edition>1, DailyNews Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 12, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00021TX</classCode><className>WHOLE FOODS MARKET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNITED FOOD &amp;

Given that both these tech giants have a history of buying stake in other firms, the phenomenon is not new. However, such big buyouts may not really help the digital platforms sector: as a new study suggests, they tend to create a \"kill-zone\" that drives out start-ups' incentive to innovate.</p><p>The study, whose authors include former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan, was published as a working paper by the US National Bureau of Economic Research. It uses data on seven startups acquired by Google and two by Facebook between 2006 and 2018, for over $500 million each.</p><p>The paper finds that in the three years after a typical Facebook or Google acquisition, venture capital (VC) investments in start-ups in the market space of the acquired firm fell 40% on average and there were 20% fewer deals in the sector.</p><p>New start-ups in the digital space depend on the network effect to attract users, wherein a new user values a platform based on the number of users already on it. When a tech giant acquires a new platform, it incorporates the platform's innovative features. This, the authors say, discourages users from switching to new platforms, brings down the valuation of start-ups and drives out funding. This also discourages technological innovation, the authors add.</p><p>The study recommends three key policy solutions to reverse this trend. First, interoperability would reduce the customers' cost of switching platforms and give them access to wider networks. Second, if users are allowed to sell their own data, digital platforms can use it to improve their technology. Finally, the study proposes antitrust regulations to keep foreign giants out of domestic markets as a solution to foster innovation in the start-up space.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

This is according to James Buckley, head of Finacle Europe, the banking division of Infosys. He believes that the opening up of APIs, a key requirement of Open Banking, has brought with new opportunites for Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, and new challenges for regulators. \"The big players that are sitting out there sort of around the edge of financial services at the moment I think will start moving in a much more systemic way. </p><p>So the Apples of this world, and Alibaba and Tencent,\" says Buckley, who has over 25 years' experience in the banking industry. Big Tech bankingThe ability to play an even larger role in the lives of users, as well as unlocking valuable insights from their spending habits, is an enticing prospect for Big Tech and has seen several companies pay closer attention to the financial sector in recent years. In 2018 Apple launched a credit card in the US in partnership with Goldman Sachs and Marcus in the US. Last year Google announced it would soon start offering consumer bank accounts in collaboration with Citigroup. Amazon has also been offering loans to Amazon sellers since 2011, but has not yet gone into consumer banking. Although many consumers still choose an incumbent as their main bank, shifts towards digital-only brands may translate to an increasing willingness to bank with Big Tech. According to a survey of 18 to 35-year-olds by MuleSoft, 52% would consider using banking products from either Google, Amazon, Facebook or Apple. \"We still have yet to see dramatic shifts in the markets where people will become less and less attached to their banks\", says Buckley, \"However, I think open banking is an enablement, and the sorts of organisations that are going to take advantage of the shifting patterns are likely to be the large fintechs, the Apples and the Tencents. They're not conventional banks, but they are waiting to make massive inroads using open banking APIs and their capabilities to really change the change the goalposts. \"One thing that the conventional banks are sitting on is a critical mass of customers, together with a perception that financial services is risky, and it's a big thing to move your bank accounts. So there is a degree of inertia. But of course, if you have the technology wherewithall, you have the open banking API capabilities and the business model, you can start to attack the big banks in a much more systemic way.\" \"The biggest threat comes from these big players\"With access to realms of data and technological infrastructure, Big Tech is in a strong position to enter the world of banking. According to research by Pepper, 82% of UK consumers believe that banks are not innovating fast enough, opening up the possibility of new forms of banking. \"The biggest threat comes from these big players, because they have all the wherewithal to use open banking and PSD2 and APIs and artificial intelligence and analytics because they're already using it for everything else\", says Buckley. \"So it's quite easy for Apple or one of these big players to use all that information and understand context-based financial services in a faster and more superior ways than a bank. Facebook knows huge amounts about me versus a bank in terms of the way I think. \"Once you've got the transaction relationship for consumers hidden sitting somewhere else, all the bank will see, or the credit card will see, just blind transactions and all the relevant information about the context of the transaction. Will be sitting with WeChat. Which will mean that they understand the consumer, and the banks have become commoditised.\" Of course, currently these companies do not have banking licenses, and therefore launch financial products in partnership with organisations that do. However, Buckley believes that regulators could follow a similar route to the one taken in India, where some organisations are given a more restrictive licenses: \"I look back to India, because their regulator has gone through a different licensing pattern. So the concept of a payment bank, which is limited in what it can do, I think that type of regulatory framework will be introduced in terms of organisations. However they are sitting on huge amounts of money, sitting on huge volumes of consumers, and they have the brand to steal a march on the conventional banks.\" In this landscape, Buckley believes that some traditional banks are re-evaluating their business models in order to keep up, but this is not universal: \"It's interesting because you have the more competitive banks looking at open banking as an opportunity as a payment service provider, as an aggregator, as the ones re-engineering the world themselves. And then you've got other banks who are more on the backfoot that are struggling with the minimum of exposing their API's because the regulators say they have to do this by this time. And you've got some in between looking at either fintechs or looking at their own niche models that they want to build, to improve their offerings using open banking as a toolset to open up.\" When it comes to regulation, he explains that there is a risk that Big Tech could come to dominate, as has happened in other industries, and care must be taken to ensure smaller businesses are given a chance to compete: \"What [regulators] can do is make it easier for smaller players to play in the market. Because obviously, part of it is to create more competition and create a more level playing field and to allow better propositions for the consumer base.\" .gd-report-modal {display: none !Important;} div#Unit5 {display: none !Important;} div#Unit2 {display: none !Important;} div#Unit9 {display: none !Important;} .article-mpu {display: none !Important;}</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-63E0DD6944B640DB94D34F7994F837FE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YH2-0PY1-DYG0-7417-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"986\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 23, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Every day, tech companies' algorithms flag posts and videos and tweets, some of which are taken down for violating those policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response to the recent El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio shootings, President Donald Trump called for a violent extremism summit with social media companies, which will convene Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So how does Big Tech hope to stop more mass shooters from uploading their \"manifestos,\" or rants, to the internet?</p><p>\"Our thoughts are with the victims and their families,\" a Facebook spokesperson told InsideSources. \"Content that praises, supports or represents the shooting or anyone responsible violates our Community Standards and we will continue to remove as soon as we identify it.\"</p><p>Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for Big Tech lobbying group NetChoice, said that between July and December 2018, Facebook, Twitter and Youtube \"took action against over 11 million accounts that had broken policies on hate speech and extremism.\"</p><p>\"The 11 million accounts, that's the number you don't hear about because it's gone before you even see it,\" Szabo told InsideSources. \"The large platforms and even the small ones do work really hard to take down harmful content and do that through algorithms and bots, through user tagging, and through manual reviews.\"</p><p>The Internet Association, another Big Tech lobbying group, said \"violent and terroristic speech ... have no place either online or in our society.\"</p><p>\"IA members work every day to find dangerous content and remove it from their platforms,\" IA President and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement emailed to InsideSources. \"IA members are committed to continuing to work with law enforcement, stakeholders, and policymakers to make their platforms safer, and to prevent people from using their services as a vehicle for disseminating violent, hateful content.\"</p><p>The rant of the El Paso gunman, who killed 22 and injured 24 others at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas early Sunday morning, was found on unmoderated social media site 8chan. Cloudfare, the web infrastructure company supporting 8chan, withdrew support Monday, forcing the site off the internet.</p><p>In a YouTube video, 8chan founder Jim Watkins said the El Paso shooter's rant was originally uploaded to Instagram and then later shared on 8chan.</p><p>Facebook denies Watkins' claim.</p><p>\"We have found nothing that supports this theory,\" a Facebook spokesperson told InsideSources.</p><p>Facebook also told InsideSources that the El Paso shooter's Instagram account was disabled on Saturday, and hadn't been active for a year, and that Facebook is working with law enforcement.</p><p>\"Once the platforms were able to identify the video, then automated systems are pretty good at preventing re-uploads,\" Szabo said. \"That's typically the problem you see, it's not just takedowns of content, it's preventing content that's trying to be re-uploaded either through fake accounts or other platforms.\"</p><p>But critics of Big Tech say social media platforms aren't doing enough to take down mass shooters' screeds and similar content supporting such violence, which experts and law enforcement worry can lead to \"copycat\" shootings.</p><p>The Brookings Institution published an analysis Wednesday about how Big Tech cracks down on extreme content after the fact, and isn't prepared for the ways their platforms will be abused a year from now.</p><p>\"There are dozens of these barely-moderated havens for extremism online right now, and none of them will be affected by legislation proposed to supposedly rid US-based Big Tech of hatred,\" wrote Megan Squire, a professor of computer science at Elon University, for Brookings. \"In fact, most of these sites do not bother to conduct any meaningful self-regulation and are too small to qualify for monitoring under proposed legislation. Making things worse, when a 'Big Tech' site is removed, an 'Alt-Tech' clone rises up to take its place. Thus, the real danger slips right through the cracks.\"</p><p>But much of the content posted by mass shooters and circulated amongst individuals who advocate for violence against people of color, Jews, or LGBT people is perfectly legal, and tech companies are within their legal rights not to take down such content. (Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act offers tech platforms like Facebook and Google legal immunity from what their users post.)</p><p>Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University, said that trying to decide what content to remove is often a fuzzy line for Big Tech.</p><p>\"The fundamental question is, how do you get rid of legal content? And my pushback would be, why? What problems do you want to solve? We saw this problem with the Christchurch video,\" he told InsideSources, referring to the mass shooter who gunned down more than 50 people at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand in March and livestreamed his massacre on Facebook. \"In the US, that's legal content. We have to start with, what kind of content are we talking about? I personally am ok with that [El Paso shooter's] rant not being widely disseminated. It's pernicious content. I think there's value to dissecting the rant to understand what happened, why it happened, and what we might do differently to prevent the next attack, so treating it as verboten might make it harder to diagnose the problem. I personally don't want it widely available as a reference point for the next extremist.\"</p><p>In 2017, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube founded the Global Internet Forum to Combat Terrorism (GIFCT), which Goldman said was \"at the behest of the U.S. government.\" GIFCT swiftly identifies and blacklists terrorist content which helps give social media platforms guidance for keeping such content off their platforms.</p><p>The problem, Goldman said, is that GIFCT is a \"black box\" and there is no transparency about its methods for identifying and blacklisting what qualifies as terrorist content.</p><p>Goldman also worries about the U.S. government's attitude towards tech companies' moderation practices, specifically Sen. Josh Hawley's (R-Mo.) bill to rescind Section 230 protections for tech companies that don't moderate content in a \"politically neutral way.\"</p><p>\"Section 230 was designed to do the socially valuable work of policing problematic content,\" Goldman said. \"So Section 230 is part of the solution, not part of the problem. If we want legal content offline, the government can't ban it, but the internet companies might choose to suppress or obscure that content. Section 230 provides a path to a society-wide win. Hawley's approach would effectively enforce internet companies to carry content like the terrorist's rant even if they would choose to delete it. To me, his law is about the worse policy outcome we could imagine.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

'Digital ethics and privacy' shot into research and advisory company Gartner's top ten strategic technology trends for 2019 . Before that it barely raised a mention. In the past year governments , corporations and policy and technology think tanks have published data ethics guides. An entire cohort of expert data ethicists have magically materialised. Why this sudden interest in data ethics?</p><p> What is data ethics? Whose interests are the guidelines designed to serve? To understand what is going on, it's necessary to take a step back and look at how the information landscape has unfolded. The picture that emerges is of an industry immune from the regulatory constraints that apply to everyone else. The shine has gone Over the past few years the information industry has lost its lustre. The Snowden revelations , the Cambridge Analytica scandal , social media's enabling of hate speech , the weaponisation of information and its role in undermining democratic institutions have all contributed. Read more: Four ways social media platforms could stop the spread of hateful content in aftermath of terror attacks The business model that monetises personal information to sell advertising is now seen as a faustian bargain - perhaps the sacrifice is not worth it, after all. From 2017 to 2018 there was a 6% drop in Facebook users in the United States in the lucrative 12-34 year old market . These concerns have led to calls for regulation. But these have struggled to gain traction against the prevailing regulatory orthodoxy for the technology sector. This dates back to Al Gore's five principles for enabling what was then quaintly called the 'global information superhighway.' Principle three was that regulatory policy would 'create a flexible regulatory framework that can keep pace with rapid technological and market changes'. This was code for no regulation, or self-regulation. In Australia it was known as 'light touch' regulation . Big tech acted with regulatory impunity, largely freed from the mundane concerns of the 'old' economy such as consumer protection or product liability or competition law or, in particular, information privacy. Circling closer Europe never completely adopted this laissez-faire approach. Information privacy has always been high on its agenda, culminating in the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ). This provides individuals in the European Union with the most comprehensive data protection rights in the world. The rights have extraterritorial reach, involve regulatory oversight, and employ civil fines of eye-watering magnitude . Other jurisdictions are beginning to follow suit. In parallel, regulators from other disciplines are beginning to circle. Anti-trust regulators are looking afresh at information monopolies and big tech's use of market power to restrict competition. In Australia, the ACCC has called for a new regulatory authority to monitor and investigate the effect of algorithms on ranking news and journalistic content. Read more: The law is closing in on Facebook and the 'digital gangsters' The UK Select Committee on Communications report on Regulating in a Digital World has recommended a new Digital Authority to oversee the 'fragmented' regulation of the digital environment around ten regulatory principles, noting that 'self-regulation by online platforms is clearly failing'. Human rights regulators are examining the role of algorithms in creating and entrenching discrimination. Data means money Big tech does not want to be regulated. It does not want its unlimited ability to harvest personal information to be restricted or for GDPR-type protections to become the global norm. Personal information is the raw material for the algorithms that enable it to monetise our attention. For an industry that prides itself on being 'disruptive', big tech's greatest anxiety is to forestall the tightening regulatory environment to avoid being disrupted itself. Data ethics is one of the means it has developed to fight regulation. It does so by appropriating the virtues associated with ethics but by emptying them of content or consequence. Take Google's principles for AI . (AI is artificial intelligence). These are: be socially beneficial avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias be built and tested for safety be accountable to people incorporate privacy design principles uphold high standards of scientific excellence be made available for uses that accord with these principles.<br/>These 'principles' are strikingly similar to the feel-good homilies published on Instagram that urge us to 'be good to each other' or not to 'let the sun go down on our anger', and are about as useful. Really? Screen shot captured March 28 2019 Put to the test Let's test one of Google's principles, 'be accountable to people'. There are several layers of ambiguity here. Does it mean that Google's AI algorithms should be accountable to 'people' in general, Google's 'people', or someone else's 'people' such as an independent regulator? If the latter, will Google supply the algorithm for analysis, correct any errors, and pay compensation for any harm caused? If Google's AI algorithms mistakenly conclude I am a terrorist and then pass this information on to national security agencies who use the information to arrest me, hold me incommunicado and interrogate me, will Google be accountable for its negligence or for contributing to my false imprisonment? How will it be accountable? If I am unhappy with Google's version of accountability, to whom do I appeal for justice? Read more: Digital platforms. Why the ACCC's proposals for Google and Facebook matter big time Useful ethics involves accountability Ethics is concerned with the moral principles that affect how individuals make decisions and how they lead their lives. Ethics have been studied and debated for aeons. Within western traditions, ethics are traced back to Socrates . They include philosophical positions such as deontological (duty-based) ethics, consequentialism, utilitarianism and existentialism, to name but a few. Unsurprisingly, none of these produce the same answers to questions about what an individual must do in any particular circumstances. Read more: Christchurch attacks provide a new ethics lesson for professional media 'Applied ethics' aims to bring the principles of ethics to bear on real-life situations. There are numerous examples. Public sector ethics are governed by law. There are consequences for those who breach them, including disciplinary measures, termination of employment and sometimes criminal penalties. To become a lawyer, I had to provide evidence to a court that I am a 'fit and proper person'. To continue to practice, I'm required to comply with detailed requirements set out in the Australian Solicitors Conduct Rules. If I breach them, there are consequences. The features of applied ethics are that they are specific, there are feedback loops, guidance is available, they are embedded in organisational and professional culture, there is proper oversight, there are consequences when they are breached and there are independent enforcement mechanisms and real remedies. They are part of a regulatory apparatus and not just 'feel good' statements. Feelgood, high-level data ethics principles are not fit for the purpose of regulating big tech. Applied ethics may have a role to play but because they are occupation or discipline specific they cannot be relied on to do all, or even most of, the heavy lifting. The harms linked to big tech can only be addressed by proper regulation.

Amazon teamed with two large employers in an ambitious undertaking to completely reimagine the nation's health care and insurance system. Amazon also showed interest in creating an insurance comparison website in the United Kingdom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, consumers continued to warm to the notion of buying their insurance from Google or Amazon.</p><p>For traditionalists, there was one comfort: transportation tech firm Uber signaled it has no interest in getting into the insurance business. However, investor Softbank is interested in new ways to sell insurance to the clients of Uber and similar platforms.</p><p>Here is a recap of stories from 2018 about big technology courting big insurance:</p><p>Giant Google's investment arm purchased a minority stake in Applied Systems, a provider of insurance technology and cloud-based software for independent agencies. Applied Systems CEO Reid French confirmed that Google/CapitalG will become minority investor, while adding that Google/CapitalG's financial stake is significant. \"It's not small,\" Reid said of the investment. \"They made a legitimate commitment ... it's real money.\" Applied Systems reassured its clients, independent insurance agents, that they should welcome, not fear, Google's involvement with the firm. In return for the Alphabet/Google/CapitalG investment, Applied Systems gains access to Google expertise in areas including artificial intelligence, machine learning and digital marketing but, according to French, Google will not b able to tap into any of Applied Systems' insurance data residing in the cloud or within various customer applications. \"There are many agents that have wanted to have greater access to high technology. The vast majority will view this, with the facts, as super-duper positive for Applied and for the industry,\" French said.</p><p>Google is eager to invest in other insurance technology companies well beyond its newly announced . \"We really like the market,\" said Jesse Wedler, a principal with CapitalG, the growth equity investment fund of Google's parent Alphabet. \"We will definitely be looking for additional investments in the insurance technology space.\" Wedler said the search would be for other businesses like Applied. \"Broadly speaking, the software businesses addressing the insurance market are interesting to us,\" Wedler said. He emphasized, however, that potential investment targets won't be rivals of Applied.</p><p>One-in-five consumers say they would use Amazon or Google for their home insurance, a J.D. Power survey showed. And most of those who took the survey (80 percent) already have insurance with a large national carrier. Both Google and Amazon have been previously pegged as potential insurance market entrants despite a Google failure in the space. J.D. Powers believes that wasn't the last of the firm's efforts to get into the insurance business.</p><p>Reuters reported that Amazon is gauging the interest level of Europe's top insurance firms in contributing products to a UK price comparison website. While it was not immediately clear what type of insurance would be sold on any Amazon site, home and motor policies are popular sellers on existing UK price comparison sites. \"As Amazon becomes a larger part of the home, whether it's products delivered to the home, security monitoring, home services like Wi-Fi installation, you can make the case that insurance is the next logical step for this company,\" said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy.</p><p>Speaking of the home product market as an entranceway into insurance, The Travelers Companies Inc. announced it is teaming up with Amazon in selected states to offer smart home kits, insurance quotes and risk management information through a digital storefront: Amazon.com/Travelers. Customers may obtain smart home kits that include security cameras, water sensors, motion detectors and a smart home hub at discounted prices. Consumers interested in a home insurance quote are directed from the Travelers storefront on Amazon to the company's website or to an independent insurance agent. In addition, Travelers independent agents can use Travelers and Amazon co-branded products to market to customers about smart home technology.</p><p>Should insurers be worried about Amazon disrupting insurance as it has retail? At the S&amp;P Global Ratings insurance conference, analysts said there's no reason to panic. If Amazon does offer home insurance, it would probably start small with \"simple, bare-bones\" coverage, said one analyst, who also questioned whether the e-tailer would even take such a step. \"Does Amazon really want to get regulated? I don't think they do.\"</p><p>Tech companies pose a challenge to banks. Amazon is reported to be in talks with JPMorgan Chase and other big retail banks to create a checking-account-like offering aimed at younger adults and those without checking accounts. This move would build on the company's initial forays into financial products over recent years and be the start of its venturing into lending, mortgages, property/casualty insurance, wealth management and term life insurance, according to consultants at Bain &amp; Co.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Amazon.com Inc., and Berkshire Hathaway will focus on the biggest health issues threatening the U.S. economy in their new joint venture, including aligning healthcare payments with employee health and addressing chronic diseases, CEO Jamie Dimon said. The three giant firms announced in January that they would form a venture that would for their employees, and potentially open the venture to other companies. Dimon said the company would focus on using big data, virtual technology, better customer engagement and more consumer choice to address critical problems and issues.\"</p><p>Softbank is not a tech firm itself but it is a major investor in tech-based insurance firms. In the past year, it backed China's largest online insurer ZhongAn as well as PolicyBazaar, India's biggest online insurance seller, as well as U.S. home insurer Lemonade. Softbank sees the insurance sector as ripe for disruption and believes insurtechs can partner with other firms within its portfolio including Uber and office sharing firm WeWork to sell new products and services to their clients.</p><p>While it is weighing providing benefits and insurance to its independent contractor drivers, ride-hailing giant Uber is not interested in getting into the insurance business itself. Rather, the global transportation firm is content to focus on being an \"intelligent purchaser\" of insurance, continuing to work with insurance carriers and brokers on any insurance for its drivers. \"No, to be honest, we're trying to get out of the insurance business,\" Curtis Scott, global head of insurance for Uber, said. \"I can tell you that Uber doesn't have a desire to. We are good at being a tech company that's in logistics and we want to do that. That's what we're strong at,\" he said. \"Insurance companies are good at being insurance companies and that's hard to do,\" he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WLINJN-ij513324</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WLINJN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9J-G5V1-JBH5-P33C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1243\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Wells Media Group, Inc.

The more tech-oriented Nasdaq 100 index climbed more than 700 per cent over the same period.\u00a0</p><p>This stretched valuations. A key measure of that \u2014 the ratio between the Nasdaq 100 companies\u2019 share prices and expected earnings \u2014 rose to more than 25 at the start of this year, against a 10-year average of 19, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ figures. Many analysts expected the stocks to fall back to earth when the next downturn came. </p><p>Instead, the sector has reasserted its dominance in the coronavirus era, with the Nasdaq 100 climbing 15 per cent in April to end up back in positive territory for the year. The price-to-earnings ratio has now stretched towards 28 as earnings have slumped but stocks have rebounded.</p><p>\u201cIt was a narrow bull market driven mainly by one sector, and typically this is the sector that is sold the hardest when it ends,\u201d says Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, and one of many analysts who thought the era of tech stock supremacy would end. \u201cBut what is interesting is how tech-friendly this recession has been.\u201d</p><p>With millions cooped up at home, companies like online retailing giant Amazon and internet streaming service Netflix are clear winners. They are both up about 30 per cent so far this year. <url normalizedValue=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/04/14/1586853042000/Is-the-Zoom-boom-doomed-/\"> Zoom</url>, the video conferencing company, is another victor, doubling in value in 2020. Microsoft, which has also benefited from the video-calling boom, is up more than 10 per cent. Google, Apple and Facebook are also now roughly flat for the year, after each falling more than 30 per cent from the February highs. </p><p>This is part of a broader trend of stronger, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02dd3e98-41ef-11e9-9bee-efab61506f44\"> less indebted</url> companies doing well, as investors fret over the impact of an economic lockdown. Talk of introducing stricter regulations around privacy and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db0d36e0-8c8d-11e9-a1c1-51bf8f989972\"> concerns about digital monopolies</url> have also faded from the political agenda as the coronavirus crisis dominates. This has added to the tech sector\u2019s tailwinds.</p><p>As a result, the five biggest constituents of the S&amp;P 500 \u2014 Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google\u2019s parent Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 now account for a fifth of the entire index\u2019s market capitalisation. That is a modern-day record in terms of concentration, Goldman Sachs notes, and comes with potential risk for investors.</p><p>\u201cNarrow breadth can last for extended periods, but past episodes have signalled below-average market returns and eventual momentum reversals,\u201d David Kostin, chief US equity strategist, warned this week.\u00a0</p><p>He admits to sharing the \u201cincredulity\u201d of many investors that the S&amp;P 500 is now just 14 per cent below its all-time high, despite the biggest economic shock in a century, but calculates that the median stock in the index is still about 28 per cent below its high.</p><p>Typically, such <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/749b7bfa-3143-11ea-9703-eea0cae3f0de\"> narrow rallies</url> end either when investors crowd into the market leaders but fail to justify their inflated valuations, or when an improving economic outlook helps laggards catch up. Increasingly, it is looking like investors are betting on the former outcome.\u00a0</p><p>The April rally has also been helped by a huge comeback from beaten-up energy stocks, as investors have bet that some of the gloom surrounding the industry is overdone. Despite US oil prices briefly plunging into negative territory last month, energy is the best-performing sector of the US equity market this month, up about 30 per cent.</p><p>European stocks have also bounced back since the worst of the sell-off, but the Stoxx 600 index rose just 6 per cent in April, and remains down 18 per cent for the year. The lack of big technology stocks in the region has been a drag, but index heavyweights such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Nestl\u00e9 are now nearly flat for the year, having weathered the early part of the crisis. Healthcare company Roche has gained 8 per cent thanks to its testing expertise.</p><p>In Asia, the Chinese \u201cBat\u201d stocks \u2014 the local equivalent of the Fang stocks \u2014 have been more of a mixed bag. Search engine <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7b20b3a-59a1-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc\"> Baidu</url> is still down 20 per cent this year, after an advertising drought hit sales, while online retailer       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b1644b1-aeee-4d02-805a-c3ac26291412\"> Alibaba</url> is down just 6 per cent and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/579661ff-9d2d-4a1a-8dd3-f4eed24d9a6c\"> Tencent</url>\u2019s thriving online gaming platform has helped its stock erase its March losses to climb 11 per cent this year.</p><p>Some of the coronavirus-era stock market winners are likely to stay buoyant once the crisis recedes, as the outbreak accelerates existing trends such as online streaming and shopping. But in some cases analysts say high valuations will be a risk if growth fails to justify investors\u2019 faith. </p><p>Yet the biggest question is whether the global stock market rally is sustainable, or merely a temporary \u2014 if powerful \u2014 bounce, engineered by central bank and government stimulus packages that will fade as the virus\u2019s economic destruction hits.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMany promising <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb31917c-fc08-487a-af0d-f9e54c8717dd\"> bear rallies</url> fizzle as the initial euphoria clears and the grim realities of underlying fundamentals come to the fore,\u201d said Andrew Lapthorne, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\u00a0\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-d2e09235b28e438d9b550e6bab7ac8ec</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YT4-F871-DXP9-93G6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 1, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

I cannot help but wonder if that might be the case over the next few years, as the United States (and possibly the world) heads toward its next big slowdown. Downturns historically come about once every decade, and it has been more than that since the 2008 financial crisis. Back then, banks were the \"too-big-to-fail\" institutions responsible for our falling stock portfolios, home prices and salaries. Technology companies, by contrast, have led the market upswing over the past decade. But this time around, it is the big tech firms that could play the spoiler role.</p><p>You wouldn't think it could be so when you look at the biggest and richest tech firms today. Take Apple. Warren Buffett says he wished he owned even more Apple stock. (His Berkshire Hathaway has a 5% stake in the company.) Goldman Sachs is launching a new credit card with the tech titan, which became <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">the world's first</url> $1tn market-cap company in 2018. But hidden within these bullish headlines are a number of disturbing economic trends, of which Apple is already an exemplar. Study this one company and you begin to understand how big tech companies - the new too-big-to-fail institutions - could indeed sow the seeds of the next crisis.</p><p>No matter what the Silicon Valley giants might argue, ultimately, size is a problem, just as it was for the banks. This is not because bigger is inherently bad, but because the complexity of these organisations makes them so difficult to police. Like the big banks, big tech uses its lobbying muscle to try to avoid regulation. And like the banks, it tries to sell us on the idea that it deserves to play by different rules.</p><p>Consider the financial engineering done by such firms. Like most of the largest and most profitable multinational companies, Apple has loads of cash - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">around</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">$210bn</url> at last count - as well as plenty of debt (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">close to</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">$110bn</url> ). That is because - like nearly every other large, rich company - it has parked most of its spare cash in offshore bond portfolios over the past 10 years. This is part of a Kafkaesque financial shell game that has played out since the 2008 financial crisis. Back then, interest rates were lowered and central bankers flooded the economy with easy money to try to engineer a recovery. But the main beneficiaries were large companies, which issued lots of cheap debt, and used it to buy back their own shares and pay out dividends, which bolstered corporate share prices and investors, but not the real economy. The Trump corporate tax cuts added fuel to this fire. Apple, for example, was responsible for about a quarter of the $407bn in buy-backs announced in the six months or so after Trump's tax law was passed in December 2017 - the biggest corporate tax cut in US history.</p><p>Because of this, the wealth divide has been increased, which many economists believe is not only the biggest factor in slower-than-historic trend growth, but is also driving the political populism that threatens the market system itself.</p><p>That phenomenon has been put on steroids by yet another trend epitomised by Apple: the rise of intangibles such as intellectual property and brands (both of which the company has in spades) relative to tangible goods as a share of the global economy. As Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake show in their book Capitalism Without Capital, this shift became noticeable around 2000, but really took off after the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. The digital economy has a tendency to create superstars, since software and internet services are so scalable and enjoy network effects (in essence, they allow a handful of companies to grow quickly and eat everyone else's lunch). But according to Haskel and Westlake, it also seems to reduce investment across the economy as a whole. This is not only because banks are reluctant to lend to businesses whose intangible assets may simply disappear if they go belly-up, but also because of the winner-takes-all effect that a handful of companies, including Apple (and Amazon and Google), enjoy.</p><p>This is likely a key reason for the dearth of startups, declining job creation, falling demand and other disturbing trends in our bifurcated economy. Concentration of power of the sort that Apple and Amazon enjoy is a key reason for record levels of mergers and acquisitions. In telecoms and media especially, many companies have taken on significant amounts of debt in order to bulk up and compete in this new environment of streaming video and digital media.</p><p>Some of that debt is now looking shaky, which underscores that the next big crisis probably won't emanate from banks, but from the corporate sector. Rapid growth in debt levels is historically the best predictor of a crisis. And for the past several years, the corporate bond market has been on a tear, with companies in advanced economies issuing a record amount of debt; the market grew 70% over the past decade, to reach $10.17tn in 2018. Even mediocre companies have benefited from easy money.</p><p>But as the interest rate environment changes, perhaps more quickly than was anticipated, many could be vulnerable. The Bank for International Settlements - the international body that monitors the global financial system - has warned that the long period of low rates has cooked up a larger than usual number of \"zombie\" companies, which will not have enough profits to make their debt payments if interest rates rise. When rates eventually do rise, warns the BIS, losses and ripple effects may be more severe than usual.</p><p>Of course, if and when the next crisis is upon us, the deflationary power of technology (meaning the way in which it drives down prices), exemplified by companies like Apple, could make it more difficult to manage. That is the final trend worth considering. Technology firms drive down the prices of lots of things, and tech-related deflation is a big part of what has kept interest rates so low for so long; it has not only constrained prices, but wages, too. The fact that interest rates are so low, in part thanks to that tech-driven deflation, means that central bankers will have much less room to navigate through any upcoming crisis. Apple and the other purveyors of intangibles have benefited more than other companies from this environment of low rates, cheap debt, and high stock prices over the past 10 years. But their power has also sowed the seeds of what could be the next big swing in the markets.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>A few years ago, I had a fascinating conversation with an economist at the US Treasury's Office of Financial Research, a small but important body that was created following the 2008 financial crisis to study market trouble, and which has since seen its funding slashed by Trump. I was trawling for information about financial risk and where it might be held, and the economist told me to look at the debt offerings and corporate bond purchases being made by the largest, richest corporations in the world, such as Apple or Google, whose market value now dwarfed that of the biggest banks and investment firms.</p><p>In a low interest rate environment, with billions of dollars in yearly earnings, these high-grade firms were issuing their own cheap debt and using it to buy up the higher-yielding corporate debt of other firms. In the search for both higher returns and for something to do with all their money, they were, in a way, acting like banks, taking large anchor positions in new corporate debt offerings and essentially underwriting them the way that JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs might. But, it is worth noting, since such companies are not regulated like banks, it is difficult to track exactly what they are buying, how much they are buying and what the market implications might be. There simply is not a paper trail the way there is in finance. Still, the idea that cash-rich tech companies might be the new systemically important institutions was compelling.</p><p>I began digging for more on the topic, and about two years later, in 2018, I came across a stunning Credit Suisse report that both confirmed and quantified the idea. The economist who wrote it, Zoltan Pozsar, forensically analysed the $1tn in corporate savings parked in offshore accounts, mostly by big tech firms. The largest and most intellectual-property-rich 10% of companies - Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle and Alphabet (Google's parent company) among them - controlled 80% of this hoard.</p><p>According to Pozsar's calculations, most of that money was held not in cash but in bonds - half of it in corporate bonds. The much-lauded overseas \"cash\" pile held by the richest American companies, a treasure that Republicans under Trump had cited as the key reason they passed their ill-advised tax \"reform\" plan, was actually a giant bond portfolio. And it was owned not by banks or mutual funds, which typically have such large financial holdings, but by the world's biggest technology firms. In addition to being the most profitable and least regulated industry on the planet, the Silicon Valley giants had also become systemically crucial within the marketplace, holding assets that - if sold or downgraded - could topple the markets themselves. Hiding in plain sight was an amazing new discovery: big tech, not big banks, was the new too-big-to-fail industry.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>As I began to think about the comparison, I found more and more parallels. Some of them were attitudinal. It was fascinating, for example, to see how much the technology industry's response to the 2016 election crisis mirrored the banking industry's behaviour in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008. Just as Wall Street had obfuscated as much as possible about what it was doing before and after the crisis, every bit of useful information about election meddling had to be clawed away from the titans of big tech.</p><p>First, they insisted that they had done nothing wrong, and that anyone who thought they had simply did not understand the technology industry. It was under extreme pressure from both press and regulators that Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">finally turned over</url> 3,000 Russia-linked adverts to Congress. Google and others were only marginally less evasive. Similar to Wall Street financiers at the time of the US sub-prime crisis, the tech titans have remained, years after the 2016 election, in a largely reactive posture, parting with as few details as possible, attempting to keep the asymmetric information advantages of their business model that, as in the banking industry, help generate outsized profit margins. It is a \"deny and deflect\" attitude similar to what we saw from financiers in 2008, and has resulted in deservedly terrible PR.</p><p>But there are more substantive similarities as well. At a meta level, I see four major likenesses in big finance and big tech: corporate mythology, opacity, complexity and size. In terms of mythology, Wall Street before 2008 sold the idea that what was good for the financial sector was good for the economy. Until quite recently, big tech tried to convince us of the same. But there are two sides to the story, and neither industry is quick to acknowledge or take responsibility for the downsides of \"innovation\".</p><p>A raft of research shows us that trust in liberal democracy, government, media and nongovernmental organisations declines as social media usage rises. In Myanmar, Facebook has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">been leveraged</url> to support genocide. In China, Apple and Google have bowed to government demands for censorship. In the US, of course, personal data is being collected, monetised and weaponised in ways that we are only just beginning to understand, and monopolies are squashing job creation and innovation. At this point, it is harder and harder to argue that the benefits of platform technology vastly outweigh the costs.</p><p>Big tech and big banks are also similar in the opacity and complexity of their operations. The algorithmic use of data is like the complex securitisation done by the world's too-big-to-fail banks in the sub-prime era. Both are understood largely by industry experts who can use information asymmetry to hide risks and the nefarious things that companies profit from, such as dubious political ads.</p><p>Yet that complexity can backfire. Just as many big-bank risk managers had no idea what was going in to and coming out of the black box before 2008, big tech executives themselves can be thrown off balance by the ways in which their technology can be misused. Consider, for example, the New York Times <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">investigation</url> in 2018 that revealed that Facebook had allowed a number of other big tech companies, including Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, to tap sensitive user data even as it was promising to protect privacy.</p><p>Facebook entered into the data-sharing deals - which are a win-win for the big tech firms in general, to the extent that they increase traffic between the various platforms and bring more and more users to them - between 2010 and 2017 to grow its social network as fast as possible. But neither Facebook nor the other companies involved could keep track of all the implications of the arrangements for user privacy. Apple claimed to not even know it was in such a deal with Facebook, a rather stunning admission given the way in which Apple has marketed itself as a protector of user privacy. At Facebook, \"some engineers and executives ... considered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth\", read a telling line in the Times piece. And grow it has: Facebook took in more than $40bn in revenue in 2017, more than double the $17.9bn it reported for 2015.</p><p>Facebook's prioritisation of growth over governance is egregious but not unique. The tendency to look myopically at share price as the one and only indicator of value is something fostered by Wall Street, but by no means limited to it. The obliviousness of the tech executives who cut these deals reminds me of bank executives who had no understanding of the risks built into their balance sheets until markets started to blow up during the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>Companies tend to prioritise what can be quantified, such as earnings per share and the ratio of the stock price to earnings, and ignore (until it is too late) the harder-to-measure business risks.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>It is no accident that most of the wealth in our world is being held by a smaller and smaller number of rich individuals and corporations who use financial wizardry such as tax offshoring and buy-backs to ensure that they keep it out of the hands of national governments. It is what we have been taught to think of as normal, thanks to the ideological triumph of the Chicago School of economic thought, which has, for the past five decades or so, preached, among other things, that the only purpose of corporations should be to maximise profits.</p><p>The notion of \"shareholder value\" is shorthand for this idea. The maximisation of shareholder value is part of the larger process of \"financialisation\". It is a process that has risen, in tandem with the Chicago School of thinking, since the 1980s, and has created a situation in which markets have become not a conduit for supporting the real economy, as Adam Smith would have said they should be, but rather, the tail that wags the dog.</p><p>\"Consumer welfare,\" rather than citizen welfare, is our primary concern. We assume that rising share prices signify something good for the economy as a whole, as opposed to merely increasing wealth for those who own them. In this process, we have moved from being a market economy to being what Harvard law professor Michael Sandel would call a \"market society\", obsessed with profit maximisation in every aspect of our lives. Our access to the basics - healthcare, education, justice - is determined by wealth. Our experiences of ourselves and those around us are thought of in transactional terms, something that is reflected in the language of the day (we \"maximise\" time and \"monetise\" relationships).</p><p>Now, with the rise of the surveillance capitalism practised by big tech, we ourselves are maximised for profit. Remember that our personal data is, for these companies and the others that harvest it, the main business input. As Larry Page himself once said when asked \"What is Google?\": \"If we did have a category, it would be personal information ... the places you've seen. Communications ... Sensors are really cheap ... Storage is cheap. Cameras are cheap. People will generate enormous amounts of data ... Everything you've ever heard or seen or experienced will become searchable. Your whole life will be searchable.\"</p><p>Think about that. You are the raw material used to make the product that sells you to advertisers.</p><p>Financial markets have facilitated the shift toward this invasive, short-term, selfish capitalism, which has run in tandem with both globalisation and technological advancement, creating a loop in which we are constantly competing with greater numbers of people, in shorter amounts of time, for more and more consumer goods that may be cheaper thanks in part to the deflationary effects of both outsourcing and tech-based disruption, but that cannot compensate for our stagnant incomes and stressed-out lives.</p><p>But you could argue that, in a deeper way, Silicon Valley - not the old Valley that was full of garage startups and true innovators, but the financially driven Silicon Valley of today - represents the apex of the shift toward financialisation. Today the large tech companies are run by a generation of business leaders who came of age and started their firms at a time when government was viewed as the enemy, and profit maximisation was universally seen as the best way to advance the economy, and indeed society. Regulation or limits on corporate behaviour have been viewed as tyrannical or even authoritarian. \"Self-regulation\" has become the norm. \"Consumers\" have replaced citizens. All of it is reflected in the Valley's \"move fast and break things\" mentality, which the tech titans view as a fait accompli. As Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen wrote in an afterword to the paperback edition of their book, The New Digital Age: \"Bemoaning the inevitable increase in the size and reach of the technology sector distracts us from the real question ... Many of the changes that we discuss are inevitable. They're coming.\"</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>Perhaps. But the idea that this should preclude any discussion of the effects of the technology sector on the public at large is simply arrogant. There is a huge cost to this line of thinking. Consider the $1tn in wealth that has been parked offshore by the US's largest, most IP-rich firms. A trillion is no small sum: that is an 18th of the US's annual GDP, much of which was garnered from products and services made possible by core government-funded research and innovators. Yet US citizens have not got their fair share of that investment because of tax offshoring. It is worth noting that while the US corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%, most big companies have for years paid only about 20% of their income, thanks to various loopholes. The tech industry pays even less - roughly 11-15% - for this same reason: data and IP can be offshored while a factory or grocery store cannot. This points to yet another neoliberal myth - the idea that if we simply cut US tax rates, then these \"American\" companies will bring all their money home and invest it in job-creating goods and services in the US. But the nation's biggest and richest companies have been at the forefront of globalisation since the 1980s. Despite small decreases in overseas revenues for the past couple of years, nearly half of all sales from S&amp;P 500 companies come from abroad.</p><p>How, then, can such companies be perceived as being \"totally committed\" to the US, or, indeed, to any particular country? Their commitment, at least the way American capitalism is practised today, is to customers and investors, and when both of them are increasingly global, then it is hard to argue for any sort of special consideration for American workers or communities in the boardroom.</p><p>Tech firms are more able than any other type of company to move business abroad, because most of their wealth is not in \"fixed assets\" but in data, human capital, patents and software, which are not tied to physical locations (such as factories or retail stores) but can move anywhere. And as we have already learned, while those things do represent wealth, they do not create broad-based demand growth in the economy like the investments of a previous era.</p><p>\"If Apple acquires a licence to a technology for a phone it manufactures in China, it does not create employment in the US, beyond the creator of the licensed technology if they are in the US,\" says Daniel Alpert, a financier and a professor at Cornell University studying the effects of this shift in investment. \"Apps, Netflix and Amazon movies don't create jobs the way a new plant would.\" Or, as my Financial Times colleague Martin Wolf has put it, \"[Apple] is now an investment fund attached to an innovation machine and so a black hole for aggregate demand. The idea that a lower corporate tax rate would raise investment in such businesses is ludicrous.\" In short, cash-rich corporations - especially tech firms - have become the financial engineers of our day.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>There are the ways in which big tech is driving the mega-trends in global markets, as we have just explored. Then, there are the ways tech companies are playing in those markets that grant them an unfair advantage over consumers. For example, Google, Facebook and, increasingly, Amazon now own the digital advertising market, and can set whatever terms they like for customers. The opacity of their algorithms coupled with their dominance of their respective markets makes it impossible for customers to have an even playing field. This can lead to exploitative pricing and/or behaviours that put our privacy at risk. Consider also the way Uber uses \"surge pricing\" to set rates based on customers' willingness to pay. Or the \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">shadow profiles</url> \" that Facebook compiles on users. Or the way in which Google and Mastercard teamed up to track whether online ads led to physical store sales, without letting Mastercard holders know they were being tracked.</p><p>Or the way Amazon secured an unusual procurement deal with local governments in the US. It was, as of 2018, allowed to purchase all the office and classroom supplies for 1,500 public agencies, including local governments and schools, around the country, without guaranteeing them fixed prices for the goods. The purchasing would be done through \"dynamic pricing\" - essentially another form of surge pricing, whereby the prices reflect whatever the market will withstand - with the final charges depending on bids put forward by suppliers on Amazon's platform. It was a stunning corporate jiu-jitsu, given that the whole point of a bulk-purchasing contract is to guarantee the public sector competitive prices by bundling together demand. For all the hype about Amazon's discounts, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">a study</url> conducted by the nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance concluded that one California school district would have paid 10-12% more if it had bought from Amazon. And cities that wanted to keep on using existing suppliers that did not do business on the retail giant's platform would be forced to move that business (and those suppliers) to Amazon because of the way that deal was structured.</p><p>It is hard to ignore the parallels in Amazon's behaviour to the lending practices of some financial groups before the 2008 crash. They, too, used dynamic pricing, in the form of variable rate sub-prime mortgage loans, and they, too, exploited huge information asymmetries in their sale of mortgage-backed securities and complex debt deals to unwary investors, not only to individuals, but also to cities such as Detroit. Amazon, for its part, has vastly more market data than the suppliers and public sector purchasers it plans to link.</p><p>As in any transaction, the party that knows the most can make the smartest deal. The bottom line is that both big-platform tech players and large financial institutions sit in the centre of an hourglass of information and commerce, taking a cut of whatever passes through. They are the house, and the house always wins.</p><p>As with the banks, systemic regulation may well be the only way to prevent big tech companies from unfairly capitalising on those advantages.</p><p>There are questions of whether Amazon or Facebook could leverage their existing positions in e-commerce or social media to unfair advantage in finance, using what they already know about our shopping and buying patterns to push us into buying the products they want us to in ways that are either a) anticompetitive, or b) predatory. There are also questions about whether they might cut and run at the first sign of market trouble, destabilising the credit markets in the process.</p><p>\"Big-tech lending does not involve human intervention of a long-term relationship with the client,\" said Agust\u00edn Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements. \"These loans are strictly transactional, typically short-term credit lines that can be automatically cut if a firm's condition deteriorates. This means that, in a downturn, there could be a large drop in credit to [small and middle-sized companies] and large social costs.\" If you think that sounds a lot like the situation that we were in back in 2008, you would be right.</p><p>Treating the industry like any other would undoubtedly require a significant shift in the big-tech business model, one with potential profit and share price implications. The extraordinary valuations of the big tech firms are due in part to the market's expectations that they will remain lightly regulated, lightly taxed monopoly powers. But that is not guaranteed to be the case in the future. Antitrust and monopoly issues are fast gaining attention in Washington, where the titans of big tech may soon have a reckoning.</p><p>                     This is an edited extract from Don't Be Evil: The Case Against Big Tech by Rana Foroohar, published by Allen Lane and available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">guardianbookshop.co.uk</url></p><p> Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">@gdnlongread</url>, and sign up to the long read weekly email       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">here</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-57756183</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGF-PKX1-JCJY-G2D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4425\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Back then, Big Tech didn't need to ask if it had a seat at the table of a Democratic presidential transition. But times have changed. Now, Silicon Valley has to take a different route to gain power and influence. </p><p>It floods[3] the Beltway with cash spent on lobbyists, think tanks, Metro ads\u2014anything to get the suits to back off. If Joe Biden wins in November, you can bet that Big Tech's representatives will do the same thing as every other industry's political strategists: scour the list[4] of more than four thousand appointments across the executive branch the new president needs to make, and figure out which of their loyalists are ready for a spin through the government's revolving door. That's nothing new; between 2008 and 2016, 55 former Google employees took[5] powerful jobs in the Obama administration, and 197 former Obama officials revolved out to Google. But now that there's a fast-growing bipartisan constituency that wants to break up Big Tech, the stakes are high for the entire industry. Now is the time for that constituency to identify which executive branch jobs Big Tech cares most about. Depending on how you define 'tech industry,' the answer could be all of them. Most Americans seemingly define 'tech' as any product or service that has computer code as an input at some point in its production cycle. But in a post-iPhone world, that definition touches just about everything. Tech isn't so much a sector as the method of distribution for every other sector. That means Silicon Valley has a stake in almost every part of the regulatory state. Uber, Lyft, and self-driving car manufacturers are obviously interested in the next appointees to the National Transportation Safety Board. Fintech startups regularly schmooze[6] with financial regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The entire gig economy certainly hopes to maintain an anti-worker majority on the National Labor Relations Board. Defense contractors like Palantir and Anduril\u2014not to mention cloud[7] computing services\u2014want the Pentagon to hear their pitches. That said, there are some jobs that we can reasonably assume virtually all of Silicon Valley cares about. While few of these positions were tailor-made to regulate the digital economy, many have jurisdiction over individual elements of common digital business models. Thus far, the industry has had to work with Trump appointees who have been mostly favorable to their bottom lines; while few come from the tech world specifically, almost all share an anti-regulatory zeal from which the industry happily benefits. Broadly speaking, we can clump the jobs most relevant to Big Tech into four categories: Oversight, Cybersecurity, Antitrust and Privacy, and Business Opportunities. With Biden poised to secure the party's nomination, some progressives may fret that a K Street-favored[8] Democrat is their only hope to unseat Trump. But we are not powerless to influence the trajectory of a Biden administration. The first step is to predict how Big Tech will look to solidify its grip on power. Look no further than the powerful government positions it will try to fill with its own darlings.OversightBig Tech's most obvious mark will be the Chief Technology Officer of the United States. This is the president's top adviser on pretty much everything technology\u2014from smartphones to solar panels. Google met with Obama CTO Todd Park 22 times[9] in his two-year tenure, before he was replaced by Google Vice President Megan Smith. But the CTO is a deputy to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, which provides the president with raw scientific information to guide policymaking. Other OSTP jobs include the Senior Adviser for Internet, Innovation and Privacy, and Deputy Director for Policy (Obama's now works for Schmidt Futures \u2014 yes, Google's Schmidt.) There are myriad other advisers of note. Obama's National Economic Council also had a Special Assistant to the President for Economic and Technology Policy. Plus, tech CEOs themselves can be appointed to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Even if these roles have little policymaking authority, they carry the potential for tremendous influence. When it comes to actual decision-makers, though, few policy areas matter more to Big Tech than intellectual property rights. There's a reason why 61 companies and trade groups pleaded[10] for Trump to keep Obama's little-known Patent and Trademark Office Director Michelle Lee on the job. She entered government from Google and slashed[11] the number of patent lawsuits that big platforms face. She ultimately resigned in 2017, and currently enjoys a C-Suite job at Amazon Web Services. The PTO Director is an undersecretary in the Commerce Department, which also houses the Director of Digital Economy and the Digital Economy Board of Advisors, a sounding board for the Commerce Secretary. It was composed[12] almost exclusively of lobbyists under Obama. Moreover, onlookers don't often think about how much Silicon Valley cares about trade. There's a reason why Amazon scooped[13] up former US Trade Representative Michael Ward Punke for a lobbying job. Through trade deals, Big Tech can both circumvent domestic law\u2014as happened[14] with the USMCA\u2014and spread its business-takes-all data regime to the Global South. Simply put, Big Tech knows how to play the trade game.CybersecuritySince it's a concern for the whole of government, every department and agency has individual cybersecurity positions with historical connections to the revolving door. Take Nuala O'Connor. She was a Big Law privacy lawyer who took a job as counsel at DoubleClick, an early targeted ad company. From there, she revolved into government to pioneer the first Chief Privacy Officer position at DHS in 2002. After two years, she went on to stints at Amazon and General Electric before running the Center for Democracy and Technology, a think tank overwhelmingly funded[15] by Silicon Valley. These days, she's a Senior Vice President at Walmart. DHS also maintains a Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee that grants lobbyists and corporate lawyers direct access to the Homeland Security Secretary; current committee members work[16] for Amazon, AT&amp;T, Toyota AI Ventures, Accenture, and Northrop Grumman. In fact, one of the government's most powerful cybersecurity bodies isn't technically a cybersecurity body at all. That's the Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council, a panel meant to offer feedback on new technology to the Federal Communications Commission. Across all four of its iterations since 2011, when it was created, the commission has overrepresented[17] corporations and business voices. The result has strengthened the FCC's laissez-faire attitude when it comes to cybersecurity.Antitrust and PrivacyOf course, the backlash against Big Tech platforms mostly centers on two concerns: privacy violations and monopoly power. That's what led Congresswomen Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren (who both represent Silicon Valley) to propose a new Digital Privacy Agency. Still, Silicon Valley knows precisely which jobs within the existing bureaucracy to target in antitrust and privacy protection. Most are in the Federal Trade Commission. It's not just actual Commissioners. There are positions like the Director of the Office of Policy Planning, Director of the Bureau of Economics, and General Counsel that significantly shape FTC investigations. Right now, each of these positions is held by former professors from George Mason University's Scalia Law School, a notorious conduit[18] for Charles Koch's cash and ideology. The Revolving Door Project's research hasfound[19] that one out of nine attorneys who have passed through the FTC's Bureau of Competition since 2014 had a degree from George Mason. Organizations like UnKoch My Campus have documented[20] how Koch uses universities like George Mason as the first step of a pipeline into infiltrating government. The FTC is also America's de facto privacy regulator. It is grossly understaffed. Last April, even Republican Chairman Joseph Simons complained that the Commission only has 40 employees working[21] on the issue. The FTC's privacy protection powers were also written before the digital era, which limits their applicability to Silicon Valley. Hence Facebook's scrawny punishment over the Cambridge Analytica scandal\u2014a fine whose $5 billion price tag equals[22] about 11 weeks of the company's cash-flow\u2014and which was secured, in part, thanks to former FTC directors revolving[23] out to serve as Facebook's counsel. Indeed, 63 percent[24] of top FTC officials over the last two decades either worked in tech before joining the government, left the government to work in tech, or both. The Department of Justice's current Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust was recently sidelined[25] from the tech investigations since he is a one-time Google M&amp;A lobbyist. But these cases will almost certainly last into the next administration, making his position an important job. Plus, the tech industry has another vector for playing defense: the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). The draft implementation[26] of an executive orderTrump signed[27] in February requires agencies to follow OIRA's cost-benefit analysis framework when considering regulations on artificial intelligence. This superficially sensible rule could block any constraints on big business: sycophantic economists at OIRA regularly twist numbers to reach prepackaged business-friendly conclusions. OIRA hamstrung President Obama's regulatory agenda. There's no reason to think a corporate appointee wouldn't do the same for Big Tech.Business OpportunitiesThe Pentagon's JEDI controversy highlighted how much money and power flows through cloud computing contracts: The Capitol Forum and ProPublica exposed[28] last August how CEOs like Eric Schmidt and Reid Hoffman made direct inroads with military leaders through joining the Defense Innovation Board, whose members gain 'full access to the department and its entities.' ProPublica also highlighted the Defense Digital Service, a unit of former Google and Amazon coders brought in to 'challenge the status quo, burdensome policies and established bureaucracies' at DOD. This usually meant awarding contracts to their old employers. An even bigger money-maker, though, could be the Federal Chief Information Officer job at the Office of Management and Budget. This official oversees federal IT projects and makes recommendations to the whole of government through the 'E-Gov' office they run. The Federal CIO also chairs the Technology Modernization Board, which manages a slush fund for IT projects across the federal agencies. If you want money from the fund, or contracts across Washington, you want this person on your side. These are just a handful of the positions that will matter to the next administration's technology policy\u2014and they may well be overshadowed by new positions the next president will create. No one doubts that 21st-century governments need to understand, regulate, and constrain the technology sector. As a consequence, whole new jobs, bureaucracies, and legal interpretations aimed at accomplishing those goals are inevitable. Still, it's crucial that progressive activists begin thinking this way about the executive branch now. After all, you can't make a difference in Washington without understanding the mechanics of power and influence. Big Tech gets it. It's high time the rest of us do, too.

Electronic devices often include hard to recover that make them expensive to strip for parts. Last year, an estimated 12 million tonnes of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/0/average-household-has-127-worth-old-tech-sitting-small-windfall/\">electronic waste, or e-waste</url> was thrown out across Europe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But that might be about to change. The European Commission (EC) has today laid out new proposals for its Circular Economy Action Plan that could push technology giants into changing how they manage the life cycle of gadgets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Virginijus Sinkevicius, the Commission's environment minister, said: \"The linear growth model has reached its limits... products will be designed to last longer, be easier to repair and upgrade, easier to recycle and easier to reuse.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tech sector is squarely in the sights of the EU. It plans to move towards a universal smartphone charger standard to prevent waste and duplication by the end of this year.</p><p>It also plans to bring in a \"right to update obsolete software\" and a \"right to repair\" by 2021-giving consumers more say over ensuring they can get replacement parts for devices. Beyond this, it also plans to phase out non-disposable batteries to cut down on their hazardous waste.</p><p>The average Briton produces 24.9kg of e-waste, higher than the EU average of 17.7kg. New standards on electronic gadgets will also affect Britain even outside the EU, as tech companies are likely to apply such product decisions globally. Last year, The Telegraph launched its own <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/0/average-household-has-127-worth-old-tech-sitting-small-windfall/\">Zero Waste campaign</url>to improve recycling standards in the UK.</p><p>Some tech firms have already taken strides towards improving sustainability in their products. Others will have some catching up to do.</p><p>                     Making a 'sustainable smartphone'                   </p><p>Making smartphones work in a circular economy is a big technical challenge. Many use rare earth metals that are beyond the realms of ordinary recycling processes to recover economically. Other devices feature batteries that cannot be easily replaced.</p><p>Some have taken steps to try and improve their environmental footprint. Apple has made aggressive promises to cut down on its environmental impact, including an ultimate goal to end all mining. In its latest iPhone 11, Apple says it uses 100pc recycled tin in its logic board, has cut plastic packaging by 7pc and uses around 25pc recycled rare earth metals across the device.</p><p>The company has developed iPhone repair robots-known as Daisy-that are able to disassemble up to 1 million iPhones each year for parts. Last year, Apple expanded its repair programme in August making its tools available to independent repair shops to fix out-of-warranty devices.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, has pledged to include recycled materials in all its hardware devices by 2022, although it is not there yet. In the US, it also has a programme for sending old devices to Google for free so they can be disassembled. In January 2019, Samsung, pledged to replace plastic packaging with bioplastics, recycled plastics and paper.</p><p>But challenges await-not least the EU's plans to force smartphone firms into using a universal charging standard, something Apple opposes. The proposal \"stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, and would harm consumers in Europe and the economy as a whole,\" Apple said in January. Hundreds of millions of devices in Europe already use Apple's \"lightning\" chargers, meaning these could become obsolete.</p><p>The Commission believes having \"a universal charger... and a new charger not included\" in boxes would \"clearly decrease pressure on resource extraction,\" according to Sinkevicius.</p><p>While making a sustainable smartphone is a challenge, it is perfectly possible, according to Miquel Ballester of modular smartphone maker FairPhone. \"We are aligned with these proposals. It is possible to make replaceable batteries and repairable phones. There are already examples out there.\"</p><p>                     PC makers                   </p><p>PC and desktop computer makers have stepped up their efforts, in some cases, to cut down on electronic waste. In 2018, Apple confirmed its new MacBook Air and Mac Mini would be entirely made using recycled aluminium. </p><p>Dell has pledged to reuse or recycle an equivalent device for each one it sells by 2030. \"Our plan includes a moonshoot goal to achieve one-for-one recycling,\" says Louise Koch, a sustainability director at Dell, \"we are also committing that 100 per cent of our packaging... to be made from recycled or renewable material.\"</p><p>But overall, only around a third of total e-waste produced in Europe ends up being recycled in any form. The majority ends up in landfill or is incinerated-while some ends up in parts of Africa and China. In 2020, around 14pc of e-waste is expected to be from PC and TV screens alone. </p><p>Printers and printer cartridges, meanwhile, remain a significant source of e-waste and present a form of hazardous waste to consumers. Printer maker Canon says it already assumes responsibility for recovering 100pc of printer cartridges, which are never sent to landfill.</p><p>                     Software obsolescence                   </p><p>Perhaps one of the most challenging aspects of new EU plans are aims to give a \"right\" to update devices without software obsolescence. Device makers have often limited how many updates they give to devices. In part this is because they may not have enough memory to run the latest software.</p><p>However, tech firms have come into criticism. In 2017, Apple apologised for slowing down older iPhones to make their batteries last longer and agreed to cut prices on replacement batteries. This month, speaker maker Sonos backtracked on a controversial \"Recycle Mode\" that saw it disable older speakers so they could not be used again, which Sonos had said was due to the devices not being able to receive its latest updates.</p><p>But devices are lasting longer-and so is software. Microsoft's Windows 10, introduced in 2015, has rolling updates and was famously dubbed \"the last version of Windows\".</p><p>But offering consumers the latest software is not always easy, says Fairphone's Ballester, with a complicated supply chain meaning parts makers are not always aligned. Therefore, he says, regulation is key so standards on sustainability \"trickle up\" to suppliers across the world.</p><p>                     Fighting the 'right to repair'                   </p><p>Technology firms are keen to publicly tout their green credentials, but some critics are not convinced by their sustainability efforts are more than window dressing. Janter Gunter, a co-founder of The Restart Project which encourages people to repair and reuse devices, says large technology companies are \"looking at ways that they can be seen to be taking care\" of the issue.</p><p>The EU now seems set to introduce a \"right to repair\", a set of technical standards to ensure parts can be repaired and replaced in electronics. But technology firms have resisted similar changes. In the US, Apple has pushed back against bills brought by repair activists, arguing they could lead to consumers hurting themselves when attempting to repair their own devices. </p><p>A spokesman for DigitalEurope, a lobbying organisation which represents technology businesses including Apple, Amazon and Google, said on Wednesday: \"We consider that the Commission's circular economy approach continues to focus too much on consumer products and not enough on industry. Europe already has an extensive and well-established framework of regulations for consumer electronics.\"</p><p>\"They need to call off the marketing dogs,\" says Gunter, \"and they need to rethink what kind of devices they're selling.\"</p><p>And, as Fairphone's Ballester adds: \"We need to consider what is the cost of not doing all this. What will be the cost for the world if we don't do our bit.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-61034027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD8-1871-F021-61XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1286\"/><timeReceived>4:52 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 11, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Graphic by The National</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big technology companies are increasingly playing a role in reshaping banking and financial services which can help boost the inclusion of the unbanked across the globe and reduce transaction costs.</p><p>\"Big Tech's promise is to make payments and financial services as easy and as cheap as sending a text or a picture,\" David Lipton, first deputy managing director of the IMF told a gathering at the fund's headquarters in Washington DC. \"This could potentially change and reshape the financial sector's landscape for the future.\"</p><p>Technology may emanate from Silicon Valley and its adoption at home in the US precedes its use elsewhere, however, nowhere is the impact clearer than in Africa and Asia. The mass market penetration of smartphones facilitated the financial inclusion of unbanked segments of the population in developing countries and helped streamline payment processes.</p><p>The adoption of FinTech services has moved steadily upward, from 16 per cent in 2015 to 33 per cent in 2017 and 64 per cent in 2019, according to EY's Global FinTech Adoption Index. Of 27 markets surveyed globally, consumer FinTech adoption was 87 per cent in both China and India, 82 per cent in South Africa, 76 per cent in Colombia, 72 per cent in Mexico and 71 per cent in the UK.</p><p>The most commonly-used category is money transfer and payments, with 75 per cent of consumers using at least one service in this category and 64 per cent of those polled attracted by the lower fees associated with FinTech services.</p><p>For much of the past decade India has put in place building blocks to digitise public infrastructure. About 1.2 billion people in Asia's third-largest economy today have a digital ID \u2014 the base for electronic verification of an individual's identity, referred to as e-KYC (know your customer), according to Nandan Nilekani, cofounder and chairman of Infosys Technologies, who took part in the discussion at the IMF. With bio-metrics, people can open a bank account within minutes in a manner fully compliant with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws.</p><p>The figures show FinTech adopters as a percentage of the digitally active population in each market. Graphic by The National</p><p>Thanks to the new technology, India's government went live with a programme in 2014 that has led to 330 million new bank accounts opening \u2014 a process that would normally take 46 years, said Mr Nilekani.</p><p>\"E-KYC was essential to financial inclusion because if people don't have an identity, they can't open a bank account or get access to financial services,\" he said. Developing a payment system was the second component and the platform was designed by the central bank and the banks themselves.</p><p>\"The uniqueness of this model is that Big Tech participates along with the banks,\" said Mr Nilekani, adding that six different entities signed up to take part.</p><p>Last month, the platform processed 955 million transactions worth about $23 billion, according to Mr Nilekani.</p><p>\"This has shown that you can have an architecture [and] that you get all the benefits you talk about: convenience, instant payments, get them cheap with instant provisioning and you can do it within the system,\" he said.</p><p>Key to the success of India's platform is its interoperability, allowing transactions to take place between customers using different forms of payment channels in conjunction with financial institutions and the regulator.</p><p>\"The India model is important because it's an open access model, it allows any Big Tech to participate, but they have to come through the banks, and it is interoperable \u2026 the heart of payments is interoperability. Payment is so fundamental to an economy that you need an interoperable payment system,\" said Mr Nilekani.</p><p>About 1.7 billion people across the globe do not have access to digital money and sending money across borders costs an average 7 per cent of the transaction, said David Marcus, a former president of PayPal who now heads Calibra, the Facebook-owned digital wallet set up for the new Libra cryptocurrency. Though communicating costs have been drastically reduced with the coming of the digital age, the same isn't true of financial services when it comes to transaction costs.</p><p>\"Digital money is only for people who have the devices on which they can store the digital money, in other words you need to have a smartphone to keep the digital money,\" said Mr Nilekani. \"If you really want financial inclusion for the world you have to think of those who have no bank accounts, those who have no IDs and how to get them IDs and so on.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/54/157131385838.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/54/157131385838.jpg</url></p><p>The figures show FinTech adopters as a percentage of the digitally active population in each market.

David McCabe, who covers tech policy in Washington, discussed the tech he's using. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  What tech is most important for doing your job?</p><p>  One element of covering policy is understanding what forces are pushing certain ideas forward in Washington. I often turn to government and private disclosure databases to help answer that question.</p><p>  There's a lot of information a few clicks away: Congress maintains databases of whom companies are paying to lobby on their behalf. The Justice Department tracks which operatives are registered to work for foreign firms. The service Guidestar collects the forms that influential nonprofits file with the I.R.S. describing their finances, and many prominent foundations list their grants online.</p><p>  These records don't tell the full story, but they can be a source of valuable context when you're chasing a tip or trying to understand the landscape around a new issue.</p><p>  I try to speak with sources where they are most comfortable. That can be on the phone, by text or encrypted message, or in person. Twitter's and LinkedIn's direct message features can be great ways to reach out to people.</p><p>  For on-the-record interviews, I've recently started using the automated transcription app Otter at the recommendation of other reporters. If I'm doing an interview by phone, I use an Olympus earpiece that plugs into my recorder to capture the conversation.</p><p>  How is Silicon Valley having an impact on Washington?</p><p>  Washington has become intertwined with the Valley in lots of different ways.</p><p>  Every major tech company has ramped up its presence here. Small armies of lobbyists work Capitol Hill and a vast swath of the administration to fight attempts to regulate the industry or to shape the rules when they become inevitable.</p><p>  The revolving door between tech and Washington may have lost some of its luster -- a job at Google or Facebook isn't as shiny as it used to be -- but it is still functioning just fine. For example, Google just hired the chief of staff to Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, to lead its Washington office.</p><p>  How do Washington folks use tech differently, compared with other parts of the country?</p><p>  My unscientific conclusion is that the Washington metro area has the highest per-capita concentration of Twitter users whose profile photo is a shot of them appearing on cable news. Some of those people are my friends, and I would like to take this opportunity to urge them to reconsider.</p><p>  How has the tech fluency among lawmakers changed, or not, over time?</p><p>  Many lawmakers have become more fluent in tech -- or at least more conversant -- since the infamous Mark Zuckerberg hearings in 2018. There's an understanding that before they became giants, Capitol Hill didn't pay enough attention to the platforms that now account for a large share of the economy. In both the House and the Senate, lawmakers are often asking sharper questions than they used to and doing a better job of diving into the specifics.</p><p>  There's a related issue: For years, ''tech policy'' largely meant communications policy. It was about regulating the infrastructure that allows us to share information with one another. That has much wider implications than it used to.</p><p>  If you oversee banking, you have to grok Facebook's attempt to build a cryptocurrency. Google's use of patient records is a health policy question as much as it's a tech policy one. I'm interested in how lawmakers and their staff members adapt to this moment, when major tech companies are trying to play in more and more parts of modern life even as they face scrutiny for the business models that made them successful.</p><p>  And what is the tech industry like in Washington?</p><p>  All eyes are on Amazon and, more specifically, on its second headquarters in Northern Virginia. Its arrival has prompted a lot of questions about whether it will trigger even more gentrification in an already gentrifying city.</p><p>Amazon has been aggressive in building relationships with local educational institutions. In October, its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, visited a class at Dunbar High School in Washington, and the company is counting on local universities to help build the work force for its new offices.</p><p>  The efforts have been met with resistance that is emblematic of the wider reckoning tech faces around its impact on society. Jay Carney, the former White House press secretary who leads Amazon's policy apparatus, visited Trinity Washington University this fall. While he was there, an undocumented student raised concerns about Amazon's work with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and he was met by anti-Amazon activists outside during his visit.</p><p>  Outside of work, what tech are you personally obsessed with?</p><p>  I'm a heavy Spotify user and find that music streaming has broadened my musical horizons. I listen to more artists than I did before and pay more attention to new releases.</p><p>  I am also one of those people who fell hard for AirPods. They look silly, but they work very well. Contrary to my expectations, I haven't lost one of the earbuds yet. That said: Buying the new, pricey AirPods Pro seems like tempting the earbud-losing fates. I'm staying away and saving my money.</p><p>  Frankly, I spend more of my personal time trying to disconnect. I delete Twitter from my phone on vacation and on weekends when I'm being especially disciplined. I have been far less successful in cutting down on my Instagram use, but hope springs eternal.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Congress keeps databases of lobbyists and the companies that hired them.

That number was significant. It brought into sharper focus questions on internet giants' business practices, not just in the US and Europe, but also Australia and India. At the heart of the tension between publishers and Big Tech - a term used to describe large technology companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, among others - is control over content, including news, distribution and monetisation, especially through the advertising technology (ad tech) stacks Big Tech currently owns. Google, some publishers say, owns the entire supply (and demand) chain for ad tech and structures it in a way that disincentivises companies from working with any third-party products. </p><p>The Big Tech player disagrees. \"There is a significant amount of technology disruption right now,\" says Kate Beddoe, Google's head of news partnerships in Asia-Pacific, in a telephonic interaction with ET. \"Our own products are better when there is a vibrant, healthy and thriving ecosystem, and that's why we launched our Digital News Initiative. We structure our relationship in a way that we do better when news does better. We make money and grow when news makes money and grows.\" She adds, \"There is a lot of complexity (in Google's advertising practices), but the fundamentals haven't changed. There is a marketplace or an exchange that happens between advertisers and audiences. Our role is really as a technology provider to facilitate that in a digital environment.\" Facebook did not respond to ET's questions. These practices, publishers say, are central to Big Tech cornering a lion's share - 52.1% in 2019, according to an estimate by market research company eMarketer - of the $130-billion digital advertising business in the US, and its similar dominance elsewhere. In India, the 'duopoly' of digital advertising - Google and Facebook - has a combined market share of 68%, as per a 2018 SeekingAlpha report. Indian digital advertising business, a January 2019 report by Dentsu Aegis Network says, will reach $3.6 billion (Rs 24,920 crore) by 2021, growing at a CAGR of 31.96%. \"Never before in the world - through no company, government or group of governments - has power and control been concentrated in the hands of a single company... (No one) has control over the world as Google has,\" says Anant Goenka, executive director, Indian Express Group. Goenka is also in charge of the company's digital division. \"They not just control the demand and supply, but also the marketplace. Today, no matter which business you are in, you have to build your business keeping Google in mind,\" he says. The Economic Times competes with The Financial Express, also part of the Indian Express Group. OVERALL DOMINANCE The end result is the sheer dominance of two companies - more Google than Facebook - in the search and advertising market, partly due to network effects that, in turn, create high entry barriers, as the European Commission noted. While announcing a Euro 4.2-billion fine on Google in 2018 for abusing its dominant position in the search engine market, the European Commission wrote, \"The more consumers use a search engine, the more attractive it becomes to advertisers. Profits generated can then be used to attract even more consumers. Similarly, data a search engine gathers about consumers can, in turn, be used to improve results.\" Two questions are critical. How does this dominance work? What can be done to create a fairer market? DECODING THE AD STACK Understanding Google's ad tech stack is a complex exercise. There are three areas of concern on Google's control of this supply chain, according to various publishers ET spoke to as part of research for this story. They requested strict anonymity, as they are not authorised to speak to the media... First, attribution. In order to target ads with Google (and the same applies to Facebook), an app must use their sof tware development kits.When an advertiser measures performance, Google and Facebook analytics tools will tell them how many 'conversions' (or, instals) come from ads on Big Tech platforms. However, in case a user clicks on more than one ad before converting, Google counts that as its own conversion alone, as per its policies. For instance, a user sees an ad from Google to download a streaming app. He clicks on it but doesn't download it. Two weeks later, the user sees another ad, say, on a newspaper website, which says \"Watch IPL\" on this streaming app. If the user now clicks and downloads the app, Google's ad tools, used by most advertising buyers, credit the conversion to Google and not the newspaper. \"Google and Facebook have built their attribution tools in a way that favours their own ad platforms,\" says a publisher aware of how Google's ad stack works. The publisher explains, \"Attribution is the means through which money earned from the advertiser is fairly and judiciously shared between various advertising platforms that have contributed to the sale or advertiser's goal. Unfortunately, in the ad tech ecosystem, there have been systematic efforts from Google (and Facebook) to almost disable attribution, that is, nobody else can attribute other than them.\" Naveen Tewari, cofounder and chief executive, InMobi Group, says, \"From the advertisers' point of view, the industry thrives because of them. They are the ones who write the cheque, which becomes revenue for downstream industry participants. Advertisers spend their money not only on walled gardens such as Google or Facebook but also on other platforms such as InMobi.\" He adds, \"However, despite fuelling the industry, advertisers don't have a complete and accurate view of the customer because of a lack of access to data. This is mainly because walled gardens are able to use their scale and control of data, to attribute the success of the platform to themselves.\" In a way, Tewari explains, this is similar to football, where the goalkeeper could have made the initial move in a goal-scoring effort with many players in between, but it is the striker who gets the credit. \"Only when one has a view of the complete move, does one get the accurate picture,\" he adds... The second area of concern is interconnectivity of Google's ad tech products. In the ad tech ecosystem, the advertising buyer and publisher are represented by publisher-side and demandside platforms. The market dynamics between them essentially dictates how open and free the market is. However, Google, publishers say, supplies both sides of the spectrum. DoubleClick (the server that manages the process of delivering ads to websites or apps) and integrated AdX (Google's programmatic ad exchange where people bid for ads) are tools for publishers to run ads and monetise their inventory. This fact was incidentally noted by News Corp in its submissions to Australia's competition commission in March. It wrote, \"Since Google's integrated ad tech services operate along the entire ad tech supply chain and on both advertiser and publisher sides of the market, it creates the potential for anti-competitive conduct. For example, there have been allegations that Google is manipulating DoubleClick to favour its own ad intermediation services.\"All third parties, in essence, are dependent on Google, as the entire chain - analytics, search and ad platforms - is owned by Google. The publisher quoted earlier in the story adds, \"Currently, there is opacity and bias in how publisherside solutions (provided by Google) operate with Google's advertiserside platforms. This is inherently anti-competitive, as it does not allow third-party solution providers the same ease of integration and efficiency with publishers who use Google's advertising ecosystem.\" Equally, third-party advertising networks get secondary access to inventory on AdX. In effect, as the publisher explains, Google tells publishers to \"deploy the AdX unit to get revenues and while it allows you to intermediate other networks, AdX takes the best inventory and gives secondary inventory to other companies.\" TIL also owns and runs Columbia, a leading ad network in Asia-Pacific. Google, Tewari feels, has to open its stack up to create a level playing field. \"Every publisher ends up having their stack and therefore, there are challenges as it is not open. Also, the dominance they're doing from so many different directions is a challenge,\" he says, before adding, \"It's not just us. The publishers face it, the advertisers face it, and platforms like us are facing it.\" The fundamental issue, those from the platform side such as Tewari, feel, is around data. \"Basically, it means they don't let data leave them. They're not letting you become smarter as much as you should - it's like what happened on your platform is with them (Google and Facebook) and not with you. So, you are not able to utilise all of it.\" PUBLISHER OR NOT? Third, Google is also one of the largest publishers online, though it refuses to call itself one. It has sites like Google.com, YouTube and Gmail, all of which sell banner ads. But the question is if these Googleowned sites get preferential access or \"self-preference\" to its advertising solutions over other exchanges and sell-side platforms, given the size of these sites and market share of the advertising solutions. The publisher quoted above says, \"This preferred access to Googleowned sites gives an unfair advantage to advertising solutions because they now have much larger scales and user understanding, as these solutions track their behaviour on these large sites.\" The company is slowly even controlling the demand chain for content, especially in India, where they are publishing content themselves - election results, cricket scores and stock market updates. \"Google needs to stop getting into every avenue available,\" says Goenka, before adding, \"Now having learnt user behaviour, it is becoming a publisher and competing by selling its own ads, ending up controlling who gets to see those ads. It's the last piece in their puzzle.\" Google's Beddoe, however, says Google is first and foremost a technology company \"and, most importantly, a very user-centric technology company.\" She adds, \"Our job is to make sure users get answers from the most trusted and authoritative sources, as quickly as possible. There are quick, fact-based answers to some questions - like \"What is the temperature?\" or \"What is the score?\" but the news is not just quick, fact-based answers but about who, what, why and how -and that is what makes one trust anews organisation over another.\" In a statement, a spokesperson for TIL said, \"Innovation is at the heart of the digital economy and our ecosystem thrives most in an environment that encourages competition. As digital advertising becomes a critical form of marketing, there should be transparency and neutrality on platforms that connect buyers and sellers, so the best offerings get a fair chance of succeeding.\" REGULATION OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING? Executives from the digital advertising industry say the time has come for regulation on lines of traditional advertising, with a monitoring mechanism in place. \"Digital advertising is run using old rules. India has not done much in digital ad regulation and that's not helping the industry,\" said Jessie Paul, chief executive, Paul Writer Strategic Advisory, a Bengalurubased marketing advisory firm. InMobi's Tewari adds, \"Walled gardens thrive because they are not only able to control data they generate but are able to do it at scale. However, this data really belongs to consumers. I firmly believe regulators need to step in and provide a framework that lets consumers own their data and be in control of who, meaning platforms, they want to share the data with.\" Besides, those like Tarun Wadhwa, chief executive of strategy and advisory firm Day One Insights, feel there is also a need for Google to be more transparent. \"Google has massive tentacles across the Web. Google and Facebook store user data. They have advantages and they are years ahead,\" he says, before adding, \"How Google ranks pages, information, connects with users and gets ads is done via an opaque algorithm. They extract power and money from their software tools.\" Paul adds, \"There's no transparent way to verify you are getting what you were promised. Most advertising is based on platform providers' tools and these are not shared; neither do they encourage third-party tools. There's a need for a strong mechanism to monitor advertising.\" But beyond calls for regulation of digital advertising, publishers such as The Indian Express' Goenka feel that if nothing else, Google should \"increase the proportion of revenue that goes to the end publisher.\" Equally, he believes Google must pay for all data the publisher is giving the Google marketplace. \"For instance, I have a price comparison story on Express Drive, saying which car to buy - a Hyundai i10 or a Maruti Swift - the Google ad network serves him ads of both cars wherever he goes. That is based on user behaviour on the publisher's end. Why should they not pay us for data generated by us?\" The fact of the matter, Goenka adds, is that Google was just \"smarter than anyone else in investing resources to build a digital advertising ecosystem, but it also stands to lose if the publisher ecosystem diminishes.\" He says, \"As publishers, we create content that has engagement. With the sheer volume ofcontent the top 5 publishers in India create - around 800 URLs a day each (4,200 new URLs/day collectively) - even if half the number is duplicated, nearly 2,000-2,500 new pieces of content are being created every day by publishers who control 50% of the market.\" Realistically, publishers say they are merely seeking a \"level playing field\" so the digital ad ecosystem doesn't end up becoming a monopoly. The publisher quoted earlier feels there is a need for both Google and Facebook to expose impression-level data or smart data (how many times the ad has been served and seen, who saw the ads, etc) to thirdparty platforms and decouple it from the Google stack, besides making it available for all players in the ad tech ecosystem. \"Currently, this is clearly an unfair environment for other players. Without options, this could lead to the global advertising industry quickly becoming a single option monopoly,\" he says, adding that Google must also ensure all privileges it provides to its own products and platforms are equally provided to other advertising solutions.

That number was significant. It brought into sharper focus questions on internet giants' business practices, not just in the US and Europe, but also Australia and India. At the heart of the tension between publishers and Big Tech - a term used to describe large technology companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, among others - is control over content, including news, distribution and monetisation, especially through the advertising technology (ad tech) stacks Big Tech currently owns. Google, some publishers say, owns the entire supply (and demand) chain for ad tech and structures it in a way that disincentivises companies from working with any third-party products. </p><p>The Big Tech player disagrees. \"There is a significant amount of technology disruption right now,\" says Kate Beddoe, Google's head of news partnerships in Asia-Pacific, in a telephonic interaction with ET. \"Our own products are better when there is a vibrant, healthy and thriving ecosystem, and that's why we launched our Digital News Initiative. We structure our relationship in a way that we do better when news does better. We make money and grow when news makes money and grows.\" She adds, \"There is a lot of complexity (in Google's advertising practices), but the fundamentals haven't changed. There is a marketplace or an exchange that happens between advertisers and audiences. Our role is really as a technology provider to facilitate that in a digital environment.\" Facebook did not respond to ET's questions. These practices, publishers say, are central to Big Tech cornering a lion's share - 52.1% in 2019, according to an estimate by market research company eMarketer - of the $130-billion digital advertising business in the US, and its similar dominance elsewhere. In India, the 'duopoly' of digital advertising - Google and Facebook - has a combined market share of 68%, as per a 2018 SeekingAlpha report. Indian digital advertising business, a January 2019 report by Dentsu Aegis Network says, will reach $3.6 billion (Rs 24,920 crore) by 2021, growing at a CAGR of 31.96%. \"Never before in the world - through no company, government or group of governments - has power and control been concentrated in the hands of a single company... (No one) has control over the world as Google has,\" says Anant Goenka, executive director, Indian Express Group. Goenka is also in charge of the company's digital division. \"They not just control the demand and supply, but also the marketplace. Today, no matter which business you are in, you have to build your business keeping Google in mind,\" he says. The Economic Times competes with The Financial Express, also part of the Indian Express Group. OVERALL DOMINANCE The end result is the sheer dominance of two companies - more Google than Facebook - in the search and advertising market, partly due to network effects that, in turn, create high entry barriers, as the European Commission noted. While announcing a Euro 4.2-billion fine on Google in 2018 for abusing its dominant position in the search engine market, the European Commission wrote, \"The more consumers use a search engine, the more attractive it becomes to advertisers. Profits generated can then be used to attract even more consumers. Similarly, data a search engine gathers about consumers can, in turn, be used to improve results.\" Two questions are critical. How does this dominance work? What can be done to create a fairer market? DECODING THE AD STACK Understanding Google's ad tech stack is a complex exercise. There are three areas of concern on Google's control of this supply chain, according to various publishers ET spoke to as part of research for this story. They requested strict anonymity, as they are not authorised to speak to the media... First, attribution. In order to target ads with Google (and the same applies to Facebook), an app must use their sof tware development kits.When an advertiser measures performance, Google and Facebook analytics tools will tell them how many 'conversions' (or, instals) come from ads on Big Tech platforms. However, in case a user clicks on more than one ad before converting, Google counts that as its own conversion alone, as per its policies. For instance, a user sees an ad from Google to download a streaming app. He clicks on it but doesn't download it. Two weeks later, the user sees another ad, say, on a newspaper website, which says \"Watch IPL\" on this streaming app. If the user now clicks and downloads the app, Google's ad tools, used by most advertising buyers, credit the conversion to Google and not the newspaper. \"Google and Facebook have built their attribution tools in a way that favours their own ad platforms,\" says a publisher aware of how Google's ad stack works. The publisher explains, \"Attribution is the means through which money earned from the advertiser is fairly and judiciously shared between various advertising platforms that have contributed to the sale or advertiser's goal. Unfortunately, in the ad tech ecosystem, there have been systematic efforts from Google (and Facebook) to almost disable attribution, that is, nobody else can attribute other than them.\" Naveen Tewari, cofounder and chief executive, InMobi Group, says, \"From the advertisers' point of view, the industry thrives because of them. They are the ones who write the cheque, which becomes revenue for downstream industry participants. Advertisers spend their money not only on walled gardens such as Google or Facebook but also on other platforms such as InMobi.\" He adds, \"However, despite fuelling the industry, advertisers don't have a complete and accurate view of the customer because of a lack of access to data. This is mainly because walled gardens are able to use their scale and control of data, to attribute the success of the platform to themselves.\" In a way, Tewari explains, this is similar to football, where the goalkeeper could have made the initial move in a goal-scoring effort with many players in between, but it is the striker who gets the credit. \"Only when one has a view of the complete move, does one get the accurate picture,\" he adds... The second area of concern is interconnectivity of Google's ad tech products. In the ad tech ecosystem, the advertising buyer and publisher are represented by publisher-side and demandside platforms. The market dynamics between them essentially dictates how open and free the market is. However, Google, publishers say, supplies both sides of the spectrum. DoubleClick (the server that manages the process of delivering ads to websites or apps) and integrated AdX (Google's programmatic ad exchange where people bid for ads) are tools for publishers to run ads and monetise their inventory. This fact was incidentally noted by News Corp in its submissions to Australia's competition commission in March. It wrote, \"Since Google's integrated ad tech services operate along the entire ad tech supply chain and on both advertiser and publisher sides of the market, it creates the potential for anti-competitive conduct. For example, there have been allegations that Google is manipulating DoubleClick to favour its own ad intermediation services.\"All third parties, in essence, are dependent on Google, as the entire chain - analytics, search and ad platforms - is owned by Google. The publisher quoted earlier in the story adds, \"Currently, there is opacity and bias in how publisherside solutions (provided by Google) operate with Google's advertiserside platforms. This is inherently anti-competitive, as it does not allow third-party solution providers the same ease of integration and efficiency with publishers who use Google's advertising ecosystem.\" Equally, third-party advertising networks get secondary access to inventory on AdX. In effect, as the publisher explains, Google tells publishers to \"deploy the AdX unit to get revenues and while it allows you to intermediate other networks, AdX takes the best inventory and gives secondary inventory to other companies.\" TIL also owns and runs Columbia, a leading ad network in Asia-Pacific. Google, Tewari feels, has to open its stack up to create a level playing field. \"Every publisher ends up having their stack and therefore, there are challenges as it is not open. Also, the dominance they're doing from so many different directions is a challenge,\" he says, before adding, \"It's not just us. The publishers face it, the advertisers face it, and platforms like us are facing it.\" The fundamental issue, those from the platform side such as Tewari, feel, is around data. \"Basically, it means they don't let data leave them. They're not letting you become smarter as much as you should - it's like what happened on your platform is with them (Google and Facebook) and not with you. So, you are not able to utilise all of it.\" PUBLISHER OR NOT? Third, Google is also one of the largest publishers online, though it refuses to call itself one. It has sites like Google.com, YouTube and Gmail, all of which sell banner ads. But the question is if these Googleowned sites get preferential access or \"self-preference\" to its advertising solutions over other exchanges and sell-side platforms, given the size of these sites and market share of the advertising solutions. The publisher quoted above says, \"This preferred access to Googleowned sites gives an unfair advantage to advertising solutions because they now have much larger scales and user understanding, as these solutions track their behaviour on these large sites.\" The company is slowly even controlling the demand chain for content, especially in India, where they are publishing content themselves - election results, cricket scores and stock market updates. \"Google needs to stop getting into every avenue available,\" says Goenka, before adding, \"Now having learnt user behaviour, it is becoming a publisher and competing by selling its own ads, ending up controlling who gets to see those ads. It's the last piece in their puzzle.\" Google's Beddoe, however, says Google is first and foremost a technology company \"and, most importantly, a very user-centric technology company.\" She adds, \"Our job is to make sure users get answers from the most trusted and authoritative sources, as quickly as possible. There are quick, fact-based answers to some questions - like \"What is the temperature?\" or \"What is the score?\" but the news is not just quick, fact-based answers but about who, what, why and how -and that is what makes one trust anews organisation over another.\" In a statement, a spokesperson for TIL said, \"Innovation is at the heart of the digital economy and our ecosystem thrives most in an environment that encourages competition. As digital advertising becomes a critical form of marketing, there should be transparency and neutrality on platforms that connect buyers and sellers, so the best offerings get a fair chance of succeeding.\" REGULATION OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING? Executives from the digital advertising industry say the time has come for regulation on lines of traditional advertising, with a monitoring mechanism in place. \"Digital advertising is run using old rules. India has not done much in digital ad regulation and that's not helping the industry,\" said Jessie Paul, chief executive, Paul Writer Strategic Advisory, a Bengalurubased marketing advisory firm. InMobi's Tewari adds, \"Walled gardens thrive because they are not only able to control data they generate but are able to do it at scale. However, this data really belongs to consumers. I firmly believe regulators need to step in and provide a framework that lets consumers own their data and be in control of who, meaning platforms, they want to share the data with.\" Besides, those like Tarun Wadhwa, chief executive of strategy and advisory firm Day One Insights, feel there is also a need for Google to be more transparent. \"Google has massive tentacles across the Web. Google and Facebook store user data. They have advantages and they are years ahead,\" he says, before adding, \"How Google ranks pages, information, connects with users and gets ads is done via an opaque algorithm. They extract power and money from their software tools.\" Paul adds, \"There's no transparent way to verify you are getting what you were promised. Most advertising is based on platform providers' tools and these are not shared; neither do they encourage third-party tools. There's a need for a strong mechanism to monitor advertising.\" But beyond calls for regulation of digital advertising, publishers such as The Indian Express' Goenka feel that if nothing else, Google should \"increase the proportion of revenue that goes to the end publisher.\" Equally, he believes Google must pay for all data the publisher is giving the Google marketplace. \"For instance, I have a price comparison story on Express Drive, saying which car to buy - a Hyundai i10 or a Maruti Swift - the Google ad network serves him ads of both cars wherever he goes. That is based on user behaviour on the publisher's end. Why should they not pay us for data generated by us?\" The fact of the matter, Goenka adds, is that Google was just \"smarter than anyone else in investing resources to build a digital advertising ecosystem, but it also stands to lose if the publisher ecosystem diminishes.\" He says, \"As publishers, we create content that has engagement. With the sheer volume ofcontent the top 5 publishers in India create - around 800 URLs a day each (4,200 new URLs/day collectively) - even if half the number is duplicated, nearly 2,000-2,500 new pieces of content are being created every day by publishers who control 50% of the market.\" Realistically, publishers say they are merely seeking a \"level playing field\" so the digital ad ecosystem doesn't end up becoming a monopoly. The publisher quoted earlier feels there is a need for both Google and Facebook to expose impression-level data or smart data (how many times the ad has been served and seen, who saw the ads, etc) to thirdparty platforms and decouple it from the Google stack, besides making it available for all players in the ad tech ecosystem. \"Currently, this is clearly an unfair environment for other players. Without options, this could lead to the global advertising industry quickly becoming a single option monopoly,\" he says, adding that Google must also ensure all privileges it provides to its own products and platforms are equally provided to other advertising solutions.

They argued that online privacy rules would be difficult to implement in the midst of the pandemic, which had forced most staff to work from home.</p><p>\"Now is not the time to threaten business leaders with premature enforcement lawsuits,\" they claimed. The plea by some of the world's most powerful companies was just one example of how Big Tech has been using the crisis to double down on its lobbying efforts.</p><p>In another example of what some have described as \"opportunistic lobbying\", Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, wrote to Donald Trump, the US president, in March to ask that the country's economic package also include independent workers. He added this could go further to change how America classifies workers - something Uber has long been attempting to address. \"I am eager for us to work together to establish a new standard for flexible work,\" he wrote.</p><p>Technology companies are perhaps better placed than most right now to demand changes in regulation to suit their needs. Once regarded as selfserving monopolies, governments are now turning to the likes of Google and Amazon to manage the crisis. Jason Kint, chief executive of industry group Digital Content Next, said they have found themselves \"in a position to do a world of good\" thanks to their dominance of information.</p><p>\"I fully expect they will readily share this with policymakers,\" he said. \"But no one should be lulled into thinking they will willingly do anything to limit their data and market capture.\"</p><p>For instance, Google launched a global movement tracker, based on location data from users, to show governments how their populations were moving. But Kint notes that data and antitrust concerns that have plagued technology firms \"will still exist when this passes\".</p><p>Such policy problems are not limited to the US. In the UK, the digital services tax, a 2pc tax on some tech giants on online advertising and e-commerce revenues, came into effect on April 1. Although it will not need to be paid until January, some have suggested it could be pushed back further. \"It should be delayed until the following year and give companies a bit more breathing space,\" Neil Ross, of TechUK, told the journal Tax Notes.</p><p>Privacy feels less important when lives are at stake, while prohibitive taxes and rules seem punitive when companies are helping to fight Covid-19.</p><p>Such shifts in attitude will be nothing if not beneficial to the longer-term policy goals of Big Tech.</p><p>'No one should be lulled into thinking they will willingly do anything to limit their data and market capture'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-158907637</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YKY-3591-DYTY-C0V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 7, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff was pushing the World Economic Forum's 1 Trillion Trees initiative, and even managed to get the Trump Administration committed. Driving the news: How artificial intelligence should be regulated was also a big topic in Davos, though companies' agendas varied. </p><p>IBM called for \"targeted regulation\" of AI. CEO Ginni Rometty was quick to point out that the company wants to see legislation focused on how specific technologies are used, rather than blanket bans, like Europe is considering for public use of facial recognition.Google issued a broader call for regulation, including support for a temporary ban on facial recognition[2].While other companies sought to make nice with critics, Palantir CEO Alex Karp vigorously defended his company's work with the U.S. government \u2014 including immigration agencies \u2014 in an interview[3] with CNBC. Meanwhile: Those were just the public pronouncements. Tech leaders spent much of Davos behind closed doors, meeting with top officials from around the world. About three dozen of the tech leaders met with President Trump on Wednesday, though the discussion focused largely on the friendly turf of workforce training, with Apple's Tim Cook and IBM's Rometty delivering remarks.Tech leaders also met privately with top officials from Europe, which is seen as taking the lead on regulation. And then there were all the pop-ups. The street outside the Congress Centre, known as the Promenade, was taken over by tech companies, who paid to commandeer the town's shops for the week in an effort to seem warm and fuzzy.That was good news if you wanted branded lip balm or free food, but bad news if you wanted to see any remnants of the cute ski town.Facebook threw its storefront open to highlight its platform security work, share a host of feel-good stories and demo its Oculus VR systems. Microsoft was demoing Hololens and serving up a yummy Thai curry. Surprisingly, Google's pop-up was open only to those with an appointment.

The sun was shining, a gentle breeze was blowing and, at a Silicon Valley coffee shop, Rep. Ro Khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject: the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies. \"There's some more humility out here,\" Khanna, D-Calif., said. </p><p>The billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh. Chris Larsen was on his third start-up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley, if not the world. \"Realizing people hate your guts has some value,\" he joked. For decades, Democrats and Republicans have hailed America's business elite, especially in Silicon Valley, as the country's salvation. The government might be gridlocked, the electorate angry and divided, but America's innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain-free way out of the mess. Their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the U.S. economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing. Their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country's most vexing problems. Government's role was to stay out of the way. Now that consensus is shattering. For the first time in decades, capitalism's future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for America's business elite. In places such as Silicon Valley, the slopes of Davos, Switzerland, and the halls of Harvard Business School, there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made America an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart. On a quiet weekday at a strip-mall coffee shop, the conversation between Khanna and Larsen turned to what went so wrong. Americans still loved technology, Khanna said, but too many of them felt locked out of the country's economic future and were looking for someone to blame. \"What happened to us?\" he imagined people in these left-behind places asking. Part of Khanna's solution was to sign on as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against \"the handful of billionaires\" who \"control the economic and political life of this nation,\" and who disproportionately live in Khanna's district. The other part of Khanna's solution was to do what he was doing now, talking to billionaire tech executives like Larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and Silicon Valley was unsustainable. Boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year, Larsen's net worth had briefly hit $59 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world before the currency's value fell. Without an intervention, he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in Silicon Valley and anger in the country would continue to grow. \"It seems like every company in the world has to be here,\" Larsen said. \"It's just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger.\" At some point, Larsen and Khanna worried, something was going to break. The 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of American capitalism. But it was Donald Trump's election and the pent-up anger it exposed that left America's billionaire class fearful for capitalism's future. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Khanna was elected in 2016, just as the anxiety started to spread. In Europe, far-right nationalist parties were gaining ground. Closer to home, socialists and Trump-inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections. Conversations of the sort that Khanna was having with Larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism's most rarefied circles including Harvard Business School, where last fall Seth Klarman, a highly influential billionaire investor, delivered what he described as a \"plaintive wail\" to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late. The setting was the opening of Klarman Hall, a new $120 million conference center, built with his family's donation. \"It's a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can,\" he told the audience gathered in the 1,000-seat auditorium. \"It's a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions ... or harsh ones; to offer good benefits or paltry ones.\" If business leaders didn't \"ask hard questions about capitalism,\" he warned that they would be asked by \"ideologues seeking to point fingers, assign blame and make reckless changes to the system.\" Six months after that speech, Klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass. Leading politicians, such as Trump, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., were advocating positions on tariffs, wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. Klarman wasn't opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation. But he worried that these new proposals went much too far. \"I think we're in the middle of a revolution \u2014 not a guns revolution \u2014 but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up, and good things don't happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution,\" he said. He wasn't the only one who felt a sense of alarm. One of the most popular classes at Harvard Business School, home to the next generation of Fortune 500 executives, was a class on \"reimagining capitalism.\" Seven years ago, the elective started with 28 students. Now there were nearly 300 taking it. During that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government, said Rebecca Henderson, the Harvard economist who teaches the course. \"What the trust surveys say is what I see,\" she said. \"They are really worried about the direction in which the U.S. and the world is heading.\" A few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading \"Winners Take All,\" a book by Anand Giridharadas, a journalist and former McKinsey consultant, that had hit the best-seller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like Silicon Valley, Davos and Harvard Business School. Giridharadas' book was a withering attack on America's billionaire class and the notion that America's iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government. This spring, Giridharadas took his argument to Klarman Hall. He slammed Mark Zuckerberg, taking aim at the Facebook founder's $100 million effort to fix Newark's faltering schools and his $3 billion push to end disease in a generation. \"I'm glad he's trying to get rid of all the diseases, [but] I wish Facebook wasn't a plague,\" Giridharadas said. He trashed Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber-wealthy. And he lambasted the notion, frequently championed by the likes of Bill Gates and Barack Obama, that Silicon Valley's innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism's rewards. \"Really?\" Giridharadas asked. \"Now five companies control America, instead of 100! And a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted.\" For many of the students, schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place, Giridharadas' ideas were both energizing and disorienting. Erika Uyterhoeven, a second-year student, recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when Giridharadas was finished. \"So, what should we do?\" her colleague asked. \"Is he saying we shouldn't go into banking or consulting?\" Added another student: \"There was a palpable sense of personal desperation.\" \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district. He grew up in an overwhelmingly white, middle-class suburb of Philadelphia. After college and Yale Law School, he moved to Silicon Valley in 2003, hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world. In 2014, backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors, Khanna challenged an eight-term incumbent in a Democratic primary and lost. The defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed \u2014 in particular, the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district, where the median home value in formerly blue-collar cities surged past $2 million. \"The best thing that happened to me was that I lost my 2014 election,\" he said. \"Had I won ... maybe I would've been a traditional neoliberal. It really forced my self-reflection and it pointed out every weakness I ever had.\" In California, Khanna's home is a small apartment around the corner from a Dollar Tree, one of only two in his district. His wife and two children live most of the year in Washington, where home values are cheaper. His days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid Silicon Valley's success. \"I am an 11-year renter with a master's degree,\" a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees. Her question wasn't about whether she would ever be able to afford a home, but about a fellow teacher who couldn't afford health insurance. A few days earlier, he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage. Khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf. The billionaires in Khanna's district, meanwhile, were consumed by a different worry. Mixed in with the valley's usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism. The digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job-producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era. The result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands. As technology advanced, some feared things were only going to get worse. Robots were eliminating much factory work; online commerce was decimating retail; and self-driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers. The next step was computers that could learn and think. \"What happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor?\" said Greg Brockman, chairman of OpenAI, a company backed by several Silicon Valley billionaires. Such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research, said Brockman, 30. They could displace a large number of office jobs. Eventually, he said, the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live. Only Andrew Yang, a long-shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur, supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income. But the idea of a \"universal basic income\" was discussed regularly in the valley. The prospect was both energizing and terrifying. OpenAI had recently added an ethicist \u2014 Brockman sometimes referred to her as a \"philosopher\" \u2014 to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations. To Brockman, a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat, a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty. \"Once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing, my expectation is that we're going to look back at eating meat as this terrible, immoral thing,\" he said. The same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence. \"We'll look back and say, \u2018Wow, that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive,' \" he said. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci-fi fantasy. His focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today. He often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies. The tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent. On a warm spring evening, Khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen Silicon Valley tech executives, software engineers and venture capitalists. The group gathered at a $5 million Mediterranean-style villa perched atop a hill overlooking Cupertino, which glittered in the valley below. Khanna described a December trip he organized to tiny Jefferson, Iowa, for a group of tech executives that included Microsoft's chief technology officer and a LinkedIn co-founder. The executives donated to the community college's scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs, starting at $65,000 a year. Khanna had made similar trips to West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. The total number of jobs these trips produced was small, and the pay wasn't great. Still, Khanna believed they served a larger purpose. They proved that people in Silicon Valley cared about places like Jefferson, a rural town of only 4,200. They gave people hope that even the remotest parts of America could take part in the country's tech revolution. The next step, Khanna told the executives at the mansion in Cupertino, California, was a $100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes, similar to land-grant colleges, to train workers in left-behind parts of America. Khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass. But that wasn't really the point. \"It sets a blueprint,\" he said. Khanna's blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country. Many Democrats blamed Trump's victory and the country's divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favored positions. Khanna had a different view. He saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity. Sometimes Khanna imagined what people in these left-behind parts of the country were thinking: Their grandparents had fought in World War II and helped build the country's industrial age economy. Now they worried people like Khanna, whose parents emigrated from India, were surging past them. \"They just got here, and they are doing really, really well,\" Khanna imagined these people saying. \"What happened to us?\" Not everyone at the tech gathering was buying Khanna's analysis. Atam Rao, a nuclear engineer, told Khanna that he had come to the United States from India 50 years earlier. Rao's son, who founded a successful video-game company in Los Angeles, was born in America. The day after Trump was elected, his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in India, just in case they needed to return someday. \"Are we welcome here?\" he said his son asked. He believed that Khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country. \"They found someone to blame,\" Rao said of Trump and his backers. \"This is not going to be won by logic.\" But that wasn't the America Khanna knew. It didn't fit with his experience growing up in suburban Philadelphia or arriving in Silicon Valley, where Indians had become rock stars and CEOs of companies such as Google. And it didn't comport with the results of the 2018 election, he said, now speaking directly to Rao. \"The same country that elected Trump just elected the most diverse Congress in the country's history,\" Khanna said. Khanna didn't deny the problem of racism, but like Sanders he saw the country's divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism's shortcomings and the economy, not race. A few days after the meeting at the Cupertino mansion, Khanna was standing in front of 16,000 amped-up Sanders supporters. The San Francisco skyline rose in front of him and the Golden Gate Bridge spanned the bay behind him. In his gray suit and pressed white shirt, the two-term congressman looked a bit out of place \u2014 an emissary from establishment Washington crashing someone else's revolution. Khanna gave a brief speech introducing Sanders, who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 Democratic primaries. He bashed the billionaire class and its influence over American elections. \"Democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections,\" Sanders yelled in his Brooklyn growl. \"We say no to oligarchy,\" he continued. \"Yes to democracy.\" Khanna's eyes fixed on Steve Spinner, a big tech investor in Silicon Valley and major fundraiser for Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Spinner, who chaired Khanna's congressional win, was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest. \"We dragged him out here,\" Khanna said. \"He's about as far from Bernie as you can get.\" Many of Khanna's billionaire supporters \u2014 even those who worried about capitalism and inequality \u2014 seemed genuinely puzzled by Khanna's affection for Sanders. For Khanna it was simple: In Sanders, Khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country's most vexing problems: inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism. Sanders wasn't a perfect match for Khanna. Sanders didn't really understand the tech industry \u2014 though he wasn't calling for the breakup of big tech companies like Warren and some other candidates. Warren's proposal, if executed, would hurt companies in Khanna's district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers. Khanna wished Sanders would talk more about the greatness of the American economy and the power of the tech industry, when properly taxed and regulated, to lift people out of poverty. But on that score Khanna believed he could help Sanders. \"We can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue,\" Khanna said. \"But I have no doubt that if Bernie Sanders was in the White House, he'd wake up every day thinking, \u2018How do I solve structural inequality in America?' \u2018' The 77-year-old socialist's speech had passed the one-hour mark and the crowd was still laughing, cheering, hooting and shouting. \"We're probably not going to get a lot of support from the one percent and the large profitable corporations,\" Sanders said. A voice in the crowd screamed an expletive. \"That's OK,\" Sanders continued, \"I don't need, and we don't want, their support.\" The congressman in the gray suit gazed out at the crowd, which stretched to the back of the park. Khanna saw Sanders' revolution as an imperfect solution to a near-impossible problem. For now, though, it was the best he could find.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Rep.

The European Union is currently building a blockchain-based gateway designed to share information on listed companies and also follow challenges and opportunities for European industry and governments.</p><p>\"I am not surprised, since there is untapped potential for using the technology to provide citizens with new services while improving regulation and markets are monitored,\" says Christian Catalini, professor at MIT.</p><p>Catalini defines blockchains as \"really a suite of technologies\". He thinks the technology will change our lives within the next five to 10 years - we will see many different, new types of digital platforms that will rely on a crypto-token for their operations. \"At a high level, a blockchain allows a network of devices to agree, at regular intervals, about the true state of shared data,\" says Catalini. \"What that shared data represents can be many things: currency, equity in a start-up, intellectual property, attributes tied to identity or provenance of goods. This is why the benefits from it will affect multiple industries.\"</p><p>The first distributed blockchain was conceptualised in 2008 by an anonymous person in Japan known as Satoshi Nakamoto and formed the core of bitcoin, the first digital currency. Like so many computing revolutions, wider implementation began in the US.</p><p>Yet the centre of gravity of blockchain use could move toward Europe.</p><p>\"I think the verdict is still out on whether the US or Europe will lead in the blockchain race,\" says Lasse Birk Olesen, co-founder of Coinify, a blockchain payment provider, and Bitcoin Nordic, a bitcoin brokers in Europe.</p><p>\"The US has vastly greater risk-taking venture capital funds and the largest share of big tech corporations willing to adopt blockchain technology,\" says Olesen. \"However, what many think is overly strict financial regulation of blockchain companies, as seen in New York, has been making EU jurisdictions more attractive.\"</p><p>He points to \"the so-called crypto valley of Zug, Switzerland, where the government is accepting bitcoin payments\". Moreover, \"many Initial Coin Offerings have been in Switzerland, which counterbalances the advantage of the US as the start-up capital\", says Olesen.</p><p>Before blockchains, a fintech entrepreneur had to get permission from banks to access the existing financial infrastructure, says Olesen. \"For many entrepreneurs, that meant asking competitors for permission to launch their products. Blockchains are democratising finance by allowing anyone to access a global financial infrastructure, enabling any entrepreneur to do the same as the biggest banks of yesterday could. Blockchains are the internet of value. That's incredibly powerful, and I can't wait to see what people are building.\"</p><p>The Danish entrepreneur says \"blockchains are digitising trust or even making trust obsolete in many cases\".</p><p>\"For instance, blockchains can be used to issue election tokens to people during political elections. So even though it is digital, it can be issued in such a way that it is cryptographically guaranteed for people to remain anonymous when they vote. And when the election result is published, voters can cryptographically verify that their specific vote was counted as part of the election result. This can be beneficial particularly in countries that face problems with election fraud. Blockchains, in such cases, can remove the need to trust humans counting the votes. Every day people are discovering new ways to use blockchains to digitise trust or make trust obsolete,\" he says. But that seems to be a far cry from today. For now, the German Central Bank says consumers won't yet accept crypto-currencies.</p><p>Ferdinando M. Ametrano, professor of Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology at Politecnico University of Milan, notes \"any form of innovation has inherent risks and dangers, but to cast a bad light over bitcoins is short-sighted. For the first time in digital realm we have a scarce asset that can be transferred but not duplicated: the bitcoin aims to be the digital equivalent of physical gold.\" Though still complex to use \"as the technology evolves, it will become user-friendly and integrated with existing currencies\".</p><p>With a long history of ideological revolution, Europe might be the centre of yet another, this time in the digital world.</p><p>Mariella Radaelli and Jon Van Housen are editors at the Luminosity Italia news agency in Milan</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-101237070</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PNS-7PF1-JDJN-653P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"822\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

Let us know at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B8awlHff7M&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be\">dealbook@nytimes.com</url>.</p><p>How to restore strength and fairness to our economy</p><p>By Leo E. Strine Jr. and Dorothy S. Lund</p><p>When we cautiously return to normalcy, there will be a natural tendency to play the blame game about the reality that our economic system was not well positioned to absorb the effects of the pandemic without an enormous corporate bailout. Bluntly, why do the wealthiest institutions in our society appear to manage their balance sheets less prudently than many middle-class Americans?</p><p>When many businesses did not have sufficient reserves to pay the next month\u2019s rent after less than a month of slowdown, and when many more furloughed or laid off thousands of workers for the same reason, it will be tempting to single out examples for shaming. But the finger-pointing will obscure a central question that must be answered if we want our economy to better endure unexpected shocks in the future: Are Americans well served by a corporate governance system that has encouraged all sectors of the economy to run their businesses on fumes?</p><p>What we mean by that is simple. Families are encouraged to put aside a reserve to pay their mortgages and bills and to feed themselves in case of an emergency. Why don\u2019t corporations do the same? After a 10-year economic expansion that led to record increases in earnings, plus huge corporate tax relief, American corporations should have had substantial cash reserves to sustain them during a short period without revenue. But many did not, and instead were highly leveraged, lacked adequate reserves and lived paycheck to paycheck, so to speak. What happened to that cash? Much of it was returned to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks.</p><p>At the same time, American corporations weakened the traditional gain-sharing between the workforce and stockholders that characterized the post-World War II era. During that period, when corporate profits went up, workers shared equitably in the gains. Not any more.</p><p>There are many reasons for this, including diminished legal protection for workers seeking to unionize. But our corporate governance system must accept substantial responsibility for the slant against workers and in favor of stockholders. Powerful institutional investors have arisen to pressure companies to reduce the share of corporate profits that goes into workers\u2019 paychecks and tilt companies toward riskier balance sheets. Making this more piquant is that these institutional investors wield the power that flows from the 401(k) retirement savings of American workers, worker-investors who derive almost all of their wealth and savings from their continued access to a job and fair pay raises.</p><p>Recently, the Business Roundtable and leading institutional investors have responded to growing inequality and economic insecurity by calling for greater respect toward all corporate stakeholders, not just stockholders. But what does it say about whether rhetoric is enough that, in the national emergency we are facing, American workers and taxpayers, not institutional investors or top corporate managers, are bearing the brunt of the harm? We are again paying the price for a corporate governance system that lacks focus on financial soundness, sustainable wealth creation and the fair treatment of workers.</p><p>For too long, the stock market\u2019s power over our economy has grown at the expense of other stakeholders, particularly workers. Although overall wealth has grown, it has done so in a skewed way that is unfair to the bulk of the American workers who are primarily responsible for that increase. The shift toward satisfying insatiable stock market demands has also led to increasing levels of corporate debt and economic risk.</p><p>Because we are spending more than $2 trillion to keep our economy afloat, some will argue that we lack the capacity to address the deeper problems that made us weak when we most needed strength. They are dangerously mistaken. It is more important than ever to understand the connection between the poor policy choices we have made and the reasons for yet another enormous corporate bailout. Instead of retreat, we need a 21st-century New Deal that, in the bold spirit of F.D.R., rebalances our corporate governance system and makes it deliver economic security for the many once again.</p><p>Instead of just rhetoric, consider regulatory action to encourage corporations and institutional investors to make the best interests of American workers, consumers, communities and the environment an end goal of corporate governance, as important as serving stockholders. Public and large private companies receiving bailouts or pandemic-related subsidies could be required to become public benefit corporations under state law, and others could be given positive incentives to do the same. Institutional investors and socially important companies could be required to disclose to the public how much weight they give to issues like worker pay and safety, environmental responsibility and maintaining a strong balance sheet.</p><p>Restoring the fairness of our economic system also requires investments in infrastructure, innovation and worker training to meet the existential threat of climate change and improve the quality of pay and job prospects for American workers. Penny-pinching did not inhibit the bailout of the financial industry in 2008, the 2017 corporate tax cuts or the emergency bill to address the pandemic. And it cannot stop us from funding what is needed to get America back to work and to prevent the catastrophic consequences of global warming. Progressive approaches like a financial transaction tax, a graduated capital gains tax and an end to the carried interest loophole for hedge funds can pay for these essential investments fairly. These measures are integral to corporate governance reform because they encourage sustainable investing and put a damper on imprudent speculation.</p><p>Finally, we must acknowledge this fact: Waiting until a dark economic moment to give workers Band-Aids in a bailout bill is a poor substitute for giving them what they deserve in the first place. Restoring a fair opportunity for American workers to unionize, and increasing worker voice and leverage at socially important businesses, must be at the forefront of any agenda to make sure that American capitalism delivers for all of us.</p><p>Long reads for the long weekend</p><p> The New York Times\u2019s Opinion team has started a new project imagining how the United States can address the inequalities exposed by the coronavirus crisis, and emerge more resilient than before.

But AI also presents a myriad of challenges, especially for the businesses designing AI systems.</p><p>In the last or so 30 years, AI has left the laboratory and appeared in our everyday lives. \u201cThat\u2019s the funny thing about AI \u2013 it is touching people\u2019s lives but they may not even realise it,\u201d says Toby Walsh, Scientia Professor of AI in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW Sydney, leads the Algorithmic Decision Theory group at Data61.</p><p>Prof. Walsh was recently named one of the 14 prestigious Australian Laureate Fellows, being awarded $3.1 million by the Australian Research Council to continue his research into understanding how to build AI systems that humans can trust.The challenges AI presents today</p><p>Every time you read a story on your Facebook or Twitter feed, it is AI that is recommending those stories to you, while a third of all the movies you watch on Netflix are also coming from algorithms, explains Prof. Walsh. But even such harmless-sounding activities passed over to machines can have corrosive effects on society, he warns.</p><p>Indeed, his research is uncovering just how wide-ranging the adverse effects can be. \u201cThey can create filter bubbles, where we end up with either fake news or the possibility of elections being tampered with,\u201d he says.</p><p>While AI has the ability to make society a fairer and more just place by taking away menial jobs, it can also be used to hurt the cohesion of society. In fact, Prof. Walsh says he is more worried about more mundane misuses of AI today than he is of superintelligent AI in the future. 'I'm much more worried about the increasing inequality that automation is driving in society,\u201d he explains.</p><p>Algorithms can be just as biased as humans and this is one of the biggest challenges facing AI today. 'Worse, they are not accountable in any legal way and they are not transparent,\u201d continues Prof. Walsh.</p><p>So in his research, Prof. Walsh is looking at how to build AI and verify that AI systems make fair decisions, which can be traced, explained and audited, and are respectful of people\u2019s privacy.</p><p>But what about companies that are already using AI, namely the Big Five (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google) \u2013 how do such powerful tech behemoths design AI processes that people can trust?Google designs AI based on seven principles</p><p>In March 2018, Google announced it had partnered with the Pentagon on 'Project Maven' where it helped analyse and interpret drone videos via AI. Following this, the tech giant released a set of seven AI principles that form an ethical charter, guiding all development and use of AI at Google, and which prohibits its use in weapons and human rights abuses.</p><p>But some say many of the considerations since 2018 have not gone away. The Human Rights Watch recently published a report calling for a ban on \u201cfully autonomous weapons'. Indeed, the potential to use AI for good is immense, but such powerful technology raises equally powerful questions about the use and impact of this technology on society, admits Google Australia\u2019s Engineering Director Daniel Nadasi.</p><p>He warns anyone developing AI should hold themselves to the highest ethical standards and carefully consider how this technology will be used for the benefit of society as a whole. Indeed, for the past few years, Google has been using AI for myriad tasks like identifying items in an image, automated translation and making smart suggestions for your emails.</p><p>\u201cAI can help us solve problems for billions of people \u2013 from breaking down language barriers with apps like Google Translate to improving food safety and detecting air quality, to helping doctors detect diabetic eye disease in India and Thailand\u2026 but unless people trust that they will be treated fairly and that this technology will benefit them and the people they care about, they won't feel comfortable having it in their lives,\u201d explains Mr Nadasi.</p><p>So AI systems should be designed following general best practices for software systems, such as privacy and security, together with considerations unique to AI. \u201cThe AI principles help make sure that we continue to develop this technology responsibly for the benefit of everyone,\u201d explains Mr Nadasi.Microsoft's approach to AI has three stages</p><p>Microsoft uses AI across a broad range of our business; from finance and capacity planning in our core business all the way up to predictive text in Outlook and design ideas in the PowerPoint office tool. It builds AI systems from the input of three diverse teams that come together to build the tools it delivers through its cloud services.</p><p>But Microsoft was recently called up for issues concerning face recognition and bias and decided not to sell its facial recognition software to police until there is a federal law regulating it \u2013 following similar moves by Amazon and IBM.</p><p>\u201cWe have an Ethics &amp; Society team that brings a diverse, non-IT lens to our development and they consider the societal impact, inclusivity, and human experience of AI systems. This ensures that we start from a people point of view and human experience at the heart of the process,\u201d explains Lee Hickin, National Technology Officer at Microsoft Australia.</p><p>\u201cNext we have a Technology &amp; innovation approach that is across our engineering, research and business teams that looks at the potential for what\u2019s possible in technology, hardware and software and explores what we can do to deliver something unique and valuable to the market,\u201d he continues.</p><p>\u201cFinally \u2013 we have a team that looks at the responsible application of AI, this is where we can also work with customers and partners to share tools, learnings and guidance on the responsible use of AI tools in solutions,\u201d he says.Trust is the core of successful AI</p><p>\u201cBusinesses creating AI systems should work to make these systems understandable to the people who use them and to put as much control as possible in the user\u2019s hands. This can be built into the software development process right from the design phase,' says Mr Nadasi.</p><p>But maintaining trust with your customers is what good business is built on \u2013 regardless of whether AI is there or not.</p><p>'For AI to be deployed in a responsible, trustworthy way, it is clear that we need action at many levels. And whilst I welcome the actions of Big Tech companies to develop AI principles and frameworks, we also need better regulation,' says Prof. Walsh.</p><p>'In high stake areas like facial recognition, we already see many companies will not sell their facial recognition software for police use until a national law is in place \u2013 players like Microsoft and Amazon are calling for such regulation.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3655896</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N6-N601-F0YC-N26F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1140\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That word is 'fake news'. Although popularized in 2016 during the US elections \u2013 and since then by the US President \u2013 fake news is not exclusive to either; it is an all-pervasive epidemic that seems to have hit Facebook the hardest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, a 2017 Ipsos survey conducted in the US found that an astounding 75 percent of Americans believe 'fake news' headlines. What's worse for Facebook is that people who cite the platform as a major source of news are more likely to view fake news headlines as accurate than those who rely less on it for news.</p><p>Facebook, for its part, says that it has tied up with external fact-checkers but its stringent control on sharing information with them is leading to their frustration, and eventually, inefficiency.</p><p>READ: Why are publishers not happy with Facebook?</p><p>\"Producing fake news is cheap, but producing quality, fact-checked, fair and balanced reporting is costly,\" said Faisal J. Abbas, editor-in-chief of Saudi English-language daily Arab News at the International Media Gala on the first day of the Arab Media Forum in Dubai. He took this opportunity to announce the rebrand of the 43-year-old Saudi newspaper and its 'Vision 2020', which includes a focus on digital.</p><p>Publishers can't compete with the rates offered by the likes of Google and Facebook, but they can't cut down on the quality at the expense of the truth, either, he said.</p><p>The big tech giants started by amassing a large user base and then exploiting their data to make money, which is why these walled gardens command anywhere above 70 to 80 percent of digital ad spends in most markets. Admittedly both Google and Facebook have gotten into trouble with fines being slapped on both especially in the EU, but the issues of fake news and brand safety still persist \u2013 something the companies need to take responsibility for.</p><p>MUST READ: Facebook's new privacy guidelines decoded</p><p>Speaking to Communicate last year, Andy Powell, sales director, Middle East, Africa &amp; Turkey, InMobi, says, \"Google, YouTube and Facebook should take full responsibility for their actions.\" \"If they [Google and Facebook] create an ecosystem and people abuse it, then, as the owner of that ecosystem, they need to take responsibility,\" adds Alistair Burton, who was then digital media director at Initiative.</p><p>Content publishers don't have the scale and/or the data points of their readers that the likes of Facebook do, which means that the monetization model is completely different. Combatting fake news, therefore, starts with relooking at the digital monetization model for media, said Abbas, calling for a fairer model for content creators.</p><p>\"The only way forward is to ensure sufficient monetization of our digital platforms,\" he added.</p><p>Moreover, Facebook's advertising formats and algorithms decrease the visibility of quality content. For instance, its in-roll ads run between a video and are not skippable, which leads users to stop watching the video altogether, says Ihab El Yaman, head of mobile and performance director at mobile audience network MEmob. \"Users are hating the fact that they are forced to watch ads during a video and they have no option to skip it,\" he says. Also, Facebook's algorithm pushes content that has the potential for virality, which in most cases is \"stories of cats falling off the couch,\" versus quality content. \"Facebook should limit these videos and/or at least\u00a0give priority to educational content. I can't remember when was the last time I watched an effective educational piece of content on Facebook; it has been ages,\" adds Yaman.</p><p>READ: Want to earn $500? Report abuse to Facebook.</p><p>Despite the concerns around these tech giants, one can't deny their popularity as distributions channels. Many audiences today turn to social media and the Internet for news. And so, it is imperative for news publishers to work with tech companies \"for the sake of combating fake news and preserving editorial integrity,\" said Abbas.</p><p>\"Given the precedent of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the implications of Cambridge Analytica and the inability of the Internet's dominant players \u2013 the likes of Facebook, Google and Twitter \u2013 to effectively self-regulate on big issues such as data protection, fake news and public rights, it's likely that we will see more cooperation between policymakers\u00a0when it comes to drafting and enforcing new legislation,\" says Alex Malouf, IABC Chair for Europe, Middle East and North Africa.

And we're only just getting going. In just a century we will go through the equivalent of the journey from cave paintings to nuclear weapons. Technology will transform how we meet our needs for peace, dignity and community. It gives the prospect of the world's population having an instant, global and unfiltered means of communicating, consuming information, forming opinions, preferences and societies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How humans manage this paradigm shift to a connected world is the greatest challenge of our era. Yet we are in danger of being overwhelmed. At a time when we have the tools to react globally, we are failing to use them. We have not begun to truly adapt our institutions to the new realities.</p><p>If we are in the foothills of a truly global, connected civilisation, where can we debate these challenges? The pace of technological change means that the internet has often been something that happens to the global architecture, not a force marshaled fully in support of our collective objectives.</p><p>Denmark has been a first mover in working out how to respond. Casper Klynge was appointed the country's tech ambassador in 2017, the world's first. Already an experienced diplomat, he is now pioneering a new diplomacy between tech and governments. After seven months in the job, I caught up with him at the offices of The National.</p><p>Tom: What exactly does a tech ambassador do?</p><p>Casper: It is about responding to important international trends. Big tech companies are now so powerful: the annual turnover of Apple is the same as Denmark's GDP. That power can be transformed into political influence, a role similar to states. So we need diplomatic representation to deal with them. Technology will define who will be winners and losers in the next decade. We want to help humanity reap the benefits. My day is balanced between dealing with technology companies, countries and international organisations. I travel a lot \u2013 my mandate and my team are global.</p><p>Tom: How does that comparison look in 20 years from now? Is Apple going to be a bigger world power than Denmark?</p><p>Casper: If we don't act, these companies will challenge governance in its traditional sense \u2013 not only Denmark. So this initiative is to exercise influence as a state, and to redefine the relationship between the private and public sector. Governments won't be able to regulate because of the pace of change, but tech can't self-regulate either. We need to work together.</p><p>Tom: Facebook, Cambridge Analytica. This is clearly a moment of self-reflection for tech. An idealistic industry is finding message boards filling with criticisms. Does dialogue go the other way? Will Microsoft send ambassadors to capitals? Will Google have a place on the UN Security Council?</p><p>Casper: Big companies have growing de facto presence in our capitals. But this is about bringing back diplomacy to its roots, and into the headquarters of these companies. Not only in Silicon Valley \u2013 also in Beijing, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Europe. We press them to assume a responsibility proportional to their influence. How do we create a digital dividend, not a digital divide?</p><p>Tom: Is Silicon Valley a hardship posting compared to Afghanistan? How receptive are they?</p><p>Casper: I have been trying to convince my colleagues in Copenhagen that California is a hard posting. We hope other countries will follow. It is not easy: we have been met with scepticism about what we are trying to achieve. But once we explain the broad agenda, from cyber security to online terrorism, there is more interest.</p><p>Tom: Diplomats speak truth to power. You have tough conversations with the Googles and Facebooks. But what is your message to governments about how to engage global tech?</p><p>Casper: It cannot be monothematic or purely commercial. Advanced machine learning, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, gene-modifying: those are existential issues for countries. You don't need a tech ambassador, but we do need a tech dialogue.</p><p>Tom: For you not to be the last tech ambassador, what does success look like?</p><p>Casper: Creating a coalition of other countries, international organisations, civil society and tech to really dig into these issues. Making the companies more accountable, more responsible. Applying traditional diplomatic tools to this new industry. And trying to talk the talk ourselves: to use new technologies for our humanitarian agenda, blockchain on fighting corruption, big data on migration flows. How do we prepare Danish society for the digital age?</p><p>Tom: Many of the rules to govern global politics were forged after the Second World War: the creation of the UN, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Can these rules keep up or will be need to start again as we balance liberty and security online?</p><p>Casper: That is the million-dollar question. Can we govern as the last 60 years? Can a Geneva Convention apply to a digital age where cyber-attacks are as damaging as conventional warfare? Big tech themselves are proposing new international norms.</p><p>Tom: You have been here meeting future tech ambassadors at the Emirates Diplomatic Academy, the Ministers for Artificial Intelligence and Happiness. What role can the UAE play in this ecosystem?</p><p>Casper: We have been impressed by the UAE's political vision in appointing the world's first AI Minister. At the UN, we hope Denmark and UAE can cooperate on the big challenges. Diplomacy will have to be agile; adapt; think out of the box; build new partnerships.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/84/152544980893.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/84/152544980893.jpg</url></p><p>Casper Klynge, Denmark's tech ambassador, at The National's offices in Abu Dhabi.

Instead, the organizers say they\u2019re going all-digital , with several days of online entertainment planned for Jan. 6-9, 2021.    Good luck with that.    As a longtime attendee, with more years of attendance than I care to admit, I think the odds of success here are very tough. Yes, we can devote three days of our lives to getting to Las Vegas and roaming the show floor. It\u2019s a lot harder to do it in front of a computer for hours.    COVID-19 VICTIM: CES 2021 cancels in-person show, moves event online   Smart speakers: Are Facebook and Alexa really listening? 6 common tech myths debunked   That said, can CES put on a great show that people would want to tune into?    Most definitely yes.    Naturally, I have some ideas.    Let\u2019s start with why we go to CES in the first place. To see the cool new products being introduced, to be wowed by them and to get a sense for where the industry is headed this year.    There\u2019s also lots of talk. Many attend CES industry exec keynotes and panel discussions. But let\u2019s face it: Many of the LinkedIn generation go to panels to network, hoping to meet up with top industry insiders in the room, and the keynotes are much of the same. A little education, but also schmoozing.    So if CES hopes to replicate the experience by offering more online webinars and panel discussions, I don\u2019t see myself taking three days off from work to watch the online show.    But what about a really great, highly produced online presentation that truly showcased new products?    Now that would be must-see streaming.    As I said, I go to CES to see what\u2019s new. What was so hard about CES was that as so many other conferences fell off by the wayside over the years (Comdex, MacWorld, etc.) CES became the one show that \u2013 love it or hate it \u2013 most everyone in tech attended.    And it became so big and bloated that with 175,000 people crowding the halls, just getting from point A to point B was a constant challenge. It had so many exhibitors that it was tough to see all the booths in one convention hall, let alone the satellite facilities that sprung up all over town.    And with so many people in Las Vegas, it could take upwards of an hour just to get a cab to visit one of the other facilities.    So I love the idea of ditching those logistics.   Put on an amazing show  Apple showed with its online presentation for the Worldwide Developers Conference in June that it could be done, and done really well. But that\u2019s Apple, which does things its way. Those high-profile yearly product reveals are million-dollar TV shows meant to live on, for the online audience.   So take what Apple has done, and apply it to CES. Sounds cool, right?    But what happens if CES is calling the shots, and telling Samsung, LG, Sony, TCL and so many of the long-time exhibitors how it wants to present the showcase to viewers?    I can tell you from experience that the CES presentations from these companies generally last an hour at least, with a good 30 minutes devoted to self-congratulations and executive ego shining. A good CES producer will want to focus just on what\u2019s new and let us really see the products. And to ditch the chatter.    Can CES convince the companies to do it right?    I could see a CES devote two to three hours daily to highly produced product demos, and perhaps an hour of industry chatter. I could imagine an hour show devoted to CES\u2019s annual Innovation Awards, where the Consumer Technology Association selects winners in many categories that it deems worthy of showcasing.    But let\u2019s not forget that most of what we see at CES is junk. It\u2019s old products masquerading as new, or new things with no hope of ever getting actually released. In my years at CES, I\u2019ve seen smart shoes, smart bras, smart shirts, smart everything. When\u2019s the last time you wore your smart shirt?    But occasionally, something fun comes out of the startup room.   Startups  What does it do about all the tiny start-ups that come to Las Vegas every year, hoping Lady Luck will rub on them, that some buyer from Walmart, Target or somewhere else takes the time to stop, miraculously puts in a order and gets the product on the map? (This indeed happened for Ring, which brought its product to CES on a card table, found a buyer and later got bought by Amazon for $1 billion.)   OK, the startups get a show, too.    And this is where CES Digital could actually improve on being there in person. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve talked to an exhibitor about their product, and asked for a demo, only to have them tell me it was just a \u201cprototype.\u201d    Like the drone that you tossed in the air like a frisbee and it somehow started flying, without any controls. (It was never released.) Or last year\u2019s flying car announcement from Hyundai.    OK, big mouths. You have an announcement and a breakthrough? Show me! Prove it. You have the video floor. I can\u2019t wait to watch.    Now add in in a few keynotes, but only if they have big names (i.e., people we want to hear from), or dive into hot-button topics that make for riveting entertainment. You know, like \u201cShould Big Tech Be Reigned In? Facebook faces off with government regulators.\u201d Or, \u201cDoes TikTok deserve to be banned in the United States?\u201d Stuff like that. Zoom sessions with a bite.    CES has its work cut out for it. Because there\u2019s nothing like being there in person, asking questions, meeting people, seeing the products for yourself.    But, I\u2019ll be the first one to tune in to a really incredible showcase of worthy new products and industry chatter. I have to. It\u2019s my job.    But wouldn\u2019t you, too?

But over the past year, there's been a glaring exception: Apple CEO Tim Cook's all-out rhetorical assault on Facebook and Google. On Wednesday Cook delivered some of his strongest criticism yet of advertising-supported tech giants.Here's James Vincent inThe Verge: He went on to indict algorithmic feeds and the ways in which they are abused: 'Platforms and algorithms that promised to improve our lives can actually magnify our worst human tendencies. Rogue actors and even governments have taken advantage of user trust to deepen divisions, incite violence, and even undermine our shared sense of what is true and what is false. This crisis is real. </p><p>It is not imagined, or exaggerated, or crazy. Indeed \u2014 there are even daily newsletters about it! Cook's speech had an important, and unstated, element of self-interest. Regular readers of this column know thatCalifornia passed a privacy law this yearthat attempts to bring General Data Protection Regulation-style privacy protections to its citizens. All the big platforms are leery of a patchwork of such regulations breaking out all over the country. That's why Cook took time today to call for a national privacy regulation, one which would allow Apple to operate uniformly across the country. But Cook's commitment to privacy comes with an asterisk: the company's government-ordered requirement tostore iCloud user data on the servers of a state-run telecom. Alex Stamos, the recently departed chief security officer of Facebook,pointed out the issue in a valuable Twitter thread. 'Tim is right, privacy is a fundamental human right, Stamos wrote. 'I believe that Chinese people should have the same access to fundamental human rights as the rest of the world. Apple needs to document how they protect data stored by a PRC-owned cloud provider. As Stamos points out, iMessage is the only approved messaging app with end-to-end encryption allowed in China. He called on Apple to disclose under what circumstances Chinese authorities could access iCloud backups \u2014 and whether Apple made concessions there it hasn't made elsewhere. 'Perhaps the answer is \u2018no concessions, there is no practical mechanism for the MSS to get access to iCloud data, he said, referring to the Ministry of State Security. 'That would be wonderful, but we shouldn't assume it to be true. Apple declined to comment when I asked. In July, when the company made the deal with China's Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, Apple issued a lengthy statement in which they reiterated their commitment to privacy and security. But they also said this: Each country in which we do business has its own customs, culture and legal process. While our values and beliefs don't change from country to country, we are subject to each country's laws. Of course, even if Apple has made concessions to the Chinese government, it doesn't mean the company isn't sincere about its belief in a right to privacy. Nor does it take away the very real steps Apple does take to protect users' privacy, particularly when compared to Facebook and Google. But Facebook employees have had to endure months of taunting from Cook, and to date the company has mostly suffered in silence. Stamos doesn't work there anymore, and he doesn't speak for Facebook in any official capacity. Still, I'd wager that his former colleagues cheered when they saw his tweetstorm today. (At press time, he had just posted a second one,lamenting the positive coverage Cook gotfor his remarks.) Google and Facebook have faced blistering criticism lately for their attempts to work in China. That Apple has operated for so long in the country with so little discussion of the potential for government access to user data seems, in light of Cook's speech, all the more conspicuous. Democracy Facebook, Twitter Can't Find China Election Meddling Trump Claims The president said China is meddling in the election. There is no evidence that China is, according to Facebook, Twitter, and many others. 'This is how Donald Trump stays president for four more years' Trump plans to relylesson Facebook for his reelection campaign, according to this report by Alex Thompson. I'm skeptical \u2014 whatever the president's claims of 'bias, he's still a top Facebook advertiser, and the platform will presumably continue to be quite useful for fundraising purposes. The emerging tech strategy, according to four officials involved in Trump's reelection campaign, will reduce its reliance on Big Tech platforms \u2014 which were the dominant messaging channels in 2016 \u2014 to get the president's message out. The president's team instead is planning to go around the platforms as much as possible and reach supporters directly, making use of old-school text messaging. The Wildly Unregulated Practice of Undercover Cops Friending People on Facebook We've talked a bit here about 'Bob Smith accounts \u2014 fake profiles used by undercover cops to catch criminals. Kashmir Hill digs in on how little the practice is regulated: Police have come to recognize thefertilehuntinggroundofsocial mediaand are covertly surveilling people and groups there with little oversight. We don't know how many people have been targeted for undercover surveillance on social media because police departments don't keep track in a public manner and prefer, in general, not to discuss it. They're willing to talk about posing as kids online to snare sexual predators\u2014a relatively uncontroversial undercover practice\u2014but they're far more secretive about targeting suspected gang members, protestors and other 'people of interest. We reached out to dozens of police departments around the country to ask what their policies are when it comes to undercover Facebook police work and discovered that very few have any kind of formal rules governing it. Clarence Thomas's Wife is Sharing Fake News About the 'Caravan Ginni Thomas is promoting a bunch of misinformation about the group of people seeking refuge in America.

Older People Are Worse Than Young People at Telling Fact from Opinion Young people get a lot of flack these days, for killingmayonnaiseandgolfand lots ofother things. But you know what young people are great ad? Recognizing the truth when they see it. Here's Alexis Madrigal on some new Pew research: Given 10 statements, five each of fact and opinion,younger Americans correctly identified both the facts and the opinionsat higher rates than older Americans did. Forty-four percent of younger people identified all five opinions as opinions, while only 26 percent of older people did. And 18-to-29-year-olds performed more than twice as well as the 65+ set. Of the latter group, only 17 percent classified all five facts as factual statements. On the individual questions, the identification gap was particularly large regarding the nature of the American government and questions about immigration, but there was no statement that younger Americans did not identify with equal or higher accuracy than their elders. Snapchat Helped Register Over 400,000 Voters Hey, thanks Snapchat: Snap, the company behind the popular social media service, said on Tuesday that it had helped more than 400,000 users register to vote during a recent two-week period. Much of the activity, the company said, was in key battleground states like Texas, Florida and Georgia. Snapchat, which is popular among teenagers and young adults, pushed people 18 and over to register by adding a button about doing so on each user's profile page. The company also sent video messages to all of those users urging them to register. Elsewhere Twitter tests new profile features, including presence indicators and \u2018ice breakers' Twitter wants to promote more and better conversations. I spoke with two top product executives, Sara Haider and Mike Kruzeniski, who showed me some prototypes. There's some cool stuff in here \u2014 check it out. Facebook unveils systems for catching child nudity, grooming of children Facebook said Wednesday that moderators removed 8.7 million user images of child nudity over the past quarter. It's also using machine learning to detect instances of creeps attempting to friend young children. How Facebook's Messenger Got Its New Look in a New Jersey Basement I got one version of the origin story for the new Messenger. Steven Levy got another one, which is that it was all the idea of a 23-year-old intern working from his basement. Snap hires new chief business officer, chief strategy officer Today's good news for Snap (other than that voter registration thing) is that it lured two new executives to join: Jeremi Gorman who was previously head of advertising sales for Amazon, will become chief business officer; and Jared Grusd who was most recently CEO of The Huffington Post, will become its chief strategy officer. Snap Employees Are Eyeing Exit As Stock Sinks on Cheddar Today's bad news for Snap is that in an internal survey, 40 percent of employees say they're planning to leave the company. Launches Facebook is now downranking stories with false headlines In Septembera partisan war over fact-checking on Facebookbroke out, based on a story from ThinkProgress in which a headline said Brett Kavanaugh 'said' something that he did not, in fact, say. Now Facebook is adding some nuance to the fact-checking process, letting fact-checkers note whether the headline is false, the story is false, or both are false. If the headline is true but the story is false, it will be shown to more people than if the headline is false but the story is true. (Stares off into the middle distance for 15 minutes.) Takes The Problem With Fixing WhatsApp? Human Nature Might Get in the Way Farhad Manjoo says the real problem with WhatsApp is human nature. I have a different view, which is that WhatsApp uniquely enables hateful mobs through its combination of end-to-end encryption and anonymous message forwarding. I say ditch the message forwarding and watch the problems disappear: It's a story of human nature. And that's why, beyond learning to inhibit our natural tendency to share, it's hard to know what can be done about false news on WhatsApp \u2014 other than bracing yourself for more. Twitter raises the curtain on disinformation. Other companies should take a tip. The Post editorial board pats Twitter on the back for sharing a trove of tweets from a Russian influence campaign: Other companies should take a tip from Twitter and make the data they collect on disinformation more widely available. Though Twitter's structure gives it a leg up over its peers such as Facebook, sites across the board should disclose as much about influence campaigns as liability concerns allow. It is heartening to see platforms scrubbing themselves of malicious content. But the rest of the country cannot help with cleanup if it does not know what the mess looks like. And finally #8230; Twitter's Dorsey Hosts \u2018Tweetup' With Tacos to Foster Community I leave San Francisco forone weekand Jack Dorsey decides to host an impromptu 'tweetup and buy tacos for everyone and answer all of their questions about his app. It is amazing and hilarious and honestly wonderful that this insane thing happened, and here's hoping that it happens again while I'm in town.

Its decision to exclude high-risk vendors in August 2018 was marked by a refreshing openness about the grounds[1] on which it was made. The thinking about risk and security was very similar to that in the EU security assessment[2] of 5G released in October 2019. Two core factors in these assessments are that 5G providers that have legal and other imperatives to cooperate covertly and deeply with their home governments pose a greater security risk than providers without these obligations and imperatives\u2014and that governments do not want to be beholden to the governments of states with which they do not share values or interests. Both these factors apply in the case of the Chinese state and its two 5G 'national champions', Huawei and ZTE. </p><p>While there has been a burgeoning and critical debate inside and between governments, there's been strikingly less talk about what the future 5G world means for 'big tech' in China and the US\u2014the two homes of the globe's tech giants. That's surprising, because arguably the strategic and economic competition between Xi Jinping's China and Donald Trump's America has at its centre a contest over advanced technology and the future of global data and communications. Xi's China Dream[3] can't be achieved without China's big tech firms dominating their US counterparts globally, because gaining strategic and economic power depends so heavily on having technological ascendancy, especially in data and communications. But even without the state-on-state great-power competition, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon, Apple and Microsoft all have existential stakes in the future of global communications. The odd thing is they don't seem to be acting like it. If, as some experts predict, Huawei and ZTE win the race to build and operate much of the world's 5G infrastructure, US tech firms will be dependent on them to transmit their services and products. American big tech will live in a Chinese walled garden of technology and be subject to the curators' choices about what it can and can't do, at least in major markets like Southeast Asia, Africa and chunks of Europe. On the flip side, China's non-5G tech giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT) will ride on the digital infrastructure of Huawei and ZTE. Given the Chinese Communist Party's digital authoritarian model of fused state-corporate cooperation, this puts BAT in an advantageous position\u2014not just in the China home market, but wherever the Chinese 5G champions provide the digital infrastructure. The worst-case scenario for big US tech is that Apple, Facebook and Google in effect become apps inside a Chinese global information ecosystem. Chinese state policies and BAT, Huawei and ZTE would decide which of their products and services can be hosted on Chinese digital infrastructure and services. That looks like a very bad business plan, unless entering bankruptcy or becoming CCP-compliant in your global operations is the end goal. So far, Apple's[4] and Google's[5] forays into 5G have been about 5G smartphones\u2014which will also ride on the underlying 5G infrastructure. So why are these US tech giants seemingly snoozing at the wheel on 5G and future communications infrastructure? Maybe they're like great white sharks, lurking deep but ready to break the surface and show us that they knew what they had to do all along. But there's no sign of that. Maybe they're planning to get a jump on 6G, thinking that new communications concepts and systems\u2014like cheap and ubiquitous constellations of small satellites\u2014will deliver a new source of communications business advantage that undercuts terrestrial 5G networks. Maybe the real reason Google insisted on continuing to develop[6] the now apparently defunct[7] model of its search engine\u2014Dragonfly, which was being designed to comply with Chinese state censorship\u2014is because it's preparing for the corporate dystopia of the future, not just trying to find a way to get bigger in the Chinese market. Maybe they all think the competition between the US and China is just the business of governments and therefore doesn't concern them. If so, they're failing to see that the same factors which are driving renewed great-power competition mean that they too are in strategic and economic competition not just with BAT, Huawei and ZTE, but with their chief supporter, the CCP. Or maybe they're stuck in a mindset that governments around the world already know is dead: the idea that globalisation is a process that 'de-states' the world, rendering state boundaries and powers less relevant. According to this long-gone vision of globalisation, companies and consumers could be 'country agnostic' about where services and products came from because global supply chains and capital would move and reconfigure in ways that had no little or connection with individual nations. That was the arc of logic operating in much of the world politically and economically until the return of assertive authoritarian power\u2014Russia, and now, most particularly, the Chinese state under Xi. And the truly globalised world was the dominant paradigm when many of the leaders of US big tech rose to prominence, so it wouldn't be surprising if they're finding it hard to let go. For all their genius, they too are products of their environment and their times. Xi and great-power competition\u2014along with 'Made in China 2025', the Digital Silk Road and military-civil fusion\u2014have killed that vision. There's a way out of the Chinese walled garden for Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. These companies have enormous capital and human capital strengths. And they have potential 5G, data and communications partners in places other than China\u2014Samsung in South Korea; Japanese tech giants like Sony, NEC and Fujitsu; Europe's Nokia, Ericsson and even Siemens; and US partner-competitors like Qualcomm and Oracle (as well as India's growing tech world). Certainly, democratic governments from Canberra to Washington, Seoul, Berlin, Delhi and Tokyo all have deep interests in creating policy and regulation that supports alternatives to a unitary Chinese tech future. Fraying international cooperation, the disdain for Trump in much of Europe, and Trump's own disdain for alliances and partnerships make these interests harder to give effect to. Yet letting those difficulties prevent positive action to shape our future communications world would be a defining and generational error for each of the democratic world's leaders. Big tech companies and their home governments outside the authoritarian world need to reset their relationship from a contested one around privacy, data and regulation to one that supports government and corporate strategic and competitive interests. That seems a remote prospect in the world we're in right now, but what seems remote has a habit of happening when the need is sufficient. Even without supportive policies and regulation from their home governments, it makes sense as a simple matter of future corporate existence, success and competition for the US tech giants to be able to live on alternative digital infrastructure to that brought to them by China Tech Inc. Who from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft will be the first to get this party started?

Its decision to exclude high-risk vendors in August 2018 was marked by a refreshing openness about the grounds on which it was made. The thinking about risk and security was very similar to that in the EU security assessment of 5G released in October 2019.</p><p>Two core factors in these assessments are that 5G providers that have legal and other imperatives to cooperate covertly and deeply with their home governments pose a greater security risk than providers without these obligations and imperatives\u2014and that governments do not want to be beholden to the governments of states with which they do not share values or interests. Both these factors apply in the case of the Chinese state and its two 5G \u2018national champions\u2019, Huawei and ZTE.</p><p>While there has been a burgeoning and critical debate inside and between governments, there\u2019s been strikingly less talk about what the future 5G world means for \u2018big tech\u2019 in China and the US\u2014the two homes of the globe\u2019s tech giants.</p><p>That\u2019s surprising, because arguably the strategic and economic competition between Xi Jinping\u2019s China and Donald Trump\u2019s America has at its centre a contest over advanced technology and the future of global data and communications. Xi\u2019s China Dream can\u2019t be achieved without China\u2019s big tech firms dominating their US counterparts globally, because gaining strategic and economic power depends so heavily on having technological ascendancy, especially in data and communications.</p><p>But even without the state-on-state great-power competition, Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company), Amazon, Apple and Microsoft all have existential stakes in the future of global communications. The odd thing is they don\u2019t seem to be acting like it.</p><p>If, as some experts predict, Huawei and ZTE win the race to build and operate much of the world\u2019s 5G infrastructure, US tech firms will be dependent on them to transmit their services and products. American big tech will live in a Chinese walled garden of technology and be subject to the curators\u2019 choices about what it can and can\u2019t do, at least in major markets like Southeast Asia, Africa and chunks of Europe.</p><p>On the flip side, China\u2019s non-5G tech giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT) will ride on the digital infrastructure of Huawei and ZTE. Given the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s digital authoritarian model of fused state\u2013corporate cooperation, this puts BAT in an advantageous position\u2014not just in the China home market, but wherever the Chinese 5G champions provide the digital infrastructure.</p><p>The worst-case scenario for big US tech is that Apple, Facebook and Google in effect become apps inside a Chinese global information ecosystem. Chinese state policies and BAT, Huawei and ZTE would decide which of their products and services can be hosted on Chinese digital infrastructure and services. That looks like a very bad business plan, unless entering bankruptcy or becoming CCP-compliant in your global operations is the end goal.</p><p>So far, Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s forays into 5G have been about 5G smartphones\u2014which will also ride on the underlying 5G infrastructure.</p><p>So why are these US tech giants seemingly snoozing at the wheel on 5G and future communications infrastructure? Maybe they\u2019re like great white sharks, lurking deep but ready to break the surface and show us that they knew what they had to do all along. But there\u2019s no sign of that.</p><p>Maybe they\u2019re planning to get a jump on 6G, thinking that new communications concepts and systems\u2014like cheap and ubiquitous constellations of small satellites\u2014will deliver a new source of communications business advantage that undercuts terrestrial 5G networks.</p><p>Maybe the real reason Google insisted on continuing to develop the now apparently defunct model of its search engine\u2014Dragonfly, which was being designed to comply with Chinese state censorship\u2014is because it\u2019s preparing for the corporate dystopia of the future, not just trying to find a way to get bigger in the Chinese market.</p><p>Maybe they all think the competition between the US and China is just the business of governments and therefore doesn\u2019t concern them. If so, they\u2019re failing to see that the same factors which are driving renewed great-power competition mean that they too are in strategic and economic competition not just with BAT, Huawei and ZTE, but with their chief supporter, the CCP.</p><p>Or maybe they\u2019re stuck in a mindset that governments around the world already know is dead: the idea that globalisation is a process that \u2018de-states\u2019 the world, rendering state boundaries and powers less relevant. According to this long-gone vision of globalisation, companies and consumers could be \u2018country agnostic\u2019 about where services and products came from because global supply chains and capital would move and reconfigure in ways that had no little or connection with individual nations.</p><p>That was the arc of logic operating in much of the world politically and economically until the return of assertive authoritarian power\u2014Russia, and now, most particularly, the Chinese state under Xi. And the truly globalised world was the dominant paradigm when many of the leaders of US big tech rose to prominence, so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if they\u2019re finding it hard to let go. For all their genius, they too are products of their environment and their times.</p><p>Xi and great-power competition\u2014along with \u2018Made in China 2025\u2019, the Digital Silk Road and military\u2013civil fusion\u2014have killed that vision.</p><p>There\u2019s a way out of the Chinese walled garden for Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. These companies have enormous capital and human capital strengths. And they have potential 5G, data and communications partners in places other than China\u2014Samsung in South Korea; Japanese tech giants like Sony, NEC and Fujitsu; Europe\u2019s Nokia, Ericsson and even Siemens; and US partner-competitors like Qualcomm and Oracle (as well as India\u2019s growing tech world).</p><p>Certainly, democratic governments from Canberra to Washington, Seoul, Berlin, Delhi and Tokyo all have deep interests in creating policy and regulation that supports alternatives to a unitary Chinese tech future. Fraying international cooperation, the disdain for Trump in much of Europe, and Trump\u2019s own disdain for alliances and partnerships make these interests harder to give effect to.

Two decades resisting the authority of an empowered and modern Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is nothing to sneeze at. But with last month\u2019s passing of the\u00a0National Security Law\u00a0(NSL), which aims to clamp down on the raucous anti-CCP protests that have recently gripped the island, Hong Kong\u2019s unprecedented experiment in pseudo-sovereign liberalism looks to be coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This law has already\u00a0threatened\u00a0the prized freedoms to which dissident Hong Kongers are accustomed. With the NSL also comes an uncertain future for both individual technology companies and the landscape of the global internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law grants authorities with sweeping powers to root out what they consider \u201csecession, terrorist activities, subversion, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements\u201d\u2014no new feat for a government. At the same time, the NSL adopts the language of Western governments with promises to protect \u201chuman rights\u201d including the \u201cfreedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession, and of demonstration.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, unless those activities are deemed to be actually illegal by a newly created \u201cCommittee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\u201d that is supervised by the Mainland government. </p><p>Should a would-be freedom fighter be suspected as a secretive terrorist under the system the Committee creates, they will be tried in a special court and subject to penalties up to life imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This de facto legal crusade against any discussion of Hong Kong independence or CCP shortcomings\u00a0creates problems for U.S. tech companies\u00a0operating in the region. Many U.S. companies only partially operate on the mainland, and some of them are basically shut out. Having offices in Hong Kong lets them have a footprint in China without being openly subject to CCP rule (and therefore the\u00a0public criticism\u00a0in the West that would follow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is now changing with the NSL. China is exerting more direct control of Hong Kong through the Committee for Safeguarding National Security and another new body called the \u201cOffice for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People\u2019s Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,\u201d which is totally under the control of the mainland and not subject to Hong Kong jurisdiction at all. As the lines between the CCP and Hong Kong governance become blurrier, it becomes harder to claim you do not collaborate with or enable foreign governments that\u00a0operate ethnic concentration camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the NSL asks for much collaboration.\u00a0Article 43\u00a0of the NSL empowers Hong Kong police with authorities to investigate suspected subversion. Specifically, law enforcement can \u201c[require] a person who published information or the relevant service provider [i.e. technology company] to delete the information or provide assistance\u201d including decryption. If the service provider refuses, the police can petition for a warrant to force the intended digital deeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, to operate in Hong Kong, a technology company, foreign or domestic, must accept being deputized as a CCP informant. Failure to comply means possible fines of up to $100,000 HKD (around $13,000 USD) and six months in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also provisions for surveillance. Subsection 6 outlines a process for law enforcement to apply for \u201cinterception of communications and covert surveillance operations\u201d authorities along with a fast-tracked process for \u201cless intrusive covert surveillance.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What future will American companies have in Hong Kong? Some of the biggies have already started to resist:\u00a0Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft\u00a0have already paused their information sharing request programs with the Hong Kong government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps when the buzz dies down, and it looks to them like the NSL will not be\u00a0too\u00a0too onerous, American tech companies will resume normal operations. Hong Kong authorities have tried to assuage concerns by stating that the new laws will\u00a0only target a small and specific minority. Maybe, maybe not. Would we expect a CCP-controlled jurisdiction to\u00a0tell\u00a0us when they plan on abusing power?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there is great potential for abuse. The NSL does\u00a0not just apply to Hong Kongers. Article 38 states that the law applies to \u201c[offenses]\u2026committed against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from outside the Region by a person who is not a permanent resident of the Region\u201d\u2014a.k.a.\u00a0you. Hope you like the CCP! If you don\u2019t, keep your criticisms to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSL is not merely the first step in covering Hong Kong within the CCP\u2019s Great Firewall. It tries to\u00a0extend Chinese jurisdiction over the open internet as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to see a way around a\u00a0coming tech exodus\u00a0from Hong Kong. Will American tech companies just tell these various People\u2019s Committees to go pound sand? Them and what army? Will the U.S. government back an escalation of conflicts with China on Big Tech\u2019s behalf? The potential for brinkmanship is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is built into many companies\u2019 business models. Firms like Google and Facebook survive on data-driven advertising. They make money by amassing personally identifiable and behavioral data. Law enforcement agents of any country would love to get their hands on that data, and it can be trivially easy to do this, especially when they have a world power government behind you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a weird situation. The U.S. government has tapped into these rich data veins on persons both within and beyond our borders for years. And although the state here does not censor by law, powerful companies are often close to powerful politicians and they help each other out how they can. For freedom-loving people outside of U.S. borders (and even many people here), this anti-Chinese posture surely smacks of more than a little power-preserving hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Western internet is undeniably more open than the one behind Great Firewall. But only to the extent that it does not effectively challenge our own power centers. Encryption is already of\u00a0questionable legality\u00a0in China. Our leaders are not too far behind with measures like the\u00a0EARN It Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not to downplay the severity of the threat to Hong Kong dissidents and the open internet. The NSL must be strongly resisted and criticized because it puts lives at great risk. But so did measures like the PATRIOT Act, which we have merely become accustomed to here in our \u201cfree web.\u201d It may be that it\u2019s easier to challenge dangerous power-grabs when coming from \u201ctheir side.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenges to the open internet emanate from many nations beyond the U.S. and China. Take your pick: there\u2019s\u00a0Australia\u2019s encryption war, the\u00a0German hate crime bill, the EU\u2019s\u00a0General Data Protection Regulation, Brazilian\u00a0battles\u00a0against WhatsApp, and now\u00a0India\u00a0is getting in on the fun. For a brief and beautiful moment, technology secured free spaces online. As governments have gotten savvier, those free communities have become scarcer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sum effects of these developments may be to speed up the development of a more private web. Distributed networks will replace centralized platforms that can be leaned upon to censor or track individuals. Identities will be more pseudonymous and reputation-based rather than tied to bodies that can be oppressed by powerful groups. The act of sending bits will resistant to control even if the developers of the technology that empowers such acts really wished it wasn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least, this is the vision of a new generation of cypherpunks that are working to build these technologies as we speak. It is becoming clearer that governments\u2014even those that profess to operate on principles of liberalism\u2014have no interest in securing a true open internet beyond what suits their present strategies for securing global power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can\u2019t rely on states. Our strongest hope for resistance against censorship and surveillance lies with technologies that are\u00a0built to resist censorship and surveillance by design. The question is when current internet users will decide when they\u2019ve had enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://reason.com/2020/07/14/how-chinas-clamp-down-on-hong-kong-could-affect-the-global-internet/&lt;/p&gt;\">https://reason.com/2020/07/14/how-chinas-clamp-down-on-hong-kong-could-affect-the-global-internet/&lt;/p&gt;</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-107197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C2-TXW1-JBJN-M2HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1399\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Press</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Center for Tech and Innovation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cybersecurity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Two decades resisting the authority of an empowered and modern Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is nothing to sneeze at. But with last month's passing of the National Security Law (NSL), which aims to clamp down on the raucous anti-CCP protests that have recently gripped the island, Hong Kong's unprecedented experiment in pseudo-sovereign liberalism looks to be coming to an end.   This law has already threatened the prized freedoms to which dissident Hong Kongers are accustomed. With the NSL also comes an uncertain future for both individual technology companies and the landscape of the global internet.   The law grants authorities with sweeping powers to root out what they consider \"secession, terrorist activities, subversion, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements\"\u2014no new feat for a government. At the same time, the NSL adopts the language of Western governments with promises to protect \"human rights\" including the \"freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession, and of demonstration.\"   That is, unless those activities are deemed to be actually illegal by a newly created \"Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\" that is supervised by the Mainland government. Should a would-be freedom fighter be suspected as a secretive terrorist under the system the Committee creates, they will be tried in a special court and subject to penalties up to life imprisonment.   This de facto legal crusade against any discussion of Hong Kong independence or CCP shortcomings creates problems for U.S. tech companies operating in the region. Many U.S. companies only partially operate on the mainland, and some of them are basically shut out. Having offices in Hong Kong lets them have a footprint in China without being openly subject to CCP rule (and therefore the public criticism in the West that would follow).   That is now changing with the NSL. China is exerting more direct control of Hong Kong through the Committee for Safeguarding National Security and another new body called the \"Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,\" which is totally under the control of the mainland and not subject to Hong Kong jurisdiction at all. As the lines between the CCP and Hong Kong governance become blurrier, it becomes harder to claim you do not collaborate with or enable foreign governments that operate ethnic concentration camps .   And the NSL asks for much collaboration. Article 43 of the NSL empowers Hong Kong police with authorities to investigate suspected subversion. Specifically, law enforcement can \"[require] a person who published information or the relevant service provider [i.e. technology company] to delete the information or provide assistance\" including decryption. If the service provider refuses, the police can petition for a warrant to force the intended digital deeds.   In other words, to operate in Hong Kong, a technology company, foreign or domestic, must accept being deputized as a CCP informant. Failure to comply means possible fines of up to $100,000 HKD (around $13,000 USD) and six months in prison.   There are also provisions for surveillance. Subsection 6 outlines a process for law enforcement to apply for \"interception of communications and covert surveillance operations\" authorities along with a fast-tracked process for \"less intrusive covert surveillance.\"   What future will American companies have in Hong Kong? Some of the biggies have already started to resist: Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft have already paused their information sharing request programs with the Hong Kong government.   Perhaps when the buzz dies down, and it looks to them like the NSL will not be too too onerous, American tech companies will resume normal operations. Hong Kong authorities have tried to assuage concerns by stating that the new laws will only target a small and specific minority . Maybe, maybe not. Would we expect a CCP-controlled jurisdiction to tell us when they plan on abusing power?   And there is great potential for abuse. The NSL does not just apply to Hong Kongers . Article 38 states that the law applies to \"[offenses]\u2026committed against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from outside the Region by a person who is not a permanent resident of the Region\"\u2014a.k.a. you . Hope you like the CCP! If you don't, keep your criticisms to yourself.   The NSL is not merely the first step in covering Hong Kong within the CCP's Great Firewall. It tries to extend Chinese jurisdiction over the open internet as well .   It is hard to see a way around a coming tech exodus from Hong Kong. Will American tech companies just tell these various People's Committees to go pound sand? Them and what army? Will the U.S. government back an escalation of conflicts with China on Big Tech's behalf? The potential for brinkmanship is clear.   The problem is built into many companies' business models. Firms like Google and Facebook survive on data-driven advertising. They make money by amassing personally identifiable and behavioral data. Law enforcement agents of any country would love to get their hands on that data, and it can be trivially easy to do this, especially when they have a world power government behind you.   It's a weird situation. The U.S. government has tapped into these rich data veins on persons both within and beyond our borders for years. And although the state here does not censor by law, powerful companies are often close to powerful politicians and they help each other out how they can. For freedom-loving people outside of U.S. borders (and even many people here), this anti-Chinese posture surely smacks of more than a little power-preserving hypocrisy.   The Western internet is undeniably more open than the one behind Great Firewall. But only to the extent that it does not effectively challenge our own power centers. Encryption is already of questionable legality in China. Our leaders are not too far behind with measures like the EARN It Act .   This is not to downplay the severity of the threat to Hong Kong dissidents and the open internet. The NSL must be strongly resisted and criticized because it puts lives at great risk. But so did measures like the PATRIOT Act, which we have merely become accustomed to here in our \"free web.\" It may be that it's easier to challenge dangerous power-grabs when coming from \"their side.\"   Challenges to the open internet emanate from many nations beyond the U.S. and China. Take your pick: there's Australia's encryption war , the German hate crime bill , the EU's General Data Protection Regulation , Brazilian battles against WhatsApp, and now India is getting in on the fun. For a brief and beautiful moment, technology secured free spaces online. As governments have gotten savvier, those free communities have become scarcer.   The sum effects of these developments may be to speed up the development of a more private web. Distributed networks will replace centralized platforms that can be leaned upon to censor or track individuals. Identities will be more pseudonymous and reputation-based rather than tied to bodies that can be oppressed by powerful groups. The act of sending bits will resistant to control even if the developers of the technology that empowers such acts really wished it wasn't.   At least, this is the vision of a new generation of cypherpunks that are working to build these technologies as we speak. It is becoming clearer that governments\u2014even those that profess to operate on principles of liberalism\u2014have no interest in securing a true open internet beyond what suits their present strategies for securing global power.   We can't rely on states. Our strongest hope for resistance against censorship and surveillance lies with technologies that are built to resist censorship and surveillance by design . The question is when current internet users will decide when they've had enough.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42595097005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BW-XW01-JCSC-J48M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1396\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>REASON Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Taking a look at how these ecosystems are formed, operate and develop, the team presented a comparative analysis of three very different industries and styles. The report specifically outlines how food logistics, big-tech and manufacturing oftentimes use similar ideas to organize themselves into highly-efficient ecosystems of interdependence. As the undisputed global leaders in manufacturing, China has for years been perfecting the model of open innovation within large business ecosystems. Adding to much of the country's economic rise over recent decades, these huge ecosystems are comprised of a great number of smaller component parts that allow for ultra-specialization at each individual point in the business cycle.</p><p><br/>Oftentimes spanning multiple verticals, these ecosystems are seen everywhere from digital services, to manufacturing and even the food industry.<br/>Understanding cooperation as being more beneficial to growth than competition, Chinese companies of all sizes attribute their being within a business ecosystem as being a major competitive advantage. Being part of the team means potentially having access to shared resources, knowledge and insights, as well as being able to access new clients, markets and being reserved a place on exclusive platforms. In turn, these specialized component players are able to focus on incremental innovation and thus fend off outsiders in order to gain market share in their respective vertical whilst maintaining low cost and high product quality.<br/>These ecosystems are formed in a number of ways, generally either naturally through inter-dependance on each other at various levels of the supply chain, or through investment and M &amp; A. Governance of these ecosystems can also vary greatly depending on their areas of service and leadership styles, but majority seek to try and uphold a level of quality consistent with the overall brand image. For this reason, being associated with a certain ecosystem can add a lot of social capital to, especially younger companies, trying to establish themselves and their brand amongst an ocean of competitors. In China, business ecosystems are absolutely key to driving innovation on all fronts and are of fundamental importance to companies of all sizes.\u00a0<br/>Digital Ecosystem - ATM ( Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan Dianping )<br/>Well known to any China-watcher, the massive ATM tech trio of Alibaba, Tencent and Meituan Dianping are the middle kingdom's answer to FAAMG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google); they are truly enormous and are all a feature of modern-day life for most Chinese people. It's not by accident that their collective acronym is the same as a cash dispensing machine either, these tech giants are known for having incredibly deep pockets which they regularly use to invest in smaller companies, absorb competitors and support lengthy cash burns against each other in emerging industries. All three support a wide range of digital products and services that facilitate China's online economy and innovative tech industry.<br/>Tencent-backed Meituan Dianping's membership in the top three club is highly contested after it knocked out search engine provider Baidu (formerly BAT) from the third spot in mid-2019 and has seen advances from news aggregator Toutiao and TikTok's parent company ByteDance. This fierce competition is perpetuated by consistent investment by Tencent and Alibaba to advance the entire industry as a whole and boost digital innovation across the country. As the two undisputed Internet industry leaders, Alibaba and Tencent both have very different styles for organising their ecosystems. Alibaba is known for being very hands-on with their investments, like in the case of their 2018 full acquisition of food delivery service ele.me in which they already owned a 43% share versus Tencent's more hands-off approach symbolised by their taking of a 20% stake in ele.me 's main rival, Meituan Dianping, before the 2018 IPO . The Alibaba ecosystem also appears more tangible, with technical and financial support from Alibabacloud and Ant Financial underpinning mega-app platform Alipay, which in turn exclusively supports a whole host of Alibaba applications and services such as Tmall, Taobao, ele.me , Hellobike, Hema supermarkets and more.<br/>For many years, Tencent was seen to be flying under the radar of international attention. Preferring a hands-off strategy, Tencent invests even wider and more frequently than Alibaba and with stakes of over 100 billion yuan in more than 600 companies since 2011 , Tencent prefers to take minority interests and co-invest with other VC's to allow the companies to remain independent before claiming a profit upon public listing. In more recent years, however, both Alibaba and Tencent have taken their rivalry to the international stage with a number of highly publicised investments in up-and-coming South East Asian Internet companies including Grab, GoJek and Lazada . In both cases, the two giants look to bolster innovation by freeing up promising startups to focus on producing quality products rather than worrying about finances; both also share networking resources and technical support to help build the individual companies and in turn, expand the ecosystem. Manufacturing Ecosystem - Vaporesso &amp; Smoore International<br/>On speed, versatility or volume, the rest of the world cannot compete with Chinese manufacturing. This is the case for the new-age industry of e-cigarettes, where access to a large pool of world-class designers, technicians and researchers has resulted in a massive concentration of 90% of the world's vaping devices coming from China. Specifically, production is centralized in Shenzhen, a city with over 600 e-cigarette manufacturers and understandably regarded as the absolute forefront of vape-tech design and innovation. For consumers, however, this supporting network is both invisible and inaccessible. In order to complete the cycle of research, to production, to selling to offline consumers, retail partners who understand local market conditions and regulations are also needed.<br/>In mid-2020, well-known vaping device brand Vaporesso's parent company, Smoore International Holdings(6969.HK), debuted internationally with a Hong Kong IPO of $29.4 billion, making it the first vaping company to list in Hong Kong and instantly minting China's first two vaping industry billionaires. Utilizing the strength of the Shenzhen electronics manufacturing ecosystem, Smoore established themselves early on in the industry and became dedicated to being ultra-specialists in electronic atomization technology, leading the entire industry's R &amp; D efforts. Smoore's research-focused approach is shown through the company's employing of more people in R &amp; D than sales and in being in possession of over 1000 technology patents. Cutting-edge innovations are then worked into marketable products by Smoore's public facing brands including Vaporesso, FEELM Lab and\u00a0CCELL to be distributed around the world. Smoore's sub-brand Vaporesso, having a team focused on R &amp; D within the ecosystem allows them to concentrate on being specialists in production and branding. This constant flow of new technical innovations means that without having to commit resources to R &amp; D, Vaporesso can still remain a market leader, recording the lowest rejection rate in the vaping industry and contributing to Smoore's 16.5% global market share with a CAGR of 110%. In addition to support in development, Vaporesso also relies on local distributors around the world to help facilitate the sale of their products and ensure adherence with legislation. This reliance on local partners reduces the need for Vaporesso to commit to taking resources away from specializing on production and branding, leaving the final leg of the product sale cycle in the hands of other equally specialized partners within the same ecosystem. This attitude also means the brand is equipped to deal with new imposed regulations on the fast-growing industry such as America's impending PMTA (Premarket Tobacco Product Application) which ahead of schedule Vaporesso has already submitted and received their acceptance letter and positive comments from FDA on its overall preparation.\u00a0<br/>Food Supply Chain Ecosystem - Haidilao Hotpot<br/>Known in China for its above-and-beyond service, Haidilao Hotpot blipped onto international radars with its near $1 billion Hong Kong IPO in 2018 . The restaurant chain's success, however, is due to more than just providing quality food and services to its customers. With over 300,000 Hotpot restaurants in the country, Haidilao sought to differentiate themselves by establishing a brand consistent across all restaurants in the country and internationally. In order do so, they reverse-engineered an ecosystem to allow oversight across the entire food and product cycle; creating a specially designed production and logistics system to feed into the restaurants. This control of every step in the cycle also allowed them to experiment with innovative technologies and business practices with reduced risk.<br/>Despite third party food supply and logistics services already being very mature in China, the Hotpot industry requires a higher standard of service as ingredients are generally delivered raw to customers' tables and therefore need to be absolutely fresh. As the franchise grew from a single store in 1994, it became apparent that maintaining standards for products and services would be best managed by the company body, rather than individual store managers. The solution was to establish a dedicated food supply and logistics company that would oversee the restaurants' supply needs. By doing so, Haidilao was also able to reduce kitchen staff numbers by preparing ingredients in a controlled warehouse environment and transporting directly to the restaurants, maintaining freshness and consistency, whilst allowing employees to focus more on providing quality customer service and experience.<br/>Through systematic analysis and control at each step in the food production to consumption cycle, Haidilao Hotpot are able to dedicate resources to ultra-specialization. Instead of having to worry about what is happening behind the scenes, in-store managers are able to focus solely on providing customer service, resulting in PR-boosting headlines such as ' Offering manicures with your Hotpot ' and ' HaiDiLao Hot Pot Chain Has Free Massages \". The kitchen then also becomes the responsibility of kitchen specialists and results in innovations like a joint venture with Panasonic in 2018 to launch 'smart' restaurants by leveraging image recognition and robotics to create fully automated kitchens. The franchise is an example of how creating a dedicated ecosystem of many moving parts can allow for greater overall growth and development whilst maintaining a consistent brand image. China's huge size and population lends itself to extremely competitive business practices. As these practices have grown and evolved over time, ecosystems of ultra-specialization have appeared as the prevailing standard. Regardless of industry or product, the pattern of Chinese organizations to dissect each individual step in the business cycle and then optimize better and faster than their competition, has created enormous ecosystems of many interdependent moving parts with their own unique roles and purposes. For international observers looking in, there is still much more to learn about how these ecosystems arise, how they are maintained and how they will develop into the future.<br/>Media Contact:<br/>Company: Spider Media<br/>Email:<br/>Website: [To enable links contact<url normalizedValue=\"https://menafn.com/mf_contact.aspx?src=Contact_Authors\">MENAFN</url>]<br/>Attachment<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Spider Media</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1100820415</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W3-X741-JCNX-31SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 18, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Taking a look at how these ecosystems are formed, operate and develop, the team presented a comparative analysis of three very different industries and styles. The report specifically outlines how food logistics, big-tech and manufacturing oftentimes use similar ideas to organize themselves into highly-efficient ecosystems of interdependence.</p><p> As the undisputed global leaders in manufacturing, China has for years been perfecting the model of open innovation within large business ecosystems. Adding to much of the country's economic rise over recent decades, these huge ecosystems are comprised of a great number of smaller component parts that allow for ultra-specialization at each individual point in the business cycle.\u00a0\u00a0Oftentimes spanning multiple verticals, these ecosystems are seen everywhere from digital services, to manufacturing and even the food industry. Understanding cooperation as being more beneficial to growth than competition, Chinese companies of all sizes attribute their being within a business ecosystem as being a major competitive advantage. Being part of the team means potentially having access to shared resources, knowledge and insights, as well as being able to access new clients, markets and being reserved a place on exclusive platforms. In turn, these specialized component players are able to focus on incremental innovation and thus fend off outsiders in order to gain market share in their respective vertical whilst maintaining low cost and high product quality.These ecosystems are formed in a number of ways, generally either naturally through inter-dependance on each other at various levels of the supply chain, or through investment and M&amp;A. Governance of these ecosystems can also vary greatly depending on their areas of service and leadership styles, but majority seek to try and uphold a level of quality consistent with the overall brand image. For this reason, being associated with a certain ecosystem can add a lot of social capital to, especially younger companies, trying to establish themselves and their brand amongst an ocean of competitors. In China, business ecosystems are absolutely key to driving innovation on all fronts and are of fundamental importance to companies of all sizes.\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Digital Ecosystem - ATM</emphasis> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan Dianping</emphasis>)Well known to any China-watcher, the massive ATM tech trio of Alibaba, Tencent and Meituan Dianping are the middle kingdom's answer to FAAMG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google); they are truly enormous and are all a feature of modern-day life for most Chinese people. It's not by accident that their collective acronym is the same as a cash dispensing machine either, these tech giants are known for having incredibly deep pockets which they regularly use to invest in smaller companies, absorb competitors and support lengthy cash burns against each other in emerging industries. All three support a wide range of digital products and services that facilitate China's online economy and innovative tech industry.  Tencent-backed Meituan Dianping's membership in the top three club is highly contested after it knocked out search engine provider Baidu (formerly BAT) from the third spot in mid-2019 and has seen advances from news aggregator Toutiao and TikTok's parent company ByteDance. This fierce competition is perpetuated by consistent investment by Tencent and Alibaba to advance the entire industry as a whole and boost digital innovation across the country.</p><p>As the two undisputed Internet industry leaders, Alibaba and Tencent both have very different styles for organising their ecosystems. Alibaba is known for being very hands-on with their investments, like in the case of their 2018 full acquisition of food delivery service ele.me in which they already owned a 43% share versus Tencent's more hands-off approach symbolised by their\u00a0 taking of a 20% stake in ele.me's main rival, Meituan Dianping, before the 2018 IPO. The Alibaba ecosystem also appears more tangible, with technical and financial support from Alibabacloud and Ant Financial underpinning mega-app platform Alipay, which in turn exclusively supports a whole host of Alibaba applications and services such as Tmall, Taobao, ele.me, Hellobike, Hema supermarkets and more.For many years, Tencent was seen to be flying under the radar of international attention. Preferring a hands-off strategy, Tencent invests even wider and more frequently than Alibaba and with stakes of over 100 billion yuan in more than 600 companies since 2011, Tencent prefers to take minority interests and co-invest with other VC's to allow the companies to remain independent before claiming a profit upon public listing. In more recent years, however, both Alibaba and Tencent have taken their rivalry to the international stage with a number of highly publicised investments in up-and-coming South East Asian Internet companies including Grab, GoJek and Lazada. In both cases, the two giants look to bolster innovation by freeing up promising startups to focus on producing quality products rather than worrying about finances; both also share networking resources and technical support to help build the individual companies and in turn, expand the ecosystem.</p><p> Manufacturing Ecosystem - Vaporesso &amp; Smoore International\u00a0On speed, versatility or volume, the rest of the world cannot compete with Chinese manufacturing. This is the case for the new-age industry of e-cigarettes, where access to a large pool of world-class designers, technicians and researchers has resulted in a massive concentration of 90% of the world's vaping devices coming from China. Specifically, production is centralized in Shenzhen, a city with over 600 e-cigarette manufacturers and understandably regarded as the absolute forefront of vape-tech design and innovation. For consumers, however, this supporting network is both invisible and inaccessible.

Taking a look at how these ecosystems are formed, operate and develop, the team presented a comparative analysis of three very different industries and styles. The report specifically outlines how food logistics, big-tech and manufacturing oftentimes use similar ideas to organize themselves into highly-efficient ecosystems of interdependence.    As the undisputed global leaders in manufacturing, China has for years been perfecting the model of open innovation within large business ecosystems. Adding to much of the country\u2019s economic rise over recent decades, these huge ecosystems are comprised of a great number of smaller component parts that allow for ultra-specialization at each individual point in the business cycle.  Oftentimes spanning multiple verticals, these ecosystems are seen everywhere from digital services, to manufacturing and even the food industry.    Understanding cooperation as being more beneficial to growth than competition, Chinese companies of all sizes attribute their being within a business ecosystem as being a major competitive advantage. Being part of the team means potentially having access to shared resources, knowledge and insights, as well as being able to access new clients, markets and being reserved a place on exclusive platforms. In turn, these specialized component players are able to focus on incremental innovation and thus fend off outsiders in order to gain market share in their respective vertical whilst maintaining low cost and high product quality.    These ecosystems are formed in a number of ways, generally either naturally through inter-dependance on each other at various levels of the supply chain, or through investment and M&amp;A. Governance of these ecosystems can also vary greatly depending on their areas of service and leadership styles, but majority seek to try and uphold a level of quality consistent with the overall brand image. For this reason, being associated with a certain ecosystem can add a lot of social capital to, especially younger companies, trying to establish themselves and their brand amongst an ocean of competitors. In China, business ecosystems are absolutely key to driving innovation on all fronts and are of fundamental importance to companies of all sizes.    Digital Ecosystem \u2013 ATM (Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan Dianping)  Well known to any China-watcher, the massive ATM tech trio of Alibaba, Tencent and Meituan Dianping are the middle kingdom\u2019s answer to FAAMG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google); they are truly enormous and are all a feature of modern-day life for most Chinese people. It\u2019s not by accident that their collective acronym is the same as a cash dispensing machine either, these tech giants are known for having incredibly deep pockets which they regularly use to invest in smaller companies, absorb competitors and support lengthy cash burns against each other in emerging industries. All three support a wide range of digital products and services that facilitate China\u2019s online economy and innovative tech industry.    Tencent-backed Meituan Dianping\u2019s membership in the top three club is highly contested after it knocked out search engine provider Baidu (formerly BAT) from the third spot in mid-2019 and has seen advances from news aggregator Toutiao and TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance. This fierce competition is perpetuated by consistent investment by Tencent and Alibaba to advance the entire industry as a whole and boost digital innovation across the country.    As the two undisputed Internet industry leaders, Alibaba and Tencent both have very different styles for organising their ecosystems. Alibaba is known for being very hands-on with their investments, like in the case of their 2018 full acquisition of food delivery service ele.me in which they already owned a 43% share versus Tencent\u2019s more hands-off approach symbolised by their taking of a 20% stake in ele.me\u2019s main rival, Meituan Dianping, before the 2018 IPO. The Alibaba ecosystem also appears more tangible, with technical and financial support from Alibabacloud and Ant Financial underpinning mega-app platform Alipay, which in turn exclusively supports a whole host of Alibaba applications and services such as Tmall, Taobao, ele.me, Hellobike, Hema supermarkets and more.    For many years, Tencent was seen to be flying under the radar of international attention. Preferring a hands-off strategy, Tencent invests even wider and more frequently than Alibaba and with stakes of over 100 billion yuan in more than 600 companies since 2011, Tencent prefers to take minority interests and co-invest with other VC\u2019s to allow the companies to remain independent before claiming a profit upon public listing. In more recent years, however, both Alibaba and Tencent have taken their rivalry to the international stage with a number of highly publicised investments in up-and-coming South East Asian Internet companies including Grab, GoJek and Lazada. In both cases, the two giants look to bolster innovation by freeing up promising startups to focus on producing quality products rather than worrying about finances; both also share networking resources and technical support to help build the individual companies and in turn, expand the ecosystem.    Manufacturing Ecosystem \u2013 Vaporesso &amp; Smoore International  On speed, versatility or volume, the rest of the world cannot compete with Chinese manufacturing. This is the case for the new-age industry of e-cigarettes, where access to a large pool of world-class designers, technicians and researchers has resulted in a massive concentration of 90% of the world\u2019s vaping devices coming from China. Specifically, production is centralized in Shenzhen, a city with over 600 e-cigarette manufacturers and understandably regarded as the absolute forefront of vape-tech design and innovation. For consumers, however, this supporting network is both invisible and inaccessible. In order to complete the cycle of research, to production, to selling to offline consumers, retail partners who understand local market conditions and regulations are also needed.    In mid-2020, well-known vaping device brand Vaporesso\u2019s parent company, Smoore International Holdings(6969.HK), debuted internationally with a Hong Kong IPO of $29.4 billion, making it the first vaping company to list in Hong Kong and instantly minting China\u2019s first two vaping industry billionaires. Utilizing the strength of the Shenzhen electronics manufacturing ecosystem, Smoore established themselves early on in the industry and became dedicated to being ultra-specialists in electronic atomization technology, leading the entire industry\u2019s R&amp;D efforts. Smoore\u2019s research-focused approach is shown through the company\u2019s employing of more people in R&amp;D than sales and in being in possession of over 1000 technology patents. Cutting-edge innovations are then worked into marketable products by Smoore\u2019s public facing brands including Vaporesso, FEELM Lab and CCELL to be distributed around the world.    Smoore\u2019s sub-brand Vaporesso, having a team focused on R&amp;D within the ecosystem allows them to concentrate on being specialists in production and branding. This constant flow of new technical innovations means that without having to commit resources to R&amp;D, Vaporesso can still remain a market leader, recording the lowest rejection rate in the vaping industry and contributing to Smoore\u2019s 16.5% global market share with a CAGR of 110%. In addition to support in development, Vaporesso also relies on local distributors around the world to help facilitate the sale of their products and ensure adherence with legislation. This reliance on local partners reduces the need for Vaporesso to commit to taking resources away from specializing on production and branding, leaving the final leg of the product sale cycle in the hands of other equally specialized partners within the same ecosystem. This attitude also means the brand is equipped to deal with new imposed regulations on the fast-growing industry such as America\u2019s impending PMTA (Premarket Tobacco Product Application) which ahead of schedule Vaporesso has already submitted and received their acceptance letter and positive comments from FDA on its overall preparation.    Food Supply Chain Ecosystem \u2013 Haidilao Hotpot  Known in China for its above-and-beyond service, Haidilao Hotpot blipped onto international radars with its near $1 billion Hong Kong IPO in 2018. The restaurant chain\u2019s success, however, is due to more than just providing quality food and services to its customers. With over 300,000 Hotpot restaurants in the country, Haidilao sought to differentiate themselves by establishing a brand consistent across all restaurants in the country and internationally. In order do so, they reverse-engineered an ecosystem to allow oversight across the entire food and product cycle; creating a specially designed production and logistics system to feed into the restaurants. This control of every step in the cycle also allowed them to experiment with innovative technologies and business practices with reduced risk.    Despite third party food supply and logistics services already being very mature in China, the Hotpot industry requires a higher standard of service as ingredients are generally delivered raw to customers\u2019 tables and therefore need to be absolutely fresh. As the franchise grew from a single store in 1994, it became apparent that maintaining standards for products and services would be best managed by the company body, rather than individual store managers. The solution was to establish a dedicated food supply and logistics company that would oversee the restaurants\u2019 supply needs. By doing so, Haidilao was also able to reduce kitchen staff numbers by preparing ingredients in a controlled warehouse environment and transporting directly to the restaurants, maintaining freshness and consistency, whilst allowing employees to focus more on providing quality customer service and experience.    Through systematic analysis and control at each step in the food production to consumption cycle, Haidilao Hotpot are able to dedicate resources to ultra-specialization. Instead of having to worry about what is happening behind the scenes, in-store managers are able to focus solely on providing customer service, resulting in PR-boosting headlines such as \u201cOffering manicures with your Hotpot\u201d and \u201cHaiDiLao Hot Pot Chain Has Free Massages\u201d. The kitchen then also becomes the responsibility of kitchen specialists and results in innovations like a joint venture with Panasonic in 2018 to launch \u201csmart\u201d restaurants by leveraging image recognition and robotics to create fully automated kitchens. The franchise is an example of how creating a dedicated ecosystem of many moving parts can allow for greater overall growth and development whilst maintaining a consistent brand image.    China\u2019s huge size and population lends itself to extremely competitive business practices. As these practices have grown and evolved over time, ecosystems of ultra-specialization have appeared as the prevailing standard. Regardless of industry or product, the pattern of Chinese organizations to dissect each individual step in the business cycle and then optimize better and faster than their competition, has created enormous ecosystems of many interdependent moving parts with their own unique roles and purposes. For international observers looking in, there is still much more to learn about how these ecosystems arise, how they are maintained and how they will develop into the future.

Taking a look at how these ecosystems are formed, operate and develop, the team presented a comparative analysis of three very different industries and styles. The report specifically outlines how food logistics, big-tech and manufacturing oftentimes use similar ideas to organize themselves into highly-efficient ecosystems of interdependence.  As the undisputed global leaders in manufacturing, China has for years been perfecting the model of open innovation within large business ecosystems. Adding to much of the country\u2019s economic rise over recent decades, these huge ecosystems are comprised of a great number of smaller component parts that allow for ultra-specialization at each individual point in the business cycle.    Oftentimes spanning multiple verticals, these ecosystems are seen everywhere from digital services, to manufacturing and even the food industry.   Understanding cooperation as being more beneficial to growth than competition, Chinese companies of all sizes attribute their being within a business ecosystem as being a major competitive advantage. Being part of the team means potentially having access to shared resources, knowledge and insights, as well as being able to access new clients, markets and being reserved a place on exclusive platforms. In turn, these specialized component players are able to focus on incremental innovation and thus fend off outsiders in order to gain market share in their respective vertical whilst maintaining low cost and high product quality.   These ecosystems are formed in a number of ways, generally either naturally through inter-dependance on each other at various levels of the supply chain, or through investment and M&amp;A. Governance of these ecosystems can also vary greatly depending on their areas of service and leadership styles, but majority seek to try and uphold a level of quality consistent with the overall brand image. For this reason, being associated with a certain ecosystem can add a lot of social capital to, especially younger companies, trying to establish themselves and their brand amongst an ocean of competitors. In China, business ecosystems are absolutely key to driving innovation on all fronts and are of fundamental importance to companies of all sizes.    *Digital Ecosystem - ATM* (*Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan Dianping*)  Well known to any China-watcher, the massive ATM tech trio of Alibaba, Tencent and Meituan Dianping are the middle kingdom\u2019s answer to FAAMG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google); they are truly enormous and are all a feature of modern-day life for most Chinese people. It\u2019s not by accident that their collective acronym is the same as a cash dispensing machine either, these tech giants are known for having incredibly deep pockets which they regularly use to invest in smaller companies, absorb competitors and support lengthy cash burns against each other in emerging industries. All three support a wide range of digital products and services that facilitate China\u2019s online economy and innovative tech industry.   Tencent-backed Meituan Dianping\u2019s membership in the top three club is highly contested after it knocked out search engine provider Baidu (formerly BAT) from the third spot in mid-2019 and has seen advances from news aggregator Toutiao and TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance. This fierce competition is perpetuated by consistent investment by Tencent and Alibaba to advance the entire industry as a whole and boost digital innovation across the country.   As the two undisputed Internet industry leaders, Alibaba and Tencent both have very different styles for organising their ecosystems. Alibaba is known for being very hands-on with their investments, like in the case of their 2018 full acquisition of food delivery service ele.me in which they already owned a 43% share versus Tencent\u2019s more hands-off approach symbolised by their  taking of a 20% stake in ele.me's main rival, Meituan Dianping, before the 2018 IPO. The Alibaba ecosystem also appears more tangible, with technical and financial support from Alibabacloud and Ant Financial underpinning mega-app platform Alipay, which in turn exclusively supports a whole host of Alibaba applications and services such as Tmall, Taobao, ele.me, Hellobike, Hema supermarkets and more.   For many years, Tencent was seen to be flying under the radar of international attention. Preferring a hands-off strategy, Tencent invests even wider and more frequently than Alibaba and with stakes of over 100 billion yuan in more than 600 companies since 2011, Tencent prefers to take minority interests and co-invest with other VC\u2019s to allow the companies to remain independent before claiming a profit upon public listing. In more recent years, however, both Alibaba and Tencent have taken their rivalry to the international stage with a number of highly publicised investments in up-and-coming South East Asian Internet companies including Grab, GoJek and Lazada. In both cases, the two giants look to bolster innovation by freeing up promising startups to focus on producing quality products rather than worrying about finances; both also share networking resources and technical support to help build the individual companies and in turn, expand the ecosystem.   *Manufacturing Ecosystem - Vaporesso &amp; Smoore International *  On speed, versatility or volume, the rest of the world cannot compete with Chinese manufacturing. This is the case for the new-age industry of e-cigarettes, where access to a large pool of world-class designers, technicians and researchers has resulted in a massive concentration of 90% of the world\u2019s vaping devices coming from China. Specifically, production is centralized in Shenzhen, a city with over 600 e-cigarette manufacturers and understandably regarded as the absolute forefront of vape-tech design and innovation. For consumers, however, this supporting network is both invisible and inaccessible. In order to complete the cycle of research, to production, to selling to offline consumers, retail partners who understand local market conditions and regulations are also needed.   In mid-2020, well-known vaping device brand Vaporesso\u2019s parent company, Smoore International Holdings(6969.HK), debuted internationally with a Hong Kong IPO of $29.4 billion, making it the first vaping company to list in Hong Kong and instantly minting China\u2019s first two vaping industry billionaires. Utilizing the strength of the Shenzhen electronics manufacturing ecosystem, Smoore established themselves early on in the industry and became dedicated to being ultra-specialists in electronic atomization technology, leading the entire industry\u2019s R&amp;D efforts. Smoore\u2019s research-focused approach is shown through the company\u2019s employing of more people in R&amp;D than sales and in being in possession of over 1000 technology patents. Cutting-edge innovations are then worked into marketable products by Smoore\u2019s public facing brands including Vaporesso, FEELM Lab and CCELL to be distributed around the world.   Smoore\u2019s sub-brand Vaporesso, having a team focused on R&amp;D within the ecosystem allows them to concentrate on being specialists in production and branding. This constant flow of new technical innovations means that without having to commit resources to R&amp;D, Vaporesso can still remain a market leader, recording the lowest rejection rate in the vaping industry and contributing to Smoore\u2019s 16.5% global market share with a CAGR of 110%. In addition to support in development, Vaporesso also relies on local distributors around the world to help facilitate the sale of their products and ensure adherence with legislation. This reliance on local partners reduces the need for Vaporesso to commit to taking resources away from specializing on production and branding, leaving the final leg of the product sale cycle in the hands of other equally specialized partners within the same ecosystem. This attitude also means the brand is equipped to deal with new imposed regulations on the fast-growing industry such as America\u2019s impending PMTA (Premarket Tobacco Product Application) which ahead of schedule Vaporesso has already submitted and received their acceptance letter and positive comments from FDA on its overall preparation. *Food Supply Chain Ecosystem - Haidilao Hotpot*  Known in China for its above-and-beyond service, Haidilao Hotpot blipped onto international radars with its near $1 billion Hong Kong IPO in 2018. The restaurant chain\u2019s success, however, is due to more than just providing quality food and services to its customers. With over 300,000 Hotpot restaurants in the country, Haidilao sought to differentiate themselves by establishing a brand consistent across all restaurants in the country and internationally. In order do so, they reverse-engineered an ecosystem to allow oversight across the entire food and product cycle; creating a specially designed production and logistics system to feed into the restaurants. This control of every step in the cycle also allowed them to experiment with innovative technologies and business practices with reduced risk.    Despite third party food supply and logistics services already being very mature in China, the Hotpot industry requires a higher standard of service as ingredients are generally delivered raw to customers\u2019 tables and therefore need to be absolutely fresh. As the franchise grew from a single store in 1994, it became apparent that maintaining standards for products and services would be best managed by the company body, rather than individual store managers. The solution was to establish a dedicated food supply and logistics company that would oversee the restaurants\u2019 supply needs. By doing so, Haidilao was also able to reduce kitchen staff numbers by preparing ingredients in a controlled warehouse environment and transporting directly to the restaurants, maintaining freshness and consistency, whilst allowing employees to focus more on providing quality customer service and experience.Through systematic analysis and control at each step in the food production to consumption cycle, Haidilao Hotpot are able to dedicate resources to ultra-specialization. Instead of having to worry about what is happening behind the scenes, in-store managers are able to focus solely on providing customer service, resulting in PR-boosting headlines such as \u201cOffering manicures with your Hotpot\u201d and \u201cHaiDiLao Hot Pot Chain Has Free Massages\". The kitchen then also becomes the responsibility of kitchen specialists and results in innovations like a joint venture with Panasonic in 2018 to launch \u201csmart\u201d restaurants by leveraging image recognition and robotics to create fully automated kitchens. The franchise is an example of how creating a dedicated ecosystem of many moving parts can allow for greater overall growth and development whilst maintaining a consistent brand image.   China\u2019s huge size and population lends itself to extremely competitive business practices. As these practices have grown and evolved over time, ecosystems of ultra-specialization have appeared as the prevailing standard. Regardless of industry or product, the pattern of Chinese organizations to dissect each individual step in the business cycle and then optimize better and faster than their competition, has created enormous ecosystems of many interdependent moving parts with their own unique roles and purposes. For international observers looking in, there is still much more to learn about how these ecosystems arise, how they are maintained and how they will develop into the future.   *Media Contact: *  *Company:* Spider Media  *Email:* [email protected]  *Website:* <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.spider-media.cn\">https://www.spider-media.cn</url>/ *Attachment*   \u00b7 Spider Media</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43109010514</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W3-GF61-JCSC-J09D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2029\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NewsR.in</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 18, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Press Release</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
