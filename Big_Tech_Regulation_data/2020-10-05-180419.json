Trumpism versus socialism and it's  playing out before our very eyes in Florida's gubernatorial contest.  Who  will come out on top?  I'm guy Benson in for Kennedy tonight.  Last night,  Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis won his primary and will now go up  against the surprise Democratic winner, Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the race is way bigger than just Florida.  It's actually in some ways a  microcosm of the larger political battle raging across the nation.  Here's  why.  DeSantis is a big supporter of President Trump and vice versa.   Gillum is backed by Vermont socialist Senator Bernie Sanders, and the  winner of this race might foreshadow what's to come in 2020.  Last night,  DeSantis claimed his opponent's policies will destroy Florida's economy.   Watch.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  He is the most liberal candidate that the  Democratic Party has ever nominated in the State of Florida by a country  mile in a governor's race.  He wants to abolish ICE, he wants a billion  dollar tax increase, he wants a single-payer healthcare system in Florida  which would bankrupt the state.  I'm trying to make Florida even better.   He wants to make FloridaVenezuela. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BENSON:  Make Florida Venezuela again, that could go on a baseball cap.   But Gillum claims that raising corporate taxes could actually attract new  businesses.  Hmm.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDREW GILLUM, MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE:  What we have proposed is an increase  in the corporate tax rate which in the State of Florida is lower than our  neighboring States of Alabama and Georgia.  Right now we're at 5-1/4 and  we've suggested going up to just over seven which puts us in line with many  other states and part of what -- it creates a billion dollars in funding  for our public education system.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BENSON:  OK.  So what are the takeaways from last night and what does it  mean going forward?  Joining me now, former special assistant to President  Trump and former press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence, Mark Lotter  is here.  And also here with me in New York, co-host of \"THE FIVE,\" Juan  Williams.  Gentlemen, welcome.  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Good evening.  </p><p>MARK LOTTER, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE:  Good to  be here.</p><p>BENSON:  Mark, I'll start with you.  Another major endorsement victory for  President Trump, dare we call this a winning streak?  </p><p>LOTTER:  I think so, and it's pretty clear when you see that Ron DeSantis  was down by big double digits and after that endorsement he won by over --  by close to 20 points.  So, big win for Ron DeSantis and I would say it's a  big win for Florida because they've had a really good thing going in the  last 20 years under Republican leadership.  Not sure they're ready to turn  their backs on that and embrace socialism.  </p><p>BENSON:  Juan, I'm actually fascinated by the dynamics of this race.  We  talked about a little bit of the top.  It's almost a laboratory pure test  of MAGA versus feel the burn here in the swingiest state in the country.   How do you feel like this is going to shape up with these two candidates  that frankly the other party will argue is unelectable?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, in fact, one of the arguments today I was hearing from  political people is either side got the candidate they want to run against.  </p><p>BENSON:  Right.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  And so here you have a situation where the question is the label  socialist. So the Republican, the Trumpian, DeSantis, says my opponent is a  socialist.  And, in fact, we recently had a poll that you may have seen  where most Democrats said they're fine with socialism.  </p><p>BENSON:  I mean, he won the primary.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Correct.  But the question is this, is he a socialist?  I don't  think he accepts that label.  He's not, certainly, about having the  government takeover the means of production.  We live in an age where there  are lots of people -- we had a poll this week that found, I think, it's 40  percent of Americans said they had a hard time meeting bills for food, for  housing and healthcare.</p><p>In an era of high-income inequality, is it socialist to say I believe in a  social safety net that protects people from falling to the bottom?  </p><p>BENSON:  All right.  Well, Mark, let's get your response to that because we  can debate whether or not he's a socialist or a Democratic socialist, but  as you heard from Ron DeSantis in that clip we just played, his opponent  does support socialist healthcare.  He wants to socialize healthcare in the  state, abolish ICE.  It's a pretty far-left agenda especially in a state  like Florida which is kind of down the middle.  </p><p>LOTTER:  And you're absolutely right.  And let's remember that he won that  primary last night with only one-third of a very large Democratic vote.  So  two out of three Democratic voters said no.  How is he going to convince  them that his far-left policies, which are farther left than more even  moderate, middle Democrats in Florida, that's a pretty extreme program he's  embracing.  We've got a lot of support, a lot of enthusiasm on the  Republican side.</p><p>I think he's going to have a lot of work to do, especially in that I-4  corridor, trying to make moderate people embrace his very liberal, very  progressive ideas.  </p><p>BENSON:  All right.  So Juan, how does he do that?  If you were  recommending things to Andrew Gillum as he looks toward November at this  point, he's won the primary, he checked the box.  Bernie Sanders really  helped him obviously.  Does he campaign with Bernie?  Does he remain a  Bernie Democrat or does he start to sort of inch toward the center?  And  how can he do that?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, no, I think the key in all races right now, and I think  you're going to see this across the country specifically in Georgia which  also has a Democrat black woman running, Stacey Abrams running against a  Trumpian, Brian Kemp, I think what you're going to see is they're saying  we're going to talk about the issues from the Democratic perspective.</p><p>And the issue will be -- and this is what Gillum did in his race against  other Democrats, say I'm the only non-millionaire in the race.  I'm the one  that really can identify --</p><p>BENSON:  That's not an issue.  That's not an issue.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, it is.  Because you want to say in a time of income  inequality I relate to you, struggling people, who are out there working  hard and having a hard time paying for your kids to go to college, college  tuition.  I'm the ones who can relate when a big medical bill comes in how  threatened you are and how it throws off your budget.  And I think that's  what he's going to do.</p><p>It's not going to, you know, so I think Republicans may say, oh, sounds  like socialism, but you know what?  I wonder if voters instead will respond  this is someone who shares my needs and understands my predicament.  </p><p>LOTTER:  But I'll tell you one thing in that response to Juan is all of  those people who have jobs, who are looking for jobs, they're going to have  small businesses, big business owners saying, well, because Gillum supports  a $15.00 minimum wage, because he's raising taxes on our companies 40  percent, we are not going to be able to give you a race.  We're not going  to be able to hire you.</p><p>Well, we're going to fire you and replace you with a computer because it's  costing us too much.  That is a very powerful driver and you can bet the  Chambers of Commerce and business groups are all going to be out there  rallying people to stop the tax increase.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Mark, you've got to hear from the teachers, you've got to  hear from people who feel as if they're underpaid in terms of government.   You've got to hear from the minority groups, larger and larger especially  along that I-94 corridor that you mentioned, referenced earlier.  These are  people who are quite excited by Gillum.  The question is, because I think  the Republican base is excited by Trump and DeSantis.</p><p>The question is once you get beyond these two polarized bases, what does  the middle think?  What does the suburban house way?</p><p>BENSON:  Yes.  That's going to be, I think, one of the most fascinating  races in the country.  We'll watch it very closely.  Mark, Juan, thank you  both.</p><p>LOTTER:  You're welcome.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Thanks.</p><p>BENSON:  One thing is for sure under the economy that has been engineered  by DeSantis' coach, President Trump, things are booming.  Just today the  government reported the U.S. economy grew 4.2 percent in the last quarter  which is higher than previously estimate and the best quarter since 2014.   A stronger economy has Americans more comfortable with their jobs as well.</p><p>A new report today claiming just over half of Americans, 51 percent say  they're satisfied with their jobs, the highest level since 2005.  Plus,  consumer confidence also at an 18-year high.  So while a lot of people love  to hate this President, are his policies at least being vindicated?  Fox  News Contributor and chief investment officer of Kingsview Asset  Management, Scott Martin is here with me now.</p><p>Scott, thanks for swinging by from Chicago, my former hometown.  Go, Cubs.  </p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Yes.   I mean, no problem.  And sorry about all the heat we sent you, but I'm not  telling you, I'm not missing it, man.  So enjoy.  </p><p>BENSON:  Chicago -- people talk about Chicago winners but Chicago summers  can be absolutely brutal.  So Scott, I want to talk about these economic  numbers today.  The job security and job satisfaction statistics, I thought  were interesting.  We don't always hear about that metric.  Why is it  important?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Well, it says a lot of things.  It says that employers are  treating or their employees right for maybe the first time in several years  via benefits, obviously 401(k) benefits are doing very well, we've seen  those balances, Guy, at record highs.  And job quality too.  You know, I  think with technology and things that are going on in the work force, Guy,  I think people are happier in their jobs because they're doing more stuff  in technology.</p><p>Maybe it's making their jobs easier.  And then on the flipside too, you  know, the employers are happy about that because companies are making more  money, we have record profits, and you're seeing that show up in the data  points.  </p><p>BENSON:  So I want to talk about a dichotomy here that is a little bit  puzzling to me, because I can rattle off all the incredible numbers about  the economy, unemployment, GDP growth, consumer confidence, the list goes  on.  We actually talked about a few of them just a moment ago and yet in  our most recent Fox News poll, only 47 percent of Americans rank the U.S.  economy right now as excellent or good.</p><p>With the other half saying only fair or poor.  So objectively, the economy  is in great shape, but the American people are polarized about whether it's  really all that great.  Why?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  It's kind of weird, you know?  It could be the media that  they're ingesting, certainly, that's telling them those things.  Or you  could have just made it to, you know, the right haters on the street as far  as that poll goes because to me, I've got to tell you, I mean, looking at  those data points you mentioned, Guy, with the economy now growing at 4.2  percent, the best in several years.</p><p>Consumer confidence at highs that we haven't seen since I was prom king,  business confidence as well -- </p><p>BENSON:  Were you really?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Very high.  No.  You know, when I came in second, and it was  totally fixed -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BENSON:  So that was fake news.  I just called you out in fake news.  </p><p>MARTIN:  It was totally -- it was totally fixed man.  The guy paid people  off to vote for him.  But either way, I should have been.  And then  secondly, listen like look at -- look at business confidence numbers.  Now  what we're seeing, Guy, that we haven't seen for many, many years because  businesses weren't confident enough in the future, they're actually doing  capital expenditures, research and development, investing in their  employees.</p><p>Things that companies weren't doing a couple years ago because they were  worried about the future, they were worried about regulations and taxes.   All of that spending is now getting unlocked.  So, I think those people you  interviewed eventually are going to turn tail because they're just going to  have to realize that the economy is better than they think.  </p><p>BENSON:  What do you make of this debate over whether we're on a sugar high  right now and everything is great for the moment but it's going to go away,  or is this unsustainable, is it sustainable to sort of this back and forth  among economists and politicians.  Where do you come down on that? </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  You know, I'm close to the sugar high camp.  Not yet, but I  will tell you that, you know, the way the markets are and the way that  they've just been going up and up and up on almost seemingly bad news these  days and, yes, we've had some good trade reconciliation news which does  support the S&amp;P 500, it will push up stock prices.  But the reality is  this, things are getting very good.</p><p>So if you just look back in history and look back at cycles, you know,  things in the markets and economy occur, and cycles just like seasons of  the year do, as you mentioned how hot it is in Chicago, it gets cold in  Chicago as well just like it will on the East Coast.  So, just remember  that if you're investing for today, there is going to be a rainy day in the  stock market, so as greatest things could be today, you've just got to have  some things in your portfolio that will do well if the markets go down. </p><p>BENSON:  Cyclical, I buy that, but how long is the cycle?  That's such a  huge question.  When might we start to look for some potential downturn  signs?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I'll tell you, man.  I mean, things are going to change if  the midterms go the wrong way.  Let's say depending on who you're voting  for, obviously that's a subjective comment.</p><p>BENSON:  Right.  </p><p>MARTIN:  But if things go a bad way in November, that could be the start of  it, Guy.  And in 2020, let's face it, man, it's not that far away, so  that's another twist that could be happening in the pipe here.  </p><p>BENSON:  Don't remind me.  All right.  Scott, thank you so much tonight.   And stay cool in Chicago for now.  </p><p>MARTIN:  See you.  </p><p>BENSON:  On a more somber note tonight, thousands of mourners paying their  respects today in honoring the life of war hero and longtime Senator John  McCain who served his country for more than 60 years.  Take a look there.   A live look inside the Arizona State Capitol where the body of John McCain  is lying in state.</p><p>Earlier today a police escort accompanied McCain's body to the Capitol as  scores of military veterans, law enforcement, fire and first responders  lined the sides of Capitol Plaza for the procession is.  Fox News  correspondent William La Jeunesse is with us Phoenix with more.  William?</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Guy, it's about 106  degrees here, and it has been all day.  And here is the amazing thing, the  line that you see here, it snakes another quarter mile around the corner  here.  It's been that way uninterrupted for about four hours all for the  chance to spend 20 or 30 seconds next to the casket of John McCain, just  enough to say goodbye.</p><p>But, you know, many don't know John McCain planned these services.  He  personally reached out to the pallbearers and the ushers and the people who  speak tomorrow to celebrate his life on what would have been his 82nd  birthday.  Now, there -- today was as you said, more solemn than  celebration.  Cindy and her two sons met the casket along with Governor  Doug Ducey and his wife.</p><p>The casket will lie here until tomorrow morning in a motorcade to North  Phoenix Baptist Church.  Senator Jon Kyl who served with McCain said there  was a debate on the floor of Congress he jointed, if there wasn't, McCain  would start one.  The country he said will miss his fight and his voice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>JON KYL, FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR:  John's love for America and  Arizona.  He represented our values all over the world as Senator from  Arizona.  And America is stronger for his fierce defense of our values.  We  can be proud he was our Senator.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Now, it was an emotional service with Cindy laying her head  on the coffin, daughter Meghan openly crying, follow by McCain's sons,  Governor Ducey recalled McCain's years in Vietnam fighting for his country  down for the state he represented for 36 years.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KYL:  When John McCain called upon us to serve a purpose greater than one's  own self-interest, it wasn't a talking point designed to win the next  election.  It was how he had actually lived his life and continued to live  his life.  That's how he wanted us to live ours.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Even though McCain is gone, he is still sending a message of  inclusivity and bipartisanship.  Those speaking tomorrow include Democrats  Joe Biden, the ushers and pallbearers are a mixed of -- well, a Hispanic  woman, a native American, cardinal Larry Fitzgerald, ex-Diamondback Luis  Gonzalez and in Washington many will come from across the aisle, Guy.  As I  said today, 106 degrees.  That building was built in 1901.</p><p>It's very thick wall, it's going to remain kind of cool.  But the people I  spoke to said they came for several reasons.  Obviously, his sacrifice in  Vietnam.  Some native Americans coming from five, six hours away on the  Naval Reservation because of what he did for the tribes and Indian gaming,  allowing that, pushing that legislation through.  And then of course many  just said, listen, he was there for us, it is our turn to be there for him  and their chance to say goodbye.  Back to you.</p><p>BENSON:  William, thank you for that report.  Moving day in Arizona.   Coming up, back in D.C. President Trump attacking Hillary Clinton after a  new report suggest China was able to hack into her e-mail server.  Remember  that one?  But did it actually happen?  Plus, another White House  departure, White House Counsel Don McGahn leaving his post this fall.  What  does that mean for the President's legal team?  Jason Chaffetz joins me  after the break.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BENSON:  President Trump calling for a new investigation into Hillary  Clinton's private e-mail server.  Earlier today the President tweeting,  \"Hillary Clinton's e-mails, many of which are classified information, got  hacked by China.  Next move better be by the FBI and DOJ or after all of  their other missteps, Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page or FISA dirty dossier et  cetera, their credibility will be gone forever.</p><p>The President seemed to be referencing a Daily Caller report that cited  anonymous sources in the intelligence community.  The FBI later countering  that, \"the FBI has not found any evidence that the servers were  compromised.\"  The Chinese Foreign Ministry for their part also denying the  report, LOL, of course they would, but is the President right to call out  the intelligence community as potentially compromised?</p><p>Joining me now, former Utah Congressman and Fox News Contributor Jason  Chaffetz.  Jason, it's great to see you.  You also have a forthcoming book,  The Deep State, we're happy to have you here.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, thank you, I appreciate it.  I  look forward to the book coming out, and thanks for having me on.</p><p>BENSON:  All right.  So let's start with this Daily Caller report, what we  saw form the President and his tweets and the FBI denying it, right?   Denying this whole suggestion or report that China hacked into Hillary  Clinton's bootleg basement e-mail server.  I'm reminded, everyone from  Robert Gates to Jim Comey to Mike Morrell said the chances were high that a  hostile foreign power did get into that unsecure server.</p><p>You paid very close attention to this while you were in Congress, what do  you think the truth is here? </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Oh, I think it's highly probable and most likely that it did  happen.  We heard testimony from the inspect general, Michael Horowitz,  that they did believe that there was an intrusion on this computer.  When I  was the chairman of the oversight committee, we heard testimony from the  person who set up the server, did not have a degree in computer science,  had never taken a computer course.</p><p>It literally kind of, you know, went down to Best Buy and then set it up in  the basement there.  I mean, literally, that's how sloppily this was done.   We never did get testimony from the secret service, you would think they  would take some ownership given that within former President Clinton's  home, but nevertheless it's -- I can't imagine that, A, she wasn't  targeted.  Of course she was.  She was Secretary of State.</p><p>And then even as former Secretary of State, she was presidential candidate  most likely at that point.  And it's almost impossible to think that even  some guy down by the river in a van could have done this probably.  It's  not a local 17-year-old, your local high schooler.  </p><p>BENSON:  Meantime, Jason, yesterday on Capitol Hill we saw Bruce Ohr  arriving for closed-door testimony before some committees.  You were, as  you just referenced, the chairman of the Oversight Committee in the house.   If you had been in that private session, what would have been some of the  questions you were eager to ask Bruce Ohr? </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, what you want to do is play off what the FBI was telling  you officially, because they have been fishy, at best, in provide  documents, they have been hiding the ball for a long time and it ends up  that more and more what Congressional investigators are finding out is what  they weren't told even under oath is turning out not to be true.   Particularly as it relates to this dossier, the funding of it.</p><p>The only evidence that we see of true collusion when money is changing  hands is between Russians, the Democratic National Committee, a guy named  Mark Elias.  That name is out in the media, but it's going to be the center  of the universe for so many of these things.  And Bruce Ohr talking about  how his wife Nelly is involved and engaged in this.  I mean, it's a  nefarious, salacious situation and yet no attention, but little to no  attention by the FBI itself.  </p><p>BENSON:  All right, Jason.  One more question here.  The report today  confirmed by the President, Don McGahn on his way out as White House  Counsel.  What's the effect at the White House?  What do you make of that? </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, I don't know who filled those big shoes.  I think Don  McGahn has been a trusted adviser, close to the President, a superb job in  the judicial nominees and selections certainly with the Supreme Court but  also at the district court level and whatnot.  There's no heir apparent  that I'm aware of.  And, you know, general counsel to the President of the  United States is a very big role to fill.  Especially in this White House.</p><p>BENSON:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And so, he will be deeply missed.  I don't know who steps up and  fills that but it is of critical importance.  </p><p>BENSON:  Jason Chaffetz, thank you for your time.  And good luck with the  book.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Thanks, Guy. </p><p>BENSON:  Sure thing.  Coming up.  Should the government be able to regulate  search engine results from Google?  We'll tell you why President Trump  seems to think so.  Plus, a senior Facebook engineer speaking out claiming  the company is biased against conservatives.  The panel joins me next to  discuss.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BENSON:  Some new controversies today the involving major internet company  that many of us use every single day, Facebook, Google, Yahoo! and Amazon.   Let's start with Google and Facebook.  Each of which are now mired in  separate claims of bias against conservatives.  Yesterday President Trump  tweeted, \"Google search results for Trump news shows only the viewing  reporting of fake news media.</p><p>In order, they have rigged it for me and others so that almost all stories  and news is bad.  Fake CNN is prominent, Republican conservative and fair  media is shut out.  Illegal?  96 percent of results on Trump news are from  national left-wing media, very dangerous.  Google and others are  suppressing voices of conservatives and is hiding information and news that  is good.  They are controlling what we can and cannot see.</p><p>This is a very serious situation.  Will be addressed.\"  Google responded  saying there's no bias in search results.  Over at Facebook, meanwhile,  dozens of employees have reportedly united to challenge what they say is a  left-swing culture at the social media giant.  They're claiming  conservative staffers shunned, marginalized and even harassed.  So is the  bias real, and what can or should be done about any of it if anything?</p><p>Let's go to the panel tonight.  FBN's Deirdre Bolton is here, Jimmy Failla  and Democratic strategist and attorney, Danielle McLaughlin.  Hello,  everyone.  </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BENSON:  Thanks for being here.  All right.  So, Deirdre, let's start with  Google and the President maybe suggesting that some regulation might be  coming down the pike.  As we think about regulation from the federal  government, looking at Google, private company but arguably sort of a  public utility because they're a gateway to internet searches.  How do you  strike that balance?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Well, we've heard the president  criticized Google, right, as he has.  We've also heard him say it's one of  our greatest companies, and we know that there is this Senate Intelligence  Committee hearing on September 5th.  So, we have to assume that some of  this is a little bit of grandstanding.  And as you say, I mean, this is a  publicly-traded company from a legal perspective, which I'm sure Danielle  will help us out on.  </p><p>I actually don't know what the government really can do even if they  decided in some weird way to try to somehow restrict.  I don't know, you  would have freedom of speech infractions.  I mean, you have a lot of  problems if the government tries to outright regulate Google.  And by the  way, the president has also complained, right, about Facebook, and perhaps  right so, also complained about Twitter -- </p><p>BENSON:  Lots of complaining.  </p><p>BOLTON:  So, I just think -- as we know, he tends to be very pure in  whatever sentiments he is feeling at that particular moment.  </p><p>BENSON:  All right.  So, Danielle, let's just say hypothetically, Google's  denying any of this for the moment.  But hypothetically, if Google was  tweaking its formulas to promote an agenda or suppress some search results,  would that be a problem?  </p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Constitutionally, no.  I mean,  the freedom of speech that we have, and corporations have freedom of speech  as well, which we can decide whether that's a good thing or not, they have  a lot of rights, protects us, protects corporations against government.   So, it gives the freedom -- you know, what's the saying I hate what you  say, but you know, I'll defend your right to say it.  We see conservative  media, we see liberal media, we used to have some cool neutrality which was  required by the FCC.  Not anymore.  So, that's why we've seen the sort of - - we see now, we see Fox News, and we see MSNBC on the other side.  There's  not a lot that the president can do, and I think he calls it rigged when he  doesn't like what he's seeing, frankly.  </p><p>BENSON:  Jimmy, are you willing to criticize Google in light of your own  personal searches?</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>JIMMY FAILLA, COMEDIAN:  I was just going to say that.  I give him that  credit. </p><p>BOLTON:  Like prom jacket comes up sometimes.  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  This is going to come up on Google tomorrow.  </p><p>FAILLA:  But you might search this, that so much to the president's point.   I don't think anyone ever Googles the term \"Trump news.\"  You're never more  than three-inches from Trump news in the world that we're living right now.   But I think the reason he initiates this argument is not so much that he  plans on regulating, but that he calls attention to it because it casts him  in a sympathetic light.  It's another attempt to remind everybody that the  powers that be are aligned against him.  </p><p>BENSON:  Just briefly on the Facebook accusation for some of these  employees, is it bad business for these big tech companies to  overwhelmingly hire people from one political persuasion?  </p><p>BOLTON:  I actually was happy to hear of this one engineer who just said  like, OK, it's 0.5 percent of employee base at Facebook, they have 25,000  employees -- something like a hundred signed up for this diversity  committee.  I personally would rather have a company.  I think it is better  for business to have tons of different points of view.  And I think  interestingly enough, even the people on Facebook who signed up for this  diversity or political diversity opinion meeting even said we're not  conservative, we're just sick of all the liberal slant and just feeling  like we can't even hear a different point of view.  So, yes, I think the  best for business, open, open, open ideas, right?  That's where you get the  best creativity.  </p><p>BENSON:  All right.  So, next topic, there was a time when advertisers  hoped to read your mind, but nowadays they can just read your e-mails.  The  Wall Street Journal reporting that Yahoo! is scanning the e-mails from 200  million accounts to get information they can sell to advertisers.  The  report raises serious privacy questions but the tech company insists they  never scan personal messages -- yes, sure -- and only target commercial  products in an effort to deliver a more personalized advertising  experience, which is a nice way to put it.  </p><p>AOL also reportedly engaging in the same practice, but both companies quick  to point out consumers can opt out of the targeted ads by logging on to a  privacy dashboard that they launched in April.  So, it's hard to imagine  they're the only tech companies doing this, but they're definitely the only  ones admitting it -- at least now that they've been caught by The Wall  Street Journal.  Is Yahoo! up to no good or just no good at keeping  secrets?  Jimmy, when I saw this story, I just assumed this was already  happening because of my targeted ads.  I see this all the time, like isn't  everyone doing this?  </p><p>FAILLA:  Yes, we have this discussion earlier.  I mean, the biggest shock  to me was that people were still using Yahoo! and AOL.  I was more shocked  to hear that.  And to the point of who's still using it, because in a lot  of ways it's like the MySpace of e-mail.  The only people still on it are,  like, creeps, you know what I mean?  So, it's all going to be ads for how  to bury a body.  </p><p>BENSON:  I would point out, I'm not on this, but the woman who normally  sits here, from what I'm told, might be on one of those two platforms, so  watch it.  You work for her.  You work for her.</p><p>FAILLA:  I just outed her.  </p><p>BENSON:  Danielle, any points here for candor on behalf of Yahoo!, or  they're really just caught by newspaper and then they said, OK, fine.  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  No.  No points for -- you would think that (INAUDIBLE) after  the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica ought to debacle that maybe opting in to  something like this was a better idea for not only P.R. but just for the --  for consumer.  </p><p>BOLTON:  But they're defending it, actually, fairly funny, right?  They're  like, oh, it costs a lot of money to like keep these servers up and  running, and you would have to pay if we didn't sell ads.  I mean, in their  defense, I do not work for Yahoo! Obviously, do not give a hoot, but they  do say that they're not actually reading through your e-mail line by line.   What they're saying is if you -- of course not -- if you open a trader  account at T.D. Ameritrade, then when you log on, you will just see you're  known as an investor then.  </p><p>BENSON:  Here's the other thing, and this is just a devil's advocate point.   I'm generally on the privacy side of this, but like, in some ways, even  though they're creepy, targeted ads are sort of useful somehow.  Well,  actually, yes, I do want that.  </p><p>FAILLA:  You'd rather see an ad for that, but wouldn't it be great if this  is how we found Hillary's e-mails after all this time, it's a bunch of ads  for bleach bit and stuff like that?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BENSON:  All right.  Amazon finally having enough of Bernie Sanders  attacks.  In a rare move, they made a public response to the socialist  senator.  Sanders has spent months slamming both Amazon's working  conditions and pay, but the tech giant accused the Vermont senator of  spreading \"misleading statements and urged Sanders to visit one of the  company's fulfillment centers.\"  </p><p>Sanders shot back earlier today: \"Many Amazon employees who work for the  wealthiest person on earth are paid wages so low they can't make ends  meet.\"  He also threatened to call the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration to investigate \"unsafe working conditions in the company's  warehouses.\"  Keep in mind, President Trump has also been a vocal critic of  Amazon, but for very different reasons, who's going to win this war of  words?  </p><p>Danielle, I'll start with you, I understand that Bernie Sanders has a  problem with big successful businesses sometimes.  People are voluntarily  working for Amazon.  Amazon today said, hey, not only you, senator, come on  in, ask our employees.  Ask them what they're experience have been.  I  think that's a pretty good response, don't you?  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I do.  And I, of course, read Jeff Bezos' response, the  average wage for a full-time worker at Amazon is over $15.00 an hour, which  further than many states mandate.  They get great medical benefits, they  get maternity and paternity leave, they get stock.  The issue that came up  of this was people who have been part-time workers, people who had left  Amazon and had worked very long.  So, there are issues with corporate  wealthy, don't get me work.  If you're working full time, I don't think you  should be needing to get food stamps, there's a problem there, but I don't  think necessarily that Amazon is -- </p><p>BENSON:  Jimmy, part of me as a conservative, I want the send a bouquet of  flowers to people like Bernie Sanders who are attacking these companies  that Americans find super convenient.  Like Amazon and Uber, like keep  coming after things that make Americans' lives more affordable and more  convenient.  Keep doing it.  </p><p>FAILLA:  Yes, it's a dumb move.  I mean, I think the reason he hates Amazon  is because you can't make other people pay for your stuff on Amazon.  It  just kind of goes against his doctrine.  But I think to the point of what  they're paying people and how they're offering us an effective and  efficient service, I think this is one of those errands where the effort to  demonize everything you come across in this age we live in brings you into  a lot of dark alleys.  And you know, Bernie Sanders, like a lot of people  who live in a $2 million home, is a man of the people who has several $2  million homes.  He is the mand of people, but I think he's being a man of  the wrong people on this one -- to Guy's -- </p><p>BOLTON:  Or a limousine liberal.  </p><p>BENSON:  Deirdre, if you're Amazon and Bezos, you're like I'm getting it  from Bernie, I'm getting it from Trump, what is going on here?  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes, but at least I have $155 billion -- </p><p>BENSON:  That's right, he can take the slings and arrows.  </p><p>BOLTON:  I think he can.  Listen, he is a legendary business leader, he's  the pioneer.  Jeff Bezos, I'm sure, is used to being criticized.  I am sure  he can handle it.  I thought the response was great.  Although I do think  it's notable -- usually he ignores, you know, 99 percent of the arrows that  come his way.  Apparently, he did feel like this one was worth responding  to but that was the right response.  </p><p>OK, ask our employees, come to a fulfillment center, see what it's like.   And I think to your point, the criticism has been more on people who are  not full-time employees.  I've actually been to one of those fulfillment  centers, and it's true, there's a lot of teachers or people who are trying  to get other hours doing other things, and perhaps they're treated  differently.  </p><p>BENSON:  On their own according, which is how a market works.  All right.   Panel, stick around.  Coming up, President Trump amping up his war on the  media, this time attacking the use of anonymous sources again.  Journalists  are swinging back, but does the president maybe have a point?  The panel  debates that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BENSON:  President Trump taking aim at one of his favorite targets today,  blasting CNN after the network stood by a recent report about the infamous  2016 Trump Tower meeting even after it was at least partially discredited  by their own source, Attorney Lanny Davis.  The president tweeted:  \"Anonymous sources are really starting to burn the media.  The fact that  that many anonymous sources don't even exist, that's the fact,\" he said,  \"they are fiction made up by fake news reporters.  Look at the lie that  fake CNN is caught in now?  They got caught red-handed, enemy of the  people!\"  He also tweeted: \"When you see anonymous source, stop reading the  story, it is fiction.\"  </p><p>Now, several members of the media are firing back noting that the president  himself has acted as his own anonymous source in the past about himself and  saying that officials in Trump's White House actually often prohibit  reporters from naming them in stories.  Back to help me separate fact from  fiction, our panel, Deirdre, Jimmy, and Danielle.  All right, so Danielle,  it seems to me like sometimes the president's righteous indignation over  things are sort of situational based on what he needs and how he's feeling  in the moment.  And I kind of have this sneaking suspicion that the next  time there's a news report with anonymous sources saying good things about  him or things that are helpful to him, maybe he'll share that story widely.   Right?  Am I wrong?  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I'm picking up what you're putting down.  I think that's true.   You know, this is a man who was known around New York City for decades as  being his own anonymous source, launching stories that were good and were  good for him related to his dating life and also some other stuff.  These  people often won't tell their stories unless they're given anonymity, and  we've seen instances in history.  You think about deep throat, we would  never have known about Watergate in some aspects, if we hadn't had people  who are willing to come forward but didn't want to be the identified.  </p><p>BENSON:  Jimmy, when you serve as your own anonymous source --</p><p>FAILLA:  Which happens a lot.</p><p>BENSON:  -- about you, do you change your accent?  Like, how do you pull  that off?</p><p>FAILLA:  I do have a voice filter option, you know, on the iPhone, which I  don't want to give away my trade secrets here.  And these are brilliant  move by Trump, because everybody sees through it, but he's strategically  picking a fight with the media because a they're the one people that people  hate more than him.  You know, he has very low approval ratings, but people  hate the media.  This is like, if a band were to pick a fight with  nickelback, you're always going to come off looking good in the exchange  because no one's going to choose nickelback over you.  And to his point,  the media with all the critics he's levied on the media, he could never  discredit them as much as they have discredited themselves.  They've been  terrible, and it should be said.  </p><p>BENSON:  In some cases, not all cases.  A little bit more of a serious  question.  Deirdre, for you, about journalism, is going after the concept  of anonymous sources and actually more of an undermining of journalism than  yelling fake news or having a crowd boo at reporters if trying to tell the  American people that all anonymous sources are fake, that to me seems like  a more serious implication about journalism.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  I actually hadn't thought of it that way, but I agree with  you.  And going back to what you were saying, I mean, there are tons of  people who are willing to speak on backgrounds but certainly do not want to  be quoted.  And there would be a lot of mis-stories.  No, I agree, that is  a big part of our pipeline, right?  At least it lets you know, like, in the  best of the journalism senses, at least it lets you know what to chase.  </p><p>BENSON:  Right.  Yes, I think the problem that you run into especially if  you're CNN in this case, is when you protect one of your anonymous sources  who then tells you -- actually tells America I was the anonymous source,  and I'm changing my story, and you just stand by the original reporting.  </p><p>FAILLA:  Not the best look.  </p><p>BENSON:  Not the best.  That's -- we're talking about it last night on this  show, that's where Trump, I think, is just like ramping up and go straight  after CNN, because they're creating their own problem.  All right, panel,  this was great, thank you so much.  All right.  We'll be right back.   \"TOPICAL STORM\" is coming up next.  It's a good one, my first shot at it.   We'll see how it goes. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BENSON:  A new study found that people who eat large quantities of meat and  cheese will live longer than people who don't.  Yes!  The study was  conducted by the University of Arby's -- they have the meats with special  help from the Five Guys Institute.  That is a complete delicious sham, and  this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\"  </p><p>Topic one.  We begin tonight at the go Bananas Family Fun Center where you  can't beat the prices, but you can beat fellow customers.  According to  their Web site, go Bananas is the finest family amusement center in the  entire Chicago-land area.  Kids just love their interactive games -- like  pin the tail on the fistfight and duck, duck flying garbage can.  This  brawl reportedly breaking out after two parents got into a disagreement, at  which point police were called because you can't just go around hitting  people you disagree with, unless you're Antifa.  In which case, some people  at CNN might actually defend you.  We are happy to report that nobody was  injured or hurt during that arcade ambush, although four parents were  arrested.  The judge in the case have set their bail at 5,000 tickets.  </p><p>Topic two.  No fistfights at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado last  night which is amazing because one guest was truly behaving like an animal.   The Stanley Hotel became famous for inspiring Steven King's classic \"The  Shining.\"  They don't normally get a lot of bears at the Stanley, what with  the Wi-Fi and lack of gluten free menu options, which outrageous in 2018,  good Lord.  But this fella decided to stop by for some R&amp;R because all work  and no play makes Jack a dull boy -- and that's a shining reference, by the  way, for those of you who might be under the age of 40, like me.  Although  I have seen the film when I was younger.  I was absolutely terrified,  despite telling my friends that I was definitely not terrified.  Speaking  of, \"The Shining\" was recently voted the greatest horror movie of all time,  in a recent survey.  Coming in second was the Clinton campaign.  Got her  again.  Yes!  </p><p>Topic three.  A Massachusetts golfer has been telling friends for weeks  that a fox is stealing his balls off the course.  Yes, right, no one  believed him until one day he learned how to record the Fox after reading  Omarosa's book.  This video is so crazy that when they showed it on the  golf channel, it literally woke up nearly half of their audience.  That is  not a therapy animal, that is a ball-stealing fox.  And the man feels  vindicated because it turns out, the only person making up stories this  week was Lanny Davis.  His video is being called a sign of the times in the  golf world because years ago golfers were worried about a tiger on the  course.  Nowadays, it's foxes.  Tigers are too busy chasing Perkins'  waitresses around to ruin your golf game.  Also, unlike Democrats, that guy  actually has a legit point when he blames his problems fox.  </p><p>Topic four, a new hot dog stand opened up in Times Square yesterday, and  the good news is, they were absolutely swarmed.  The bad news?  This is a  nightmare.  Absolute nightmare.  They were swarmed by 30,000 bees who cut  the line.  Probably not going to improve their Yelp reviews.  Police still  aren't sure why the bees came to Times Square, they're actually still  trying to figure out why any humans would go to Times Square.  I mean,  other than to get groped by someone in an Elmo costume.  But besides that,  I can't think of a good reason to show up to that general locale not too  far from right here where I sit.  The NYPD was forced to bring in a  beekeeper to vacuum up the bees.  And despite record-breaking temperatures,  he wasn't taking any chances, so he put on a hazmat suit -- yes because of  the bees, but mostly because of the ingredients in a New York City hot dog.   The bees reportedly charged tourists $10.00 a pop for photos and enforced  the price aggressively.  </p><p>Topic five.  Finally, tonight, a Montana man had his methamphetamine  conviction overturned after, get this, the expert witness the state used  against him was caught using -- drum roll -- methamphetamines during his  testimony.  I think I speak for everyone, by the way, that I'm shocked this  story didn't take place in Florida.  James Bochelle -- I mean, winner right  there, like the rat tail -- allegedly caught with a glass pipe and several  bags of meth back in 2017.  Convicted two days later, but the analyst who  handled the evidence recently admitted to taking the leftover meth home  from the crime lab and even showing up to court high.  </p><p>In fact, police say he was so high, he claimed Michael Avenatti could  actually win the presidency.  Although I'm not so sure that's crazy  anymore, am I high?  Kennedy is screaming at her television right now, yes!   Because she's totally watching her own show on vacation.  No.  The analyst  has been fired from his job, as expected, and Bochelle is going to get his  own trial, a redo here, coming up later this fall -- just in time for  pumpkin spice meth to come out which is extra delicious but a little higher  in calories.  That's the \"TOPICAL STORM.\"  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BENSON:  That's our show, you guys.  Three down, one to go for me.  The  lady returns next week.  You can catch me on radio, by the way, \"BENSON AND  HARF,\" Fox News Radio, weeknights 6-8 p.m. Eastern, Bensonandharf.com.   Tomorrow right here, we have Shannon Bream, Chris Stirewalt, Rachel Campos- Duffy.  Look at that line up.  I'm Guy Benson, in for Kennedy, and tonight  we'll leave you with a live look at Phoenix where Senator John McCain lies  in state.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A babe who photographed babies...  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She would get them to do the craziest things.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  ...becomes a celebrity herself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Trumpism versus socialism and it's playing out before our very eyes in Florida's gubernatorial contest. Who will come out on top? I'm guy Benson in for Kennedy tonight. Last night, Republican <person><nameText>Congressman Ron DeSantis </nameText></person>won his primary and will now go up against the surprise Democratic winner, Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the race is way bigger than just Florida. It's actually in some ways a microcosm of the larger political battle raging across the nation. Here's why. DeSantis is a big supporter of <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and vice versa. Gillum is backed by Vermont socialist <person><nameText>Senator Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person>and the winner of this race might foreshadow what's to come in 2020. Last night, DeSantis claimed his opponent's policies will destroy Florida's economy. Watch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>RON DESANTIS (R</nameText></person>), FLORIDA: He is the most liberal candidate that the Democratic Party has ever nominated in the State of Florida by a country mile in a governor's race. He wants to abolish ICE, he wants a billion dollar tax increase, he wants a single-payer healthcare system in Florida which would bankrupt the state. I'm trying to make Florida even better. He wants to make FloridaVenezuela.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENSON: Make Florida Venezuela again, that could go on a baseball cap. But Gillum claims that raising corporate taxes could actually attract new businesses. Hmm.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW GILLUM, MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE: What we have proposed is an increase in the corporate tax rate which in the State of Florida is lower than our neighboring States of Alabama and Georgia. Right now we're at 5-1/4 and we've suggested going up to just over seven which puts us in line with many other states and part of what -- it creates a billion dollars in funding for our public education system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENSON: OK. So what are the takeaways from last night and what does it mean going forward? Joining me now, former special assistant to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and former press secretary to Vice President <person><nameText>Mike Pence, </nameText></person>Mark Lotter is here. And also here with me in New York, co-host of \"THE FIVE,\" Juan Williams. Gentlemen, welcome.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>POLITICAL ANALYST: Good evening.</p><p>MARK LOTTER, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY TO VICE PRESIDENT <person><nameText>MIKE PENCE</nameText></person>: Good to be here.</p><p>BENSON: Mark, I'll start with you. Another major endorsement victory for <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>dare we call this a winning streak?</p><p>LOTTER: I think so, and it's pretty clear when you see that <person><nameText>Ron DeSantis </nameText></person>was down by big double digits and after that endorsement he won by over -- by close to 20 points. So, big win for <person><nameText>Ron DeSantis </nameText></person>and I would say it's a big win for Florida because they've had a really good thing going in the last 20 years under Republican leadership. Not sure they're ready to turn their backs on that and embrace socialism.</p><p>BENSON: Juan, I'm actually fascinated by the dynamics of this race. We talked about a little bit of the top. It's almost a laboratory pure test of MAGA versus feel the burn here in the swingiest state in the country. How do you feel like this is going to shape up with these two candidates that frankly the other party will argue is unelectable?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, in fact, one of the arguments today I was hearing from political people is either side got the candidate they want to run against.</p><p>BENSON: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And so here you have a situation where the question is the label socialist. So the Republican, the Trumpian, DeSantis, says my opponent is a socialist. And, in fact, we recently had a poll that you may have seen where most Democrats said they're fine with socialism.</p><p>BENSON: I mean, he won the primary.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Correct. But the question is this, is he a socialist? I don't think he accepts that label. He's not, certainly, about having the government takeover the means of production. We live in an age where there are lots of people -- we had a poll this week that found, I think, it's 40 percent of Americans said they had a hard time meeting bills for food, for housing and healthcare.</p><p>In an era of high-income inequality, is it socialist to say I believe in a social safety net that protects people from falling to the bottom?</p><p>BENSON: All right. Well, Mark, let's get your response to that because we can debate whether or not he's a socialist or a Democratic socialist, but as you heard from <person><nameText>Ron DeSantis </nameText></person>in that clip we just played, his opponent does support socialist healthcare. He wants to socialize healthcare in the state, abolish ICE. It's a pretty far-left agenda especially in a state like Florida which is kind of down the middle.</p><p>LOTTER: And you're absolutely right. And let's remember that he won that primary last night with only one-third of a very large Democratic vote. So two out of three Democratic voters said no. How is he going to convince them that his far-left policies, which are farther left than more even moderate, middle Democrats in Florida, that's a pretty extreme program he's embracing. We've got a lot of support, a lot of enthusiasm on the Republican side.</p><p>I think he's going to have a lot of work to do, especially in that I-4 corridor, trying to make moderate people embrace his very liberal, very progressive ideas.</p><p>BENSON: All right. So Juan, how does he do that? If you were recommending things to Andrew Gillum as he looks toward November at this point, he's won the primary, he checked the box. <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>really helped him obviously. Does he campaign with Bernie? Does he remain a Bernie Democrat or does he start to sort of inch toward the center? And how can he do that?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, I think the key in all races right now, and I think you're going to see this across the country specifically in Georgia which also has a Democrat black woman running, Stacey Abrams running against a Trumpian, <person><nameText>Brian Kemp, </nameText></person>I think what you're going to see is they're saying we're going to talk about the issues from the Democratic perspective.</p><p>And the issue will be -- and this is what Gillum did in his race against other Democrats, say I'm the only non-millionaire in the race. I'm the one that really can identify --</p><p>BENSON: That's not an issue. That's not an issue.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, it is. Because you want to say in a time of income inequality I relate to you, struggling people, who are out there working hard and having a hard time paying for your kids to go to college, college tuition. I'm the ones who can relate when a big medical bill comes in how threatened you are and how it throws off your budget. And I think that's what he's going to do.</p><p>It's not going to, you know, so I think Republicans may say, oh, sounds like socialism, but you know what? I wonder if voters instead will respond this is someone who shares my needs and understands my predicament.</p><p>LOTTER: But I'll tell you one thing in that response to Juan is all of those people who have jobs, who are looking for jobs, they're going to have small businesses, big business owners saying, well, because Gillum supports a $15.00 minimum wage, because he's raising taxes on our companies 40 percent, we are not going to be able to give you a race. We're not going to be able to hire you.</p><p>Well, we're going to fire you and replace you with a computer because it's costing us too much. That is a very powerful driver and you can bet the Chambers of Commerce and business groups are all going to be out there rallying people to stop the tax increase.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, Mark, you've got to hear from the teachers, you've got to hear from people who feel as if they're underpaid in terms of government. You've got to hear from the minority groups, larger and larger especially along that I-94 corridor that you mentioned, referenced earlier. These are people who are quite excited by Gillum. The question is, because I think the Republican base is excited by Trump and DeSantis.</p><p>The question is once you get beyond these two polarized bases, what does the middle think? What does the suburban house way?</p><p>BENSON: Yes. That's going to be, I think, one of the most fascinating races in the country. We'll watch it very closely. Mark, Juan, thank you both.</p><p>LOTTER: You're welcome.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Thanks.</p><p>BENSON: One thing is for sure under the economy that has been engineered by DeSantis' coach, <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>things are booming. Just today the government reported the U.S. economy grew 4.2 percent in the last quarter which is higher than previously estimate and the best quarter since 2014. A stronger economy has Americans more comfortable with their jobs as well.</p><p>A new report today claiming just over half of Americans, 51 percent say they're satisfied with their jobs, the highest level since 2005. Plus, consumer confidence also at an 18-year high. So while a lot of people love to hate this President, are his policies at least being vindicated? <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Contributor and chief investment officer of Kingsview Asset Management, Scott Martin is here with me now.</p><p>Scott, thanks for swinging by from Chicago, my former hometown. Go, Cubs.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: Yes. I mean, no problem. And sorry about all the heat we sent you, but I'm not telling you, I'm not missing it, man. So enjoy.</p><p>BENSON: Chicago -- people talk about Chicago winners but Chicago summers can be absolutely brutal. So Scott, I want to talk about these economic numbers today. The job security and job satisfaction statistics, I thought were interesting. We don't always hear about that metric. Why is it important?</p><p>MARTIN: Well, it says a lot of things. It says that employers are treating or their employees right for maybe the first time in several years via benefits, obviously 401(k) benefits are doing very well, we've seen those balances, Guy, at record highs. And job quality too. You know, I think with technology and things that are going on in the work force, Guy, I think people are happier in their jobs because they're doing more stuff in technology.</p><p>Maybe it's making their jobs easier. And then on the flipside too, you know, the employers are happy about that because companies are making more money, we have record profits, and you're seeing that show up in the data points.</p><p>BENSON: So I want to talk about a dichotomy here that is a little bit puzzling to me, because I can rattle off all the incredible numbers about the economy, unemployment, GDP growth, consumer confidence, the list goes on. We actually talked about a few of them just a moment ago and yet in our most recent <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>poll, only 47 percent of Americans rank the U.S. economy right now as excellent or good.</p><p>With the other half saying only fair or poor. So objectively, the economy is in great shape, but the American people are polarized about whether it's really all that great. Why?</p><p>MARTIN: Yes. It's kind of weird, you know? It could be the media that they're ingesting, certainly, that's telling them those things. Or you could have just made it to, you know, the right haters on the street as far as that poll goes because to me, I've got to tell you, I mean, looking at those data points you mentioned, Guy, with the economy now growing at 4.2 percent, the best in several years.</p><p>Consumer confidence at highs that we haven't seen since I was prom king, business confidence as well --</p><p>BENSON: Were you really?</p><p>MARTIN: Very high. No. You know, when I came in second, and it was totally fixed --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BENSON: So that was fake news. I just called you out in fake news.</p><p>MARTIN: It was totally -- it was totally fixed man. The guy paid people off to vote for him. But either way, I should have been. And then secondly, listen like look at -- look at business confidence numbers. Now what we're seeing, Guy, that we haven't seen for many, many years because businesses weren't confident enough in the future, they're actually doing capital expenditures, research and development, investing in their employees.</p><p>Things that companies weren't doing a couple years ago because they were worried about the future, they were worried about regulations and taxes. All of that spending is now getting unlocked. So, I think those people you interviewed eventually are going to turn tail because they're just going to have to realize that the economy is better than they think.</p><p>BENSON: What do you make of this debate over whether we're on a sugar high right now and everything is great for the moment but it's going to go away, or is this unsustainable, is it sustainable to sort of this back and forth among economists and politicians. Where do you come down on that?</p><p>MARTIN: Yes. You know, I'm close to the sugar high camp. Not yet, but I will tell you that, you know, the way the markets are and the way that they've just been going up and up and up on almost seemingly bad news these days and, yes, we've had some good trade reconciliation news which does support the S&amp;P 500, it will push up stock prices. But the reality is this, things are getting very good.</p><p>So if you just look back in history and look back at cycles, you know, things in the markets and economy occur, and cycles just like seasons of the year do, as you mentioned how hot it is in Chicago, it gets cold in Chicago as well just like it will on the East Coast. So, just remember that if you're investing for today, there is going to be a rainy day in the stock market, so as greatest things could be today, you've just got to have some things in your portfolio that will do well if the markets go down.</p><p>BENSON: Cyclical, I buy that, but how long is the cycle? That's such a huge question. When might we start to look for some potential downturn signs?</p><p>MARTIN: Yes. I'll tell you, man. I mean, things are going to change if the midterms go the wrong way. Let's say depending on who you're voting for, obviously that's a subjective comment.</p><p>BENSON: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: But if things go a bad way in November, that could be the start of it, Guy. And in 2020, let's face it, man, it's not that far away, so that's another twist that could be happening in the pipe here.</p><p>BENSON: Don't remind me. All right. Scott, thank you so much tonight. And stay cool in Chicago for now.</p><p>MARTIN: See you.</p><p>BENSON: On a more somber note tonight, thousands of mourners paying their respects today in honoring the life of war hero and longtime Senator <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>who served his country for more than 60 years. Take a look there. A live look inside the Arizona State Capitol where the body of <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>is lying in state.</p><p>Earlier today a police escort accompanied McCain's body to the Capitol as scores of military veterans, law enforcement, fire and first responders lined the sides of Capitol Plaza for the procession is. <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>correspondent William La Jeunesse is with us Phoenix with more. William?</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: Well, Guy, it's about 106 degrees here, and it has been all day. And here is the amazing thing, the line that you see here, it snakes another quarter mile around the corner here. It's been that way uninterrupted for about four hours all for the chance to spend 20 or 30 seconds next to the casket of <person><nameText>John McCain, </nameText></person>just enough to say goodbye.</p><p>But, you know, many don't know <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>planned these services. He personally reached out to the pallbearers and the ushers and the people who speak tomorrow to celebrate his life on what would have been his 82nd birthday. Now, there -- today was as you said, more solemn than celebration. Cindy and her two sons met the casket along with Governor Doug Ducey and his wife.</p><p>The casket will lie here until tomorrow morning in a motorcade to North Phoenix Baptist Church. Senator Jon Kyl who served with McCain said there was a debate on the floor of Congress he jointed, if there wasn't, McCain would start one. The country he said will miss his fight and his voice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JON KYL, FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR: John's love for America and Arizona. He represented our values all over the world as Senator from Arizona. And America is stronger for his fierce defense of our values. We can be proud he was our Senator.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Now, it was an emotional service with Cindy laying her head on the coffin, daughter Meghan openly crying, follow by McCain's sons, Governor Ducey recalled McCain's years in Vietnam fighting for his country down for the state he represented for 36 years.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KYL: When <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>called upon us to serve a purpose greater than one's own self-interest, it wasn't a talking point designed to win the next election. It was how he had actually lived his life and continued to live his life. That's how he wanted us to live ours.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Even though McCain is gone, he is still sending a message of inclusivity and bipartisanship. Those speaking tomorrow include Democrats Joe Biden, the ushers and pallbearers are a mixed of -- well, a Hispanic woman, a native American, cardinal Larry Fitzgerald, ex-Diamondback Luis Gonzalez and in Washington many will come from across the aisle, Guy. As I said today, 106 degrees. That building was built in 1901.</p><p>It's very thick wall, it's going to remain kind of cool. But the people I spoke to said they came for several reasons. Obviously, his sacrifice in Vietnam. Some native Americans coming from five, six hours away on the Naval Reservation because of what he did for the tribes and Indian gaming, allowing that, pushing that legislation through. And then of course many just said, listen, he was there for us, it is our turn to be there for him and their chance to say goodbye. Back to you.</p><p>BENSON: William, thank you for that report. Moving day in Arizona. Coming up, back in D.C.<person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>attacking Hillary Clinton after a new report suggest China was able to hack into her e-mail server. Remember that one? But did it actually happen? Plus, another White House departure, White House Counsel Don McGahn leaving his post this fall. What does that mean for the President's legal team? Jason Chaffetz joins me after the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENSON: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>calling for a new investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. Earlier today the President tweeting, \"Hillary Clinton's e-mails, many of which are classified information, got hacked by China. Next move better be by the FBI and DOJ or after all of their other missteps, Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page or FISA dirty dossier et cetera, their credibility will be gone forever.</p><p>The President seemed to be referencing a Daily Caller report that cited anonymous sources in the intelligence community. The FBI later countering that, \"the FBI has not found any evidence that the servers were compromised.\" The Chinese Foreign Ministry for their part also denying the report, LOL, of course they would, but is the President right to call out the intelligence community as potentially compromised?</p><p>Joining me now, former Utah Congressman and <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Contributor Jason Chaffetz. Jason, it's great to see you. You also have a forthcoming book, The Deep State, we're happy to have you here.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR: Well, thank you, I appreciate it. I look forward to the book coming out, and thanks for having me on.</p><p>BENSON: All right. So let's start with this Daily Caller report, what we saw form the President and his tweets and the FBI denying it, right? Denying this whole suggestion or report that China hacked into Hillary Clinton's bootleg basement e-mail server. I'm reminded, everyone from Robert Gates to Jim Comey to Mike Morrell said the chances were high that a hostile foreign power did get into that unsecure server.</p><p>You paid very close attention to this while you were in Congress, what do you think the truth is here?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Oh, I think it's highly probable and most likely that it did happen. We heard testimony from the inspect general, Michael Horowitz, that they did believe that there was an intrusion on this computer. When I was the chairman of the oversight committee, we heard testimony from the person who set up the server, did not have a degree in computer science, had never taken a computer course.</p><p>It literally kind of, you know, went down to Best Buy and then set it up in the basement there. I mean, literally, that's how sloppily this was done. We never did get testimony from the secret service, you would think they would take some ownership given that within former President Clinton's home, but nevertheless it's -- I can't imagine that, A, she wasn't targeted. Of course she was. She was Secretary of State.</p><p>And then even as former Secretary of State, she was presidential candidate most likely at that point. And it's almost impossible to think that even some guy down by the river in a van could have done this probably. It's not a local 17-year-old, your local high schooler.</p><p>BENSON: Meantime, Jason, yesterday on Capitol Hill we saw Bruce Ohr arriving for closed-door testimony before some committees. You were, as you just referenced, the chairman of the Oversight Committee in the house. If you had been in that private session, what would have been some of the questions you were eager to ask Bruce Ohr?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, what you want to do is play off what the FBI was telling you officially, because they have been fishy, at best, in provide documents, they have been hiding the ball for a long time and it ends up that more and more what Congressional investigators are finding out is what they weren't told even under oath is turning out not to be true. Particularly as it relates to this dossier, the funding of it.</p><p>The only evidence that we see of true collusion when money is changing hands is between Russians, the Democratic National Committee, a guy named Mark Elias. That name is out in the media, but it's going to be the center of the universe for so many of these things. And Bruce Ohr talking about how his wife Nelly is involved and engaged in this. I mean, it's a nefarious, salacious situation and yet no attention, but little to no attention by the FBI itself.</p><p>BENSON: All right, Jason. One more question here. The report today confirmed by the President, Don McGahn on his way out as White House Counsel. What's the effect at the White House? What do you make of that?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, I don't know who filled those big shoes. I think Don McGahn has been a trusted adviser, close to the President, a superb job in the judicial nominees and selections certainly with the Supreme Court but also at the district court level and whatnot. There's no heir apparent that I'm aware of. And, you know, general counsel to the President of the United States is a very big role to fill. Especially in this White House.</p><p>BENSON: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: And so, he will be deeply missed. I don't know who steps up and fills that but it is of critical importance.</p><p>BENSON: Jason Chaffetz, thank you for your time. And good luck with the book.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thanks, Guy.</p><p>BENSON: Sure thing. Coming up. Should the government be able to regulate search engine results from Google? We'll tell you why <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>seems to think so. Plus, a senior Facebook engineer speaking out claiming the company is biased against conservatives. The panel joins me next to discuss.</p><p>BENSON: Some new controversies today the involving major internet company that many of us use every single day, Facebook, Google, Yahoo! and Amazon. Let's start with Google and Facebook. Each of which are now mired in separate claims of bias against conservatives. Yesterday <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>tweeted, \"Google search results for Trump news shows only the viewing reporting of fake news media.</p><p>In order, they have rigged it for me and others so that almost all stories and news is bad. Fake CNN is prominent, Republican conservative and fair media is shut out. Illegal? 96 percent of results on Trump news are from national left-wing media, very dangerous. Google and others are suppressing voices of conservatives and is hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can and cannot see.</p><p>This is a very serious situation. Will be addressed.\" Google responded saying there's no bias in search results. Over at Facebook, meanwhile, dozens of employees have reportedly united to challenge what they say is a left-swing culture at the social media giant. They're claiming conservative staffers shunned, marginalized and even harassed. So is the bias real, and what can or should be done about any of it if anything?</p><p>Let's go to the panel tonight. FBN's Deirdre Bolton is here, Jimmy Failla and Democratic strategist and attorney, Danielle McLaughlin. Hello, everyone.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BENSON: Thanks for being here. All right. So, Deirdre, let's start with Google and the President maybe suggesting that some regulation might be coming down the pike. As we think about regulation from the federal government, looking at Google, private company but arguably sort of a public utility because they're a gateway to internet searches. How do you strike that balance?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Well, we've heard the president criticized Google, right, as he has. We've also heard him say it's one of our greatest companies, and we know that there is this Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on September 5th. So, we have to assume that some of this is a little bit of grandstanding. And as you say, I mean, this is a publicly-traded company from a legal perspective, which I'm sure Danielle will help us out on.</p><p>I actually don't know what the government really can do even if they decided in some weird way to try to somehow restrict. I don't know, you would have freedom of speech infractions. I mean, you have a lot of problems if the government tries to outright regulate Google. And by the way, the president has also complained, right, about Facebook, and perhaps right so, also complained about Twitter --</p><p>BENSON: Lots of complaining.</p><p>BOLTON: So, I just think -- as we know, he tends to be very pure in whatever sentiments he is feeling at that particular moment.</p><p>BENSON: All right. So, Danielle, let's just say hypothetically, Google's denying any of this for the moment. But hypothetically, if Google was tweaking its formulas to promote an agenda or suppress some search results, would that be a problem?</p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Constitutionally, no. I mean, the freedom of speech that we have, and corporations have freedom of speech as well, which we can decide whether that's a good thing or not, they have a lot of rights, protects us, protects corporations against government. So, it gives the freedom -- you know, what's the saying I hate what you say, but you know, I'll defend your right to say it. We see conservative media, we see liberal media, we used to have some cool neutrality which was required by the FCC. Not anymore. So, that's why we've seen the sort of - - we see now, we see <person><nameText>Fox News, </nameText></person>and we see MSNBC on the other side. There's not a lot that the president can do, and I think he calls it rigged when he doesn't like what he's seeing, frankly.</p><p>BENSON: Jimmy, are you willing to criticize Google in light of your own personal searches?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JIMMY FAILLA, COMEDIAN: I was just going to say that. I give him that credit.</p><p>BOLTON: Like prom jacket comes up sometimes.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: This is going to come up on Google tomorrow.</p><p>FAILLA: But you might search this, that so much to the president's point. I don't think anyone ever Googles the term \"Trump news.\" You're never more than three-inches from Trump news in the world that we're living right now. But I think the reason he initiates this argument is not so much that he plans on regulating, but that he calls attention to it because it casts him in a sympathetic light. It's another attempt to remind everybody that the powers that be are aligned against him.</p><p>BENSON: Just briefly on the Facebook accusation for some of these employees, is it bad business for these big tech companies to overwhelmingly hire people from one political persuasion?</p><p>BOLTON: I actually was happy to hear of this one engineer who just said like, OK, it's 0.5 percent of employee base at Facebook, they have 25,000 employees -- something like a hundred signed up for this diversity committee. I personally would rather have a company. I think it is better for business to have tons of different points of view. And I think interestingly enough, even the people on Facebook who signed up for this diversity or political diversity opinion meeting even said we're not conservative, we're just sick of all the liberal slant and just feeling like we can't even hear a different point of view. So, yes, I think the best for business, open, open, open ideas, right? That's where you get the best creativity.</p><p>BENSON: All right. So, next topic, there was a time when advertisers hoped to read your mind, but nowadays they can just read your e-mails. The Wall Street Journal reporting that Yahoo! is scanning the e-mails from 200 million accounts to get information they can sell to advertisers. The report raises serious privacy questions but the tech company insists they never scan personal messages -- yes, sure -- and only target commercial products in an effort to deliver a more personalized advertising experience, which is a nice way to put it.</p><p>AOL also reportedly engaging in the same practice, but both companies quick to point out consumers can opt out of the targeted ads by logging on to a privacy dashboard that they launched in April. So, it's hard to imagine they're the only tech companies doing this, but they're definitely the only ones admitting it -- at least now that they've been caught by The Wall Street Journal. Is Yahoo! up to no good or just no good at keeping secrets? Jimmy, when I saw this story, I just assumed this was already happening because of my targeted ads. I see this all the time, like isn't everyone doing this?</p><p>FAILLA: Yes, we have this discussion earlier. I mean, the biggest shock to me was that people were still using Yahoo! and AOL. I was more shocked to hear that. And to the point of who's still using it, because in a lot of ways it's like the MySpace of e-mail. The only people still on it are, like, creeps, you know what I mean? So, it's all going to be ads for how to bury a body.</p><p>BENSON: I would point out, I'm not on this, but the woman who normally sits here, from what I'm told, might be on one of those two platforms, so watch it. You work for her. You work for her.</p><p>FAILLA: I just outed her.</p><p>BENSON: Danielle, any points here for candor on behalf of Yahoo!, or they're really just caught by newspaper and then they said, OK, fine.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: No. No points for -- you would think that (INAUDIBLE) after the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica ought to debacle that maybe opting in to something like this was a better idea for not only P.R. but just for the -- for consumer.</p><p>BOLTON: But they're defending it, actually, fairly funny, right? They're like, oh, it costs a lot of money to like keep these servers up and running, and you would have to pay if we didn't sell ads. I mean, in their defense, I do not work for Yahoo! Obviously, do not give a hoot, but they do say that they're not actually reading through your e-mail line by line. What they're saying is if you -- of course not -- if you open a trader account at T.D. Ameritrade, then when you log on, you will just see you're known as an investor then.</p><p>BENSON: Here's the other thing, and this is just a devil's advocate point. I'm generally on the privacy side of this, but like, in some ways, even though they're creepy, targeted ads are sort of useful somehow. Well, actually, yes, I do want that.</p><p>FAILLA: You'd rather see an ad for that, but wouldn't it be great if this is how we found Hillary's e-mails after all this time, it's a bunch of ads for bleach bit and stuff like that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BENSON: All right. Amazon finally having enough of <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>attacks. In a rare move, they made a public response to the socialist senator. Sanders has spent months slamming both Amazon's working conditions and pay, but the tech giant accused the Vermont senator of spreading \"misleading statements and urged Sanders to visit one of the company's fulfillment centers.\"</p><p>Sanders shot back earlier today: \"Many Amazon employees who work for the wealthiest person on earth are paid wages so low they can't make ends meet.\" He also threatened to call the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to investigate \"unsafe working conditions in the company's warehouses.\" Keep in mind, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has also been a vocal critic of Amazon, but for very different reasons, who's going to win this war of words?</p><p>Danielle, I'll start with you, I understand that <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>has a problem with big successful businesses sometimes. People are voluntarily working for Amazon. Amazon today said, hey, not only you, senator, come on in, ask our employees. Ask them what they're experience have been. I think that's a pretty good response, don't you?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: I do. And I, of course, read Jeff Bezos' response, the average wage for a full-time worker at Amazon is over $15.00 an hour, which further than many states mandate. They get great medical benefits, they get maternity and paternity leave, they get stock. The issue that came up of this was people who have been part-time workers, people who had left Amazon and had worked very long. So, there are issues with corporate wealthy, don't get me work. If you're working full time, I don't think you should be needing to get food stamps, there's a problem there, but I don't think necessarily that Amazon is --</p><p>BENSON: Jimmy, part of me as a conservative, I want the send a bouquet of flowers to people like <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>who are attacking these companies that Americans find super convenient. Like Amazon and Uber, like keep coming after things that make Americans' lives more affordable and more convenient. Keep doing it.</p><p>FAILLA: Yes, it's a dumb move. I mean, I think the reason he hates Amazon is because you can't make other people pay for your stuff on Amazon. It just kind of goes against his doctrine. But I think to the point of what they're paying people and how they're offering us an effective and efficient service, I think this is one of those errands where the effort to demonize everything you come across in this age we live in brings you into a lot of dark alleys. And you know, <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person>like a lot of people who live in a $2 million home, is a man of the people who has several $2 million homes. He is the mand of people, but I think he's being a man of the wrong people on this one -- to Guy's --</p><p>BOLTON: Or a limousine liberal.</p><p>BENSON: Deirdre, if you're Amazon and Bezos, you're like I'm getting it from Bernie, I'm getting it from Trump, what is going on here?</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, but at least I have $155 billion --</p><p>BENSON: That's right, he can take the slings and arrows.</p><p>BOLTON: I think he can. Listen, he is a legendary business leader, he's the pioneer. Jeff Bezos, I'm sure, is used to being criticized. I am sure he can handle it. I thought the response was great. Although I do think it's notable -- usually he ignores, you know, 99 percent of the arrows that come his way. Apparently, he did feel like this one was worth responding to but that was the right response.</p><p>OK, ask our employees, come to a fulfillment center, see what it's like. And I think to your point, the criticism has been more on people who are not full-time employees. I've actually been to one of those fulfillment centers, and it's true, there's a lot of teachers or people who are trying to get other hours doing other things, and perhaps they're treated differently.</p><p>BENSON: On their own according, which is how a market works. All right. Panel, stick around. Coming up, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>amping up his war on the media, this time attacking the use of anonymous sources again. Journalists are swinging back, but does the president maybe have a point? The panel debates that next.</p><p>BENSON: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>taking aim at one of his favorite targets today, blasting CNN after the network stood by a recent report about the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting even after it was at least partially discredited by their own source, Attorney Lanny Davis. The president tweeted: \"Anonymous sources are really starting to burn the media. The fact that that many anonymous sources don't even exist, that's the fact,\" he said, \"they are fiction made up by fake news reporters. Look at the lie that fake CNN is caught in now? They got caught red-handed, enemy of the people!\" He also tweeted: \"When you see anonymous source, stop reading the story, it is fiction.\"</p><p>Now, several members of the media are firing back noting that the president himself has acted as his own anonymous source in the past about himself and saying that officials in Trump's White House actually often prohibit reporters from naming them in stories. Back to help me separate fact from fiction, our panel, Deirdre, Jimmy, and Danielle. All right, so Danielle, it seems to me like sometimes the president's righteous indignation over things are sort of situational based on what he needs and how he's feeling in the moment. And I kind of have this sneaking suspicion that the next time there's a news report with anonymous sources saying good things about him or things that are helpful to him, maybe he'll share that story widely. Right? Am I wrong?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: I'm picking up what you're putting down. I think that's true. You know, this is a man who was known around New York City for decades as being his own anonymous source, launching stories that were good and were good for him related to his dating life and also some other stuff. These people often won't tell their stories unless they're given anonymity, and we've seen instances in history. You think about deep throat, we would never have known about Watergate in some aspects, if we hadn't had people who are willing to come forward but didn't want to be the identified.</p><p>BENSON: Jimmy, when you serve as your own anonymous source --</p><p>FAILLA: Which happens a lot.</p><p>BENSON: -- about you, do you change your accent? Like, how do you pull that off?</p><p>FAILLA: I do have a voice filter option, you know, on the iPhone, which I don't want to give away my trade secrets here. And these are brilliant move by Trump, because everybody sees through it, but he's strategically picking a fight with the media because a they're the one people that people hate more than him. You know, he has very low approval ratings, but people hate the media. This is like, if a band were to pick a fight with nickelback, you're always going to come off looking good in the exchange because no one's going to choose nickelback over you. And to his point, the media with all the critics he's levied on the media, he could never discredit them as much as they have discredited themselves. They've been terrible, and it should be said.</p><p>BENSON: In some cases, not all cases. A little bit more of a serious question. Deirdre, for you, about journalism, is going after the concept of anonymous sources and actually more of an undermining of journalism than yelling fake news or having a crowd boo at reporters if trying to tell the American people that all anonymous sources are fake, that to me seems like a more serious implication about journalism.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I actually hadn't thought of it that way, but I agree with you. And going back to what you were saying, I mean, there are tons of people who are willing to speak on backgrounds but certainly do not want to be quoted. And there would be a lot of mis-stories. No, I agree, that is a big part of our pipeline, right? At least it lets you know, like, in the best of the journalism senses, at least it lets you know what to chase.</p><p>BENSON: Right. Yes, I think the problem that you run into especially if you're CNN in this case, is when you protect one of your anonymous sources who then tells you -- actually tells America I was the anonymous source, and I'm changing my story, and you just stand by the original reporting.</p><p>FAILLA: Not the best look.</p><p>BENSON: Not the best. That's -- we're talking about it last night on this show, that's where Trump, I think, is just like ramping up and go straight after CNN, because they're creating their own problem. All right, panel, this was great, thank you so much. All right. We'll be right back. \"TOPICAL STORM\" is coming up next. It's a good one, my first shot at it. We'll see how it goes.</p><p>BENSON: A new study found that people who eat large quantities of meat and cheese will live longer than people who don't. Yes! The study was conducted by the University of Arby's -- they have the meats with special help from the Five Guys Institute. That is a complete delicious sham, and this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\"</p><p>Topic one. We begin tonight at the go Bananas Family Fun Center where you can't beat the prices, but you can beat fellow customers. According to their Web site, go Bananas is the finest family amusement center in the entire Chicago-land area. Kids just love their interactive games -- like pin the tail on the fistfight and duck, duck flying garbage can. This brawl reportedly breaking out after two parents got into a disagreement, at which point police were called because you can't just go around hitting people you disagree with, unless you're Antifa. In which case, some people at CNN might actually defend you. We are happy to report that nobody was injured or hurt during that arcade ambush, although four parents were arrested. The judge in the case have set their bail at 5,000 tickets.</p><p>Topic two. No fistfights at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado last night which is amazing because one guest was truly behaving like an animal. The Stanley Hotel became famous for inspiring Steven King's classic \"The Shining.\" They don't normally get a lot of bears at the Stanley, what with the Wi-Fi and lack of gluten free menu options, which outrageous in 2018, good Lord. But this fella decided to stop by for some R&amp;R because all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy -- and that's a shining reference, by the way, for those of you who might be under the age of 40, like me. Although I have seen the film when I was younger. I was absolutely terrified, despite telling my friends that I was definitely not terrified. Speaking of, \"The Shining\" was recently voted the greatest horror movie of all time, in a recent survey. Coming in second was the Clinton campaign. Got her again. Yes!</p><p>Topic three. A Massachusetts golfer has been telling friends for weeks that a fox is stealing his balls off the course. Yes, right, no one believed him until one day he learned how to record the Fox after reading Omarosa's book. This video is so crazy that when they showed it on the golf channel, it literally woke up nearly half of their audience. That is not a therapy animal, that is a ball-stealing fox. And the man feels vindicated because it turns out, the only person making up stories this week was Lanny Davis. His video is being called a sign of the times in the golf world because years ago golfers were worried about a tiger on the course. Nowadays, it's foxes. Tigers are too busy chasing Perkins' waitresses around to ruin your golf game. Also, unlike Democrats, that guy actually has a legit point when he blames his problems fox.</p><p>Topic four, a new hot dog stand opened up in Times Square yesterday, and the good news is, they were absolutely swarmed. The bad news? This is a nightmare. Absolute nightmare. They were swarmed by 30,000 bees who cut the line. Probably not going to improve their Yelp reviews. Police still aren't sure why the bees came to Times Square, they're actually still trying to figure out why any humans would go to Times Square. I mean, other than to get groped by someone in an Elmo costume. But besides that, I can't think of a good reason to show up to that general locale not too far from right here where I sit. The NYPD was forced to bring in a beekeeper to vacuum up the bees. And despite record-breaking temperatures, he wasn't taking any chances, so he put on a hazmat suit -- yes because of the bees, but mostly because of the ingredients in a New York City hot dog. The bees reportedly charged tourists $10.00 a pop for photos and enforced the price aggressively.</p><p>Topic five. Finally, tonight, a Montana man had his methamphetamine conviction overturned after, get this, the expert witness the state used against him was caught using -- drum roll -- methamphetamines during his testimony. I think I speak for everyone, by the way, that I'm shocked this story didn't take place in Florida. James Bochelle -- I mean, winner right there, like the rat tail -- allegedly caught with a glass pipe and several bags of meth back in 2017. Convicted two days later, but the analyst who handled the evidence recently admitted to taking the leftover meth home from the crime lab and even showing up to court high.</p><p>In fact, police say he was so high, he claimed Michael Avenatti could actually win the presidency. Although I'm not so sure that's crazy anymore, am I high? Kennedy is screaming at her television right now, yes! Because she's totally watching her own show on vacation. No. The analyst has been fired from his job, as expected, and Bochelle is going to get his own trial, a redo here, coming up later this fall -- just in time for pumpkin spice meth to come out which is extra delicious but a little higher in calories. That's the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" We'll be right back.</p><p>BENSON: That's our show, you guys. Three down, one to go for me. The lady returns next week. You can catch me on radio, by the way, \"BENSON AND HARF,\" <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Radio, weeknights 6-8 p.m. Eastern, Bensonandharf.com. Tomorrow right here, we have Shannon Bream, Chris Stirewalt, Rachel Campos- Duffy. Look at that line up.

Trumpism versus socialism and it's  playing out before our very eyes in Florida's gubernatorial contest.  Who  will come out on top?  I'm guy Benson in for Kennedy tonight.  Last night,  Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis won his primary and will now go up  against the surprise Democratic winner, Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the race is way bigger than just Florida.  It's actually in some ways a  microcosm of the larger political battle raging across the nation.  Here's  why.  DeSantis is a big supporter of President Trump and vice versa.   Gillum is backed by Vermont socialist Senator Bernie Sanders, and the  winner of this race might foreshadow what's to come in 2020.  Last night,  DeSantis claimed his opponent's policies will destroy Florida's economy.   Watch.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  He is the most liberal candidate that the  Democratic Party has ever nominated in the State of Florida by a country  mile in a governor's race.  He wants to abolish ICE, he wants a billion  dollar tax increase, he wants a single-payer healthcare system in Florida  which would bankrupt the state.  I'm trying to make Florida even better.   He wants to make FloridaVenezuela. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BENSON:  Make Florida Venezuela again, that could go on a baseball cap.   But Gillum claims that raising corporate taxes could actually attract new  businesses.  Hmm.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDREW GILLUM, MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE:  What we have proposed is an increase  in the corporate tax rate which in the State of Florida is lower than our  neighboring States of Alabama and Georgia.  Right now we're at 5-1/4 and  we've suggested going up to just over seven which puts us in line with many  other states and part of what -- it creates a billion dollars in funding  for our public education system.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BENSON:  OK.  So what are the takeaways from last night and what does it  mean going forward?  Joining me now, former special assistant to President  Trump and former press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence, Mark Lotter  is here.  And also here with me in New York, co-host of \"THE FIVE,\" Juan  Williams.  Gentlemen, welcome.  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Good evening.  </p><p>MARK LOTTER, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE:  Good to  be here.</p><p>BENSON:  Mark, I'll start with you.  Another major endorsement victory for  President Trump, dare we call this a winning streak?  </p><p>LOTTER:  I think so, and it's pretty clear when you see that Ron DeSantis  was down by big double digits and after that endorsement he won by over --  by close to 20 points.  So, big win for Ron DeSantis and I would say it's a  big win for Florida because they've had a really good thing going in the  last 20 years under Republican leadership.  Not sure they're ready to turn  their backs on that and embrace socialism.  </p><p>BENSON:  Juan, I'm actually fascinated by the dynamics of this race.  We  talked about a little bit of the top.  It's almost a laboratory pure test  of MAGA versus feel the burn here in the swingiest state in the country.   How do you feel like this is going to shape up with these two candidates  that frankly the other party will argue is unelectable?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, in fact, one of the arguments today I was hearing from  political people is either side got the candidate they want to run against.  </p><p>BENSON:  Right.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  And so here you have a situation where the question is the label  socialist. So the Republican, the Trumpian, DeSantis, says my opponent is a  socialist.  And, in fact, we recently had a poll that you may have seen  where most Democrats said they're fine with socialism.  </p><p>BENSON:  I mean, he won the primary.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Correct.  But the question is this, is he a socialist?  I don't  think he accepts that label.  He's not, certainly, about having the  government takeover the means of production.  We live in an age where there  are lots of people -- we had a poll this week that found, I think, it's 40  percent of Americans said they had a hard time meeting bills for food, for  housing and healthcare.</p><p>In an era of high-income inequality, is it socialist to say I believe in a  social safety net that protects people from falling to the bottom?  </p><p>BENSON:  All right.  Well, Mark, let's get your response to that because we  can debate whether or not he's a socialist or a Democratic socialist, but  as you heard from Ron DeSantis in that clip we just played, his opponent  does support socialist healthcare.  He wants to socialize healthcare in the  state, abolish ICE.  It's a pretty far-left agenda especially in a state  like Florida which is kind of down the middle.  </p><p>LOTTER:  And you're absolutely right.  And let's remember that he won that  primary last night with only one-third of a very large Democratic vote.  So  two out of three Democratic voters said no.  How is he going to convince  them that his far-left policies, which are farther left than more even  moderate, middle Democrats in Florida, that's a pretty extreme program he's  embracing.  We've got a lot of support, a lot of enthusiasm on the  Republican side.</p><p>I think he's going to have a lot of work to do, especially in that I-4  corridor, trying to make moderate people embrace his very liberal, very  progressive ideas.  </p><p>BENSON:  All right.  So Juan, how does he do that?  If you were  recommending things to Andrew Gillum as he looks toward November at this  point, he's won the primary, he checked the box.  Bernie Sanders really  helped him obviously.  Does he campaign with Bernie?  Does he remain a  Bernie Democrat or does he start to sort of inch toward the center?  And  how can he do that?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, no, I think the key in all races right now, and I think  you're going to see this across the country specifically in Georgia which  also has a Democrat black woman running, Stacey Abrams running against a  Trumpian, Brian Kemp, I think what you're going to see is they're saying  we're going to talk about the issues from the Democratic perspective.</p><p>And the issue will be -- and this is what Gillum did in his race against  other Democrats, say I'm the only non-millionaire in the race.  I'm the one  that really can identify --</p><p>BENSON:  That's not an issue.  That's not an issue.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, it is.  Because you want to say in a time of income  inequality I relate to you, struggling people, who are out there working  hard and having a hard time paying for your kids to go to college, college  tuition.  I'm the ones who can relate when a big medical bill comes in how  threatened you are and how it throws off your budget.  And I think that's  what he's going to do.</p><p>It's not going to, you know, so I think Republicans may say, oh, sounds  like socialism, but you know what?  I wonder if voters instead will respond  this is someone who shares my needs and understands my predicament.  </p><p>LOTTER:  But I'll tell you one thing in that response to Juan is all of  those people who have jobs, who are looking for jobs, they're going to have  small businesses, big business owners saying, well, because Gillum supports  a $15.00 minimum wage, because he's raising taxes on our companies 40  percent, we are not going to be able to give you a race.  We're not going  to be able to hire you.</p><p>Well, we're going to fire you and replace you with a computer because it's  costing us too much.  That is a very powerful driver and you can bet the  Chambers of Commerce and business groups are all going to be out there  rallying people to stop the tax increase.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Mark, you've got to hear from the teachers, you've got to  hear from people who feel as if they're underpaid in terms of government.   You've got to hear from the minority groups, larger and larger especially  along that I-94 corridor that you mentioned, referenced earlier.  These are  people who are quite excited by Gillum.  The question is, because I think  the Republican base is excited by Trump and DeSantis.</p><p>The question is once you get beyond these two polarized bases, what does  the middle think?  What does the suburban house way?</p><p>BENSON:  Yes.  That's going to be, I think, one of the most fascinating  races in the country.  We'll watch it very closely.  Mark, Juan, thank you  both.</p><p>LOTTER:  You're welcome.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Thanks.</p><p>BENSON:  One thing is for sure under the economy that has been engineered  by DeSantis' coach, President Trump, things are booming.  Just today the  government reported the U.S. economy grew 4.2 percent in the last quarter  which is higher than previously estimate and the best quarter since 2014.   A stronger economy has Americans more comfortable with their jobs as well.</p><p>A new report today claiming just over half of Americans, 51 percent say  they're satisfied with their jobs, the highest level since 2005.  Plus,  consumer confidence also at an 18-year high.  So while a lot of people love  to hate this President, are his policies at least being vindicated?  Fox  News Contributor and chief investment officer of Kingsview Asset  Management, Scott Martin is here with me now.</p><p>Scott, thanks for swinging by from Chicago, my former hometown.  Go, Cubs.  </p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Yes.   I mean, no problem.  And sorry about all the heat we sent you, but I'm not  telling you, I'm not missing it, man.  So enjoy.  </p><p>BENSON:  Chicago -- people talk about Chicago winners but Chicago summers  can be absolutely brutal.  So Scott, I want to talk about these economic  numbers today.  The job security and job satisfaction statistics, I thought  were interesting.  We don't always hear about that metric.  Why is it  important?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Well, it says a lot of things.  It says that employers are  treating or their employees right for maybe the first time in several years  via benefits, obviously 401(k) benefits are doing very well, we've seen  those balances, Guy, at record highs.  And job quality too.  You know, I  think with technology and things that are going on in the work force, Guy,  I think people are happier in their jobs because they're doing more stuff  in technology.</p><p>Maybe it's making their jobs easier.  And then on the flipside too, you  know, the employers are happy about that because companies are making more  money, we have record profits, and you're seeing that show up in the data  points.  </p><p>BENSON:  So I want to talk about a dichotomy here that is a little bit  puzzling to me, because I can rattle off all the incredible numbers about  the economy, unemployment, GDP growth, consumer confidence, the list goes  on.  We actually talked about a few of them just a moment ago and yet in  our most recent Fox News poll, only 47 percent of Americans rank the U.S.  economy right now as excellent or good.</p><p>With the other half saying only fair or poor.  So objectively, the economy  is in great shape, but the American people are polarized about whether it's  really all that great.  Why?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  It's kind of weird, you know?  It could be the media that  they're ingesting, certainly, that's telling them those things.  Or you  could have just made it to, you know, the right haters on the street as far  as that poll goes because to me, I've got to tell you, I mean, looking at  those data points you mentioned, Guy, with the economy now growing at 4.2  percent, the best in several years.</p><p>Consumer confidence at highs that we haven't seen since I was prom king,  business confidence as well -- </p><p>BENSON:  Were you really?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Very high.  No.  You know, when I came in second, and it was  totally fixed -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BENSON:  So that was fake news.  I just called you out in fake news.  </p><p>MARTIN:  It was totally -- it was totally fixed man.  The guy paid people  off to vote for him.  But either way, I should have been.  And then  secondly, listen like look at -- look at business confidence numbers.  Now  what we're seeing, Guy, that we haven't seen for many, many years because  businesses weren't confident enough in the future, they're actually doing  capital expenditures, research and development, investing in their  employees.</p><p>Things that companies weren't doing a couple years ago because they were  worried about the future, they were worried about regulations and taxes.   All of that spending is now getting unlocked.  So, I think those people you  interviewed eventually are going to turn tail because they're just going to  have to realize that the economy is better than they think.  </p><p>BENSON:  What do you make of this debate over whether we're on a sugar high  right now and everything is great for the moment but it's going to go away,  or is this unsustainable, is it sustainable to sort of this back and forth  among economists and politicians.  Where do you come down on that? </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  You know, I'm close to the sugar high camp.  Not yet, but I  will tell you that, you know, the way the markets are and the way that  they've just been going up and up and up on almost seemingly bad news these  days and, yes, we've had some good trade reconciliation news which does  support the S&amp;P 500, it will push up stock prices.  But the reality is  this, things are getting very good.</p><p>So if you just look back in history and look back at cycles, you know,  things in the markets and economy occur, and cycles just like seasons of  the year do, as you mentioned how hot it is in Chicago, it gets cold in  Chicago as well just like it will on the East Coast.  So, just remember  that if you're investing for today, there is going to be a rainy day in the  stock market, so as greatest things could be today, you've just got to have  some things in your portfolio that will do well if the markets go down. </p><p>BENSON:  Cyclical, I buy that, but how long is the cycle?  That's such a  huge question.  When might we start to look for some potential downturn  signs?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I'll tell you, man.  I mean, things are going to change if  the midterms go the wrong way.  Let's say depending on who you're voting  for, obviously that's a subjective comment.</p><p>BENSON:  Right.  </p><p>MARTIN:  But if things go a bad way in November, that could be the start of  it, Guy.  And in 2020, let's face it, man, it's not that far away, so  that's another twist that could be happening in the pipe here.  </p><p>BENSON:  Don't remind me.  All right.  Scott, thank you so much tonight.   And stay cool in Chicago for now.  </p><p>MARTIN:  See you.  </p><p>BENSON:  On a more somber note tonight, thousands of mourners paying their  respects today in honoring the life of war hero and longtime Senator John  McCain who served his country for more than 60 years.  Take a look there.   A live look inside the Arizona State Capitol where the body of John McCain  is lying in state.</p><p>Earlier today a police escort accompanied McCain's body to the Capitol as  scores of military veterans, law enforcement, fire and first responders  lined the sides of Capitol Plaza for the procession is.  Fox News  correspondent William La Jeunesse is with us Phoenix with more.  William?</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Guy, it's about 106  degrees here, and it has been all day.  And here is the amazing thing, the  line that you see here, it snakes another quarter mile around the corner  here.  It's been that way uninterrupted for about four hours all for the  chance to spend 20 or 30 seconds next to the casket of John McCain, just  enough to say goodbye.</p><p>But, you know, many don't know John McCain planned these services.  He  personally reached out to the pallbearers and the ushers and the people who  speak tomorrow to celebrate his life on what would have been his 82nd  birthday.  Now, there -- today was as you said, more solemn than  celebration.  Cindy and her two sons met the casket along with Governor  Doug Ducey and his wife.</p><p>The casket will lie here until tomorrow morning in a motorcade to North  Phoenix Baptist Church.  Senator Jon Kyl who served with McCain said there  was a debate on the floor of Congress he jointed, if there wasn't, McCain  would start one.  The country he said will miss his fight and his voice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>JON KYL, FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR:  John's love for America and  Arizona.  He represented our values all over the world as Senator from  Arizona.  And America is stronger for his fierce defense of our values.  We  can be proud he was our Senator.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Now, it was an emotional service with Cindy laying her head  on the coffin, daughter Meghan openly crying, follow by McCain's sons,  Governor Ducey recalled McCain's years in Vietnam fighting for his country  down for the state he represented for 36 years.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KYL:  When John McCain called upon us to serve a purpose greater than one's  own self-interest, it wasn't a talking point designed to win the next  election.  It was how he had actually lived his life and continued to live  his life.  That's how he wanted us to live ours.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LA JEUNESSE:  Even though McCain is gone, he is still sending a message of  inclusivity and bipartisanship.  Those speaking tomorrow include Democrats  Joe Biden, the ushers and pallbearers are a mixed of -- well, a Hispanic  woman, a native American, cardinal Larry Fitzgerald, ex-Diamondback Luis  Gonzalez and in Washington many will come from across the aisle, Guy.  As I  said today, 106 degrees.  That building was built in 1901.</p><p>It's very thick wall, it's going to remain kind of cool.  But the people I  spoke to said they came for several reasons.  Obviously, his sacrifice in  Vietnam.  Some native Americans coming from five, six hours away on the  Naval Reservation because of what he did for the tribes and Indian gaming,  allowing that, pushing that legislation through.  And then of course many  just said, listen, he was there for us, it is our turn to be there for him  and their chance to say goodbye.  Back to you.</p><p>BENSON:  William, thank you for that report.  Moving day in Arizona.   Coming up, back in D.C. President Trump attacking Hillary Clinton after a  new report suggest China was able to hack into her e-mail server.  Remember  that one?  But did it actually happen?  Plus, another White House  departure, White House Counsel Don McGahn leaving his post this fall.  What  does that mean for the President's legal team?  Jason Chaffetz joins me  after the break.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BENSON:  President Trump calling for a new investigation into Hillary  Clinton's private e-mail server.  Earlier today the President tweeting,  \"Hillary Clinton's e-mails, many of which are classified information, got  hacked by China.  Next move better be by the FBI and DOJ or after all of  their other missteps, Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page or FISA dirty dossier et  cetera, their credibility will be gone forever.</p><p>The President seemed to be referencing a Daily Caller report that cited  anonymous sources in the intelligence community.  The FBI later countering  that, \"the FBI has not found any evidence that the servers were  compromised.\"  The Chinese Foreign Ministry for their part also denying the  report, LOL, of course they would, but is the President right to call out  the intelligence community as potentially compromised?</p><p>Joining me now, former Utah Congressman and Fox News Contributor Jason  Chaffetz.  Jason, it's great to see you.  You also have a forthcoming book,  The Deep State, we're happy to have you here.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, thank you, I appreciate it.  I  look forward to the book coming out, and thanks for having me on.</p><p>BENSON:  All right.  So let's start with this Daily Caller report, what we  saw form the President and his tweets and the FBI denying it, right?   Denying this whole suggestion or report that China hacked into Hillary  Clinton's bootleg basement e-mail server.  I'm reminded, everyone from  Robert Gates to Jim Comey to Mike Morrell said the chances were high that a  hostile foreign power did get into that unsecure server.</p><p>You paid very close attention to this while you were in Congress, what do  you think the truth is here? </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Oh, I think it's highly probable and most likely that it did  happen.  We heard testimony from the inspect general, Michael Horowitz,  that they did believe that there was an intrusion on this computer.  When I  was the chairman of the oversight committee, we heard testimony from the  person who set up the server, did not have a degree in computer science,  had never taken a computer course.</p><p>It literally kind of, you know, went down to Best Buy and then set it up in  the basement there.  I mean, literally, that's how sloppily this was done.   We never did get testimony from the secret service, you would think they  would take some ownership given that within former President Clinton's  home, but nevertheless it's -- I can't imagine that, A, she wasn't  targeted.  Of course she was.  She was Secretary of State.</p><p>And then even as former Secretary of State, she was presidential candidate  most likely at that point.  And it's almost impossible to think that even  some guy down by the river in a van could have done this probably.  It's  not a local 17-year-old, your local high schooler.  </p><p>BENSON:  Meantime, Jason, yesterday on Capitol Hill we saw Bruce Ohr  arriving for closed-door testimony before some committees.  You were, as  you just referenced, the chairman of the Oversight Committee in the house.   If you had been in that private session, what would have been some of the  questions you were eager to ask Bruce Ohr? </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, what you want to do is play off what the FBI was telling  you officially, because they have been fishy, at best, in provide  documents, they have been hiding the ball for a long time and it ends up  that more and more what Congressional investigators are finding out is what  they weren't told even under oath is turning out not to be true.   Particularly as it relates to this dossier, the funding of it.</p><p>The only evidence that we see of true collusion when money is changing  hands is between Russians, the Democratic National Committee, a guy named  Mark Elias.  That name is out in the media, but it's going to be the center  of the universe for so many of these things.  And Bruce Ohr talking about  how his wife Nelly is involved and engaged in this.  I mean, it's a  nefarious, salacious situation and yet no attention, but little to no  attention by the FBI itself.  </p><p>BENSON:  All right, Jason.  One more question here.  The report today  confirmed by the President, Don McGahn on his way out as White House  Counsel.  What's the effect at the White House?  What do you make of that? </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, I don't know who filled those big shoes.  I think Don  McGahn has been a trusted adviser, close to the President, a superb job in  the judicial nominees and selections certainly with the Supreme Court but  also at the district court level and whatnot.  There's no heir apparent  that I'm aware of.  And, you know, general counsel to the President of the  United States is a very big role to fill.  Especially in this White House.</p><p>BENSON:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And so, he will be deeply missed.  I don't know who steps up and  fills that but it is of critical importance.  </p><p>BENSON:  Jason Chaffetz, thank you for your time.  And good luck with the  book.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Thanks, Guy. </p><p>BENSON:  Sure thing.  Coming up.  Should the government be able to regulate  search engine results from Google?  We'll tell you why President Trump  seems to think so.  Plus, a senior Facebook engineer speaking out claiming  the company is biased against conservatives.  The panel joins me next to  discuss.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BENSON:  Some new controversies today the involving major internet company  that many of us use every single day, Facebook, Google, Yahoo! and Amazon.   Let's start with Google and Facebook.  Each of which are now mired in  separate claims of bias against conservatives.  Yesterday President Trump  tweeted, \"Google search results for Trump news shows only the viewing  reporting of fake news media.</p><p>In order, they have rigged it for me and others so that almost all stories  and news is bad.  Fake CNN is prominent, Republican conservative and fair  media is shut out.  Illegal?  96 percent of results on Trump news are from  national left-wing media, very dangerous.  Google and others are  suppressing voices of conservatives and is hiding information and news that  is good.  They are controlling what we can and cannot see.</p><p>This is a very serious situation.  Will be addressed.\"  Google responded  saying there's no bias in search results.  Over at Facebook, meanwhile,  dozens of employees have reportedly united to challenge what they say is a  left-swing culture at the social media giant.  They're claiming  conservative staffers shunned, marginalized and even harassed.  So is the  bias real, and what can or should be done about any of it if anything?</p><p>Let's go to the panel tonight.  FBN's Deirdre Bolton is here, Jimmy Failla  and Democratic strategist and attorney, Danielle McLaughlin.  Hello,  everyone.  </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BENSON:  Thanks for being here.  All right.  So, Deirdre, let's start with  Google and the President maybe suggesting that some regulation might be  coming down the pike.  As we think about regulation from the federal  government, looking at Google, private company but arguably sort of a  public utility because they're a gateway to internet searches.  How do you  strike that balance?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Well, we've heard the president  criticized Google, right, as he has.  We've also heard him say it's one of  our greatest companies, and we know that there is this Senate Intelligence  Committee hearing on September 5th.  So, we have to assume that some of  this is a little bit of grandstanding.  And as you say, I mean, this is a  publicly-traded company from a legal perspective, which I'm sure Danielle  will help us out on.  </p><p>I actually don't know what the government really can do even if they  decided in some weird way to try to somehow restrict.  I don't know, you  would have freedom of speech infractions.  I mean, you have a lot of  problems if the government tries to outright regulate Google.  And by the  way, the president has also complained, right, about Facebook, and perhaps  right so, also complained about Twitter -- </p><p>BENSON:  Lots of complaining.  </p><p>BOLTON:  So, I just think -- as we know, he tends to be very pure in  whatever sentiments he is feeling at that particular moment.  </p><p>BENSON:  All right.  So, Danielle, let's just say hypothetically, Google's  denying any of this for the moment.  But hypothetically, if Google was  tweaking its formulas to promote an agenda or suppress some search results,  would that be a problem?  </p><p>DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Constitutionally, no.  I mean,  the freedom of speech that we have, and corporations have freedom of speech  as well, which we can decide whether that's a good thing or not, they have  a lot of rights, protects us, protects corporations against government.   So, it gives the freedom -- you know, what's the saying I hate what you  say, but you know, I'll defend your right to say it.  We see conservative  media, we see liberal media, we used to have some cool neutrality which was  required by the FCC.  Not anymore.  So, that's why we've seen the sort of - - we see now, we see Fox News, and we see MSNBC on the other side.  There's  not a lot that the president can do, and I think he calls it rigged when he  doesn't like what he's seeing, frankly.  </p><p>BENSON:  Jimmy, are you willing to criticize Google in light of your own  personal searches?</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>JIMMY FAILLA, COMEDIAN:  I was just going to say that.  I give him that  credit. </p><p>BOLTON:  Like prom jacket comes up sometimes.  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  This is going to come up on Google tomorrow.  </p><p>FAILLA:  But you might search this, that so much to the president's point.   I don't think anyone ever Googles the term \"Trump news.\"  You're never more  than three-inches from Trump news in the world that we're living right now.   But I think the reason he initiates this argument is not so much that he  plans on regulating, but that he calls attention to it because it casts him  in a sympathetic light.  It's another attempt to remind everybody that the  powers that be are aligned against him.  </p><p>BENSON:  Just briefly on the Facebook accusation for some of these  employees, is it bad business for these big tech companies to  overwhelmingly hire people from one political persuasion?  </p><p>BOLTON:  I actually was happy to hear of this one engineer who just said  like, OK, it's 0.5 percent of employee base at Facebook, they have 25,000  employees -- something like a hundred signed up for this diversity  committee.  I personally would rather have a company.  I think it is better  for business to have tons of different points of view.  And I think  interestingly enough, even the people on Facebook who signed up for this  diversity or political diversity opinion meeting even said we're not  conservative, we're just sick of all the liberal slant and just feeling  like we can't even hear a different point of view.  So, yes, I think the  best for business, open, open, open ideas, right?  That's where you get the  best creativity.  </p><p>BENSON:  All right.  So, next topic, there was a time when advertisers  hoped to read your mind, but nowadays they can just read your e-mails.  The  Wall Street Journal reporting that Yahoo! is scanning the e-mails from 200  million accounts to get information they can sell to advertisers.  The  report raises serious privacy questions but the tech company insists they  never scan personal messages -- yes, sure -- and only target commercial  products in an effort to deliver a more personalized advertising  experience, which is a nice way to put it.  </p><p>AOL also reportedly engaging in the same practice, but both companies quick  to point out consumers can opt out of the targeted ads by logging on to a  privacy dashboard that they launched in April.  So, it's hard to imagine  they're the only tech companies doing this, but they're definitely the only  ones admitting it -- at least now that they've been caught by The Wall  Street Journal.  Is Yahoo! up to no good or just no good at keeping  secrets?  Jimmy, when I saw this story, I just assumed this was already  happening because of my targeted ads.  I see this all the time, like isn't  everyone doing this?  </p><p>FAILLA:  Yes, we have this discussion earlier.  I mean, the biggest shock  to me was that people were still using Yahoo! and AOL.  I was more shocked  to hear that.  And to the point of who's still using it, because in a lot  of ways it's like the MySpace of e-mail.  The only people still on it are,  like, creeps, you know what I mean?  So, it's all going to be ads for how  to bury a body.  </p><p>BENSON:  I would point out, I'm not on this, but the woman who normally  sits here, from what I'm told, might be on one of those two platforms, so  watch it.  You work for her.  You work for her.</p><p>FAILLA:  I just outed her.  </p><p>BENSON:  Danielle, any points here for candor on behalf of Yahoo!, or  they're really just caught by newspaper and then they said, OK, fine.  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  No.  No points for -- you would think that (INAUDIBLE) after  the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica ought to debacle that maybe opting in to  something like this was a better idea for not only P.R. but just for the --  for consumer.  </p><p>BOLTON:  But they're defending it, actually, fairly funny, right?  They're  like, oh, it costs a lot of money to like keep these servers up and  running, and you would have to pay if we didn't sell ads.  I mean, in their  defense, I do not work for Yahoo! Obviously, do not give a hoot, but they  do say that they're not actually reading through your e-mail line by line.   What they're saying is if you -- of course not -- if you open a trader  account at T.D. Ameritrade, then when you log on, you will just see you're  known as an investor then.  </p><p>BENSON:  Here's the other thing, and this is just a devil's advocate point.   I'm generally on the privacy side of this, but like, in some ways, even  though they're creepy, targeted ads are sort of useful somehow.  Well,  actually, yes, I do want that.  </p><p>FAILLA:  You'd rather see an ad for that, but wouldn't it be great if this  is how we found Hillary's e-mails after all this time, it's a bunch of ads  for bleach bit and stuff like that?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BENSON:  All right.  Amazon finally having enough of Bernie Sanders  attacks.  In a rare move, they made a public response to the socialist  senator.  Sanders has spent months slamming both Amazon's working  conditions and pay, but the tech giant accused the Vermont senator of  spreading \"misleading statements and urged Sanders to visit one of the  company's fulfillment centers.\"  </p><p>Sanders shot back earlier today: \"Many Amazon employees who work for the  wealthiest person on earth are paid wages so low they can't make ends  meet.\"  He also threatened to call the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration to investigate \"unsafe working conditions in the company's  warehouses.\"  Keep in mind, President Trump has also been a vocal critic of  Amazon, but for very different reasons, who's going to win this war of  words?  </p><p>Danielle, I'll start with you, I understand that Bernie Sanders has a  problem with big successful businesses sometimes.  People are voluntarily  working for Amazon.  Amazon today said, hey, not only you, senator, come on  in, ask our employees.  Ask them what they're experience have been.  I  think that's a pretty good response, don't you?  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I do.  And I, of course, read Jeff Bezos' response, the  average wage for a full-time worker at Amazon is over $15.00 an hour, which  further than many states mandate.  They get great medical benefits, they  get maternity and paternity leave, they get stock.  The issue that came up  of this was people who have been part-time workers, people who had left  Amazon and had worked very long.  So, there are issues with corporate  wealthy, don't get me work.  If you're working full time, I don't think you  should be needing to get food stamps, there's a problem there, but I don't  think necessarily that Amazon is -- </p><p>BENSON:  Jimmy, part of me as a conservative, I want the send a bouquet of  flowers to people like Bernie Sanders who are attacking these companies  that Americans find super convenient.  Like Amazon and Uber, like keep  coming after things that make Americans' lives more affordable and more  convenient.  Keep doing it.  </p><p>FAILLA:  Yes, it's a dumb move.  I mean, I think the reason he hates Amazon  is because you can't make other people pay for your stuff on Amazon.  It  just kind of goes against his doctrine.  But I think to the point of what  they're paying people and how they're offering us an effective and  efficient service, I think this is one of those errands where the effort to  demonize everything you come across in this age we live in brings you into  a lot of dark alleys.  And you know, Bernie Sanders, like a lot of people  who live in a $2 million home, is a man of the people who has several $2  million homes.  He is the mand of people, but I think he's being a man of  the wrong people on this one -- to Guy's -- </p><p>BOLTON:  Or a limousine liberal.  </p><p>BENSON:  Deirdre, if you're Amazon and Bezos, you're like I'm getting it  from Bernie, I'm getting it from Trump, what is going on here?  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes, but at least I have $155 billion -- </p><p>BENSON:  That's right, he can take the slings and arrows.  </p><p>BOLTON:  I think he can.  Listen, he is a legendary business leader, he's  the pioneer.  Jeff Bezos, I'm sure, is used to being criticized.  I am sure  he can handle it.  I thought the response was great.  Although I do think  it's notable -- usually he ignores, you know, 99 percent of the arrows that  come his way.  Apparently, he did feel like this one was worth responding  to but that was the right response.  </p><p>OK, ask our employees, come to a fulfillment center, see what it's like.   And I think to your point, the criticism has been more on people who are  not full-time employees.  I've actually been to one of those fulfillment  centers, and it's true, there's a lot of teachers or people who are trying  to get other hours doing other things, and perhaps they're treated  differently.  </p><p>BENSON:  On their own according, which is how a market works.  All right.   Panel, stick around.  Coming up, President Trump amping up his war on the  media, this time attacking the use of anonymous sources again.  Journalists  are swinging back, but does the president maybe have a point?  The panel  debates that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BENSON:  President Trump taking aim at one of his favorite targets today,  blasting CNN after the network stood by a recent report about the infamous  2016 Trump Tower meeting even after it was at least partially discredited  by their own source, Attorney Lanny Davis.  The president tweeted:  \"Anonymous sources are really starting to burn the media.  The fact that  that many anonymous sources don't even exist, that's the fact,\" he said,  \"they are fiction made up by fake news reporters.  Look at the lie that  fake CNN is caught in now?  They got caught red-handed, enemy of the  people!\"  He also tweeted: \"When you see anonymous source, stop reading the  story, it is fiction.\"  </p><p>Now, several members of the media are firing back noting that the president  himself has acted as his own anonymous source in the past about himself and  saying that officials in Trump's White House actually often prohibit  reporters from naming them in stories.  Back to help me separate fact from  fiction, our panel, Deirdre, Jimmy, and Danielle.  All right, so Danielle,  it seems to me like sometimes the president's righteous indignation over  things are sort of situational based on what he needs and how he's feeling  in the moment.  And I kind of have this sneaking suspicion that the next  time there's a news report with anonymous sources saying good things about  him or things that are helpful to him, maybe he'll share that story widely.   Right?  Am I wrong?  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I'm picking up what you're putting down.  I think that's true.   You know, this is a man who was known around New York City for decades as  being his own anonymous source, launching stories that were good and were  good for him related to his dating life and also some other stuff.  These  people often won't tell their stories unless they're given anonymity, and  we've seen instances in history.  You think about deep throat, we would  never have known about Watergate in some aspects, if we hadn't had people  who are willing to come forward but didn't want to be the identified.  </p><p>BENSON:  Jimmy, when you serve as your own anonymous source --</p><p>FAILLA:  Which happens a lot.</p><p>BENSON:  -- about you, do you change your accent?  Like, how do you pull  that off?</p><p>FAILLA:  I do have a voice filter option, you know, on the iPhone, which I  don't want to give away my trade secrets here.  And these are brilliant  move by Trump, because everybody sees through it, but he's strategically  picking a fight with the media because a they're the one people that people  hate more than him.  You know, he has very low approval ratings, but people  hate the media.  This is like, if a band were to pick a fight with  nickelback, you're always going to come off looking good in the exchange  because no one's going to choose nickelback over you.  And to his point,  the media with all the critics he's levied on the media, he could never  discredit them as much as they have discredited themselves.  They've been  terrible, and it should be said.  </p><p>BENSON:  In some cases, not all cases.  A little bit more of a serious  question.  Deirdre, for you, about journalism, is going after the concept  of anonymous sources and actually more of an undermining of journalism than  yelling fake news or having a crowd boo at reporters if trying to tell the  American people that all anonymous sources are fake, that to me seems like  a more serious implication about journalism.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  I actually hadn't thought of it that way, but I agree with  you.  And going back to what you were saying, I mean, there are tons of  people who are willing to speak on backgrounds but certainly do not want to  be quoted.  And there would be a lot of mis-stories.  No, I agree, that is  a big part of our pipeline, right?  At least it lets you know, like, in the  best of the journalism senses, at least it lets you know what to chase.  </p><p>BENSON:  Right.  Yes, I think the problem that you run into especially if  you're CNN in this case, is when you protect one of your anonymous sources  who then tells you -- actually tells America I was the anonymous source,  and I'm changing my story, and you just stand by the original reporting.  </p><p>FAILLA:  Not the best look.  </p><p>BENSON:  Not the best.  That's -- we're talking about it last night on this  show, that's where Trump, I think, is just like ramping up and go straight  after CNN, because they're creating their own problem.  All right, panel,  this was great, thank you so much.  All right.  We'll be right back.   \"TOPICAL STORM\" is coming up next.  It's a good one, my first shot at it.   We'll see how it goes. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BENSON:  A new study found that people who eat large quantities of meat and  cheese will live longer than people who don't.  Yes!  The study was  conducted by the University of Arby's -- they have the meats with special  help from the Five Guys Institute.  That is a complete delicious sham, and  this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\"  </p><p>Topic one.  We begin tonight at the go Bananas Family Fun Center where you  can't beat the prices, but you can beat fellow customers.  According to  their Web site, go Bananas is the finest family amusement center in the  entire Chicago-land area.  Kids just love their interactive games -- like  pin the tail on the fistfight and duck, duck flying garbage can.  This  brawl reportedly breaking out after two parents got into a disagreement, at  which point police were called because you can't just go around hitting  people you disagree with, unless you're Antifa.  In which case, some people  at CNN might actually defend you.  We are happy to report that nobody was  injured or hurt during that arcade ambush, although four parents were  arrested.  The judge in the case have set their bail at 5,000 tickets.  </p><p>Topic two.  No fistfights at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado last  night which is amazing because one guest was truly behaving like an animal.   The Stanley Hotel became famous for inspiring Steven King's classic \"The  Shining.\"  They don't normally get a lot of bears at the Stanley, what with  the Wi-Fi and lack of gluten free menu options, which outrageous in 2018,  good Lord.  But this fella decided to stop by for some R&amp;R because all work  and no play makes Jack a dull boy -- and that's a shining reference, by the  way, for those of you who might be under the age of 40, like me.  Although  I have seen the film when I was younger.  I was absolutely terrified,  despite telling my friends that I was definitely not terrified.  Speaking  of, \"The Shining\" was recently voted the greatest horror movie of all time,  in a recent survey.  Coming in second was the Clinton campaign.  Got her  again.  Yes!  </p><p>Topic three.  A Massachusetts golfer has been telling friends for weeks  that a fox is stealing his balls off the course.  Yes, right, no one  believed him until one day he learned how to record the Fox after reading  Omarosa's book.  This video is so crazy that when they showed it on the  golf channel, it literally woke up nearly half of their audience.  That is  not a therapy animal, that is a ball-stealing fox.  And the man feels  vindicated because it turns out, the only person making up stories this  week was Lanny Davis.  His video is being called a sign of the times in the  golf world because years ago golfers were worried about a tiger on the  course.  Nowadays, it's foxes.  Tigers are too busy chasing Perkins'  waitresses around to ruin your golf game.  Also, unlike Democrats, that guy  actually has a legit point when he blames his problems fox.  </p><p>Topic four, a new hot dog stand opened up in Times Square yesterday, and  the good news is, they were absolutely swarmed.  The bad news?  This is a  nightmare.  Absolute nightmare.  They were swarmed by 30,000 bees who cut  the line.  Probably not going to improve their Yelp reviews.  Police still  aren't sure why the bees came to Times Square, they're actually still  trying to figure out why any humans would go to Times Square.  I mean,  other than to get groped by someone in an Elmo costume.  But besides that,  I can't think of a good reason to show up to that general locale not too  far from right here where I sit.  The NYPD was forced to bring in a  beekeeper to vacuum up the bees.  And despite record-breaking temperatures,  he wasn't taking any chances, so he put on a hazmat suit -- yes because of  the bees, but mostly because of the ingredients in a New York City hot dog.   The bees reportedly charged tourists $10.00 a pop for photos and enforced  the price aggressively.  </p><p>Topic five.  Finally, tonight, a Montana man had his methamphetamine  conviction overturned after, get this, the expert witness the state used  against him was caught using -- drum roll -- methamphetamines during his  testimony.  I think I speak for everyone, by the way, that I'm shocked this  story didn't take place in Florida.  James Bochelle -- I mean, winner right  there, like the rat tail -- allegedly caught with a glass pipe and several  bags of meth back in 2017.  Convicted two days later, but the analyst who  handled the evidence recently admitted to taking the leftover meth home  from the crime lab and even showing up to court high.  </p><p>In fact, police say he was so high, he claimed Michael Avenatti could  actually win the presidency.  Although I'm not so sure that's crazy  anymore, am I high?  Kennedy is screaming at her television right now, yes!   Because she's totally watching her own show on vacation.  No.  The analyst  has been fired from his job, as expected, and Bochelle is going to get his  own trial, a redo here, coming up later this fall -- just in time for  pumpkin spice meth to come out which is extra delicious but a little higher  in calories.  That's the \"TOPICAL STORM.\"  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BENSON:  That's our show, you guys.  Three down, one to go for me.  The  lady returns next week.  You can catch me on radio, by the way, \"BENSON AND  HARF,\" Fox News Radio, weeknights 6-8 p.m. Eastern, Bensonandharf.com.   Tomorrow right here, we have Shannon Bream, Chris Stirewalt, Rachel Campos- Duffy.  Look at that line up.  I'm Guy Benson, in for Kennedy, and tonight  we'll leave you with a live look at Phoenix where Senator John McCain lies  in state.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A babe who photographed babies...  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She would get them to do the craziest things.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  ...becomes a celebrity herself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I`m Ray Suarez.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the NewsHour tonight: the news of this Wednesday; then, the presidential candidates join the battle over the bailout plan; a second day of rough sledding on Capitol Hill for the administration`s plan; political analysis from Ruth Marcus and Byron York; and regional business writers gauge Main Street`s reaction; plus, the third in our \"Close Up\" series on the two major presidential candidates, tonight, <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>and adversity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BREAK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RAY SUAREZ: The fight over a huge financial rescue plan took on a new urgency today. The president decided to address the nation, and Republican presidential <person><nameText>candidate John McCain </nameText></person>suspended campaigning.</p><p>McCain urged Democrat <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>to delay their first debate, set for Friday night, and return to Washington to help resolve the crisis.</p><p>Obama said the debate should go ahead. He said the country especially needs to hear from the presidential candidates now. We`ll have more on this story right after this news summary.</p><p>The president made his decision in the face of resistance in Congress to the $700 billion bailout. He flew back to Washington early from meeting with foreign leaders in New York. He took no questions as he returned to the White House.</p><p>White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said, \"The president believes it is important for the American people to fully understand the depths of this crisis.\"</p><p>Earlier, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid charged Mr. Bush should have acted before now.</p><p>SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), Senate Majority Leader: When there`s an issue of such paramount importance, we were always called to the White House. Not this time; the president hasn`t been available. It hasn`t been his issue. Well, it is his issue.</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: The president`s address -- his first in primetime in more than a year -- is scheduled for 9 p.m. Eastern time. It can be seen on most of these PBS stations.</p><p>The administration pushed Congress again today to act. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned the credit system will break down without strong action.</p><p>And Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson agreed the plan should limit the pay of executives in the rescued companies.</p><p>House Republican leaders suggested that concession could help them make a tough sell to their side.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>JOHN BOEHNER </nameText></person>(R-OH), House Minority Leader: The battle that we`re in is about understanding how difficult the crisis is and trying to understand, will this plan, in fact, work?</p><p>Members of Congress have a responsibility to the American people and to their constituents to understand what it is they`re voting on, what it is they`re being asked to do, and that`s why we`re going through this, frankly, very difficult process.</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: Negotiations continued behind the scenes, but there were indications final action might wait until next week. We`ll have more on this story later in the program tonight.</p><p>The FBI has begun investigating possible fraud at the heart of the financial crisis. It was widely reported today Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and AIG are now under scrutiny. The probe is part of a wider investigation of alleged corporate fraud.</p><p>Wall Street was calmer today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 29 points to close at 10,825. The Nasdaq rose 2 points to close above 2,155.</p><p>The House of Representatives easily passed a catch-all spending bill today worth $630 billion. In a victory for Republicans, it lifted a 25- year-old ban on off-shore oil drilling.</p><p>There was also record funding for the military and $25 billion in aid for auto makers, plus 2,300 special projects known as earmarks. The Senate is expected to pass the bill, as well.</p><p>North Korea banned U.N. inspectors from its main nuclear reactor site today. It was latest step toward restarting the Yongbyon facility. A nuclear test explosion was conducted there two years ago.</p><p>The International Atomic Energy Agency announced today`s move by the North, formally known as the Democratic People`s Republic of Korea.</p><p>MELISSA FLEMING, IAEA Spokeswoman: There are no more seals and surveillance equipment in place at the reprocessing facility. The DPRK has also informed the IAEA inspectors that they plan to introduce nuclear material to the reprocessing plant in one week`s time.</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: Also today, the European Union warned Iran is very close to being able to arm a nuclear warhead. The E.U. also said it does appear Iran had a nuclear arms program in the past, despite repeated denials.</p><p>The Iraqi parliament approved a law for provincial elections today. The measure had been mired in a dispute between Arabs and Kurds over sharing power in the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. Those differences haven`t been settled: The two sides have now agreed to work on a separate law for the Kurdish regions.</p><p>In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said today`s action is an encouraging sign.</p><p>GEOFF MORRELL, Pentagon Press Secretary: This is exactly what we have been looking for. In fact, it`s what the secretary had spoke to the Senate about yesterday.</p><p>We need more tangible signs of reconciliation. We need more political progress. We need more democratic activity, and that`s what this is.</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: The legislation still has to be approved by a three- member presidential panel. And it will push back the deadline for holding elections in Iraq to January 31st of next year.</p><p>A federal appeals court today upheld making visitors from Arab and Muslim nations register with U.S. immigration officials. The rule was imposed after 9/11. It affected two dozen countries, most of the Muslim. The government has since phased out the rule, but that information that was gathered remains in a federal database.</p><p>Japan ushered in a new political leader today. Taro Aso took power as prime minister and promised emergency measures to jump-start the ailing Japanese economy. He also vowed to support the war on terror.</p><p>Aso is a conservative and the grandson of a prominent postwar prime minister. He`s also the first Roman Catholic to be prime minister of Japan, a mostly Buddhist and Shinto nation.</p><p>Thousands of people returned to Galveston, Texas, today, nearly two weeks after Hurricane Ike. Traffic backed up more than 10 miles before dawn on the main highway onto the island.</p><p>Many of the 57,000 residents were returning for the first time since the storm. The mayor warned people to bring their own water and prepare for rats, snakes, and mosquitoes.</p><p>That`s it for the news summary tonight. Now: reaction to the administration`s bailout plan from the presidential candidates, Capitol Hill, Marcus and York, and Main Street; plus, a <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>\"Close Up.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: The struggle to reach a deal on a bailout proposal shook up the political world today, both on the campaign trail, and at the White House, and on Capitol Hill.</p><p>First, on the presidential campaign, <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>spoke to reporters in New York City early this afternoon.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JOHN MCCAIN </nameText></person>(R), Arizona: Tomorrow morning, I`ll suspend my campaign and return to Washington after speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative. I`ve spoken to Senator Obama and informed him of my decision, and I`ve asked him to join me.</p><p>I`m calling on the president to convene a leadership meeting from both houses of Congress, including Senator Obama and myself. It`s time for both parties to come together to solve this problem.</p><p>We must meet as Americans, not as Democrats or Republicans, and we must meet until this crisis is resolved.</p><p>I`m directing my campaign to work with the Obama campaign and the Commission on Presidential Debates to delay Friday night`s debate until we have taken action to address this crisis.</p><p>I`m confident that, before the markets open on Monday, we can achieve consensus on legislation that will stabilize our financial markets, protect taxpayers and homeowners, and earn the confidence of the American people.</p><p>All we must do to achieve this is temporarily set politics aside, and I`m committed to doing so.</p><p>Following September 11th, our national leaders came together at a time of crisis. We must show that kind of patriotism now.</p><p>Americans across our country lament the fact that partisan divisions in Washington have prevented us from addressing our national challenges. Now is our chance to come together to prove that Washington is once again capable of leading this country.</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>was in Clearwater, Florida. This afternoon, he told reporters he phoned McCain this morning about the Treasury proposal.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA </nameText></person>(D), Illinois: Senator McCain, as I mentioned, returned my call this afternoon. We agreed that this was a critical time for everyone; Democrats and Republicans need to come together to help to stabilize the economy.</p><p>I have been in constant contact with leadership in Congress. I`ve talked to Secretary Paulson just about every day. I spoke to him twice today, indicated to him that I intend to do everything that`s required to be helpful.</p><p>And we should all do everything that`s necessary to get a bill passed that contains the proposals that I mentioned.</p><p>There are times for politics, and then there are times to rise above politics and do what`s right for the country. And this is one of those times.</p><p>I don`t think any of us enjoy putting taxpayer dollars at risk, but the risk of doing nothing is economic catastrophe potentially, and that is a risk we cannot afford to take.</p><p>No matter how this begun, this is no longer a Democratic or a Republican problem. It is an American problem; it requires an American solution.</p><p>With respect to the debates, it`s my belief that this is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who, in approximately 40 days, will be responsible for dealing with this mess.</p><p>And I think that it is -- it is going to be part of the president`s job to deal with more than one thing at once.</p><p>I think there`s no reason why we can`t be constructive in helping to solve this problem and also tell the American people what we believe, and where we stand, and where we want to take the country.</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: Back in Washington, the president was expected to make his case tonight for an urgent deal on his rescue plan for the financial system. The president decided to give the speech as the Treasury secretary and the Federal Reserve chairman were facing a skeptical audience on Capitol Hill.</p><p>NewsHour congressional correspondent Kwame Holman has that part of the story.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), New York: Let us be clear: Americans are furious.</p><p>KWAME HOLMAN: At the Capitol, another rough reception for the Bush administration`s $700 billion bailout plan for financial and other firms.</p><p>Joint Economic Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer gave the lay of the land to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke at his second day of testimony in support of the administration approach.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: I am sure that every single one of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle has heard what I have heard from my constituents: amazement, astonishment, and intense anger.</p><p>KWAME HOLMAN: But Bernanke, as he did yesterday, said the view of the independent Federal Reserve is that not acting could be calamitous.</p><p>BEN BERNANKE, Federal Reserve Chairman: Stabilization of our financial system is an essential precondition for economic recovery. I urge the Congress to act quickly to address the grave threats to financial stability that we currently face.</p><p>KWAME HOLMAN: Despite growing questions about the cost and scope of the bailout, the need for action also was supported today by the independent Congressional Budget Office.</p><p>Its director, Peter Orszag, predicted \"market chaos\" without a bailout that could lead to \"a financial market meltdown, maybe on the magnitude of the Great Depression.\"</p><p>At the Joint Economic hearing, Bernanke said U.S. economic activity already has \"broadly decelerated.\"</p><p>BEN BERNANKE: The intensification of financial stress in recent weeks, which will make lenders still more cautious about extending credit to households and business, could prove a significant further drag on growth. The downside risks to the outlook thus remain a significant concern.</p><p>KWAME HOLMAN: As he did yesterday, Chairman Schumer asked if the bailout could get started with less than the $700 billion in authority the Treasury Department called for to buy compromised mortgage-backed assets from private firms.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: In your estimation, do you need all of this money now? How much do you need right now? Can you explain why, if you disagree with this idea, why $700 billion is needed immediately?</p><p>BEN BERNANKE: I think the concern is that the markets need to have confidence that this problem will be attacked with sufficient force and addressed. Insufficient measures could be perceived as dribs and drabs, and it may not have the sufficient force to address the confidence issue.</p><p>KWAME HOLMAN: Maryland Democrat Elijah Cummings asked Bernanke to spell out how getting bad assets off the books of big financial firms would help ordinary mom and pop citizens.</p><p>REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D), Maryland: What do you say to them, that the superstar that you are, that what affect will this have on them?</p><p>BEN BERNANKE: The credit system is like the plumbing. It permeates throughout the entire system. And our modern economy cannot grow, it cannot create jobs, it cannot provide housing without effectively working credit markets.</p><p>KWAME HOLMAN: Texas Republican Kevin Brady echoed the public statements of many members of Congress since the bailout was unveiled.</p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), Texas: When we listen to folks back home -- and I don`t think we always give our constituents the credit for smarts, as we should -- and their point is they simply don`t want to reward this risky behavior.</p><p>Their feeling is that many of them -- and I agree, to a great extent - - why don`t we allow the free market system to correct itself?</p><p>BEN BERNANKE: My response is that the pain would be very significant. It would be very difficult for Main Street. If this credit system broke down, it would be very costly to average people.</p><p>Here`s a better solution. The better solution is to recognize that things went wrong, we`ve got a problem now that we can solve, if we address it with enough force.</p><p>KWAME HOLMAN: This afternoon, Bernanke was joined by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. There, members` views of the bailout plan ranged from wariness to hostility.</p><p>Ohio Republican Deborah Pryce spoke for many on the panel.</p><p>REP. DEBORAH PRYCE (R), Ohio: Right now, what we have before us is a \"trust me\" proposal. Our jobs as representatives is to do the people`s will. And so far, you`re a far cry from having the people on your side.</p><p>We can`t say to them, \"Trust me, trust the Fed, trust the Treasury,\" because they already feel that that trust has been breached.</p><p>I want to make the case -- I want you to make the case to me today so I can make the case to my constituents. Yours is a sales job, gentlemen.</p><p>KWAME HOLMAN: Republican Peter King of New York questioned the power that would be held by Secretary Paulson, who has only four months left in office.</p><p>REP. PETER KING (R), New York: No matter how the final language is, though, the reality is there`s going to be extraordinary power in the Treasury secretary -- and I think that`s warranted. I`m not questioning that.</p><p>I`m just saying, if you can give us some assurances as to how you think that, no matter who the Treasury secretary is, will be used properly and what will be done during the transition to make sure that the next administration hits the ground running.</p><p>HENRY PAULSON, U.S. Treasury Secretary: There will be -- and Ben Bernanke can talk to this, also, because we are -- as we work through this, we are going to be -- we have a number of very good ideas, I believe, on how to execute this program, but nothing like this has been done before.</p><p>So we`re going to need help and advice, and we`re going to, I`m sure, do some things better than others and make change a bit as we go along. And, clearly, we will be working with the next administration and working carefully on a transition.</p><p>This is something that all of us have to own. This is for the United States of America and for the American people.</p><p>KWAME HOLMAN: Illinois Democrat Luis Gutierrez raised another issue that`s roiling the public, whether executives in rescued companies still might reap big-pay bonuses.</p><p>Paulson initially warned limits on executive compensation could scare away companies from participating in the program. Now, he`s reconsidering.</p><p>REP. LUIS GUTIERREZ (D), Illinois: Please explain to me what we`re going to do about these executive compensations, given the fact that we are asking the American taxpayer to sacrifice and put $700 billion out there, when other people have been lining their pockets and are continuing to line their pockets today.</p><p>I want to make sure it doesn`t happen tomorrow, because, politically, that`s very embarrassing to me.</p><p>HENRY PAULSON: Well, it should be embarrassing politically and substantively and any other way.</p><p>I believe we need to figure out some way to incorporate this in this plan, but it has to be a way to incorporate it so the plan can still be effective. And one of our big objectives here in the plan -- and what I think it takes to make this plan work -- is to, as opposed to some other plan...</p><p>KWAME HOLMAN: After two days of testimony, negotiations between the administration and Congress will continue behind the scenes.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: Next, political analysis of today`s developments, and to Margaret Warner.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: And for that, we`re joined by Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus and Byron York of the National Review.</p><p>Ruth, Byron, <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>both said today it`s time to rise above politics. But wasn`t today, at least as far as the two of them were concerned, mostly about politics?</p><p>BYRON YORK, National Journal: Yes, it certainly was. I talked to a senior person at the McCain campaign not long ago and said, \"Well, why did he come out and say this?\"</p><p>And they said, \"Well, he saw today that the administration plan had just run into so much opposition.\" I think the headline of the Washington Post on the front page was that the Bush plan had met bipartisan outrage.</p><p>So he felt like he needed to go back and do that, which I think, if he had stopped there, would be a very, very smart move, because these guys are senators and they`re both the leaders of their party now. So the idea that they would be taking a leading role in the biggest thing that the Congress has done in quite a while would be reasonable.</p><p>Then, he took the step farther to say he`s suspending all political activity -- political activity, campaign activity, meaning the debate, as well.</p><p>Obviously, Obama has said no. And they appear to be in this kind of standoff right now, because I said, \"Well, OK, now Obama has just said no. What are you going to do?\"</p><p>And they said, \"Well, we said we`re going to suspend all campaign activity.\"</p><p>Perhaps there could be a compromise. You know, the debate is supposed to be about foreign policy, national security. Maybe it could be changed. Who knows what kind of compromise could be reached?</p><p>RUTH MARCUS, Washington Post: I thought the candidates had done actually a reasonably good job in the last few weeks of trying to keep politics to the extent that they could out of it. They were sniping at each other, but they weren`t sniping in ways that affected this deal.</p><p>And I completely agree, if he had stopped at, \"It`s really important, and <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>and I are going to hold hands together and get us over this patch,\" which is what the Obama campaign argues that it was trying to achieve today, that would have been great.</p><p>I think that the notion that he`s not going to debate -- first of all, everybody understands we don`t need <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>in the room negotiating the fine print to get this fixed, nor <person><nameText>Barack Obama, </nameText></person>and they can take the time to have the debate.</p><p>And it just brought politics hugely into the picture. <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>was out there, the way I saw it, saying, \"I`m -- hi, I`m the one who really cares about the economy. I just\" -- he just, from the Obama campaign`s perspective, has literally just hung up the phone with Obama and saying, \"Let`s do a joint statement,\" and went out there, and unilaterally made this challenge to make him look like he was the one who really cared about the economy.</p><p>That is not a good way to get politics out of the picture.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: So what was McCain`s calculation here? I mean, does the McCain campaign think this makes him look like a leader?</p><p>BYRON YORK: Well, first of all, it does put pressure on Obama to -- I mean, he`s out campaigning, and he basically said in his statement this afternoon, Well, you all know where to reach me. You can call me, and I`ll help, if I can.</p><p>So it does make McCain look much more involved. The other thing you have to remember, though, is this comes on the same day as a Washington Post poll has just come out showing Obama with a much bigger lead over McCain than we had previously thought.</p><p>Also, the number of people who say the economy is their top issue for president went from 37 percent a couple of weeks ago to 50 percent now; war in Iraq, 9 percent; health care, 5 percent, much, much smaller.</p><p>McCain had a bad week last week on the economy, so this was a way to retake that issue.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: And the Obama people, did they have to think long and hard about whether to call McCain`s bluff, at least over the debate?</p><p>RUTH MARCUS: In terms of turning up? I think they`re hopeful that we`re getting close enough to a deal on the Hill and that nothing concentrates the mind like a Wall Street meltdown, that this will all sort of -- the problem will evaporate and fix itself.</p><p>But I think their position and the debate commission`s position is, \"Let`s go ahead.\"</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: They`re going ahead.</p><p>RUTH MARCUS: And, I mean, I just think they feel like they were played.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: So where does that leave McCain now? If the commission has essentially come out, as you said, with a statement saying, \"We`re going ahead,\" what does McCain do?</p><p>RUTH MARCUS: Doesn`t turn up?</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: Starting tomorrow.</p><p>RUTH MARCUS: Starts to write Treasury regulations? I don`t know. And the notion, for example, that this is -- we`re at such a grave time that he needs to pull his campaign ads, you know, that doesn`t actually help the economy. It helps the economy to spend a little bit.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: Now, what is the situation with this bailout, Byron, on the Hill? I mean, is McCain right? He says he`s talked to a lot of Republicans up there and that this thing looks like it could be going down, unless something significant happens...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BYRON YORK: Well, there`s -- I mean, there`s significant agreement that the administration`s plan is not a great one and it`s got to be significantly changed.</p><p>And if you do listen to McCain and Obama, they have a number of similarities in their approach, as well as that of the other members of Congress.</p><p>There are huge areas for compromise and agreement here. There`s got to be some sort of oversight, rather major oversight, because the original bill had a clause in it that said that the secretary of Treasury`s decisions were not reviewable. There`s a lot of room for agreement there.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: But, I mean, is -- are the reports right that really this bill is mostly in trouble with Republicans on the Hill?</p><p>RUTH MARCUS: It`s just fascinating to watch the revolt of the Republicans and complaining about offering unfettered authority to the executive branch. You have to kind of laugh at that after all these years.</p><p>The reality is, is that I think the divisions are great, but they are greater than they appear. In other words, this is the kind of -- everybody understands, in the end, we need a fix, we need a big fix, and we need it quickly.</p><p>And, therefore, we will reach agreement -- I hope Congress and the administration will reach agreement on this pretty quickly.</p><p>And if you look -- for example, yesterday, the candidates were largely in agreement on their statements of principles. If they got in there and helped, or if they sent, as I think would be better, just sent their economic team to sit down with the leadership -- and, by the way, both -- Senator Obama has been on the phone with the leadership, has been talking with Secretary Paulson, to Chairman Bernanke -- that could help solve the problem.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: But, meanwhile, we do have the president of the United States who decided things were dicey enough that he`s going to come out and give a primetime speech tonight. What does he have to do, Byron?</p><p>BYRON YORK: I don`t think he can sell the plan, the original three- page plan as written. He just can`t, and it`s because of the accountability reasons.</p><p>As far as Republicans are concerned, I mean, they are concerned about, \"Do we have to give all this money to these institutions? Is there some other way to do it than just giving it to them?\"</p><p>He does have to address the Democratic concerns, which is shared by a lot of Republicans, about helping individual mortgage-holders.</p><p>And there is this executive compensation thing, which both of the candidates, the presidential candidates, agree there`s going to be some sort of clause in that.</p><p>RUTH MARCUS: Which -- it`s a silly issue, by the way.</p><p>BYRON YORK: It`s a very politically strong issue.</p><p>RUTH MARCUS: Yes. Substantively, very silly.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: As you could hear from Representative Gutierrez, though, it`s a very politically potent issue.</p><p>BYRON YORK: Absolutely.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: Do you think the president -- what do you think he has to do tonight, Ruth? Does he have to, for instance, signal that we`ve got to get a deal, but we`re willing to make all of these adjustments?</p><p>RUTH MARCUS: Yes, I think both. I have a kind of modest proposal for the president. I think it`s time for another Andrews Air Force...</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: Speechwriters, listen.</p><p>RUTH MARCUS: I think it`s time for another Andrews Air Force Base summit. He should send the Treasury secretary, ask the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the congressional leadership, and economic advisers from the two campaigns to go out to Andrews, report back by Monday morning with something that everybody agrees on.</p><p>I think that is completely doable and would be a very good way to get this solved, unless they are much closer than we understand they are at this moment, unless they really think it could be done, you know, essentially, overnight.</p><p>BYRON YORK: Well, do you think it does make sense, if there were that summit, that you`d have the two congressional leaders of the party, McCain and Obama, off talking about something else at a debate? Wouldn`t they want to be seen to be involved in that?</p><p>RUTH MARCUS: I think it would be -- I think it would be very odd to have a debate at this point that sort of pretends as if we`re not having an economic crisis swirling around us.</p><p>I think the debate should go on. I think the topic of the debate should, if not change, at least expand to include that. But they`re not the economic experts. They`ve got folks who understand the details.</p><p>MARGARET WARNER: Byron, Ruth, we have to leave it there for now. We`ll be back. Thank you both.</p><p>BYRON YORK: Thank you.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: And now the view beyond Washington and Wall Street, and to <person><nameText>Jeffrey Brown.</nameText></person></p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: And for that, we`re joined by four business journalists from around the nation.</p><p>Kathy Kristof is a syndicated personal finance columnist in Los Angeles. Her column appears in the L.A. Times and elsewhere. Keith Reed is a reporter for the Cincinnati Enquirer. Shirley Leung is business editor for the Boston Globe. And Doug Smith is a reporter for the Charlotte Observer.</p><p>Well, I want to ask each of you first to talk about what`s happening in your region`s economy.</p><p>Kathy Kristof, in what ways is the financial crisis spreading outward?</p><p>KATHY KRISTOF, Personal Finance Columnist: Well, we have a higher- than-average unemployment rate. We have difficulty, like everywhere else, in getting money to finance both business and real estate.</p><p>We have an extremely -- or we`ve had a very active real estate industry that is moribund right now. Again, the people who are really working hard are bankruptcy lawyers.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: Real estate, what other kinds of businesses or sectors are being affected?</p><p>KATHY KRISTOF: Well, almost everything. I mean, we have a very big small-business community, and they need capital to survive. So when capital dries up, you have no growth.</p><p>We have a big entertainment industry that also needs capital. And we`ve actually had A-list people being denied loans. These are fairly unheard-of frames of events. I mean, this is an unusual period.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: All right, Keith Reed in Cincinnati, how do you see this spreading out to where you are?</p><p>KEITH REED, Cincinnati Enquirer: Well, here in Ohio, you sort of have a tale of almost three separate states. If you`re here in the southern, near the southwest part of the state, you`ve got many corporate headquarters, and it all depends on the sector that those companies are in.</p><p>If you have Proctor &amp; Gamble, which, of course, is an international company, that gets a little bit more insulated and sells products that everybody has to use, that company isn`t feeling the strain of the U.S. economy to the extent that many other firms are.</p><p>But here on Main Street, in southern Ohio, many people are worried about their jobs and their investments, their 401(k)s. If you go to the northern part of the state here, where you have a lot of businesses, companies and towns that are closer to Detroit, closer to the auto industry, they are hurting, obviously, because the auto industry is hurting.</p><p>And they need a lot more help. And people, I think, are feeling a lot more desperate right now.</p><p>Then you have the middle of the state, the middle of Ohio, which is very rural, a lot of farmland, a lot of people who make their money from agriculture and those sorts of things.</p><p>And, of course, they`re going to be affected a little bit more in their business in terms of their personal incomes by things like fuel costs, input costs, because they are actually running operations, in many instances. Sometimes family or large agribusinesses that are going to be affected by these input costs.</p><p>And you have to remember that this Wall Street storm is still coming on the heels of a hurricane that not only did damage in the gulf and drove up oil and commodity prices, but also blew through a significant part of the Midwest and did some damage up here, as well.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: Shirley Leung in Boston and New England, harder to get credit, more foreclosures, what are you seeing?</p><p>SHIRLEY LEUNG, Boston Globe: All of the above. First of all, you know, we have a big tech presence here. And the tech companies are really worried about companies cutting spending.</p><p>You know, a lot of them relied on investment firms, like the Lehman Brothers of the world and the Merrill Lynches of the world, to fuel -- to buy, you know, software programs. But, clearly, that`s going to be drastically cut back.</p><p>Also, the start-ups here are going to suffer. A lot of them already delayed IPOs. Zipcar is delaying its IPO, and it is probably the leader in car-sharing.</p><p>Also, venture capital is going to dry up and be -- and they`re going to take -- they`re going to have more -- scrutinize more of the start-ups, in terms of when they give out money.</p><p>Another sector here is commercial real estate. I would say that probably at the beginning of the year that was probably the one bright spot in our economy here.</p><p>It takes a little bit longer to build buildings here, so we`re kind of catching up with the rest of the country. We have billions of dollars of commercial real estate projects kind of either in the ground or in the pipeline.</p><p>But a lot of that is probably going to grind to a halt, because it`s really hard to get a commercial loan these days. I mean, that`s probably one of the hardest-hit sectors in this current credit crunch.</p><p>Lastly, we have a really big financial services firm or industry here, mutual fund firms, from Putnam to MFS to Fidelity.</p><p>Now, they`ll probably take a hit in the short term. People will be pulling money out of their funds and probably sticking them in their mattresses the way things are going now.</p><p>But, oddly enough, ironically, with the realignment of Wall Street, Boston may benefit. Maybe New York won`t be the epicenter of Wall Street anymore. Maybe centers will pop up in Boston and maybe in Charlotte, where Bank of America is.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: All right. And Doug Smith in Charlotte, you`ve got some big banks there, don`t you, and some of them have been very involved in the news lately?</p><p>DOUG SMITH, Charlotte Observer: That`s true, with the Bank of America and Wachovia, we certainly would feel anything that happens in the financial industry. People here are very concerned about their jobs.</p><p>Bank of America is acquiring Merrill Lynch, but in that acquisition they expect to lay off thousands of people. Wachovia has already laid off thousands, mostly in its mortgage operations.</p><p>Both banks -- they`re not the only game in town, but together they employ about 30,000 people and wield a lot of weight, especially in the Center City, which has seen a condo, high-rise boom over the past couple of years.</p><p>Well, now, you know, the main buyers of those condos are bank employees, and they`re so nervous now about their jobs, those sales are almost dried up.</p><p>Consumers in general are feeling it. The employment rate is up. Food prices are up, and salaries are down, as companies cut back on jobs and lay off people. And recently, gasoline has been in short supply. Gas lines have come back to Charlotte.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: Kathy Kristof, let`s turn to attitudes. I mean, one part of a financial crisis is about a crisis of confidence. And you certainly heard in those hearings earlier, the anger out there, some resentment.</p><p>What are you hearing from people you interview, neighbors, your fellows at work? What are you hearing about their attitudes about this?</p><p>KATHY KRISTOF: Well, they`re livid. The idea that this huge financial crisis is going to be thrown onto the back of taxpayers when, you know, all that most people know about Wall Street is that these guys walk away with $25 million on a regular basis, you know, as annual compensation.</p><p>So those guys are going to walk away free and clear, no additional checks and balances on what they can do. They`ve lost this absolutely astounding amount of money. And now taxpayers are saying, \"Well, OK -- well, what we want you to do is give them some more.\"</p><p>People are flabbergasted, absolutely flabbergasted and horrified. They don`t really know what needs to be done, but they know that, if something is done, there needs to be a lot of regulation of how this money is actually used and spent, because it`s their money.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: Keith Reed, what are you hearing?</p><p>KEITH REED: Two words: fear and resentment. Fear -- Shirley said something a little bit earlier, my former colleague said something earlier about people stashing money under the mattress.</p><p>And I did hear a little bit of that sentiment in a package that I worked on over the weekend for our Sunday edition, where many investment advisers are talking to their clients right now and trying to reassure them that one of the worst things that you could do at a time like this is actually pull completely out, because you might end up taking some longer- term losses than you would if you stayed in the market right now, especially in terms of people who are younger and who have 401(k)s and need to be worried about their retirement accounts.</p><p>But people simply don`t know what to do at this point. They are hearing things like -- and this is a phrase I heard repeated many times over the past week -- that this is the worst financial crisis that this country has seen since the Great Depression. And when you are an average Main Street worker or consumer and you hear those types of things, you get nervous.</p><p>The second thing is the resentment. They want to know how in the world the U.S. government can bail out Wall Street to the tune of $700 billion when the country is already in debt, people are losing their jobs, and many people don`t know, in some instances, where their next meal is going to come from?</p><p>Now, that may sound a little bit drastic, but you have to consider, again, the auto worker, the person who works in agriculture, the person who was just laid off from their job who maybe even worked on Wall Street, who doesn`t know where that next paycheck is going to come from, and they hear the U.S. government saying that they`re going to take tax money, the money that they`ve earned, that we`ve earned as taxpayers, and give it to someone who makes millions on Wall Street.</p><p>Definitely fear and resentment are the two greatest sentiments that I`ve heard over the past week.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: Let me ask Shirley Leung, I understand your reporters or your paper was working on a story in which you talked to some CEOs in the region for their reaction. What was that group saying?</p><p>SHIRLEY LEUNG: It was very surprising. You know, CEOs are eternal optimists. They always see the silver lining in everything, and everything is always upbeat.</p><p>But these -- the CEOs we interviewed, from tech to banking to manufacturing, they were overwhelmingly deeply troubled by the turmoil on Wall Street, and they were really concerned that it would affect a broad swath -- hurt a broad swath of industries here, I mean, to the point where, you know, you have politicians debating, you know, whether or not to do the $700 billion plan.</p><p>These CEOs flat out said, \"We absolutely need this plan to stabilize the financial system.\"</p><p>Moreover, a lot of these CEOs were saying, \"You know what? We are first in line when it comes to supporting free market principles. But given what we`ve seen, given what we`re going through, given that we can`t get a loan right now, we absolutely need government intervention to save the financial system.\"</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: Well, Doug Smith, that goes to this question that`s out there, is the sense -- the question of urgency. Should Congress act real quickly, or should they take their time and get it right? What are you hearing from people?</p><p>DOUG SMITH: Well, I think people hear would favor the \"take your time\" option. They`ve seen too many cases where the government has rushed into things and made the mess worse.</p><p>And so what I`m hearing is, let`s do take the time, let`s get it right, and let`s make sure that the companies that caused the crisis don`t make windfall profits out of a bailout, especially the corporate execs.</p><p>They don`t want to see golden parachutes. They want to see those executive salaries held in check.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: Do you have -- staying with you, as we heard, the president is going to speak tonight. Do you have a sense of what he needs to say or what people might be wanting to hear from him?</p><p>DOUG SMITH: Well, I think this may be kind of like wishing on Aladdin`s lamp, but I think they would like to hear that their taxes are not going to go up, that their savings and retirement accounts will be safe, and that these executives won`t end up making windfall profits out of the bailout.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: Kathy Kristof, what do you want to hear from the president tonight?</p><p>KATHY KRISTOF: What I want to hear I don`t think is possible. I think what people need to hear is, what are the long-term repercussions of this bailout?</p><p>When you add the better part of a trillion dollars to your national debt, you create the likelihood of one of two things: much higher taxes in the future, or inflation that allows the government to pay back that debt with cheaper dollars.</p><p>Either one of those has a very direct impact on every citizen in the country. I think people need to know whether this is absolutely necessary, if there`s a cheaper way to do it, if there`s a way to make sure that it never happens again, and exactly how they`re going to pay for this in the long run.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: And, Keith Reed, we just have about 30 seconds. What do you want to hear? What do you think you`ll hear?</p><p>KEITH REED: What I`d like to hear and what people I`ve interviewed would like to hear is accountability. Who is going to pay for this? And when I say \"Who is going to pay for this?\" I mean financially.</p><p>Who`s going to wind up footing the bill, other than the taxpayer? How are we going to see some return on the investments that we`re making on Wall Street? And who`s going to pay for this punitively?</p><p>Will this FBI investigation that we`ve been hearing about actually lead to any indictments? Will anyone be held responsible for putting the taxpayers in this position? Do I think I`m going to hear it? Not likely.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: OK. And, Shirley Leung, we have time for a response from you on that.</p><p>SHIRLEY LEUNG: Very simply, people want to know if this will work. That`s it.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: That`s it?</p><p>SHIRLEY LEUNG: Yes.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: Simple as that, but not quite so simple, huh?</p><p>SHIRLEY LEUNG: Exactly.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFFREY BROWN</nameText></person>: All right, Shirley Leung, Doug Smith, Keith Reed, and Kathy Kristof, thanks all very much.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: Now, the third in our election year \"Close Up\" series. We continue with a look at how the candidates deal with adversity, as seen by people who know them well. Tonight, Judy Woodruff reports on <person><nameText>John McCain.</nameText></person></p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Anyone familiar with the heroic story of how <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>survived five-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam knows he is not a quitter. Orson Swindle was in a nearby cell.</p><p>ORSON SWINDLE, Former Vietnam POW: <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>was tested in prison. He was tested by getting shot down and almost dying, being abused and having the opportunity to say goodbye to all of the hardship and possible death and go home, and he said, \"No, I`m not going to do that.\"</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Friend and fellow Arizona Senator Jon Kyl says that when McCain finally was released, he made a point of turning to the future.</p><p>SEN. JON KYL (R), Arizona: You know, for a long time, he wouldn`t even talk about it -- he certainly didn`t dwell on his experiences in Vietnam. He really wanted to put it behind him. And you saw him do that.</p><p>John deals with adversity in a way a little different than most people, and perhaps it`s because he`s been through so much. He shrugs it off.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: After he entered politics, McCain faced a different form of adversity, growing out of his involvement in the late 1980s with a big campaign donor, savings and loan executive Charles Keating.</p><p>Federal investigators accused McCain and four other U.S. senators of improperly aiding Keating and his business. The scandal dominated the national headlines.</p><p>Dan Nowicki is a reporter for the Arizona Republic.</p><p>DAN NOWICKI, The Arizona Republic: It looked really bad. It was like here are -- here are five senators -- I think 1/20th of the United States Senate is called by this one guy to go intimidate regulators. I mean, they deny that they were trying to intimidate them, but that`s how it came out.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: In the end, the Senate Ethics Committee accused McCain of exercising \"poor judgment.\" Longtime McCain staffer Mark Buse.</p><p>MARK BUSE, Chief of Staff, McCain Senate Office: It was a tough time, but, you know, he soldiered on. Every day, he showed up in the office every day. He didn`t disappear. Every day, he was there. Every day, he fought. Every day, he still did his business.</p><p>SEN. JON KYL: It was very difficult for John because, first of all, one of the primary attributes that he thinks is important, both in his life, as well as others, is the concept of honor. So when his honor or his integrity was called into question with the so-called Keating Five issue, it hurt him deeply.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: After the scandal, McCain became a zealous proponent of campaign finance reform.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JOHN MCCAIN </nameText></person>(R), Arizona: We will pass campaign finance reform legislation and finally follow the American people`s will.</p><p>SEN. JON KYL: His efforts at campaign reform, and lobbying reform, and all of the other reforms that he`s instigated are partially to demonstrate that he believes in the kind of open and clean government that we all would like to see.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: There would be other setbacks for McCain, right up to the current presidential race. Last year, his campaign ran so badly aground, he almost had to drop out.</p><p>Campaign adviser and friend Senator Lindsey Graham blames what he calls mistaken priorities.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina: We were running on the idea that we`re inevitably going to win. From an operational point of view, we`d created an infrastructure we couldn`t -- that wasn`t sustainable, and it all came crashing down.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: In the summer of 2007, McCain regrouped and slashed campaign staff up to the highest levels, including even the campaign manager, Terry Nelson.</p><p>TERRY NELSON, Former McCain Campaign Manager: My own perspective on it is we just kind of got to a point of, you know, there needed to be a change. I think it was a very tough thing. It was a very tough thing.</p><p>SEN. JON KYL: He kind of cinched up his belt. He fired a lot of people on the campaign. They didn`t have any money left. He said, \"Let`s just try to focus on New Hampshire. Let`s focus on the things that we know we can do. We`ll stop spending money.\"</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But the story of how and why McCain let his campaign collapse after being the chosen frontrunner brings his management abilities into question, particularly when the campaign is the biggest budget the senator has been personally responsible for.</p><p>DAN NOWICKI: I think he probably delegated too much authority to the campaign manager at the time. And, well, I think he was shocked when he realized he was almost out of money.</p><p>I mean, he is in charge of the campaign. It was his campaign. He probably should have been playing closer attention to some of those details.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, has watched and worked with Senator McCain.</p><p>NORMAN ORNSTEIN, American Enterprise Institute: I always thought that this was not a man who could run things very well. His office was filled with people who were deeply loyal to him, but there was a kind of chaos, which was great in the Senate office, but that you wondered about otherwise.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Senate staffers describe McCain`s open-door management differently, as someone who`s willing to listen to all points of view.</p><p>MARK BUSE: He keeps the doors open on his office. His office isn`t a shrine. It`s not, you know, cordoned off.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Buse is the senator`s chief of staff.</p><p>MARK BUSE: He`s extremely open. He wants you just to talk and say what you think. He doesn`t want you just to answer yes. He doesn`t want you to say, \"How high?\" He wants you to push back. And it`s what he does when there`s an important issue before him.</p><p>He`ll bring three, four or five people in, and he literally calls on you one by one. You know, \"What do you think? What do you think? What do you think?\"</p><p>And he has the staff engaged in the debate, and then he makes the decision. He always makes the final decision.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: It`s a style that is very different from President Bush. Terry Nelson, who earlier worked on Bush`s campaign, says the differences in how he and McCain manage are striking.</p><p>TERRY NELSON: It`s not the Bush world where there`s a very strict order and hierarchy in decision-making. He manages a bit through the tension of the process rather than through placing trust in just one or two people.</p><p>He wants people to be engaged, discussing -- I don`t know that he wants conflict, but he definitely wants there to be a critical discussion about what`s going on in the campaign.</p><p>NORMAN ORNSTEIN: It is not at all clear that John McCain`s talents would employ themselves well in either structuring a White House staff or running the huge and sprawling federal bureaucracy.</p><p>Whether McCain could understand that what it takes to be a chief executive is a very different approach than what it takes to be a good senator is another of the question marks that we still have.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The rollercoaster ride over the course of this year`s presidential bid for the White House wasn`t the first time McCain has faced campaign turmoil.</p><p>Eight years ago, in his first run for president, McCain came off a victory over George W. Bush in New Hampshire only to be crushed in South Carolina.</p><p>The contest was brutal and was marked by lies from rogue Bush supporters that McCain had fathered an illegitimate black child. McCain accused Bush of conducting a \"character assassination.\"</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JOHN MCCAIN</nameText></person>: His supporters have been calling me everything from a liar to a hypocrite and other things. I don`t think that works in South Carolina. I don`t think it works in America.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: He felt angry. He was disillusioned. President Bush ran a very good campaign to be a party leader. We ran movement campaign that did not connect.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JOHN MCCAIN</nameText></person>: I know what it`s like to take a punch. And I`ll tell you what: This has aroused every bit of the fighter pilot in me that I ever had, and I`m ready to go!</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: We`ve learned from that experience, and John doesn`t look back in bitterness. We won South Carolina this time.</p><p>And you know what I had to say on behalf of John? Eight years ago, this was the death of <person><nameText>John McCain. </nameText></person>This is where it all happened.</p><p>Look what John`s doing: He`s helped President Bush in 2000, 2004. He`s provided leadership on the war that allowed us to turn it around. He can take us in a new direction that we need to go.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Since 2000, McCain has evolved from a senator with a reputation mainly as a maverick and an outsider into a dealmaker, working with Democrats on the reform of immigration and campaign finance laws.</p><p>Senator Jon Kyl says that shows McCain`s ability to bounce back from adversity.</p><p>SEN. JON KYL: I disagreed with him on McCain-Feingold legislation. He failed, and he failed, and he failed, and he kept trying, and he kept trying, and eventually it became law. And he has made this point over and over again about other things. He said, \"I`ll keep making this famous until we get it done.\"</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But former Republican Senator Lincoln Chafee sees McCain`s political evolution as troubling. Chafee was the only other Republican besides McCain who voted against President Bush`s original tax cuts, a position Chafee says is one of many McCain has now reversed.</p><p>FORMER SEN. LINCOLN CHAFEE (R), Rhode Island: And now we`re seeing a different <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>in 2008 presidential run, completely different, saying make the tax cuts permanent, drill, drill, drill, and appoint Supreme Court judges similar to Bush-Cheney, completely different.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Another sort of change has been on display since the crisis in the financial markets hit recently. After years of generally repudiating government regulation, McCain last week endorsed more regulation.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JOHN MCCAIN</nameText></person>: When AIG was bailed out, I didn`t like it. But I understood it needed to be done to protect hard-working Americans with insurance policies and annuities.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: McCain`s supporters say what`s important is that, in times of crisis, the senator will always return to his core principles.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: It goes back, I think, to who he is and the life he`s lived, a sense of duty and understanding that, if you`re going to be a senator, and you`re going to be given this immense power and this opportunity, that you have to use it for the common good, and sometimes that means you put your interests second to what you think is best for the country and the party.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Whatever the crisis, McCain is trying to persuade voters that the philosophy that drives his approach is the one with which they can be comfortable.</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: Tomorrow, Margaret Warner continues our \"Close Up\" series with a look at how <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>handles setbacks.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>RAY SUAREZ: Again, the major developments of this day.</p><p>Republican presidential <person><nameText>candidate John McCain </nameText></person>urged Democrat <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>to delay their first debate, set for Friday night. He said they should return to Congress to work on the financial crisis.</p><p>Obama declined. He said it`s more important than ever to debate at such a time.</p><p>President Bush planned to address the nation tonight, trying to build support for the financial rescue plan.</p><p>And North Korea banned U.N. inspectors from its main nuclear reactor site in a move toward restarting the facility.</p><p>We`ll see you online and again later tonight for the president`s address to the nation on most PBS stations and again here tomorrow evening. I`m Ray Suarez. Thanks for joining us. Good night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSHR-2008092400cb112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSHR2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4THT-1720-TWD3-113K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8767\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>September 24, 2008 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>George W.

Bill Gross, of course of PIMCO, bond king, tweeting out that there's only a 50 percent chance or better probability that we're going to get some kind of fiscal cliff. Bill Gross, always provocative in his tweets. The cliff is better than 50 percent probability, and then comes the debt ceiling, exclamation point. Dysfunctional Washington bad for risk assets. Bad for business, it has to be, John.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHN SCULLEY, FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE</emphasis>: Well, business focuses on uncertainty. And obviously we're in uncertain times. This Congress actually is still in session until January 3, and then -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EISEN</emphasis>: So there's hope yet.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCULLEY</emphasis>: So there's still hope, but I think it's a very dysfunctional Congress overall. We're not going to correct that in the next few months. This is something that's going to take years to sort its way out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG NEWS</emphasis>: Do you have a percentage of a fiscal cliff probability?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCULLEY</emphasis>: Well, I don't think the risk of going over the cliff is as big as people are saying it is. The reality is if we go over the cliff, there are mechanisms to insulate the economy from it for a period of time. So the real test is to see what happens as we move out past the inauguration of the president and a new Congress comes into section.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EISEN</emphasis>: Well, no question dysfunctional is the word of the day. We'll talk more about this in just a moment with our White House correspondent Hans Nichols.  </p><p>      06:04  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      06:15  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EISEN</emphasis>: How do you foster innovation and make profits at the same time? John Sculley led Pepsi into the cola wars. He faced ups and then downs at Apple, and he's now fostering innovation in healthcare. He joins us with a look ahead to the state of corporate America in 2013. John, our guest host for the hour. And tell us a little bit more about what you're investing in now. Healthcare technology.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCULLEY</emphasis>: Well Sara, when I joined the personal computer industry 30 years ago, Steve Jobs had this idea that the Macintosh wasn't just a computer. It was a consumer appliance and it should be sold with the same kind of big brand marketing that we used in the cola wars with Pepsi. Thirty years later, healthcare offers a similar kind of opportunity. We know we can't afford the system we have today, and yet there's a chance for disruptive delivery of healthcare services that focus on consumerization, and I think ultimately big brand marketing can play a role in that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>: So what kind of startups then maybe are you looking towards helping healthcare? I just don't see the correlation yet.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCULLEY</emphasis>: Sure. Well, we have a healthcare system since the Second World War which is an employer-based system, meaning that there's no taxes for the employees who get the healthcare benefits which they get. With the Affordable Care Act, the president is shifting us to a mandated system, and the impact of that is that employers are starting to take on their own self-insurance.   </p><p>      They're going to high deductible plans, covering catastrophic health only in many cases. And this means that the first $3,000 to $5,000 every year has to be paid by the employees. They suddenly no longer have copays for that first $3,000 to $5,000.   </p><p>      That opens up a huge opportunity for alternative types of healthcare delivery systems like telehealth, meaning being able to have a doctor appointment online over your mobile device or over your PC, walk-in urgent care centers. There are now 9,000 of them in the US, about 25 percent penetration. So we're going to start to see real innovation I believe in the delivery of healthcare services and the ability to build brands around these services is going to be a huge focus I think for the healthcare industry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EISEN</emphasis>: So this is the next it sounds like section of technology to watch. Are you talking about big tech innovation leaders like Apple?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCULLEY</emphasis>: Well, I don't think you'll find companies like Apple going specifically into healthcare because it's such a field that requires deep knowledge of the protocols, rules, regulations of that particular industry. On the other hand, we're talking about a $2.8 trillion industry just in the United States. So the opportunity to disrupt the healthcare model is huge. And so Apple may be part of the system, but I think you're going to see other companies, even new companies, playing a more important role.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>: And we don't have a lot of time on this, but this brings up the good question on should companies be innovating or should they be really putting their money into trying and make profit. Can you really do both right now in Silicon Valley?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCULLEY</emphasis>: Well, it depends if you have those skills. And clearly Apple has demonstrated time and again that it can do true product innovation. Other companies, particularly large public companies that have been around for a long time, set up an innovation department, usually not particularly successful.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EISEN</emphasis>: Well Tim Cook, the new boss who sits in your chair at Apple, recently speak to Bloomberg Businessweek of course in an interview. And he talked a lot about innovation and the (ph) chief innovation officer. He says they shouldn't have a chief innovation officer. In fact, a lot of companies have these departments and it's always a sign that something is wrong. And you have a VP of innovation or something, you know, put a for sale sign at the door because everybody there should be doing innovation. You shouldn't even have such tight (ph) officers as a title. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCULLEY</emphasis>: Well, I think he completely nailed it. He's exactly right. Innovation is done best when you have strong product leadership. Steve Jobs is obviously the best example of strong product leadership. Now Tim Cook is an outstanding CEO for Apple, but he's not the product leader. So he has to be able to empower a product leader -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EISEN</emphasis>: But he has a product leader.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCULLEY</emphasis>: He does. Jony Ives is highly respected, very successful. Worked at Steve's right hand, and so he's got one clear product leader. Remember, he had two who were in competition with each other. He chose one, and I think it was a very good choice.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EISEN</emphasis>: Does Apple need a new product right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCULLEY</emphasis>: Well, I just love the iPad Mini.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EISEN</emphasis>: Do you, really?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCULLEY</emphasis>: I do, yeah. I think the iPad Mini has opportunities to get even better. I'd love - love to see the same high-resolution retina display in the iPad Mini they have on the iPad. I'd love to see the kind of keyboard accessory in the cover that even Microsoft has on the Surface. So I think the iPad Mini has got a great run. The challenge is that the gross margin on the iPad Mini is lower than Apple has had on the iPhone and the iPad.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EISEN</emphasis>: Well, we're going to talk a lot more about Apple and what it's got coming up.  </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

He calls his Cabinet a \"One Nation\" government, given its ambition for higher public service spending, regional infrastructure investment and minimum wage increases. His musings on regulation, free trade and the nanny state often sound liberal, if not libertarian.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To confuse matters more, his proposed state aid laws suggest he's partial to some old-school national collectivist thinking too. Anyone hoping for a principles-based coherent economic agenda during this Parliament will be disappointed.</p><p>One concept the Prime Minister does appear to intuitively understand though is the importance of economic growth. His desire to \"unleash the potential\" of the country might not be based on theoretical models, like Gordon Brown's penchant for \"post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory\". But in acknowledging wealth must be produced before being spent, Johnson understands that growth is the essential precondition for the rising wages, regional levelling-up and better public services promised in yesterday's Queen's Speech.</p><p>A legacy of the Blair and Brown era is that we spend inordinate time in politics debating distributional issues, analysing \"winner and losers\". Rich are pitched against poor, young against old, North against South.</p><p>Deficit reduction from 2010 necessitated tough spending choices, adding to this zero-sum economic framing in respect of government departments or local government - the idea that one person's gain must be another's loss. Yet faster economic growth eases these constraints. It allows \"having your cake and eating it\", as Boris might say. An economy growing more quickly means stronger public finances, faster wage growth and people far less occupied with comparing their spoils. Positive sum, not zero sum.</p><p>The central economic problem the UK has faced over the past decade is simply too little growth. Whether it was the cause or simply reflective of a past unsustainable trend, the crisis's aftermath heralded a period of dire productivity growth performance. GDP per capita is over 20pc below where it would have been had pre-crisis productivity trends continued, with annual growth falling from over 2pc to just over 0.4pc.</p><p>Forecasters initially predicted a productivity bounceback was just around the corner. But tomorrow never came. Conservative chancellors each year therefore stood at the Dispatch Box to announce weak growth forecasts, before proceeding to do little about it. Then came Brexit.</p><p>Uncertainty about trading relations and a Corbyn premiership has cast a long shadow over investment and location decisions since 2016. Under these and demographic headwinds, we've become so depressingly accustomed to weak growth that its absence barely features in public debate. Which is why Boris's rhetoric is so encouraging.</p><p>The positive stock market reaction to his victory suggests seeing off Corbyn and the declining probability of a \"no-deal\" Brexit will deliver somewhat of an investment fillip, as Boris claimed. We might also see some near-term macroeconomic stimulus, although any investment projects will have muted economic effects given lead times and the likelihood the Bank of England would offset any demand pressure that raised inflation.</p><p>Given the size of his majority though, the Prime Minister's economic ambitions should extend far beyond delivering a short-term sugar rush. With unemployment low and migration likely to be curtailed, the scope for GDP boosts from simply adding workers is diminishing. Robust productivity growth is therefore crucial to deliver the tax revenues and wage increases needed to make Boris's first term a clear economic success.</p><p>His team know this, and recognise they have a narrow time frame of electoral goodwill to do something about the contentious land-use planning regime, for example. Our Byzantine mess of a system constrains economically successful areas from growing, especially through green belts.</p><p>But it also reduces the prospect of certain firms achieving efficient premises scale in industries such as retail, social care and childcare, due to limited space and/or high rents. There's obvious pro-investment policy the Government could opt for, including letting corporations write off spending on buildings and capital equipment immediately against tax.</p><p>The litmus test of whether Boris is serious about growth will come from how he intends to repay working-class towns he won. The political imperative to be seen to \"help\" may lead to resources thrown at high street, town and hospital regeneration, as tried and failed under New Labour. Hare-brained ideas for government schemes to help locals acquire shop space or incentivise them to stay where they were born are already proliferating.</p><p>This sort of stuff, plus attacks on Big Tech, is just a form of winner to loser distributional politics Boris should avoid. If you tax success to subsidise failure, you'll end up with more failure. It doesn't mean nothing can be done. But new interventions or infrastructure should work with market signals, not against them.</p><p>Removing bottlenecks to growth or joining areas to thriving markets by better transport infrastructure is what works. Given our population density, economic thinkers Stian Westlake and Sam Bowman think the best way to help poor towns' residents is to remove government barriers to moving while improving connectivity between successful city hubs and close-by towns.</p><p>While Boris does not have an economic ideology then, the sheer size of his majority has given him an opportunity to crack thorny structural economic challenges. There's a potential future where he is ruthless in eliminating barriers to growth, makes infrastructure decisions to obtain the biggest bang for the buck, broadens our free trading horizons and improves tax incentives to invest.</p><p>In that world, GDP is somewhat higher, public service pressures are that bit more manageable and economic opportunity has broadened into the regions of his new voters. Now, that's a potential worth unleashing.</p><p>Ryan Bourne holds the R Evan Scharf chair for the public understanding of economics at the Cato Institute</p><p>'Attacks on Big Tech are just a form of winner-toloser politics.

It's great to see you here. I appreciate those of you that had to get through thunderstorms and weather.</p><p>I heard one story from David Lewis right before I got -- that all the flights were canceled out of Boston last night, so he drove in and got here about 3:30 in the morning. So David, kudos to you. We'll make sure you get plenty of coffee throughout the day.</p><p>And we tried to arrange everything and make it pretty convenient and nice, except for the weather. That's one thing that we probably can't control. But again, we really appreciate the effort that you made to be here with us today. And really, welcome to the 2018 Investor Relations Day for both our Medical Device as well as our Consumer segments.</p><p>Now I think we've got a really exciting and interesting day planned. And I'm not going to spend too much time up here because I don't want to steal the thunder from the people who are actually closest to the business and who are making things happen each and every day, but I'm very excited about what we and particularly what they're going to be talking about with you today.</p><p>Now since we're here in New Brunswick, the very home of Johnson &amp; Johnson, where we started over 130 years ago -- in fact, if you get a chance, we took the original building, the powerhouse, and we turned it into a museum. And we've housed it now, and it's got some wonderful stories about our heritage. And of course, a seminal piece of that heritage is Our Credo, and this year happens to be the 75th anniversary of Our Credo because it was really institutionalized literally on the eve of the company going public by Robert Wood Johnson.</p><p>And what I would say is that it's as absolutely relevant today as it was 75 years ago and perhaps even more so given the turbulent world that we live in and we're dealing with every day. And it starts with our first responsibility, again, very -- first being to patients, consumers, to doctors, the nurses, mothers and fathers, all the other customers who use our products each and every day. It also includes our employees, many of whom you're going to meet here today, not only in this room but when you're outside at the exhibits; the communities, yes, here in New Brunswick, but more broadly, now around the world; and of course, our commitment to you, our shareholders, many of you who are in the audience with us here today.</p><p>Now as the management of this great company, I think we've got a real responsibility to keep you informed about our business, and our goal today is we want to make sure that you understand not only why but actually how all of our efforts are really centering on a few primary areas. One, it's about innovation, and it's going to be about innovation in everything that we do. Yes, about our products, but it's also about the way we're connecting with customers, everything that we're doing each and every day.</p><p>Next, it's about execution because we can have the best plans, the best PowerPoints, but at the end of the day, if we're not making that come to life, if we're not delivering on that, we're not doing our job. And what you'll see today is a strong emphasis and focus about making sure that we're delivering on all of our commitments.</p><p>And finally, it's about customers because we think that Johnson &amp; Johnson, we're uniquely capable of partnering with doctors and surgeons and patients, hospital administrators, trade partners and other people in that broader health care ecosystem. So simply put, we're here to better serve their needs. And all of this, of course, is designed to consistently and constantly improve our performance.</p><p>Now one of the most important reasons I think business reviews like this are critical, it's not only that you get to hear from me directly as I do the introduction here this morning, but also, you get to hear from our leaders, the people who are actually in the trenches running our business around the world each and every day. And I've always believed that at Johnson &amp; Johnson, one of the most significant sources of competitive advantage that we have really is our people. And it's not only their talent, their experience, entrepreneurial spirit, but it's also their dedication to purpose and mission.</p><p>Now today, you're going to hear from a wide variety of leaders who truly embody this spirit. And I think what you're going to see is they've got a sense of urgency, an innovative boldness that's going to accelerate our performance and going to continue to drive our performance for the next 132 years. I think the other thing that you're going to notice about these group of leaders today, they're diverse, some have been with the company 30 years, some have been with the company 3 years. They work cross-sector, cross-region. They bring a unique perspective to the table and sometimes we debate it out, but always with the best interest ultimately of Johnson &amp; Johnsonin mind.</p><p>Now in spite of the white carpet in some of the panels, another thing that I want to make clear today is that we're not here to have a Broadway production. We want to be fully transparent. We're going to share with you some of the lessons that we've learned. We're going to show you how we're taking that knowledge and insight that we picked up along the way to better meet the needs of customers and patients going forward and ultimately improve our success as we look through the remainder of 2018 and beyond.</p><p>So look, in this ever-evolving, more dynamic competitive environment, certainly, than I've seen in 30 years that we're working in now, we've got to be smarter, we got to be faster, we got to be more agile, more strategic and execute better than ever before. And our teams, the leaders that you're going to be hearing from today, are committed to doing just that.</p><p>Now the good news is we lead in many of the markets where we compete. In fact, we've got 27 billion-dollar or more platforms across our portfolio, and 15 of those are within the Consumer and the Medical Device businesses, which we're going to be talking about today. And in the areas where we need improvements, we are aggressively taking action to position ourselves for better growth.</p><p>Now the collective leadership experience of the teams presenting today, they've demonstrated the ability to seize opportunities and execute with excellence, but also they've demonstrated the ability to turn around declining businesses. And in a broad business, over the long term, you're going to need to do that from time to time. And we've got those capabilities, and that's evidenced by what we did in OTC and Consumer, in our contact lens business just a few years ago, in eye health care. And we are very confident and committed in our ability to replicate this success going forward.</p><p>So let me make one point absolutely clear. Our #1 priority is to drive superior performance within each one of our business segments. And to do this, we benchmark, track and hold every one of our Johnson &amp; Johnsonleaders accountable for metrics that focus on things like innovation, execution, customer satisfaction, financial performance, portfolio management, long-term sustainability and, very importantly, Credo values and leadership.</p><p>Now it's no secret that some of the changes that we're seeing in health care today, they do reflect, in essence, a new normal. So as we talk a lot about among our leadership team, get used to it. This is the way we're going to have to function. It's constant, it never stops, it's global. Challenges, opportunities are happening every day with breathtaking speed, and we've got to ensure that we actually thrive in this environment, that it inspires us to do even better.</p><p>Now we feel, after a lot of debate, discussion, that our broad base in health care is a source of competitive advantage and also a source of true strength. By being positioned across 3 vital aspects of health care, pharmaceuticals, consumer and medical devices, we've got a unique line of sight across the entire health care system.</p><p>And our broad base, well, it's not just about heritage, but it's a strategic choice. It's grounded in long-term performance and, we believe, in understanding of health care in the future.</p><p>Now if you think about it, our broad base, well, it enables us to first create and access growth opportunities across multiple sectors of the health care market all at once. It also positions us better to be the strategic partner of choice for technology companies and innovative start-ups, for scientists, for entrepreneurs who benefit from the deep health care expertise that only Johnson &amp; Johnsoncan provide across so many different sectors. Additionally, we're able to work with local governments, public health organizations, where we're collaborating more than ever to address the world's most pressing health care challenges. And we're doing all of this while providing our customers with a broader range of products and solutions and the opportunity to partner with us, particularly in large health care systems, on attracting patients, improving patient outcomes and ultimately reducing the cost for episodes of care. And finally, we can realize significant advantages in scale that give us the ability to achieve more efficiencies, better effectiveness across all the sectors that also allow us to invest in growth for the future.</p><p>So when we operate under this manner, and we continue to do so into the future, we think it's produced significant long-term results. Now it's important to recognize our markets ebbs and flows. We're seeing that today. However, we've got a long-term proven track record of strong shareholder returns, which we believe is a result of managing our business for the long term, having that relentless drive for innovation, a passion around execution, strong customer focus and disciplined portfolio management, which continually allows us to invest and drive future performance.</p><p>Our capital allocation priorities, well, they remain consistent. And we believe the recent tax reform, it actually provides us with even greater flexibility. And we regularly review and discuss these priorities as part of an ongoing strategic dialogue and planning with our senior leadership team, but also with our entire Board of Directors.</p><p>As you know, our first priority is investing in organic growth through R&amp;D, commercial activities and driving operational efficiencies through other investments in our business. And you're going to see many, many examples as we go through the discussions today.</p><p>Our next priority is delivering strong dividends to our shareholders. And as we recently announced in April, we increased our dividend by 7.1%, which I'm proud to say represents the 56th consecutive year that we've increased our dividend.</p><p>And then we target value-creating M&amp;A and licensing deals. In fact, we've executed over 20 deals, and we've invested more than $40 billion over the last 2 years. And this includes companies like Actelion, which added the sixth therapeutic area at our Pharmaceutical business; Medical Optics, which allows us to expand into new areas in the eye health care space; and Vogue, which we believe provides a compelling beauty growth opportunity. Now when you combine all of these acquisitions, we think they're contributing in a very meaningful way to our growth.</p><p>And lastly, we also consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders, such as stock repurchase programs. And as we've demonstrated, our financial strength really gives us the ability to do all of these things simultaneously.</p><p>So now what I'd like to do is take just a few moments to highlight the strengths and the opportunities for each of our different business segments. But first, I think it's important to emphasize what we're going to be talking about today is a 132-year-old company that we're very proud of but has got a sense of urgency, is not complacent, that it's not looking back but moving forward as fast as the change happening around us. Just think about all the global, technological, economic, political and health care industry fronts. And in fact, we think of ourselves much more as a 132-year-old start-up that's innovating, executing each and every day to win our customers' and shareholders' trusts, your confidence and support.</p><p>And look, we're not afraid to acknowledge areas that we need to fix. We want to talk about that, learn from them to make us better going forward. And we firmly believe that Johnson &amp; Johnsonis strongly positioned for continued and future growth.</p><p>So let me start with our Pharmaceutical business. That's been an industry leader in just about all performance measures, including things like R&amp;D productivity, commercial capabilities. The group continues to deliver strong top line growth while also increasing investment to further develop our incredibly strong pipeline of innovative new medicines. But I'll also tell you we are far from finished.</p><p>And despite the current pressures from biosimilars and generic entrants into the market, we are confident the continued growth of our marketed products, the expected launches from the robust pipeline, all these things position us to continue to grow well ahead of the market. Now we also continue some regulatory applications for new molecular entities, and we expect to file for the approval of up to 8 new compounds by 2021, each with more than $1 billion of peak revenue potential.</p><p>Our key components for growth include things like growing markets, increased patient penetration, new indications and line extensions, including more than 10, each of which represent more than $0.5 billion of opportunity. And finally, an exciting new entrant into the pulmonary arterial hypertension market with Actelion. Now we're confident that all these factors pulled together should drive above-market growth well into the future.</p><p>But today -- well, today, we're here to talk about our Medical Device and Consumer businesses. So let me highlight what you can expect from these leaders. First, with our Consumer segment, it is very important to Johnson &amp; Johnson. In addition to its strong reputational value, it's this business that provides us with the capabilities to gain a deep understanding of consumer and patient insights, particularly as these audiences become much more active on their decisions impacting their overall health care and treatment regimens.</p><p>We see rapid transformations happening all around the world due to demographic, socioeconomic and technology shifts. And this results in a growing global consumer class that are interested in things like natural health, beauty products and services that more and more incorporate concepts of total health and well-being. And look, they want all this and they want it on their own terms and they want it on a touch of a button or screen.</p><p>And the rising income in emerging markets, well, it's also fueling the demand for health products. And this rapidly changing landscape in the consumer market, we believe, creates significant opportunity for a company like Johnson &amp; Johnson. And I'm confident in our strategies to move quickly, address new market needs, work with customers from the individual consumer to the large-box retailers as well as the e-commerce channels and everything in between.</p><p>Now in today's presentations, you're going to hear about the strong plans that we have to have sustainable above-market growth in 2018 and beyond for many of our dynamic and science-based iconic brands and franchises, now -- many of which you know and love and I hope that if you use every day, you'll look even better, feel better, from Johnson's Baby to Listerine to OGX to NEUTROGENA. You'll see them right outside. But look, when you see what we're doing, you'll have much better understanding of how we're leveraging consumer insights, preferences to design, tailor and deliver ultimately superior products.</p><p>And what you're going to hear a lot about today is how we're doing that with the revitalization of Baby Care and our Oral Care franchises. We're going to be implementing an omni-channel approach to ensure that these products are available whenever and wherever consumers are shopping. And we believe the top line growth I just referenced will be met with even greater bottom line growth as we continue to improve our productivity and margins.</p><p>So let's now transition to Medical Devices. And we've got powerful opportunities for growth across our Orthopaedics, surgery, Interventional Solutions and our Vision business. And if we reflect on it for just a moment, more than a century ago, Johnson &amp; Johnsonpioneered the concept of sterile surgery. And over the decades, we've led the way with many significant steps forward.</p><p>It's estimated that almost 90% of people living today in developing countries don't have access to safe and affordable surgery, and millions of lives have been lost over the last several years from conditions needing surgical care, well, that just wasn't available where they live. And I can't emphasize enough the enormity of the opportunity in surgery and medical devices to deliver better outcomes and ultimately help people live healthier lives. Now we're committed to closing this gap through our solutions and our innovations.</p><p>In Medical Devices, we have businesses displaying great strength, businesses such as vision, electrophysiology, biosurgery, endocutters, hips, trauma, but we also fully recognize that our progress has not been uniform across the entire portfolio. There are areas where we must and we will improve, such as our weaknesses in knees and our spine businesses. Now we've taken strategic actions that refine our portfolio through our 20-plus acquisitions, the pending divestitures of certain businesses and a thoughtful deployment of resources, but we've also increased investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions, frankly, that our customers are more and more demanding.</p><p>Additionally, we're improving our cadence of innovation with 15 to 20 major product launches planned for 2018. Also, our robust pipeline includes a truly differentiated orthopaedics robotic solution in Orthotaxy as well as our Verb Surgical platform where we are creating the next generation and frontier of digital surgery. And we're simplifying our operations, developing new commercial models with a focus on execution to meet the needs of customers and patients when, where and how they want their needs to be met.</p><p>Now another important factor is technology. It's profoundly transforming this space. And we are actively assessing, developing and implementing technology and strategies across all of our platforms. We believe these drivers will deliver sustainable above-market growth across the entire breadth of our Medical Device businesses starting today, and we are committed to delivering across the portfolio in 2020.</p><p>So in closing, first and foremost, I want to thank you for being here today and investing your time in Johnson &amp; Johnson. And we are certainly proud of our historical performance. But I'll be very clear, we have an even stronger sense of urgency and excitement about our future. Your trust and confidence in us is something that we never take for granted and recognize that we need to earn it each and every day through innovation, execution, customer focus and, last but never least, near- and long-term performance.</p><p>And you've got our absolute commitment that we'll hold ourselves accountable and execute on the strategic plans that you're going to hear about today, fulfill all of our Credo responsibilities where we always keep the customer and patients at the center of everything we do and ultimately profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.</p><p>So before I turn the stage over, just a couple more logistics. You're going to have a chance to hear from each of our sectors on their own. We're going to do multiple panels where you'll get a chance to engage directly with the leaders responsible for those particular business. So -- and we're -- and by the way, we've used the survey information that you provided from past meetings to try to improve our performance, as I told you, feedback is a gift, along the way.</p><p>And very importantly, myself, Dominic and Joe will be here throughout the day. As you probably remember from previous meetings, from time to time, we may chime in as we go along. But we will also -- Dominic and I and Joe will be up here for a panel at the end of the day, so if there are questions that have not been answered that is specific to the particular businesses but perhaps more at a corporate level or regarding some of our strategies, we'll be here.</p><p>But also, during the breaks, in between, if there's any questions you have, we are here for you, and we want to make sure you walk away today, as I mentioned earlier, with a very clear understanding and excitement for our future.</p><p>So with that, it's now my turn to hand it over to the Consumer team to walk you through our Consumer business in detail. Thank you very much, everybody.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer, Jorge Mesquita.</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, WORLDWIDE CHAIRMAN, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON CONSUMER: So good morning. It's great to be back here with you to talk about our global Consumer business. I hope you saw in the video we just shared with you how proud we are of our long-standing tradition of game-changing, transformational innovation. Our business has been built by innovation that truly invented new categories or reset the standards for the categories in which we play. And that will always be at the core of our success and something that we're committed to continue to drive as we go forward.</p><p>Now the key messages I want to get across to you today is that we are well positioned to drive above-market, sustained top line growth starting in 2018 and beyond that we'll do so by embracing the new omni-channel where consumers are shopping in, whether it's in brick-and-mortar stores or online and e-commerce, which represents a massive opportunity for us. Now indeed, we have a powerful innovation pipeline, one of the strongest in our history, and we will reinvent, in particular, the Baby Care and the Oral Care categories. And we are committed to continue to improve our operating margin even as we invest in the business to sustain our top line growth.</p><p>Now as way of background, we play in 6 broad categories, OTC and Beauty being the largest of which, Baby Care and Oral Care and we also play selectively in Wound Care and in Women's Health. OTC and Beauty each represent a little over 30% of our turnover. So combined, they're over -- more than 60% of our sales. But we have strong leadership positions in Baby Care and Oral Care as well. We have a large global footprint. And more than 50% of our turnover is outside of North America, and we have very strong operations in Europe, Middle East and Africa and in Asia-Pacific.</p><p>We play in large and attractive categories that are very profitable. Combined, they represent over $500 billion in turnover. And these categories are growing faster on average than the broader FMCG industry. And if you look at consumer trends, they bode well to ensure these categories will continue to enjoy above-FMCG growth as we go forward.</p><p>We see consumers taking a much more educated and proactive stance in caring for their health, which bodes well for our OTC business. Consumers want to pursue beauty through health, a beauty that comes from well-being and wellness, which again paves the way for brands like NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. We're seeing an aging population trend across both the developed and the developing world and with it comes a number of health care issues we can address. Unfortunately, we're seeing a sedentary lifestyle trend across the entire world now migrating also to the developing world and with it come a series of obesity and health care issues that, again, we're well positioned to address. And every year, 135 million new babies are born, and we're here to meet their needs as well. So we're well positioned, and we're playing in attractive, profitable and fast-growing categories.</p><p>Now about our performance, we had a great run between 2014 and '16. We grew about 3.5% ahead of the market, and we gained market share in that period. And we made significant improvement in our profitability. We grew operating profit 20% annually in that time frame. In fact, we doubled our operating income from $1 billion to $2 billion in that time frame and significantly expanded our before-tax margin.</p><p>However, last year, we hit a speed bump. Our top line growth slowed down, and we grew very modestly. And this reflected a couple of major factors. One, we saw a temporary slowdown in the categories in which we compete in that time frame. And we also saw inventory reductions across our customers, both in developing and developed markets, and that led to the slowdown in our top line. We were able to hold our market share, and we improved our margin modestly in 2018.</p><p>In addition to these results we're very pleased with the fact that the 6 acquisitions we made in 2016, collectively, were ahead of plan, both in terms of top line and bottom line performance. So we accomplished a lot in 2017, but it clearly wasn't our best year. But it was a very valuable year for us because we learned a great deal, and what we learned is that the pace of change in the consumer industry is accelerating. In fact, we learned that our industry is being disruptive.</p><p>What we're seeing is that the competitive advantages upon which the FMCG industry has been built are not as relevant today as they once were. So for example, it used to be that large companies like J&amp;J had a competitive advantage in terms of attracting the best talents. But what we're seeing today is that for students joining the workforce, joining a smaller company, a start-up enterprise that is more entrepreneurial, has certain appeal to them. It used to be that building and nurturing brands was something expensive that only large companies like ours could do, but the reality is that it's relatively affordable now for you to build a brand online and to create an active community of loyal users very efficiently. It used to be that manufacturing assets, large plants, was a moat, a barrier for entry. But again, you see today across the world that small companies, new entrants can access excellent contract manufacturing in just about every region.</p><p>Retailer relationships are very important, and we're very proud of them. But if you are a newcomer to this industry, you can sell directly to your consumers online efficiently. Innovation, as I said, has been and will continue to be an important source of differentiation. But these small entrants that join our industry can do so as well by outsourcing some of those elements of innovation. And then lastly, financial firepower, a great strength of Johnson &amp; Johnson, is not an impediment for a new entrant to come to this industry. Given this relatively low interest rate environment, abundant VC capital, even crowd financing, it's relatively easy to raise the money you need to start a new business.</p><p>So what we're seeing as a result of all this is that there's a digital disruption that is changing the face of the consumer industry, lowering the barriers for entry and paving the way to this new class of start-up entrepreneurial entrants. And at the heart of this digital disruption is a new consumer-centric paradigm that is challenging the traditional value of scale as we have defined it and is forcing a disruption in the retail and media landscape. And what we're seeing is the emergence of a new how-to-win playbook, which is characterized by asset-light infrastructure and the creation of highly personalized, on-demand consumer experiences, which is what consumers want today. And owning that consumer relationship and its related ecosystem has now become the greatest source of competitive advantage.</p><p>So the question is: What are the strengths of these new entrants? What is it that they do uniquely well? We think we have that figured out because, among other things, we have the privilege of having acquired a great company, a start-up in its own right, that for many years has been winning against large established players in the hair care space, Vogue, the makers of OGX. And what we see in that unit is they are single-mindedly focused on breakthrough, game-changing innovation by staying externally focused and very close to their consumers, their shoppers, their customers and overall trends.</p><p>They focus on building digital-first, purpose-led brands, very important for young millennial consumers. They capitalize on the rise of emerging markets and emerging channels. They see where the shopper evolution goes. They see changes in consumer shopping behavior, and they position themselves to intercept that for their advantage. They are very lean. They are very cost-efficient, hyper-efficient, and they move very fast. Speed is an important source of competitive advantage.</p><p>So now as a result of this change, we are competing in 2 worlds. We have to compete against the large multinational companies that have been our traditional peer set for many years, but we also have to compete against these start-ups. So as Alex said, we have to become a giant start-up. We have to play to our strengths of scale and science-based superiority and differentiation, but we have to become more nimble, we have to become more entrepreneurial.</p><p>In order to compete in these 2 worlds, we have a strong strategy that has been guiding us for the last few years. We have 12 mega brands. When I met with you 2 years ago, they represented 60% of our sales. They're now representing 70% of our sales, and we're focused on continuing to driving disproportionate growth through these mega brands. We play in these large categories that I described before, 6 broad categories, and we have a very clear set of how-to-win choices around game-changing brand-building capabilities, transformational innovation, a systemic approach to driving P&amp;L improvements and productivity, a transformational commercial strategy and route to market and building a world-class organization. In addition, we have very clear where-to-play geographical choices designed to, in sum, maximize our overall global competitiveness and value creation.</p><p>But in addition to this, we have identified 5 principles we need to embrace as we execute those strategies in order to compete against this new landscape. The first principle is to broaden the scope of our innovation model. It's not enough to have great product and packaging innovation. We have to innovate to create a digital ecosystem around those products, something these small entrants do very well, an ecosystem that creates loyalty and opportunity to iterate and engage with our consumers. And it's not enough to have big game-changing global platforms. We have to have locally relevant, fast-speed innovation as well. We call this 2-speed innovation.</p><p>We have to build our brands to be relevant in these 2 new worlds. We have to communicate the superiority of our products and our benefits, but we have to also communicate what's the purpose of our brands, something that, again, these small companies do very well. They articulate well what they stand for, and we must do the same.</p><p>And again, even as we drive global campaigns for these 12 mega brands that have the best possible ideas around the world, we have to amplify and execute those campaigns in a way that feels intensely locally relevant. These small entrants tend to be single-country operators, and they make their brands feel like they belong to that market and nowhere else. Global multinational brands need to be locally relevant.</p><p>As I said before, we need to win in the traditional channels, but also in those new emerging markets and emerging channels, particularly e-commerce, something where we see disproportionate growth from these new entrants. We have to go beyond productivity and efficiency and cost reduction. We have to become more flexible and more responsive to meet consumer needs. And lastly, we have to evolve our work processes, and we have to evolve our culture so we can become more entrepreneurial and, as I said before, be a giant start-up.</p><p>So what you're going to hear for the rest of this presentation is how we're actually bringing these principles to life. And to do that, I'd like to invite you to stage 2 of my colleagues: Alison Lewis, who's our Chief Marketing Officer; and Josh Ghaim, who's our Chief Technology Officer.</p><p>JOSH GHAIM, GLOBAL CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON CONSUMER: Thank you, Jorge. Good morning. Alison and I are going to take you through the first 2 principles that Jorge just highlighted. The first, how we're broadening the scope of our innovation model and at the same time, how we're building brands to compete in this 2-world of small start-ups and large multinational players. I think it's important as we broaden the scope of our innovation model, we continue to look at both in terms of what we're doing globally, both as big companies and small start-ups. First, building breakthrough innovation and at the same time implementing fast cycle, locally relevant innovation. Second, we're continuing to create superior product and packaging, innovations and build the connected digital ecosystem that's needed in order to engage with our consumers much closely.</p><p>Breakthrough global innovation platforms require deep expertise in science, robust clinical efficacy and strong regulatory know-how globally, big ideas that step change the categories that we play in.</p><p>And now we're complementing that with fast-cycle innovation focused on local insights that continues to enable us to engage with our consumers regardless of where they live.</p><p>We have a long history of building robust science-based global platforms that transcend geographies. In fact, this year in 2018, we will be launching over 150 new products globally, including some of the breakthrough innovation platforms, such as the first mouthwash to prevent sensitivity as a Class 2 medical device so that you can have your coffee in the morning without the pain that you feel in the morning when you have sensitivity.</p><p>A new standard in anti-aging. Retinol has been a credible standard for anti-aging. This year, we're launching a Retinol and NeoGlucosamine combination through our NeoStrata business in order to drive new standard in terms of anti-aging skin care.</p><p>We're continuing to expand some of our newest platforms, such as Hydro Boost, Light Therapy to new benefits, just to name a few. To demonstrate how we're living into these 2 principles that Jorge highlighted, Alison and I will dive and give you some examples of how our core brands are living into this.</p><p>First, we'll start with LISTERINE. We're driving category growth through big global platforms around the world and at the same time continue to bring this fast cycle, locally relevant innovation. LISTERINE has a long history of safety and clinical efficacy. 50 years of research and clinical data, over 100 years of safe and effective use, making it the most widely used, extensively researched and most effective mouthwash. What is even more differentiating about LISTERINE is its superiority to all other mouthwashes as demonstrated with American Dental Association seal of acceptance for fighting plaque and gingivitis.</p><p>It is our mission to drive category growth, attracting new users was the goal to grow household penetration from 37% to 50%, basically bringing the global penetration to make it equal to that of the U.S. At the same time, we continue to drive more uses of LISTERINE -- more daily uses of LISTERINE globally. These 2 initiatives add up to 350 million new households, $25 billion in incremental sales related to, in terms of market potential, creating a great opportunity to continue to drive the category growth for mouthwash.</p><p>I'll turn it over to Alison to talk about a few examples of what we're doing in this business.</p><p>ALISON LEWIS, GLOBAL CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON CONSUMER: Thanks, Josh. So LISTERINE. Clearly, one of our crown jewels, one of our billion-dollar plus brands with strong sales and share growth over the last 5 years, but also as Josh highlighted, still enormous growth potential when you think about expanding household penetration. So when we think about global platform innovation on LISTERINE this year, it starts with a complete brand refresh that's rolling out now. This includes new packaging graphics, which have clear variant segmentation, clear highlighting of the benefits and claims and then also better pricing architectures and structures.</p><p>This all makes it easier to shop and easier for consumers to get the benefit that they need, all built around the iconic barbell bottle, while adding elements that modernize the brand. This is launching now, as I said, in over 90 countries and it's amplified with powerful in-store and e-commerce support with science-based claims in all communications. Let's take a look at how we're bringing this to life.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ALISON LEWIS: So a great example of commercial innovation, which has proven to drive growth in our categories. But we have these big global platforms like the refresh, but we also need to balance that with fast cycle, locally relevant innovation. We've seen significant success in bringing locally relevant flavors, combined with plus 1 benefits. So examples would be green tea for strong teeth in China, salt and lemon for whitening in Indonesia; and Miswak for gum health in the Middle East.</p><p>We recognize through the success the opportunity for true kitchen logic ingredients, so those ingredients that are very familiar in local markets, to deliver against unmet needs. These ingredients have easy-to-understand benefits and are combined to make something like what we're launching now, our new gum care product with ginger that's launching in Asia and being -- before being rolled out globally. Let's take a look at the fun way we're bringing this brand to life.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ALISON LEWIS: So a global brand refresh combined with locally relevant innovation, a formula for winning in the market. Josh?</p><p>JOSH GHAIM: Great. Thank you, Alison. Another great example for one of our brands is JOHNSON'S. It has a very long history of innovation, the first gentle wash for a newborn baby. The first shampoo is no more tears for your toddler. These are just a few examples of what JOHNSON'S has done over the past century.</p><p>This has made JOHNSON'S, by far, the #1 brand in the world. Superior science, differentiated products, professionally endorsed, gentle, mild and safe. But as many of you are aware, our Baby business has been challenged. Consumption and expectations changed. We're making incremental improvements. Connectivity with millennial moms was lacking. All of this resulting in share losses.</p><p>We're very excited to tell you today that we have a complete end-to-end relaunch and restage of our JOHNSON'S brand globally starting later this year. It is to completely transform our Baby business. We've shared it with some babies and I thought I'd show you what one baby thought about the whole idea.</p><p>This is also true for new moms. We shared the ideas and the products with new moms. Whether they're current JOHNSON'S users or new to JOHNSON'S, consistently loved the transformation of our formulations, packaging, digital-first communication. We have reengineered and simplified our supply chain network and our whole operating model. All of this to address the needs of millennial moms, increase our responsiveness to market dynamics and making JOHNSON'S a true 21st century brand.</p><p>We have designed JOHNSON'S with everything a mom wants for 100% gentle new classics. While our ingredients have been always been safe, our new formulations contain no unwanted ingredients. To meet the needs of new moms today, more than 90% of the ingredients in our formulations are natural. We have built superior experience with no-residue formulas, professional reassurance through dermatologist and pediatrician testing, all with unique claims based on our body of baby skin science.</p><p>Over the past few years, the JOHNSON'S reinvention has also focused on portfolio simplification and massive reduction of our operational complexity, all of this means simplicity, efficiency and speed to market for better responsiveness, better profitability and accelerated growth. Alison?</p><p>ALISON LEWIS: Thanks, Josh. So ages and stages. This has always been a really important part of our business. We enter with newborn, we retain that baby through 6 to 18 months and then expand with toddler, always addressing baby and mom's needs. So our newborn products that are gentle enough for a newborn skin, sleep time products for 6 months plus babies, clinically proven to give baby and mom a better night sleep. And then hair care for toddler where there was nothing in the market for kids that was comparable to adult products, and we brought the mildness and safety of JOHNSON'S with ingredients like silk proteins and argan oil that allow for toddler hair shine and smoothing. So the restage lays the foundation to accelerate this pioneering ages and stages model.</p><p>But in addition to the ages and stages, we'll launch a new hero line. A hero line is something that becomes a new line that halos the entire portfolio of JOHNSON'S brands. So JOHNSON'S CottonTouch, cleanser and lotion for newborns to accelerate recruitment. And as I just spoke about, the more we recruit, the more we move households through the model. It's an ingredient-focused product with cotton at the core. And as you can imagine, there's nothing softer or more intuitive for a baby skin to a mother. It's also a superior product in that it's formulated to not have any residue and no stickiness and it's proven, therefore, to reduce anxiety and the product performs perfectly with that skin-to-skin touch during bath time. So this is a significant part of the relaunch, again that halos the whole line and allows us to stay #1 in the world in Baby Care.</p><p>Also accompanying the relaunch is a strong digital-first mindset. Moms have always taken their job very seriously. They want the best for their baby. But today's moms have more information than ever. And as many of you know, digital is at the heart of how they get their information, how they research brands and how they choose what brands they're going to use for their baby.</p><p>We have BabyCenter. BabyCenter is of the world's largest online parenting community. 7 out of 10 moms around the world sign up for BabyCenter to get information about pregnancy and their baby at 5 weeks of pregnancy. BabyCenter exists in 14 countries around the world and those 14 countries actually represent 70% of our JOHNSON'S business. So what we're doing is building a complete ecosystem around BabyCenter with digital assets, and using BabyCenter as the engine. We will be able to give parents what they want, when they want and this is something that no one else can do, a huge competitive advantage for us.</p><p>And all of this is brought to life at point of purchase with creative in-store theater and accelerated e-commerce presence, all supported with brilliant claims and brought to life with an idea around the JOHNSON'S brand that reclaims our safe, mild, gentle heritage and point of difference with powerful purpose and promise-based communication.</p><p>I'll share a video in a moment that gives you a taste of how we believe in helping every baby thrive all around the idea that if we limit our conversation only to the amazing things that are in our bottle, we miss the opportunity to share what is in our heart. Everything we make, everything we do and everything we stand for at JOHNSON'S is as gentle as we want the world to be. Roll the video, please.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ALISON LEWIS: So a little taste of the powerful global platform innovation we have on JOHNSON'S that allow us to retain our #1 position and expand that position in the marketplace.</p><p>But just as important as big global platform innovation is, we need fast cycle, locally relevant innovation. And I'd be remiss in not talking about the premium segment for Baby where we continue on our premium platforms to see double-digit growth. And premium as a category actually outpaces the mass category by 2x and 2/3 of the premium business actually sits in China. We at JOHNSON'S already actually have the #2 baby premium brand in the world with AVEENO Baby and we've seen amazing success as we've rolled that out in China in the last year. In fact, China now represents our second largest AVEENO Baby market behind the U.S.</p><p>But we'll bring new innovation to China. Petite Planet from JOHNSON'S, which will be the first extension into premium under the JOHNSON'S name, launching in the back half of this year. This is a globally curated baby skin care collection inspired by the wisdom of mothers' traditions from all over the world. Each product in the collection is inspired by unique local ingredient with strong baby care rituals, so Nordic berry, Japanese lotus, African (inaudible), just as a few examples. This will allow us to strengthen our leadership position in premium baby and uniquely deliver against the China needs for continuous premium innovation.</p><p>Josh?</p><p>JOSH GHAIM: Thank you. The second area of focus in broadening the scope of our innovation model is all about creating superior product and packaging innovations and adding services via digital ecosystem that can create even more meaningful experiences and engagement with our consumers.</p><p>With NEUTROGENA, let me take you through 2 examples of how our superior scientific and clinical rigor drives our commitment to addressing the unmet needs and at the same time, how we're innovating in the digital and connected world.</p><p>Skin cancer is growing rapidly, yet one of the most preventable. One in three cancers diagnosed globally is actually skin cancer. A person dies every 57 minutes here in the U.S. Our ambition is to continue to reduce cancer around the world, specifically skin cancer around the world, promote sun care compliance by understanding consumer behaviors and the barriers that they face. But more importantly, educating our consumers in breakthrough ways that is truly going to cut through the clutter that exists in the market.</p><p>NEUTROGENA is the #1 dermatologist recommended sunscreen. Our broad educational initiatives match with products that have strong focus on science, but also equally important on esthetics of the product so that we can encourage more compliance.</p><p>Today, I'm excited to share the results of a recent study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. The randomized double-blind study evaluated SPF 100 versus SPF 50 under natural sunlight conditions. The results were very clear. After 1 day use, SPF 100 protected 2x better than SPF 50 regardless of the reapplication frequency and regardless of the skin type, demonstrating the importance of sun protection with the right SPF contrary to the belief that SPF 50 is actually enough protection. So all of you that are planning summer vacations, don't forget your SPF 100 NEUTROGENA product.</p><p>We also believe that superior products must be matched with superior packaging. Our new proprietary packaging innovation is quick and easy application that allows you to reach the hard-to-reach spots. You'll get a chance to see it when you visit the NEUTROGENA booth right outside the hall.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, we're taking our biggest strength of creating superior product and packaging innovation and adding services via digital ecosystem for innovating in the digital and connected world to drive personalization. We unveiled the NEUTROGENA Skin360 at the Consumer Electronics show in January. It is the first dermatologist-grade at-home skin analysis tool for your smartphone. It provides real time NEUTROGENA product recommendations, an ability to buy product and track progress you're making over time directly from the app. This is where our decade of skin -- decades of skin research and clinical efficacy data with digital diagnostic tools bring superior products and better outcomes for our consumers.</p><p>We have enhanced the smartphone camera with high accuracy, high magnification lens and controlled LED lighting, custom-built mobile app with J&amp;J algorithms to detect and quantify skin features, such as hydration, lines and wrinkles, pore sizes within the skin. This highlights our vision of internal scientific and clinical rigor complemented with external partnerships to bring innovation faster to the market. Let's take a look at the technology and how it works.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ALISON LEWIS: So a great example of taking existing products and combining services through technology and science and I encourage you all to try it outside at the NEUTROGENA booth.</p><p>So now let's talk about the second principle, build our brands to compete in 2 worlds. Again, there's 2 ways that we do this.</p><p>It starts with ensuring that we have global ideas and campaigns against our brands. This allows us to ensure that the brand is the brand is the brand around the world. But we amplify those global campaigns with local insights, making sure the brand feels like it was made just for you wherever you live.</p><p>So let's talk about ZYRTEC, which is a great example of a global campaign in Muddle No More. Muddle No More is based on a universal human insight that allergies create a wedge between the allergy sufferer and the people around them. It makes people feel isolated, lonely. They find suboptimal ways to cope and what ZYRTEC does, it shows through its advertising, that it really understands you as an allergy sufferer. It pokes a little fun at you and ultimately provides ZYRTEC as the solution.</p><p>This campaign was launched in the U.S. and has continuously driven share growth. We've now rolled it out across Canada, Australia, Philippines, Europe and later this year in China and seen similar results.</p><p>Global scale is really important, but for allergies are actually very local. And so only Texans know the misery of cedar fever and North Carolinians can appreciate the intensity of pine pollen. We need to go beyond just the global campaigns and bring local activation. And what the team did was create a proprietary sneeze trigger. This sneeze trigger uses local data to predict when allergies will hit. It's highly efficient because we only activate the brand when allergies are in season and that in-season differs by market and by country. It's highly effective in that it shows that the brand truly understands you because it understands the problem that you're suffering in that market at that time. It's personalized marketing at its best. Josh?</p><p>JOSH GHAIM: Thank you. And finally, the second way we're building brands to compete in this 2 worlds of large multinational players and small start-ups is all around our heritage and our unique differentiator of superior science-based benefits was professional endorsement and our core purpose.</p><p>Our relentless focus on scientific excellence and clinical efficacy is a true differentiator in our innovation model. Our consumer R&amp;D has published more fundamental and skin clinical research than any other global consumer company. In fact, 90% of all baby skin research publications is the result of our research or our collaborations.</p><p>Our scientific, regulatory and clinical excellence has enabled us to accelerate our global development in markets such as Japan, Russia and China and drive strong professional endorsement across many of our brands.</p><p>TYLENOL is a great example of how we bring superior science, a long history of clinical efficacy and our purpose together. It started over 60 years ago as a children's product. It was the first product that was safe to use for children versus aspirin. Today, TYLENOL is the most recommended analgesic and offers products across many benefits. Our launch of Rapid Release in 2017 shows our R&amp;D brilliance. These gel caps have laser-drilled holes in order to release drugs more quickly for faster pain relief. It helped TYLENOL gain 1.6 share since its launch in 2017.</p><p>This is just the first of many innovations we plan to bring into this category over the next few years. Alison?</p><p>ALISON LEWIS: Thanks, Josh. So science is a fantastic point of difference for us at Johnson &amp; Johnson. But it's not enough. We must balance that with purpose-inspired brands, which today is what millennials are looking for. What we believe for TYLENOL is that love and medicine is better than medicine alone. The brand connects on a deeper emotional level with a point of view. So in the U.S., we've done this by celebrating the diversity of families today. And in China, I'm about to share with you a sweet story of a father and son giving back to a mom what she has always given to them. Let's take a look.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ALISON LEWIS: Once again, here, we show that purpose is as important as superiority, a real competitive advantage for our brands and what those founder-based start-up brands do so well. We have just as rich and just as deep purposes for our Johnson &amp; Johnsonbrands. So we share them.</p><p>I'll now turn it back to Jorge.</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: Thank you very much, Alison and Josh. I hope you saw with these examples that we are really reinventing how we build our brands and how we innovate at Johnson &amp; Johnsonin order to meet the needs of current consumers and to compete in this new landscape.</p><p>The third principle I like to talk about is, again, how do we win in the existing channels but also in the new emerging ones. Our business and our brick-and-mortar customers is very sizable, and we are focused on winning with great sales fundamentals and joint value creating plans with them. But we're seeing clearly that a new omnichannel is really created. Consumers, even if they shop in brick-and-mortars, often are browsing online to decide which brands they go in to select. And of course, we're seeing that increasingly, more and more of our brands are purchased online. So we have to evolve with that shopper and meet our needs.</p><p>We're very proud of the strength and the accelerated growth of our e-commerce business. Last year, our e-commerce business grew 50%, well ahead of the market, which is growing around 30%, and we're gaining market share. And our aspiration is to increase this business sixfold over a 3-year period.</p><p>Now how are we doing that is by embracing a model we call SCANR, which is really all about excellence in online sales fundamentals. It starts with search. When the consumer searches for a benefit or a category or a question, our brand has to be there first. It all begins with that. And then we need to have excellent content. We have evidence that shows that when we have video reach in depth, depth of (inaudible) content, consumers are more likely to purchase your brand.</p><p>We have to have the right assortment, the right SKUs, the right power SKUs that will drive preference. We have to make navigation easy as a consumer browses online. Make it easy for her to both select what she wants and then to purchase our brand. And then lastly, ratings and reviews. What other consumers think of your brand and what they say online is more important to a future shopper than any message we can convey to them. So focus on these sales fundamentals is key for us to continue winning. And we know this can be done. China, for example, we're gaining market share online significantly. Today, 20% of our business in China is online. In fact, 30% of our Beauty business last year was online, and we expect this year, 35% of our business will be online in China in the Beauty category. And we have a great example with AVEENO Baby, which is also the #1 brand online in that market. So we see the future in China, and we believe the rest of the world is going to go there as well.</p><p>The last principle I like to talk to you today is, it's not enough to be efficient and to drive productivity and to eliminate cost and waste. We have to be more agile, more responsive, more flexible to meet customer needs much faster. We're very proud of the fact that over the last 4 years, we've taken $1.7 billion out of our system in terms of wasted cost and created value through strategic pricing, and that enabled the margin expansion I referred to before. But again, this is not enough. We have to become more responsive, more agile to meet consumer needs faster, just like these start-ups do. And we're starting to do that.</p><p>I'll give you an example. Last year, we launched a new light therapy line from NEUTROGENA, light therapy masks that provide consumers with a benefit that ranges from anti-aging, tone and acne. We believe this platform can disrupt the beauty industry. If you go to a dermatologist office today, the gold standard of care you can get is about $400 worth of light therapy. We are democratizing that and the consumer now can get that same treatment for 10 minutes for a few dollars. We're very excited about the opportunity this presents for us to meet consumer needs.</p><p>But particularly in the acne space, what we learned is that consumers like the benefit that we were offering, but they needed something that would help them with more acute lesions for acne. And so in only 8 months, we designed and launched a new light therapy pen, which consumers affectionately call the Zit-Zapper and it's really putting a lot of additional wins in our sales in this category. So a great example, I think, of responsiveness to meet consumer needs.</p><p>So in summary, we are already a solid contributor, an important contributor to Johnson &amp; Johnson. We have turnover of $13.6 billion and margins that are now in line with our peer set. Our aspiration as we go forward is to continue to grow consistently ahead of the market, year in and year out, starting in 2018, and to grow our margin ahead of our sales. And we're confident that we have the right strategies, that we are facing the reality of the changing landscape and making the necessary adjustments to compete in this new world.</p><p>So in summary, we believe that we will start winning again starting in 2018 above the market. We will do so by embracing this omnichannel and drive disproportionate growth online. We will do so by continuing to embrace our commitment to innovation and to leverage our powerful pipeline, which include the reinvention of our Oral Care and Baby Care businesses, and we'll continue to drive our operating margin even as we invest to continue to sustain our growth as we go forward. Thank you.</p><p>So what we would like to do next is just have a dialogue with you to answer any questions you may have. And for that, I'd like to invite Alison and Josh back on stage, along with Joe Wolk, Vice President of Investor Relations.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK, VP OF IR, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON: Hello, everyone. Good morning. I hope you enjoyed the consumer overview, and thanks for your continued interest in Johnson &amp; Johnsonhere today. So to ask a question, you have 2 options. Certainly, for those here in the room, you can raise your hand. We simply ask that you wait for a microphone so that folks that are participating via the webcast can also follow the discussion. We also have the opportunity for you to ask a question through our event app.</p><p>So with that, I'll open the floor up to somebody who may have a question. David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Obviously, given Alex's introduction, I have to give you the first question for trials and tribulations you took to come here.</p><p>DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. I wouldn't miss it for the world. A couple of quick questions here. The press release was very helpful in understanding how you're redeploying, personalization of the products is obviously what stuck out to me. But the one thing that wasn't addressed acutely was your big-box customers are feeling a lot of acute pricing pressure from large retailers. So what specifically do you do? How does that impact your business? Is it diversifying away from big-box distribution channels into e-commerce? And how do you take cost out of your system to sort of meet demand as these big-box customers are coming under pressure?</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: Yes. We work strategically with our big customers, whether they are brick-and-mortar retailers or online retailers on what we call joint value-creating plans. So think about a 3-year horizon plan where we together look at efficientizing our business, including the supply chain and eliminating waste in our integrated operations and then how do we innovate together to meet the needs of their shoppers. As we do so and as we innovate, we do customize differently to meet the different needs of shoppers from the different channels. If you go to a Dollar Store, consumers are looking for the same benefits, but offered in a different price point and a different format than personal shops online. So what you'll see as we innovate, Dave, is we will continue to try to differentiate not only from a pricing standpoint, but from a product offering and proposition standpoint, focused on understanding the shopper needs, which are different from channel to channel.</p><p>ALISON LEWIS: I'd also just build on that. I think you heard me talk a little bit about premiumization of Baby and I think that's a great way through both innovation. I talked about Petite Planet, but also I talked about AVEENO Baby and it's seeing strong double-digit growth. So these premium brands also help with bringing the pricing up in the category and ensuring that we have a brand that competes against every segment, which also helps to manage against any pricing pressure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just 2 quick follow-ups for me, Jorge. The first is you talked about growing above market, can you just define for us again what specifically, what growth rate is market growth? You have a whole bunch of different brands in a lot of different markets. So what is market growth so you can grow faster than that? And second thing is a lot of the thing that came out in this presentation were you're competing with local players, smaller players that are doing better or more nimble, more innovative. Are you as convinced today as you were 3 years ago that be big in a lot of these categories is an advantage and is there a suggestion that maybe consumer needs to get smaller and more focused, maybe be very dedicated to health, beauty or wellness or something like that?</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: No, I would say, starting with your second question, we do believe that we have enormous strengths that come with scale, and we believe it's very important we continue to embrace that. Our science-based superiority, the relationships we have with our customers, our insights in the category are something we need to continue to leverage. However, as we shared with you across this whole morning, we need to make our brands feel more personable, more intimate, more local and less global in terms of how they come across to consumers and that impacts everything we do. It impacts how we innovate, impacts how we design our products, and so that's the key challenge that we are focused on. We don't -- we believe that every category in which we compete can become one that feels to consumers as being more personal, more intimate, a brand that is more purposeful and more differentiated from an innovation standpoint, just as dynamic and fresh and unexpected as some of these local brands are. That's what we need to do. So we do believe that scale is not something that is a hindrance for our success, quite to the contrary, but it needs to be complemented by these more entrepreneurial qualities.</p><p>JOSH GHAIM: I guess 2 things to add to that is, one, when we talk about small companies without the scale or without the science, so we showed you the personalization, for example, for NEUTROGENA Skin360, it's a small company that actually came up with the idea. And when it first came, they said we can magnify skin images by 30x basically. Our first reaction was, so what if you don't have the science, the clinical data to actually match that and make specific recommendations. So I think you'll see is that we're doing a lot more collaboration, 50% of our pipeline is actually through those collaborations with small start-ups and that's a big part of the pipeline that we're building.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: And Jorge, would you like to address the second question that David had, regarding market growth and what we assume that is going forward?</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: As I said before, the categories in which we play have been very healthy and robust, growing about 4% to 5% over the last 4 years. We saw a slowdown in 2017 to something less than that. We expect the markets will continue to get back to grow around 4% as we go forward here. That's what we've seen in the last few years.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Is that Joanne Wuensch from BMO?</p><p>JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH, MD &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Joanne Wuensch from BMO. I'm a med tech girl, so this is all sort of new to me. I hear you talking about personalization and new branding, but how long does that really take to gain traction? And if you move from we had a tough 2017 to we're going to grow above market growth in 2018, how do we think about that trajectory and then looking forward into '19 and beyond?</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: Sure. The reality is the pace of change in our industry is accelerating at a rate that is unprecedented. And so we've been, of course, monitoring all these events. And we kind of consolidated our thinking around what needed to be done differently so that we can compete in this new landscape throughout last year. And we put in motion already the interventions that were required for us to restore the kind of growth that we've enjoyed in the past. So as I said before, we're confident that we are getting back to growing ahead of the market starting this year and sustain that kind of above market performance as we go forward.</p><p>JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH: And then as a follow-up, are there any brands within your categories that you feel like you don't have or anything after your evaluation of the last year that you sort of think about minimizing in a more significant way?</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: Yes. I think it's a good question. What I would say is, we are blessed with a full portfolio of brands. And frankly, our presence globally with these brands is not as uniform as it should be and it needs to be. So we still see a lot of runway for us to globalize with brands that we do have. That said, as you know, we have a very robust M&amp;A process in the company where we are very disciplined about assessing within each one of the categories where we compete and adjacencies around them, are there opportunities for us to create value and further accelerate our growth, opportunities like, for example, Vogue that we acquired 2 years ago. So we continue to canvass the market for that. And also to continue to look at ways to prune the tail of our portfolio. So that's an ongoing strategic process that we review with Alex and Dominic regularly. The one thing I'd say though, we're not only focused at acquiring and looking at brands themselves, but often, there's new capabilities that some of these start-up companies have that could accelerate our ability to compete in this new landscape. So we're looking for that as well in addition to brands themselves.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Okay. Yes, Glenn Novarro, RBC.</p><p>GLENN JOHN NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: 2 questions. Jorge, you talked about 2017 being a challenging year. First quarter was also a little challenging, but it -- your competitors are reporting the same challenges and I get it. There's the online competition, there's the local competition. But I just want to make sure that there's nothing else out there that we're missing. So that's question #1. And the second question is, J&amp;J in a negative way has been in the headlines with the baby powder. And I'm wondering has that had any negative impact on the brand? Have you done any focus groups with consumers to make sure that the brand is still fine in the eyes of consumers?</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: Sure. It's a fair question, Glenn. I mean, the reality is what we spent this morning showing with you is all the things we believe we need to do different so that we can strengthen our relevance and get back to winning above the market. And as I said before, we are confident that throughout this year, we will do so. One of the things that has been holding our performance back has been our Baby Care business. If you look at our performance in Beauty Care, in OTC and Oral Care, it's been strong over the years. And of course, we've been working hard to reinvent the Baby Care business and we're confident that, that's going to swing from being a drag in our performance to being a driver of growth. So I think the combination of all the changes we described to you today and a healthy and vibrant Baby Care business is going to get us back to sustainable growth. Sorry, I missed the -- remind me of your second question, if you will.</p><p>GLENN JOHN NOVARRO: Talc, regarding the talc.</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: With regard to talc, sorry. What I can assure you is we've been through this extensively, and we are 100% sure that our talc product is safe. And we will continue to defend our brand, we will continue to defend our product. Talc is only a very small portion of our business. It's like 0.3% of our total sales. And it's more relevant in emerging markets of the world where some of the news that have been in headlines because of these lawsuits have been less relevant. So what I would say in general is we have not seen a significant impact from the talc issues on overall performance of the business.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Yes. Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.</p><p>ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. I was hoping you could give us some early insights into the change that's taking in the consumer business. Are there any things you could point to early on or that we'll see throughout the first half or the rest of 2018 that really demonstrates the change that's taking hold?</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: Sure. I think you'll see it in a number of ways, some more visible than others. So one thing is that our innovation pipeline, we're not at liberty to share with you all the things that we're launching this year. In this industry, things move very fast. And so it's something we have -- we're not at liberty to share to you today. But you'll see that in addition to the -- what you heard today, there's a lot more transformational innovation coming in the back half of this year that we're very excited about. The other thing that we didn't cover here today but I'd like to share with you, just to dimensionalize the transformation that we're driving inside our company is we're evolving our organizational design to a more agile entrepreneurial model. So for example, in the United States, we have a $5 billion business, and we have divided that now in 10 working squads of about $0.5 billion internal of each -- over each. And the squad think about it as a multidisciplinary end-to-end group of leaders colocated, empowered to make decisions and to run more entrepreneurially to compete in a market in which they are responsible for. And then what we envision is that these squads will exist around the world in critical country category combinations, all rowing together to execute the global strategy that we have identified for that category. So we're driving real change in how we organize, how we'll go about our work to become more like a giant startup that I discussed.</p><p>ALISON LEWIS: The other thing I'll just mention is we continue to invest a lot in data and analytics and we get better and better and better at using the data analytics to basically leverage that against our digital marketing to make sure we get better return from every dollar we invest and drive greater personalization in the messaging, which is super important when you think about our categories and the brands that we have with a very unique problem solutions and you want to reach that person with precision. I talked a little bit about that with ZYRTEC and the sneeze trigger. That's a great example of data analytics, fueling a more personalized message and a better return, which is part of our productivity agenda. It doesn't mean we're cutting marketing dollars, but it means every marketing dollar is working that much harder. So those are the types of things. And these are the things those small companies and small startups do that we're doing very well now, and we're really excited about the success we're seeing there.</p><p>ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS: And you mentioned this in different parts across the presentations, but maybe you could give us some more insight into what changes you're making internally to attract the personnel that could help drive these changes.</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: Well, I mean, I think that the -- what -- a student that joins the workforce once today is a dynamic entrepreneurial place, a place where they can make a personal difference and they feel that they kind of own the shop somewhat. That sense of ownership, that sense of being able to make an early impact is what people want more than ever today. By evolving our model, to become more agile, more entrepreneurial like that and by innovating in a way that is more [just continuous], more relevant to consumers, we can create a kind of atmosphere, the kind of growth opportunity that will make us a very attractive place for a young person joining the workforce.</p><p>ALISON LEWIS: I think we're adding positions like data scientists, we're adding positions like content manager, we're bringing people in from different companies, different businesses. We're putting people in charge of incubator brands. Go figure out how to restage or relaunch this, go figure out how you create a brand through social media data. Those are the types of things we're doing, which are super exciting. And because we have the scale and resources, that actually is exciting to the people that sit outside because they look at us and they say, \"You can do more.\" I mean, we have what those small brands want, the scale and resources. They have the speed and agility. Jorge talked about how we're driving the speed and agility, we're bringing the scale and resources.</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: Just only -- the only thing to add to that is the partnerships that are -- that we're building across -- around the world with small startups, with new innovators around the world. That's also another way of -- that people don't have to be at J&amp;J all the time. I think it is the partnerships, the work that we do with them that's also extremely relevant.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Alex, you wanted to add something.</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: (inaudible) Yes. If I can just maybe add a little bit of a corporate overlay to that, that relates to consumer but also more broadly across all of Johnson &amp; Johnson. And I said earlier, I probably couldn't resist doing this from time to time, so I hope it's okay with everybody. But as we look at talent across J&amp;J, we actually feel very confident in our ability to continue to attract and retain across all of our different segments. And look, a lot of it, we believe, and we've actually validated this through some of the research that we have done, gets back to this culture and credo. I mean, number one, and I might go out on a limb here, I think there's a sense here that the millennial today is going to work 85 different jobs, change jobs every 6 months. Our surveys don't support that. Our surveys show that when you provide them a purpose-driven place where you're not going to go to a company that maybe has a cool technology zapped at name, but basically, you're gonna be making clickbait or a headline versus actually making a difference in patients' lives that we constantly emphasize in all of our recruiting, makes a big difference. And so if we look at our traction rates from schools, frankly, from other industries, it's very strong. If we look at millennial turnover rate, it doesn't differ significantly than any one of our other segments. A lot of that has to do with the fact that we provide, for example, 17 weeks with a millennial mom, if she's going to have a baby and the father, that they can have that kind of maternity leave. Another very interesting fact, when we survey our millennials, the #1 reason they say to be at J&amp;J, #1 or #2, is purpose, our credo, and #2, our pension. Who would have thought? Again, there's a lot of misnomers out there. Well, pension is not important to me. No, I'd say just the opposite. If you go back to 2008 and 2009 when a lot of them were getting into the workforce, they got burned. And so I think doing all those things that we found is actually our intention. And finally, they can join J&amp;J and they can have a career like many of the executives you see today where can rotate across region, across sector and you don't have to change company and do that trade-off. So -- and we don't take any of it for granted. We fight for it every day. But what I'd encourage you to do is ask some of the employees outside in the exhibits who you can hear from first hand to maybe reinforce some of those things. Thank you.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Tony Butler, Guggenheim.</p><p>CHARLES ANTHONY BUTLER, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jorge, you alluded to taking $1.7 billion of cost out. I'm respectful of that, I'm also respectful of 20% out margins. But the key question is, is 20% the peak? And if not, what could be the peak?</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: Sure. It's a fair question. Well, as you point out, we do feel good about the fact that we've come a long way. And now, we are slightly below our peers at average. And clearly, that's not a place where we need to be. So our goal is to continue to improve our margins but in a sustainable way, which allows us to reinvest to continue to drive top line growth ahead of the market. And we think there's still opportunity for us to drive margin. But again, we need to balance that with our desire to invest to capitalize on the -- all the opportunities you heard about today.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: And Tony, maybe just to elaborate. That's not just for consumer business. That's for our pharmaceutical and med device business as well, that idea of growing the bottom line faster than the top line. So even though pharmaceuticals and medical devices operate at higher margins compared to peer set, we still strive to improve that each and every year. Okay. I think we have time for one more question. Yes? Up here.</p><p>JAYSON TYLER BEDFORD, SENIOR MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND DEVICES ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp; ASSOCIATES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. There wasn't much mention of emerging markets. And a couple of years ago, I think you talked about 60% of the expected growth coming from Emerging Markets. So I guess, the questions are: one, have emerging markets lived up to your expectation? And two, should we still view it as a key growth driver?</p><p>JORGE S. MESQUITA: It's a good question. And I do believe that the emerging markets will continue to drive about 60% of our growth going forward. That remains our assumption in the strat plan. I will say last year was a bit of an exception to the rule for very unique reasons. Say, you take India, for example. There's been very disruptive efforts to transform, to modernize the Indian economy, which are going to pay huge dividends mid to long term but created a really shocking in the economy and the consumption and liquidity with our customers in the time frame itself. Brazil, we still are very bullish on long term. But you saw that last year, the country went through a very cathartic process of ridding itself of corruption, which, again, created a short-term impact. Russia suffered a bit from low oil prices and the liquidity issues that came with that. So the exception was really China, where we continue to see a terrific growth. But whether you look at BRIC or the MINT markets, Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey, and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, we still see tremendous growth opportunities as we go forward. And so we remain just as bullish as we were, and we see last year's more an exception to the rule for emerging markets.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Okay, great. So that concludes our consumer panel. I want to thank Jorge, Alison and Josh. I know the audience found the presentation and the resulting conversation informative and valuable. So thank you. We'll now take a quick break.</p><p>I would encourage you to visit our exhibits. They are open and they'll be open again at lunchtime. It really gives you a great opportunity to hear from additional business leaders in our Consumer and Medical Device units. And it really features the exciting products and technology that is discussed in today's presentations. We will return here and begin our program promptly at 10:40. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Group Worldwide Chair, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Sandi Peterson.</p><p>SANDRA E. PETERSON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, GROUP WORLDWIDE CHAIRMAN, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON: So good morning. I hope you guys were as excited as I was listening to Jorge, Josh and Alison talk about all the amazing things that we're doing in our consumer business and how they have really lived into understanding and owning the consumer and understanding the changed market environment and then clearly living into the science base of everything that we do. And I hope you share my conviction that they are -- that we are making the right choices to be relevant for consumers in the future the way we have been for over 130 years.</p><p>We clearly have built on a legacy of deep consumer understanding and science-based differentiation in our consumer business. Our team is demonstrating flexibility and creativity in not only responding to the disruption in the marketplace but more importantly, there actually capitalizing on it, to ensure that we restore above-market growth for J&amp;J consumer.</p><p>So both our Consumer Medical Device businesses are competing in industries that are undergoing profound shifts. As Jorge said, it's just as relevant in Medical Devices, the old playbooks are being rewritten. New players are entering the market, harnessing data to create new customer-centric business models and disrupting traditional value chains.</p><p>Two years ago, in this setting, I spoke about the shifts taking place at the intersection of science, technology and health. I remember saying then that business of health and well-being was changing at a pace that I've never seen before in my career. And let me tell you, in the last 2 years, it surely isn't slowing down.</p><p>In a few moments, you'll hear from some of our key medical device business leaders. Some of them you've met before, some of them, this will be your first experience seeing them in action.</p><p>The 4 markets that make up our Medical Device portfolio are unique and they had unique attributes, and each business is in a very different stage. But like all of our businesses at Johnson &amp; Johnson, they are all focused on delivering sustainable above-market growth. Across Medical Devices, we are executing robust, holistic, innovation and growth strategies.</p><p>As Alex said, we are relentlessly focused on execution, driving quality, simplifying operations and delivering new commercial models in response to changing customer needs. And in each business, we're leveraging science, technology, scale and expertise to meet the evolving expectations of health systems and people around the world.</p><p>But let's be clear. Health care is one of the world's greatest challenges. And it also represents a great market with many new opportunities for Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Devices. Global health care spend is growing faster than GDP and as we all know, it's disproportionally concentrated in developed markets.</p><p>The industry landscape is being reshaped, creating new challenges, but we see them as new opportunities. Around the world, the 60-and-over population is growing faster than all other age groups. And in emerging markets, the middle class is growing at an unprecedented rate of speed. Did you know that it's adding 5 people to the middle class a second? That's 1 million people a day. Actually, if -- the equivalent of a small city that's going to be created in the middle class and emerging markets as we're sitting here today.</p><p>Economic development, especially in these emerging markets, is increasing health care access and demand enormously. But while that's happening, we're also seeing consolidation and globalization among our customers, the increased influence of the consumer as patient and the migration of care outside of the hospital. The advances in science, technology and data analytics create immense opportunities for J&amp;J to provide new types of care that it can extend and improve lives in new places and delivered in a varied new ways.</p><p>We believe that J&amp;J is uniquely positioned to respond to these forces. We are the market leader in surgery, in orthopedics and in contact lenses. Our products are in nearly every OR in the world and are used in over 75 million procedures a year. And we have a specific strength in emerging markets where much of the procedural growth will occur.</p><p>The global medical device market is attractive and it's growing. We estimate, by 2022, the markets we compete in will grow in over $120 billion. The total medical device market will top about $490 billion. But the markets we compete in are projected to grow faster than the average of the medical device market. And we expect the overall growth rate in emerging markets, where we have a particular strength, to grow by approximately 7%.</p><p>From our earliest days, Johnson &amp; Johnsonidentified unmet needs and created new markets in medical devices. We made surgery safer, we create -- we increased access to surgical care, and we helped people recover from accidents. We trained literally hundreds of thousands of surgeons around the world. We became the leader in minimally invasive surgery. We have played a key role in restoring mobility and site. We also have been at the forefront of controlling surgical bleeding and infection around the world.</p><p>But in recent years, our track record has been uneven. At the 2016 Analyst Meeting, we had recently announced a major restructuring. And at that meeting, we projected above-market growth across the sector. We are on track to deliver on our commitment of $800 million to $1 billion in savings by 2020. However, we've grown above market in only some of our businesses.</p><p>Quite honestly, we had some missteps. Our innovation cadence in some areas was not what it should have been. Many of our resources were still tied up in completing remediation and integration work rather than in innovation. We also fell short in much of our commercial execution, which was compounded by the restructuring disruption and sales force attrition.</p><p>We're clearly not satisfied with this performance, and we are laser-focused on delivering consistent and above-market growth going forward. And I hope you will see throughout the rest of the day the progress that we have made and why we're convinced we will change this trajectory.</p><p>Over the past 12 months, we have made significant progress resetting the foundation in medical devices. We're reshaping the portfolio and making major strides in improving quality, growth and execution. We had failed critical portfolio gaps, accelerated our deal pace and divested businesses with slower growth or which were no longer a strategic fit for us. We've built new platforms in stroke and surgical vision. By the end of the year, we expect to have completed the diabetes divestiture, which will improve our overall growth rate by 1 full point.</p><p>In 2017 alone, we doubled the number of new product launches and we launched them on time. This year, as you've already heard and you'll hear more about through the rest of the day, we will launch between 15 and 20 major new products this year.</p><p>Last year, we simplified our R&amp;D organization. We shifted investments from incremental programs into programs with much higher potential and transformative impact. We have increased our pipeline value and expanded our innovation focus beyond the product.</p><p>In 2017, we invested over $5 billion with more than 30 acquisitions, investments and partnerships. We will continue to manage our portfolio with discipline, aggressively seeking out opportunities to acquire products and solutions that will make a difference to the patients and customers we serve and bring new capabilities to strengthen our ability to compete and grow.</p><p>We are improving execution across all dimensions of the business. Number one, we're improving quality and reducing the complexity of our operations; number two, we're enhancing our commercial capabilities; and number three, we are learning to collaborate with our customers in new ways.</p><p>The lifting of the Synthes warning letter on February 1 of this year was a major quality milestone. We have designed strong quality systems and we are focused on innovation and execution in addition to sustaining that strong quality. We have simplified our product portfolio, eliminating more than 26,000 SKUs, which equates to about 11% of our SKU count.</p><p>We continue to focus on optimizing every aspect of our supply chain, work that's improving our gross profit and equally importantly, our customer responsiveness. We are also investing in sales force training, increasing both clinical and commercial sales coverage, and we are building critical new commercial capabilities in analytics, in pricing and in strategic account management. These investments and this focus is beginning to drive growth and profitability. We are also evolving our go-to-market models and entering new channels in response to changing customer needs and dynamics.</p><p>As part of the world's most broadly based health care company, we bring unrivaled knowledge, resources and experience to bear for our customers. We're actually actively co-creating with health systems around the world to improve outcomes, to increase patient satisfaction, but equally important for them, to reduce costs. We are introducing digitally enabled services and tools. And these are designed: first, to optimize surgery and OR efficiently; second, to strengthen surgical skill sets; and third, to help patients better prepare for surgery and recover more quickly.</p><p>Last year, we launched 26 global Johnson &amp; JohnsonInstitute sites, reasserting our leadership and professional education. We are investing in new capabilities and reimagining what surgical training can be.</p><p>So bringing these all together, with our strengthened foundation, we expect and are committed to accelerating growth sequentially in 2018 and achieving above-market growth across our total portfolio by 2020.</p><p>At Johnson &amp; Johnson, we are focused on 4 medical device markets, all very attractive, with areas of significant unmet need. We are the world's largest orthopedics business, we continue to be the leader in the global surgery, we are a strong player in high-growth interventional solutions market and we are the #1 in the contact lens category. We have also, during this time frame, made significant investments in future areas where we can build new markets and new forms of care. These include surgical robotics, oncology and ablation, neurovascular and orthopedic robotics.</p><p>As you will hear from the team through the rest of the day, we believe that we are well positioned in most of the categories in which we compete. Our performance is very strong in wound closure, in biosurgery, in endomechanical, in trauma, in hips, in eye health and in electrophysiology. But you'll also hear about the work that we're doing to address the challenges we have in 3 of our businesses, in energy, in knee and in spine, and why we are confident and I'm hopeful by the end of today, you will also be confident that we're going to improve the trajectory of these 3 businesses.</p><p>Two years ago, we told you that the competitive advantage of J&amp;J was our breadth and scale that will increase as the environment -- the external environment evolves. Our customers are very diverse and they need very different kinds of support and engagement from us. Our recreation of our commercial model, quite honestly, took us longer than we expected, but I'm delighted to tell you that it's actually now paying off.</p><p>In 2018 alone, we racked up more than 50 cross-category multiyear customer wins. That's double the number in the fourth quarter of 2017, and we clearly expect that upward trajectory to continue. It's actually really exciting to see how our business model innovation with our customers and co-creating things that they really need is leading to tangible wins. Let me just give you a couple of examples.</p><p>In the U.S., we deployed CareAdvantage programs in 132 health systems in 2017. So CareAdvantage is what we call our holistic approach to helping customers improve care and actually increase efficiency and outcomes by bringing a very broad range of capabilities to work with our customers that go beyond the product to help them meet their specific unique needs. 132 in 2017 alone.</p><p>Let me give you another example. In the Middle East, in response to changes in our customers' needs in Saudi Arabia, which took a very different approach and we evolved our go-to-market model. We announced a joint venture in Saudi Arabia which allows us to work with health care providers and partners to develop solutions that not only reduce costs but they deliver better outcomes and ensure patient satisfaction across many disease states, including obesity and orthopedics.</p><p>We expect to see the impact of these wins and others as the year progresses, not only in 2018, but beyond as this momentum gross, and we continue to co-create with our customers and meet them where they need help.</p><p>We also believe that our refreshed approach to professional education will drive competitive advantage and growth for J&amp;J.</p><p>As many of you know, Johnson &amp; Johnsonhad been at the forefront of providing comprehensive disease state and procedural education for health care professionals around the world for decades. We are very, very proud of that work. But the demand is increasing, especially in Emerging Markets where there is an insufficient number of qualified surgeons. Training more surgeons creates access for patients and increases procedural volume while it also improves patient experience and measured outcomes. To meet these challenges, we've rethought how we do this and we've built an omni-channel education system designed to support surgical innovation and improve surgeon and care team skills. Our training technologies can help deliver better patient outcomes, improve our efficiency and transform the way care is delivered. My simple analogy is it's like the way pilots and athletes are trained today. By combining the best features of virtual and lab training, we can drive the best outcome for patients, physicians and health systems.</p><p>I hope at one of the breaks, you will get a chance to see some of that work in action. It's really exciting and it's having a huge impact in training surgeons around the world.</p><p>So at J&amp;J, we are innovating at the forefront of science and technology. We are developing connected products and solutions across the entire patient journey not just in the OR. We're leveraging data and insights to lower cost, increase access and improve outcomes. And not surprisingly, we're doing all of this with an incredible focus on disciplined commercial execution.</p><p>I am convinced that after hearing from our team today, you will get the sense of the intensity of our commitment and actually equally importantly, the enthusiasm we have for the future and what we can do to help patients around the globe.</p><p>We are increasing our innovation cadence. We are optimizing our portfolio, making sure that we're targeting high-growth categories and unmet needs while exiting slower growth businesses. We are relentlessly focused on execution in all of its dimension across our whole business, and we will accelerate growth sequentially in 2018 and are absolutely committed to achieving above-market growth across all of our businesses in 2020 and beyond.</p><p>So now it's really my pleasure to introduce to you the talented, committed people who lead our Medical Device businesses. You'll hear from our leaders in interventional orthopedics, surgery and eye health. Together, this may surprise you, but they actually represent about a century's worth of experience and knowledge and expertise in this business. And I must tell you, I am very pleased, honored and privileged to have the opportunity to work with this team every single day. They're wonderful people who are doing amazing things to help people live better, healthier lives.</p><p>So Shlomi Nachman, Ciro R\u00c3\u00b6mer and Michael Del Prado will next take you through the work we are doing to grow and shape the industry in interventional solutions and orthopedics and in surgery. Peter Shen and Euan Thomson will then share with you an exciting update about our pipeline of innovation and our approach to transforming digital surgery and robotics; and finally, Ashley McEvoy and Xiao-Yu Song will show the compelling story of vision care and the transformation that we have made in this business, our contact lens business, as well as creating a comprehensive eye health business over the last few years.</p><p>Now it's my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Shlomi Nachman, who will lead the interventional and specialist solutions business. Shlomi?</p><p>SHLOMI NACHMAN, COMPANY GROUP CHAIRMAN, INTERVENTIONAL SOLUTIONS &amp; SPECIALTY SURGERY, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON: Thank you, Sandy. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. Thank you. I'm very happy to be here today to share our strategy to sell to millions of patients around the world who can benefit from our solution to treating both atrial fibrillation and stroke.</p><p>Let me start with introducing the platforms in the market. Interventional solution is a $2.3 billion portfolio in medical devices. It includes Biosense Webster, focusing on electrophysiology; and CERENOVUS, focused on neurovascular. Both markets are really attractive, growing double digits. The EP market is about $4.4 billion market, with a very strong CAGR of estimated at around 11%. Biosense Webster is the undisputed market leader and -- across all regions, with over 46% share and about $2 billion in revenue. We are very, very proud in our of performance, delivering strong double-digit growth over the last 9-plus years and taking share every year, each and every year. On the neurovascular side, the worldwide market is about $2 billion, with a CAGR of roughly 10%. Currently, we are #4 in the market, with revenues of about $200 million.</p><p>As you know, we made a series of portfolio decisions last year. When we divested Codman Neurosurgery, we elected to focus on neurovascular. We acquired Neuravi and Pulsar Vascular. We formed CERENOVUS, and we have started a new chapter in neuro intervention, a new exciting chapter in neuro intervention. I will go into details first on atrial fibrillation and Biosense Webster, and then I will cover stroke and CERENOVUS.</p><p>So what is AFib? AFib is the rapid irregular heart rate that cause poor blood flow. Patients' symptoms typically include heart palpitations, shortness of breath and fatigue. Some patients describe it like being hit by a truck. Patient quality of life is significantly impaired, not to mention the 5x higher risk of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is truly becoming one of the world's most significant public health issues.</p><p>It is estimated that about 33 million individuals around the world are living with atrial fibrillation, with 5 million patients diagnosed each year, placing a critical, critical burden on the health care system. In fact, based on statistics, probably 1 out of 6 of us in this room will experience AFib in their lifetime.</p><p>So what are the treatment options for patients with atrial fibrillation? One option is medication, namely blood thinners such as XARELTO and, of course, anti-arrhythmic drugs. These primarily address symptoms, and we know that about 1/2 of the patients don't respond well to anti-arrhythmic drugs. The only potential curative option is interventional procedure known as ablation. However, while ablation is becoming more common procedure, penetration is still less than 10%. This represents incredible opportunity for both Biosense Webster and, of course, Johnson &amp; Johnson. With this in mind, let me talk about our innovation strategy.</p><p>We all know hospital systems are under pressure to increase productivity while managing cost and improving patient care. This challenge is further compounded due to the AFib population expected to double between now and 2030. This means our customers need to increase lab efficiency with safe and effective procedure for both paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation.</p><p>To address our customers' unmet needs our innovation strategy is focused on 3 areas: first, locate where to ablate with high-density mapping solutions; second, deliver better lesion with high-power, short-duration procedure; and third, simplify the procedure with single-shot device.</p><p>With those innovations, we know physicians can now increase their success rates from about 60% to 70% to about 90%. They reduce their fluoroscopy from about 1 hour in the past to less than 5 minutes today. And they're reducing the procedure time from roughly 4 to 6 hours to less than 2 hours today. Personally, I'm very excited with our strong innovation pipeline. Biosense Webster is clearly, clearly leading the way.</p><p>Now let me share with you some other steps that we are taking to continue fueling our growth momentums. First, we're expanding our unique commercial model. Our clinical account specialists support customers at every case. In the U.S., for example, we have more than 90% of the navigation cases covered. Meaning we are there providing support to our customers and gaining valuable insights.</p><p>Second, we are taking steps to expand our indication to include persistent atrial fibrillation and establishing ablation as a first-line therapy. We have made a significant progress in our clinical pipeline. We just recently finished our enrollment in our PRECEPT study for persistent AF indication. And as you might know, we are one of the key sponsor for CABANA, designed to establish AF as a first-line therapy.</p><p>Third, we continue to invest in adjacent interventional solution beyond ablation. I mentioned earlier the higher stroke risk associated with atrial fibrillation, our acquisition of Coherex and the commercialization of the WaveCrest left atrial appendage device expand our capabilities to address this stroke risk.</p><p>Let me switch now from the heart to the brain. I'm sure you are familiar with the devastating nature of stroke. Stroke is one of the most feared diseases, robbing millions of their independence and their quality of life. It is truly a worldwide public health issue. Strokes claim life every 6 seconds and has far-reaching implications in terms of disability, and of course, an extraordinarily high burden on the health care system. Let's understand better what is stroke.</p><p>Stroke is basically a brain attack and it can happen to anyone at any time at any age. There are two types of stroke: ischemic, caused by a clot, accounts for roughly 90% of the worldwide stroke cases; and hemorrhagic, which is caused by a rupture in the vessel, accounts for the remaining 10%. Treatment for hemorrhagic stroke is primarily preventative, with the use of stents and coils to prevent rupture. Treatment for ischemic stroke is acute, with either mechanical tubectomy or aspiration device.</p><p>With the strong clinical evidence established over the last few years, the ischemic stroke market is booming and present a very exciting opportunity to make a difference. They say time is brain. Every second matter in stroke treatment. Therefore, our innovation strategy is designed to address unmet needs in restoring oxygen to the brain. We are doubling down in ischemic stroke with the introduction of EmboTrap our stent</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>device, and focusing investment on solution to -- designed to remove the clot quickly.</p><p>On the hemorrhagic side, we just introduced the G3 coil mini device as well as the PulseRider, the only device on the market to treat bifurcated aneurysm.</p><p>To accelerate our growth, we're excited about entering 2 new segments that are significantly in the field of neuro intervention. First, and as I just mentioned, we entered the ischemic stroke market with EmboTrap, the next-generation stent device. The technology is currently in Europe, showing great momentum. And I'm excited to share with you that just last week, we received FDA clearance, and we are gearing up for commercialization next month. I hope that that you will take the time to see this great technology in our innovation display. Second, in the hemorrhagic market, we will be entering the flow diverter segment by launching our BRAVO device in Europe later this year.</p><p>In order to drive overall adoption and clinical differentiation, we are investing heavily in evidence generation and we're expanding our field process all over the world. I'm very excited of our progress in neurovascular space. I believe that we are very well positioned to take share and be a strong contender in this space.</p><p>In summary, I'm really excited, extremely excited about the future of interventional solution, and I'm confident we will continue delivering strong double-digit growth, fueled by innovation and commercial execution. Our sense of urgency is stronger than ever before. Literally, millions of patients are waiting for us, and we are committing -- committed to addressing their needs.</p><p>Thank you for your time today, and I look forward to your questions later. Now let me introduce my colleague and friend, Ciro Roemer, who lead Orthopedics. Thank you.</p><p>CIRO ROEMER, COMPANY GROUP CHAIRMAN, DEPUY SYNTHES, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON MEDICAL DEVICES, NORTH AMERICA: Good morning. Thank you, Shlomi. Good morning. Again, my name is Ciro Roemer, and it's a pleasure to be here with you today to, first of all, share the orthopedics market's perspective, update you on our progress, but more importantly, present how we are positioned to win in this dynamic but very exciting environment.</p><p>Now movement is a fundamental aspect of our lives, yet for millions of people, movement is compromised. Approximately 110 million people suffer from symptomatic hip and knee osteoarthritis and 250 million people suffer from osteoporosis worldwide. Now this leads to approximately 1.6 million hip replacements, 2.2 million knee replacements and 6.4 operatively treated fractures every year. Additionally, only 40% of certain spine surgeries are successful using today's available technologies. Now as the largest and most comprehensive orthopedics business in the world, Johnson &amp; Johnsonhas a critical role to play in tackling this challenge.</p><p>Now let's talk about the position that we have in the market. The orthopaedics business is the world's largest and most comprehensive business in a USD 45 billion market. We're operating from a position of strength. We're established broadly across orthopedics, with significant market share across our platforms. We're either #1 or #2 in 3 out of 5 platforms. Growth is forecasted to be around a 3% worldwide CAGR through 2022.</p><p>Now as Sandy mentioned, we're experiencing good performance with our trauma, hips and sport platforms. We expect that with our differentiated portfolio and pipeline, we will lead to above-market growth this year and beyond for those platforms.</p><p>Now we still have work to do in our spine and knees business, and I will address this as we deep dive in our platforms. We're, however, very confident that as we complete our portfolio and address of the spine sales force attrition, we will stabilize our performance in spine and knees year and anticipate to grow above market by 2020.</p><p>Now we're very proud of the substantial progress we have made since the last time we were in front of you. We are very confident that this will fuel our future growth. We have significantly reinvested in innovation and, as we are increasing our launch cadence, expect to gain market momentum. We launched 8 major products in 2017 and plan another 7 to 10 in 2018.</p><p>We've also filled key portfolio gaps through external innovation with 11 deals in 2017 alone. We've also been increasing our presence in the important digitally enabled solutions area. You will hear more about that later in my representation but also from our R&amp;D leader, Euan Thomson. As Sandi mentioned, we have also completed critical quality and regulatory remediation, and we have successfully passed 21 FDA inspections. Earlier this year, the FDA lifted the warning letter issued to Synthes in 2012 prior to the company's acquisition. And last but not least, we have stabilized our commercial organization, and evolved our go-to-market model, which I'll get to later.</p><p>Now Orthopaedics is important for Johnson &amp; Johnson, and we're building the Orthopaedics company of the future. Starting from a leadership position, our business strategy is to transform procedures to personalization, automation and providing complete solutions for surgeons and their patients throughout the entire continuum of care. Over the last decades, we have mainly improved outcomes focusing on better materials, better implant designs and better operating techniques, all of that combined with professional education. Moving forward, we plan to not only deliver differentiated implants but drive better clinical outcomes and increased patient satisfaction.</p><p>So now let's take a deep dive in our platforms, starting with knees. Now I've read some of your reports where you mentioned tibial loosening specifically in relation to the ATTUNE Knee System. Let me address this. Tibial loosening is an industry challenge. It's the #1 cause of knee revision 2 years after the primary knee replacement. The ATTUNE Knee performance is consistent with the Total Knee Arthroplasty class for survivorship based on 4 independent registries: namely the National Joint Registry in the U.K.; the Australian and New Zealand joint registries; and finally, the Michigan registry data. Now U.K. National Joint data provides reasons for revision, and it shows ATTUNE performing within class for tibial loosening. You may have access to this data in the events app, but also, print outs are available at our demo for your disposal.</p><p>By the way, these results are also consistent with our own internal data for more than 0.5 million patients who have benefited from the ATTUNE Knee in 43 countries. Important is also that compared to leading Total Knee Arthroplasty products, 1-year patients reported outcomes measured favorably for the ATTUNE Knee across a broad range of outcomes. I felt it was important to address this first to now go through our plan to return knees -- our knee business to growth.</p><p>We're a #3 player globally and a #2 player outside the U.S. with a portfolio positioned to win as the market evolves. The ATTUNE Knee System is the foundation of this portfolio, and we're building upon it. It's a comprehensive knee system that is designed to work in harmony with the patient's anatomy and deliver for what they want for that procedure, and that is stability in motion during daily activities. Patients with the ATTUNE Knee showed statistically significant improvement in knee physical function at 6 months and were discharged sooner from the hospital than those with competitive implants, according to a study data presented at the 2nd World Arthroplasty Congress. We are very excited to have launched also the ATTUNE Revision Knee System. We anticipate that this launch will extend our leadership in the revision segment and help also convert primary Total Knee customers. In the fastest-growing subsegment of knees, namely the cementless total knee with approximately 10% growth, we anticipate full launch of the ATTUNE cementless system in early 2019, giving us entry in this very attractive segment.</p><p>And finally, as you probably have heard, we have recently acquired Orthotaxy, which will allow us to tackle the next routine in Orthopaedics. The profession of digitally enabled technologies is significant, but we believe that existing solutions are not optimal, especially in the area of robotics. Now current robotics are large and complicated. They slow the procedure down without improving accuracy. They require very often dedicated support, intensive training and cannot easily be shared between ORs and surgeons. We have waited to engage until we found the right technology. With Orthotaxy, we will have a portable, low-cost system that is designed to be easy to use and improve accuracy. Very importantly, it maintains the surgeon's involvement, requires minimal training and technical support and can easily be shared between ORs and surgeons. Now we're working very hard and plan to launch it in 2020.</p><p>Today, you will have the opportunity to learn more about agility, R&amp;D presentation and experience the prototype in the demo space. And I really hope that you get us excited as the surgeon who has seen it.</p><p>We're entering a new era with the acquisition of Orthotaxy. It's another example how we as a company are moving beyond the implant to focus on a complete software-enabled solution with a single goal to move from better implants to better outcomes. We're very confident that we will enhance our competitiveness and accelerate growth in our knee platform.</p><p>So now let's move to Spine. In his spine, while we have made progress with the cadence of lounges, alliances and acquisitions to help fill some of our portfolio gaps, we're not satisfied with our current performance of the business. Besides a slowdown of the spine market, especially in the U.S., the main reasons for our mixed performance are: first, remaining product portfolio gaps that we are now closing; and second, sales force attrition, which we have stabilized.</p><p>But let's not forget, Spine is a large and attractive market. We continue to maintain a #2 position globally and a #1 position in key markets, such as China and EMEA. There are also still many opportunities to address unmet needs. Bottom line is that technologies are not delivering satisfactory results today. Our plan is to focus our investments, both internally and externally, on segments where we see the most growth, mainly the minimal invasive solutions, deformity, complex cervical pathology and the aging spine. We're very excited about the progress we have made, specifically in the minimal invasive space with the recent launch of the UNLEASH platform, which supports every step of the procedure, combining the CONCORDE LIFT Expandable Cage, the VIPER PRIME Pedicle Screw System, and the CONCORDE Clear MIS Discectomy Device. This complete solution is designed to reduce surgical steps, enhance efficiency and simplify spinal fusion surgery.</p><p>Besides these product launches in the U.S., we have just announced an agreement with Prosidyan to promote their line of synthetic bone materials designed for ease of use and have been engineered for optimal resorption in clinical use during spine fusion surgery.</p><p>In the interbody segment, which is growing at more than double the rate for the overall Spine of fusion procedures, we have just launched the PROTI 360 family of interbody devices to help broaden our portfolio and better meet the needs of customers performing spinal surgery. Later this year, we also launched -- we will -- we also plan to launch Sentio, the only software-enabled solution used for the nerve localization available in the marketplace.</p><p>As I mentioned before, we're very committed to stabilizing our performance in Spine this year and anticipate returning to above-market growth in 2020 and beyond.</p><p>Now let's move to hips. In hips, we have grown above the market for the last 5 years and have gained almost 3 points of share since 2011. We attribute this in part by developing, promoting and educating the complete solution for the Anterior Approach. 7 out of 10 surgeons entering hip surgery will use the Anterior Approach, and we are clearly well positioned to win in this attractive segment. The ACTIS Total Hip System was designed to be optimized with the Anterior Approach technique. The system is gaining a lot of traction with surgeons, giving us benefits, including initial implant stability and the potential for reduced pain and improved mobility.</p><p>We've also been commercializing 2 enabling technologies: the first one being the ME Impactor; and the second one is Joint Point. Earlier this week, we announced agreement to acquire assets of Medical Enterprises, the developer of the ME Impactor, which is designed to automate bone preparation, implant assembly and positioning. Following the close of this new deal, our plan is to build on the earlier exclusive agreement by further providing this technology to surgeons. In the near future, we plan to develop and broaden the surgical impact of technology for a range of orthopedic surgery procedures, including the knee.</p><p>We also have the ME Impactor available for you to experience in our demo space.</p><p>Now Join Point provides a noninvasive computer navigation, presurgical, digital templating and feedback for surgeons doing hip surgery. Now with the implants, the automation, digital solutions and instruments, we provide a complete solution to surgeons, which is key for better outcomes and at the center of our strategy to continue to gain market share in hips.</p><p>Moving forward, we're going to continue to expand our Anterior Approach leadership. We're going to drive CORAIL and PINNACLE. We will enter the dual mobility market in 2018 through the recently announced an agreement with SERF. And last but not the least, globally launch Joint Point and the ME Impactor.</p><p>So let's move to the sports, shoulders and early intervention. The total market -- the market totals approximately $8 billion with growth rates more than 1.5 points higher than the overall Orthopaedics market. Our strategy is to gain momentum by rounding out our portfolio. In shoulder reconstruction, we are seeing solid growth for the GLOBAL ICON, our anatomic stemless both in Europe but also in Canada. This year, we plan to expand our GLOBAL UNITE platform with the launch of a shoulder reverse system designed specifically for the treatment of complex fractures in the upper arm.</p><p>Within surgical sports medicine, we increased our launch cadence over the last year, introducing 5 new knee products in 2017 that drove faster than market growth in knees for the first time in several years.</p><p>We also launched PUREVUE, a high-definition and 4K imaging platform for the minimally invasive endoscopic surgery. Additionally, we're substantially refreshing our capital equivalent portfolio with a goal of bringing more comprehensive arthroscopy solutions to the market by the end of 2018.</p><p>In sports medicine where a rotator cuff surgical interventions come with a more than 20% failure rate, we anticipate launching DYNACORD in the third quarter of this year. This is a new innovative suture designed specifically to suture the knot tension to improve outcomes in the rotator cuff repair. We're additionally also launching our TRUMATCH shoulder preoperative planning. In early intervention, DePuy Synthes is growing the market with MONOVISC and ORTHOVISC and has become market leader in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018.</p><p>Let's move to trauma. In trauma, as you know, we're the clear market leader with the broadest and most comprehensive portfolio in the world. Every 12 seconds, a patient gets to DePuy Synthes implant around the world. In 2017, we launched the first and only cement-augmented nailing system in the U.S. to enhance implant fixation, and we have seen double-digit growth with this product portfolio. And that's also benefited the health care system. The combination of the TFNA and the geriatric fracture program has reduced clinical complications, decreasing the hospital length of stay for elderly hip fracture patients.</p><p>In the hip and femur fracture space, we provide the broadest portfolio of what we believe are best-in-class products and services, unparalleled expertise and the broadest resources in the industry. This year, we plan to add the Femoral Neck System and the Femoral Recon Nail System to this comprehensive portfolio, building on our history of leadership.</p><p>We've also launched MAXFRAME, the first significant advancement in 20 years in the orthopedic external circular fixation. It gradually corrects bone or soft tissue deformities in the upper and lower extremities in patients with limb deformities. Its unique 3D planning software helps improve accuracy of the deformity correction plan through product enhancements and digital tools.</p><p>Finally, we have broadened the portfolio with tuck-in deals such as BioMedical Enterprises and distribution deals like LifeNet Health and Tyber Medical to increase our portfolio and presence in the fast-growing extremity market.</p><p>Now let's have a look on how we evolve our go-to-market model. As Sandi mentioned, across the world, we have launched CareAdvantage with the goal of helping health care systems deliver value-based care by reducing costs, improving outcomes and advancing patient satisfaction. In the U.K., we have announced a 15-year strategic partnership with the Guy's and St Thomas to deliver -- improve standard of care for patients through state-of-the-art facilities, supply-chain streamlining, patient pathway redesign and introduction of innovative new technology.</p><p>In quarter 1, in Germany, we signed a 5-year exclusive agreement with the Asklepios hospital group for the delivery of hip and knee replacements. This is, by the way, the largest commercial deal in the history of DePuy Synthes.</p><p>Now these are only some of the many initiatives we have implemented around the world, which we believe will help us drive market share and growth.</p><p>Now we have moved through a lot of information today. I think importantly is that we believe that we have a robust plan in place to realize above market growth across Orthopaedics in 2020. We, first of all, have, and very importantly, a strong cadence of product launches, laser-focused commercial and supply chain execution, new go-to-market models that will improve sustainability of health care system and last but not least, digitally enabled solutions that will evolve and disrupt the market.</p><p>I want to thank you very much for your time. And I really invite you to go and see the innovations we're bringing to the market in our demos. I think you will be impressed by the cadence of launches.</p><p>And with that, I would now like to invite my colleague, Michael Del Prado, to the stage to talk about our surgery business. Michael?</p><p>MICHAEL J. F. DEL PRADO, COMPANY GROUP CHAIRMAN ETHICON, ADVANCED &amp; GENERAL SURGERY, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON: Well, good morning. My name is Michael Del Prado, I'm responsible for Ethicon, the surgery business of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Device Group. I'm pleased to be here today to share with you how we continue to shape the future of surgery and its impact on our customers and the patients we're privileged to serve.</p><p>To set the scene, significant unmet need still exists around the world in surgery. 32% of the global disease burden could be attributed to surgically treatable conditions. There are 5 billion patients globally who are unable to access good surgical care, and there are about 10 million new surgically relevant patients every single year. As a leader in surgery, it is our responsibility to ensure that our patients globally have access to safe and effective surgery to the best of our ability and to focus on diseases with the highest unmet needs. We are committed to addressing the increasing clinical and economic burden across surgical specialties globally, with a specific focus on general surgery, on obesity and cancers.</p><p>Unnecessary complications in surgery, including bleeding, leaks, surgical site infections lead to significant additional health care costs and is a tremendous burden to the system. There are about 211 million obese adults globally who are eligible for surgery, but fewer than 1% actually get surgery. Cancer surgery continues to be aggravated by very high complication rates, leading to high morbidity and high mortality. Colorectal cancer, for example, is associated with high readmission rates after surgery. Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with China contributing the largest proportion of these cases. With our leading innovation and unmatched global reach, we are very well positioned to make a meaningful impact in all of these areas to dramatically improve patient outcomes, reduce unnecessary health care costs and deliver significant returns.</p><p>We are the global leader in surgery. We're #1 in endocutters. We're #1 in biosurgery. We're #1 in wound closure, and #2 in energy with ambitious plans to ensure leadership in the very near future. This market is large at $23 billion globally and is expected to grow at a CAGR of about 6%. Growth is driven by acceleration of robotics, so you'll hear more about that later, and continued adoption of minimally invasive procedures over the next 5 years. We also anticipate that expansion in emerging markets will continue to drive double-digit growth. We expect more than 70% of our growth to be driven from the international markets over this very same time. In fact, this year, we anticipate Ethicon sales in China will exceed $1 billion.</p><p>As you will see, we have very clear plans to sustain our leadership across our key segments and enter new attractive and high-growth categories. Let me tell you the main areas that we are accelerating our growth today. We are delivering consistent sales growth improvements. Through discipline and focus, we are sequentially adding about 1 point of growth every year over the past 5 -- 3 years. We grew more than 4% in 2017 with strong sales growth and share gains in all of our key platforms. Other parts of our business, our core surgery business, which about less than 20% of our business such as general endoscopic and mechanical platforms, have been growing slower, and I will show you how we plan to accelerate the growth in these areas.</p><p>We've launched 18 new products over -- and line extensions over the past 3 years. 6 of these key products delivered meaningful innovation and growth, including ENSEAL X1 Large Jaw, which set the new standard for ceiling performance for advanced energy and open procedures; Powered ECHELON FLEX, with gripping surface technology, delivered exceptional stapling performance and clinical evidence; SURGICEL Powder, allowing us to enter the broad surface bleeding category; and then an expansion of our STRATAFIX Knotless Tissue Control Devices, continuing our long tradition of leading the evolution in wound closure technology.</p><p>Our strategic acquisitions contributed about 1 point growth in 2017, and our disciplined approach to portfolio optimization allowed us to double down on digital surgery, build a leading Advanced Surgery portfolio with the very best evidence, refresh our open surgery portfolio while, at the same time, rationalizing our slower growth businesses and building on Sandi's discussion earlier this morning: our focus on shaping the future of health care and specifically, surgery, will drive our growth into the future.</p><p>We are achieving this in 4 ways. We're already winning in open and laparoscopic surgery. This is very relevant as I shared with you statistics on people who need surgery and couldn't get it. We're improving our broad-based access to safe and efficient surgery, especially in emerging markets, and building an Advanced Surgery portfolio with the strongest evidence, particularly in cancer and obesity. We are entering the high-growth area of digital surgery with a differentiated and compelling offer. At the same time, we are creating the next frontier of surgery, including new less-invasive modalities that are designed to produce better clinical and economic outcomes. And lastly, we're delivering solutions designed to maximize customer value that leverage our global scale and capabilities, drive flawless execution and increase customer satisfaction.</p><p>Let's start with open surgery. That's where it all started about 130 years ago. Despite advances in minimally invasive surgery, most complex surgery still is being performed opened. We continue to be the leaders in this very important space. We provide surgeons the most advanced tools to improve procedural efficiency and enhance outcomes. Here are a few examples. First, to address the slower-growing core surgery space, we have begun refreshing our open stapling portfolio by applying the advanced stapling technologies that have transformed minimally invasive surgery to open procedures. This year, we expect to launch the very first product as part of this refresh: ECHELON CIRCULAR Powered Stapler, which has been shown to reduce leaks at the staple line by 61% in bench testing as compared to the competition.</p><p>Second, we are driving the first systematic approach to bleeding management to improve the use of adjunctive hemostats in the operating room and optimize surgical outcomes and reduce costs. We are the only medical device company that can provide both primary and adjunctive hemostats that will help surgeons stop bleeding. We're expanding our category leadership in biosurgery with our unparalleled mix of category insights; evidence; the innovation that we're bringing, including the newest addition to our biosurgery portfolio, SURGICEL Powder.</p><p>And third, we are setting the standard of care in wound closure, which we believe only Ethicon can truly provide. As you know, we have unrivaled leadership in wound closure. 7 out of 10 surgeons globally use Ethicon sutures every single day. And our Ethicon antibacterial sutures are the only triclosan-coated sutures available worldwide. With triclosan-coated sutures now being recommended by the WHO, the CDC for the prevention of surgical site infections, we are uniquely positioned to ensure surgeons have the right tools to improve outcomes. By combining the comprehensive portfolio of antibacterial sutures and our DERMABOND PRINEO technology, we are reducing surgical site infections, very important in areas like total knee procedures.</p><p>Let's now turn to minimally invasive surgery where our innovation is truly addressing a lot of unmet needs. With the acquisition of Megadyne last year and our recent energy launches, including HARMONIC HD 1000i and our sustainable reprocess solutions, the Ethicon energy platform has returned to global share growth and delivering best-in-class products across all energy modalities.</p><p>Secondly, our advanced stapling technology and exceptional powered devices are associated with delivering quantifiable better outcomes, very, very important in this cost-constrained environment, including reducing hemostasis complications and significantly reducing total surgical costs in bariatric and thoracic surgeries. These unique technologies and evidence have secured our leadership position in laparoscopic stapling.</p><p>And third, growth is also coming from our new technology such as LINX, a novel minimally invasive solution designed to control gastroesophageal reflux disease, or better known as GERD. So maybe in this room, out of the 150 or so, there are about 30 to 35 who are suffering from GERD, a very important decease. Continued growth from clinical evidence and extending reimbursement coverage and global expansion is key to making LINX the new standard of care in GERD procedures.</p><p>Let's now talk about robotics, and I'm pretty sure all of you are excited about to hear about our robotics program. While open and laparoscopic surgery have evolved, we see robotics surgery within the early stage of the bigger S-curve, as shown on the screen. At that intersection point that's shown, we are committed to addressing the current limitations to robotic surgery, such as access and reach, footprint and cost, workflow and advanced instrumentation. I'm pretty sure all of you who covered the robotic space have heard those limitations.</p><p>And we're not stopping there. We intend to transform robotic surgery into digital surgery. We're architecting to pave the way for the exciting future of digital surgery. If I only have 1 analogy for you, I would say it's like going from the mainframe computer to mobile digital devices. So we're going to -- from simply enabling surgical jobs to building an intelligent connected operating room environment. We are poised to disrupt the fast-growing robotics market. The Verb platform represents a true quantum leap in surgery, and we have approached robotics in a very different and novel way. Capitalizing on the unique strengths of Johnson &amp; Johnson, of Alphabet and Verb, we are designing a best-in-class differentiated at launch, and we are on track to be in market by 2020.</p><p>We have received resounding validation of our value proposition from many surgeons and nonclinical stakeholders all over the world. You'll hear some of the feedback as Peter delivers his talk. And you will hear just how excited these surgeons are with the testimonials that will be presented later on. We're absolutely pleased with our progress and have begun engaging J&amp;J commercial, professional education, supply chain, information technology and digital capabilities that Sandi just talked about, to deliver a best-in-class end-to-end experience at launch. We have 130-year legacy of shaping the future of surgery. As we've done in open and minimally invasive surgery, we intend to prevail as the market leader in digital surgery and accelerate our growth in 2020.</p><p>We are eager to give you a glimpse of what we're working on. And in just a few minutes, Peter and Euan will share more about our exciting work that we're doing in digital surgery.</p><p>Now let's look at creating the next frontier of surgery. By this, we mean emerging technologies that augment or, in some places, replace and create new markets and segments. Thermal ablation is an important emerging technology. Our recent acquisition of NeuWave, which has proprietary Precision controlled ablation probes that produce larger and more predictable and more consistent ablations, NeuWave's Ablation Confirmation Software, which we just launched recently, helps physicians identify ablation targets and, for the very first time, allows real-time confirmation of the probe placement and procedural tactical success, including margin measurement. In addition, the NeuWave Flexible Microwave Ablation System is the only FDA-cleared flexible microwave ablation probe. Throughout the next 5 years, we expect NeuWave to grow 2 to 3 times faster than the market.</p><p>We also have access to new and exciting technology through our collaborations and our investments. You may just have heard yesterday, fresh out of the waters, that Auris Health announced a co-development and commercialization agreement with Ethicon and our NeuWave team together -- especially our NeuWave Flexible Microwave Ablation -- Flexible Ablation System. This is an exciting collaboration with the goal of enabling robotic bronchoscopic ablation of lesions in the lung. Bronchoscopes, as many of you know, provide real-time visualization of airways of the lung for the purpose of diagnosing and treating lung disease. We will work with Auris to integrate our NeuWave Flexible Ablation System with our modern platform, the first FDA-cleared robotic platform for diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopic procedures. Together, we are well positioned to design innovation to diagnose and treat hard-to-reach lung lesions with more precision than ever before.</p><p>We also made an investment in RefleXion Medical, which combines the power of biologic imaging and radiotherapy to treat both primary and metastatic cancer.</p><p>And we also are developing advanced imaging modalities designed to provide sensory augmentation to allow surgeons to identify critical structures and fully view the extent of the disease. We believe this will facilitate better surgical planning and execution and eventually, improve surgical outcomes.</p><p>These are all exciting opportunities that truly demonstrate the next frontier in surgery where we intend to lead and drive growth.</p><p>And lastly, we are focused on delivering solutions that maximize customer value and ultimately, benefit the patients. Let me share with you a few examples. By utilizing the supply chain optimization solution offered through CareAdvantage and Intermountain Healthcare, which is one of the largest health systems in the U.S., experienced superior supply chain improvements. As a result, and we're very proud of this, Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Devices was presented with the Intermountain Health 2017 Supply Chain Excellence Award. Because of this great work, we are seen as an important strategic partner, and we've been able to grow our business with this major health system. This is 1 of many examples of how we are engaging customers in very different ways to drive growth and ultimately, realize better patient care.</p><p>Next, evidence, and you'll be seeing a lot of that in our booth. As an organization, we are committed to using clinical and real-world evidence to demonstrate that our devices, our innovation do, in fact, make a difference in clinical and economic outcomes. We have some of the strongest evidence in advanced stapling and in wound closure.</p><p>And finally, I'll briefly echo Sandi's commentary around trading with the creation of the omnichannel, very similar to what consumers are doing, apply to and education where we are meeting our customers wherever they are. The combination of live and digital training conducted through the J&amp;J Institute enabled Ethicon to educate about 158,000 health care professionals globally in 2017. The recent acquisition of C-SATS allows us to deepen our engagement with customers and health care systems through our leadership in professional education. We are the undisputed leader in open surgery and also minimally invasive surgery. I expect nothing less as we aim to disrupt the robotics space with our novel digital surgery approach and as we enter new modalities and create the new frontier of surgery.</p><p>I want to underscore my confidence in our ability to execute on our initiatives and to capitalize on the significant market opportunity and drive sustainable value. In short, we are accelerating sequential growth; we are increasing our global reach, and important the touch those patients without access to good surgical care; and continue our legacy of shaping the future of surgery. I know you will all agree that this is an exciting time to be in Ethicon and Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Devices.</p><p>Thank you so much. And it's now my pleasure to welcome on stage our partners in R&amp;D, Peter Shen and Euan Thomson, who will talk more about our innovation. Thank you.</p><p>PETER SHEN, GLOBAL HEAD, R&amp;D, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON MEDICAL DEVICES COMPANIES: Good morning. Good morning. Let's talk about innovation. Thank you, Michael. I'm Peter Shen, and together with my colleague, Euan Thomson, sitting there, and our colleagues in Research and Development for Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Devices. While I lead the R&amp;D teams for the surgery and interventional solutions business, Euan leads the R&amp;D for our Orthopaedics and digital technology for the entire Medical Devices. We and a more than 3,500 talented R&amp;D associates know that the growth depends on our ability to bring innovative products and solutions to surgeons and their patients. And today, we will provide an overview of our innovation pipeline and also highlight our work in the development of the state-of-the-art digital surgery technologies, and we believe we'll reinvent Medical Devices industry and also fundamentally changing the health care as we know it today.</p><p>This is our pipeline. For interventional solutions, our surgery, our Orthopaedics and our eye health. I hope you see that it's a pretty amazing innovation pipeline, and that we are confident we are going to transform patient care through innovation into the future.</p><p>As Sandi mentioned, we had a stronger innovation year in 2017 with a renewed focus on launch excellence. We expect to continue the strong launch cadence into the future. We are on track to launch 15 to 20 new products this year; 20 to 25 in 2019, next year; and in our pipeline, we have 40 to 50 planned launches for 2020 and beyond, excluding acquisitions.</p><p>So in our interventional solutions pipeline, our team is going to continue to advance the science and technology in our electrophysiology platform and invest aggressively in our neurovascular innovation for stroke treatments. In our surgery pipeline, our team continue to innovate the next generation of hemostats for challenging bleeding management and also making our surgical devices smart, advance our development in digital surgery. In our Orthopaedics pipeline, our team is transforming the Orthopaedics industry through technologies, such as 3D printing, sensors and the digital technologies. And in our eye health pipeline, which I spent the last 5 years in that business, our team expanding our market-leading innovation in contact lens, now broadening into broad eye health innovation. We're truly excited.</p><p>As you can see, we have a robust pipeline of meaningful innovations that we believe will improve clinical outcomes for increased patient, customer and consumer satisfaction. Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Devices innovation pipeline from 2018 and beyond, excluding acquisitions, is expected to drive close to $7 billion in new product sales in 2022. This is a reflection of more than 20% increase in R&amp;D productivity. So as you can see, that would take hours to come all the products. So today, Euan and I we're going to provide just some examples for you.</p><p>I think one of the Johnson &amp; Johnson's most distinctive features and one of our greatest advantage is that we are truly agnostic to the source of great innovation. We seek to the best ideas and technologies wherever they are. In addition to our internal innovation efforts, we look at external innovation ecosystem to enrich our portfolio, add new capabilities and again, early access to cutting-edge innovation. As Sandi mentioned, last year, we invested more than $5 billion in acquisition and strategic partnerships, with over 30 transactions in 2017 alone. And also last year, we opened the Center for Device Innovation at Texas Medical Center in Houston, creating a brand-new way to develop a breakthrough medical devices through close collaboration with early-stage innovators and physicians.</p><p>And as Michael shared, how we intend to disrupt the robotics market with our Verb Surgical platform in partnership with Verily. We believe this is possible because of our deep understanding of the marketing needs and that we're bringing new benefits to customers across the globe. As the largest surgery business in the world and with our unique smaller footprint, more flexible design and system on the market, we aim to drive greater global access to hospital operating rooms. We are also working to transform the learning process using virtual reality, personalize the training based on the individual's user experiences and integrate the best practice sharing by design.</p><p>Our platform is designed to deliver a better user experience with a unique console and connection through an open design principle to allow the surgeon to work with the entire operating room team. We treat the patient access and the workflow optimization as significant unmet needs. Our team is working to optimize the technology through a holistic solution to really raise the bar. Besides that, our system is being designed to provide multi-quadrant access to enable broader range of surgical procedures beyond the prostate surgery to colon, gastric, thoracic surgeries.</p><p>Finally, with our proven capability in advanced instrument, in combination with 3D HD visualization, our system is being designed with aim of increasing surgical efficiency and confidence across surgical procedures. We believe this is going to be a highly differentiated platform with a design that is intended to create a new category of digital surgery.</p><p>Here's a little bit more information on elements of our platform we have in development and what surgeons who have used the latest prototype are saying. Please roll the video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>PETER SHEN: You can see our surgeon customers are truly excited. I hope you are, too. So the question, the where are we? So what do you see is just a small glimpse of the overwhelming positive response that we have been receiving from surgeons. Our team is very busy achieving project milestones, and we have made, built multiple working prototypes.</p><p>And our team is conducting procedure development in preclinical settings and also have had multiple pre-submission meetings with the global regulatory agencies.</p><p>As Michael mentioned, we are scaling our capabilities in commercial, service, supply chain and education to support our global launch. Our plan is to commercialize the Verb platform in 2020. We believe the Verb platform will redefine how surgery is performed the same way we redefined laparoscopic surgery more than 20 years ago.</p><p>Our Verb surgical platform is a part of a much bigger vision for digital surgery.</p><p>I'd like to hand this over to Euan to update you on our Orthopaedics robotics strategy and also share our broad digital surgery vision. Thank you.</p><p>EUAN THOMSON, GLOBAL HEAD, R&amp;D, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON MEDICAL DEVICES COMPANIES: Thank you for, Peter, and I think I'm the first one to say good afternoon. I'd like to start by bringing in an external perspective. He's Dr. Charles [Decook], an orthopedic surgeon sharing some of his thoughts on the real needs of surgeons.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>EUAN THOMSON: So as you heard from Dr. [Decook], surgeons are craving automation in Orthopaedics. They need tools that are going to make them faster, more precise and more efficient. Health care providers and surgeons are shifting from volume to value-based health care. They need technologies and solutions tailored to each patient that improve outcomes, enhance patient satisfaction, minimize variability in patient care and reduce costs, and that's exactly what we've been working on.</p><p>So I'll start by describing the Orthotaxy system. As Sarah mentioned, orthopaedic and robotic surgery is a huge area of opportunity to standardize and amplify surgeons' abilities, improve clinical outcomes and drive overall patient satisfaction.</p><p>But the existing Orthopaedics robots present challenges. They are large, disruptive to workflow and really complicated for the surgeon to use.</p><p>The training requirement is considerable. They often require dedicated technical support in the operating room for every procedure, and they generally slow procedures down without significantly improving accuracy. As I hope you've had the chance to see in the demo area, the Orthotaxy system is designed to be radically different, so just a different kind of technology. It's so compact that it could be picked up and held by the surgeon. But once it's located in the operating field, it becomes a self-guiding, autonomous system that aims to deliver the same optimized results regardless of surgeons' skill set or experience and it's extremely easy to use.</p><p>The autonomous nature of the guidance system removes a lot of the complexity associated with other robotic systems. The robot literally guides the surgeon and helps them to achieve the best possible result. And the small size and convenience of the system means that the interruption to workflow is minimal and the time of a procedure is reduced rather than increased as with other robotic systems.</p><p>So we see great potential in the Orthotaxy technology. We have an aggressive schedule for the development of the system, and we're targeting commercialization in 2020. We believe it will be an Orthopaedic Robotics solution that delivers improved patient outcomes in knees, spine and hips, while adding value by standardizing procedures and reducing OR times.</p><p>But the Orthotaxy system is not the only way we are driving efficiency in surgery. We are going beyond robotics. For example, with the help of SPI's Surgical Procedure Manager that we recently acquired, best-in-class surgical standards can be provided across the whole surgical team. This is achieved through use of digital checklists that guide every team member through a procedure. This not only leads to better operating room efficiency, but also to a more consistent outcome and a better patient experience.</p><p>And as Ciro mentioned, we have acquired Medical Enterprises, the developer of the ME impactor system. This is designed to replace the conventional handheld mallet use to drive implants into bone. It's a handheld, battery-powered device that automates bone preparation, implant assembly and positioning. The impactor also speeds up the implant process. If you've not already had an opportunity, you can stop by to see the ME impactor in action.</p><p>So as an example of what we can achieve when we combine SPI's automation software, the Orthotaxy robotics solution with the impactor technology, we estimate that we can reduce a 90-minute knee procedure by approximately 30%.</p><p>Clearly better for the patient, while providing the potential for huge value to our customers and a strong reason to select our implants.</p><p>System-based automation and standardization are the heart of our entire Medical Devices digital surgery strategy. The way we are embracing digital solutions will have significant impact on outcomes. We are leveraging our knowledge, experience and breadth to disrupt and improve patient and physician experiences.</p><p>We are developing intelligent, personalized products and solutions that guide the physician to improve best medical practice and the patient to optimal recovery, redefining success following surgery. We are building a digital ecosystem where technologies that enhance surgical performance and help guide patients through to full recovery are connected pre, intra- and postoperatively. We expect this connected environment to enable us to gather insights about key drivers of outcomes. It guides us in new ways to engage with customers through services and solutions that bring value to patients, providers and payers.</p><p>To bring that to life, I'm going to use another Orthopaedics example, but the strategy I'll describe is targeted at all of the surgical procedures that we support. Our approach is to use a string of technologies to engage across the continuum of care. These technologies are designed to directly engage with patients using apps and wearables to assess and prepare patients for surgery and guide them through rehabilitation after surgery.</p><p>They engage with the surgeon in the operating room and aim to ensure best practice. In this example, our commercially available health partner system is used as the patient engagement platform. Our also commercially available TruMatch software planning system is used to prepare a personalized surgical plan. We plan for this information to be automatically transferred to the Orthotaxy robotics system that will be designed to seamlessly move to the correct cutting angles for that patient.</p><p>Meanwhile, SPI guides the surgeon and the surgical team through the recommended implant procedure. And when ME impactor is available for knee procedures, we'll be adding further automation and time reduction to this process.</p><p>After the procedure, we can give the surgeon educational feedback using C-SATS, our recently acquired digital education system. And the Health Partner platform that engages again with the patient to foster adherence to the prescribed rehabilitation service.</p><p>It's this strategy to engage beyond robotics that defines digital surgery. We are building an ecosystem of connected digital solutions that guide the surgeon, their team and the patient toward efficient practice and optimized outcomes.</p><p>So today, you've heard about the progress we've made with our innovation agenda in the past 24 months. You've had visibility of our pipeline and learned about our vision for digital surgery. But before you go, I'd like to highlight 3 main takeaway points.</p><p>First, we have increased our launch cadence and aim to continue that path moving forward, fueling our growth and revenue across all our businesses. Then the innovation we brought and will bring to market is expected to drive meaningful clinical and patient value. Also, our vision of digital surgery goes beyond robotics to the entire continuum of care and has the potential to change health care as we know it.</p><p>Finally, we are confident in our plans for Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Devices to continue to lead the way in innovation that improves patient outcomes, fuels our growth, creates new markets and reduces health care costs through comprehensive and transformative innovation.</p><p>Thank you for your attention. Now I'd like to hand you back to Joe.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Thank you, Euen. Thank you, Peter. Very exciting stuff, and I hope you take the next couple of minutes as we break for lunch to get a chance and look at some of the digital solutions that we have in surgery as well as other products that are -- have been referenced here throughout the course of the day. We will return at 1:00 and it will be a review of our eye health business. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Company Group Chairman, Johnson &amp; JohnsonVision, Ashley McEvoy.</p><p>ASHLEY A. MCEVOY, GROUP CHAIRMAN, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSONVISION: So good afternoon. Two years ago, I was here talking a bit about our ACUVUE brand and some of our growth strategies to grow the contact lens category. And as you can see in the video, I'm very pleased to share that we are evolving into an eye health company with a broad array of solutions really to meet a patient's lifetime of eye health needs.</p><p>So you see, we at vision think sight is precious. It's our most precious sight and it matters. 80% of what we learn, we learn through our eyes. And actually sight is the sense that people fear losing most. They fear losing it more than losing their memory, losing a limb and even HIV.</p><p>Now the good news is that 80% of serious vision loss is treatable if discovered early. So there is oodles of unmet need in eye health and this is what drives us everyday.</p><p>Let me reacquaint you with the eye health category. It's large and it's growing. You will see that it's about an $80 billion category comprised of medical devices, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods. It's growing north of 5%, yet it still has woefully low penetration rates. These are the 4 areas in which we compete. Reminder our -- refresh our memory on cataract. So we're in a $5 billion category growing 4%. Cataract surgery is the most commonly performed surgery done around the world, and it's the #1 cause of preventable blindness.</p><p>I'll then direct your attention to contact lens, an area that we command market leadership. $8 billion category growing 5%. But once again, very low penetration rates, under 10% globally.</p><p>Another treatment for refractive is refractive surgery, Lasik surgery. We actually enjoy market leadership. It's around a $700 million business growing in low-single digit, very strong outcomes. And then a growing segment is in dry eye. It's around a $4 billion segment, growing 6%. Around 350 million people around the world experience dry eye. And for those, if you're one of them, it feels like you have sand in your eyes on a 24x7 basis. Some -- it's predominantly treated with pharmaceuticals, but some of the newer technologies in Medtech are on their way.</p><p>So let me share with you our grounding in this market, this $80 billion market of eye health. We enjoy a very strong foundation in contact lens where we have earned market leadership, over 30 years, really fueled by the iconic nature of ACUVUE.</p><p>We acquired 3 different companies in 2017. The first and the largest was what was commonly referred to as Abbott Medical Optics, and that gave us a very strong foundation in surgical ophthalmology. We are the #2 player in cataract surgery and we're #1 in LASIK surgery.</p><p>We then acquired a small startup company called TearScience, and they are the first FDA-cleared imaging and treatment for meibomian gland disfunction, which is actually the leading cause of dry eye.</p><p>And then we bolstered our very strong, ever-changing ACUVUE experience platform, which has connected commerce with the acquisition of Sightbox, which is a startup company in Portland, Oregon. You can probably call it an eye health concierge service that really helps people with their eye care needs on their terms. And collectively, we are now Johnson &amp; JohnsonVision backed by the strong capabilities, the enterprise capabilities of J&amp;J.</p><p>I'm very pleased to share that in our first year together as Johnson &amp; JohnsonVision, we have delivered. We delivered in 2017 above market performance of 6.5% revenue growth, surpassing $4.3 billion. Very nice balanced growth between our contact lens portfolio, which achieved its 11th consecutive quarter of above-market performance through balanced growth in developed markets like the U.S. and Germany as well as a strong double-digit growth in emerging markets in our contact lens.</p><p>And I am pleased to share that in our first year of surgical vision, we achieved 10% growth year-over-year. And our cataract business achieved a very important milestone. Alex shared that chart around the $1 billion platform. Well, cataract is now a member of the billion dollar club, surpassing $1 billion, grew 13% in 2017.</p><p>So let me give you a little bit of a peek behind the curtain. Many great companies get humbled, you saw us several years stand before you around contact lens and how we had lost our way. So how did we turn that around? And really, I'll start to share with -- it starts with the brands. ACUVUE is endorsed by doctors, trusted by doctors and beloved by consumers. Over 50 million consumers rely on ACUVUE every year.</p><p>I mentioned 2 years ago around having a balanced portfolio on the core business, on our sphere reusable and our sphere daily disposables, while at the same time, riding some of those fast-growing adjacencies. Those adjacencies are areas like presbyopia or areas like astigmatism where your eyeball is like a football, in the shape of a football versus a basketball. Or areas like beauty where people are looking for refractive, but also a little bit of cosmetic. Well, those process, those agencies have been delivering double-digit growth for our portfolio and now represent more than 30% of our revenue.</p><p>And clearly, innovation has had a say. We've had 7 new product launches since 2015. You'll hear we'll have 2 over the next 5 years, and all of these launches have had very strong market acceptance, both with doctors as well as with patients.</p><p>So one of our largest additions last year was the Abbott Medical Optics acquisition. And as I mentioned, it gave us a very strong footprint in surgical ophthalmology. We gained very strong material science and optical engineering capability. We gained a world-class intraocular lens platform, really powered through the brand of TECNIS Symphony for extended depth of focus. TECNIS Symphony was the fastest growing premier intraocular lens in the category last year. It really helped us garner #1 positions in marker share, whether it be in Canada, or the U.K., or Germany or Korea. Importantly, we welcome 5,000 colleagues to our franchise in 37 different countries, and I could tell you, it was large, it was super complicated, but we're 14 months into this and we've had very minimal customer disruption. And our value capture efforts are tracking well above our deal model expectations.</p><p>So one of the newest additions is this company TearScience for dry eye. You may have experienced it in the booth. And as I mentioned, they were the first FDA-cleared for imaging and treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction, which is the leading cause of dry eye. So the thing is all of us are born with a 120 different meibomian glands. We have 30 on each eyelid. Now the primary job of your gland is to really secrete oil to keep your eyes well lubricated. And when is it's working, it feels pretty darn good. But when those things get clogged up and can actually atrophy, they actually lose functionality and that's when you start to feel sometimes that you have sand in your eye.</p><p>I actually partook in this procedure about 6 months ago. It's a minimally invasive procedure. It's about 12 minutes where we apply heat and pressure to unclog the glands. It takes a couple weeks. Evidently, meibomian glands have muscle memory. But after it kicks in, I'm 6 months in, you land on a plane after 8:00 at night, you feel pretty good.</p><p>The neat thing about this is both ophthalmologists as well as optometrists are using this novel technology to treat patients. And as you know, this is a core customer base for us. Interestingly, it shows the synergistic effects because half of all cataract patients manifest, show up with dry eye, and it allows folks that are in contact lenses, many of you here today, to actually wear your lenses for 4 hours more.</p><p>Two years ago, I spoke about the importance really of evolving our business model and moving with the market to really deliver a very modern customer experience, a modern eye health experience. And we've heard a lot about today about the seismic shifts in technology, whether they be on AI or the plethora of data that's available and how affordable it is to storage and the power of computing right now and the billions of folks who are now connected. We harnessed a lot of those technological advancements and are now using this in our first use case in contact lenses to really modernize and this eye health experience. You'll see examples of your J&amp;J Vision Pro, which is really a one-stop shopping for patient education, for modern -- Michael Del Prado shared, modern digital training as well as one-stop shopping for the doctor.</p><p>We also had a pilot case in Korea, as an example, to start to have a subscription business for ACUVUE through the launch of a CRM program called MyACUVUE. We have over 3 million members enrolled in MyACUVUE. In fact, it was the fastest-growing app. It was the #1 most downloaded health and fitness app, more than Nike, in Korea. And again, we're just getting started. As I mentioned, 50 million people already.</p><p>Clearly, as what Jorge mentioned earlier, is that e-commerce is how people want to shop. So we will service doctors wherever they practice care, and we will service consumers wherever they prefer to shop. Clearly, e-commerce is a growth engine for us. It's been growing double-digit. It grew 15%. I expect that trend to continue into '18 and beyond.</p><p>So we have a very bold ambition to be a world leader in eye health. Now to do that, we have to continue to outperform the market. So there are 4 key strategies that we are going to continue to pay attention to. The first is having a differentiated portfolio and making sure we have the right balance on our core as we perform some of those faster-growing adjacencies. The second, as you heard from Peter and Euen, it really is about accessing the world's best labs and venture companies. Actually, there's significant investment in ophthalmology in the venture community and making sure we continue that very strong cadence of innovation going forward.</p><p>It's about moving with the market and evolving our model to deliver a better customer experience. Obviously, we have to have commercial execution and supply chain execution and having a blend of a keen focus on execution today as we really build for the future. And of course, we can't do anything without people. And it's about making sure that we have access to top seasoned world-class highly diverse leaders who represent our diverse patient population and who are really united to this global cause of protecting and enhancing sight.</p><p>So I am pleased to introduce a colleague of mine. She does have some big shoes to fill. We heard a little bit about Peter, and that is Dr. Xiao-Yu Song. Dr. Xiao-Yu is a Ph. D. and an MD. Xiao-Yu will be taking the reins of the Vision Care R&amp;D team. Xiao-Yu spent -- her background, her early career in immunology, some time with the NIH. She actually, joined Johnson &amp; Johnsonthrough our Centocor franchise in immunology, and then spent time in our surgical business that Michael Del Prado was sharing earlier, really working on some of our drug combinations. So stay tuned on that.</p><p>Let me welcome Xiao-Yu to the stage.</p><p>XIAO-YU SONG, WORLDWIDE R&amp;D LEADER, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSONVISION: Awesome. Thank you, Ashley. I'm very pleased to be here today to share with you our approach to innovation. As you may remember, what Peter shared 2 years ago that we believe innovation is a company sport. Creating, developing and commercializing new novel innovation product is my, and our team's, passion. It is the lifeblood of our business and it will continue to be a key driver of growth for us.</p><p>We aim to serve our patients all along their care continuum, whether it be slowing down the progression of high myopia, which is really big problem in Asia right now; or to beauty needs; to vision correction needs; to dry eye; to presbyopia; to refractive cataract surgery; and eventually to glaucoma and eventually, age-related macular degeneration.</p><p>To do all of that, we have created a unique repeatable innovation model that draws on deep customer insights, understanding of unmet patient needs, strong internal and external R&amp;D capabilities and technologies and the power of our iconic brands, such as ACUVUE and TECNIS.</p><p>Let's turn our attention to surgical business. We have 5 key programs driving acceleration. As Ashley mentioned earlier, our cataract business grew significantly in 2017 with strong momentum, driven by our IOL portfolio. We have good track record innovating in all 3 segments, monofocal, toric and presbyopia correcting IOLs. And we are well-positioned to continue this trend with innovation programs in all these spaces.</p><p>Underdeveloped share in (inaudible) emulsification is an obvious opportunity, and we have innovation programs in this space. We're collaborating strongly with our Ethicon energy colleagues and others to leapfrog competition with new equipment.</p><p>We are also focused on dry eye and expanding our portfolio because that category is growing, especially in today's always on, multiscreen life. Our use of digital devices, for example, I have my iWatch, iPhone, iPad and a laptop computer all working at the same time. It is terrible for our eyes.</p><p>Do you know that humans blink about 18x a minute. Guess what that reduces to when you're looking at a digital device screen? Four. Without the natural cleaning motion across the ocular surface, we get into trouble. So our team is on a quest to look for ways to help solve the issue in order to help people all around the world who suffer from ocular surface diseases.</p><p>Now let's look at contact lenses, where we have committed to launch 2 new products each year, every year through 2022. Our pipeline fills base business with new family members and it also includes some innovation that will redefine the category beyond vision correction. In fact, we just filed regulatory application in Japan for our very first combination contact lenses with medicine. It is a drug-eluting contact lens to help patients with itchy eyes due to ocular allergies. And it gives me goosebumps when I say very first combination contact lenses with medicine, not only because it does feel good to be the first, but more importantly, it's just awesome to feel the power when you bring the different expertise and skill sets existing in different parts of Johnson &amp; Johnsontogether and innovating on first of its kind new product.</p><p>To serve our presbyopia patients, we are developing a self powered smart lens that will dynamically change focus for people with presbyopia. So they don't need to extend their arms all the way in order to read the small font size on their iPhone. We have overcome many technical hurdles, including onboard battery technologies. We have over 150 patents granted in the space and additional 120-plus patent applications.</p><p>We are working very closely with the FDA on the regulatory pathway for this novel innovation. And you may have heard or seen or tried and saw the product demo out there, we are meeting the needs of our patients with light sensitivity with our very first light conducting contact lens. This contact lens contains a photochromic that darkens when exposed to bright light. The product is FDA-cleared, and we are planning to launch in first half 2019.</p><p>Let me show you a brief video to tell you a bit more about our ACUVUE Oasis with transitions light intelligent technology. Please roll the video. Thank you.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ASHLEY A. MCEVOY: So pretty cool. You can check it out. We have it in our booth. It's coming soon, early 2019 in the U.S.</p><p>So J&amp;J clearly is a key source of competitive advantage for us for J&amp;J VISION. And let me just share a little bit about our supply chain as one example. We have a fully integrated, fully automated manufacturing process, which produces over 5 billion lenses per year. Now clearly, this enables us to have superior cost of goods. But what it also enables us is to is to be able to scale innovation fast. And an example of that is within 2.5 years, we were able to launch our first-in-kind now, it's the fastest growing, Oasys 1-Day with its partner for astigmatism around the world in less than 2.5 years, and it's garnered over $250 million in revenue.</p><p>It's also about accessing some of Johnson &amp; Johnson's signature capabilities. You heard Sandy earlier talking about professional education at our core. It's part of our legacy, but we're really working to modernize that experience as well using digital. Well, imagine how we can tap into that to really train the next generation of cataract surgeons around the world. Or what Jorge was mentioning around digital at its core and all of the new tools that help us engage consumers in a very fresh and modern and differentiated way, like the use of scanner. As I mentioned, ACUVUE is Johnson &amp; Johnson's largest consumer-facing brand. So we take full advantage of that capability.</p><p>Or to what Peter Shen was mentioning around energy and the use of ultrasound. We were somewhat of the godfathers of ultrasound. We are going to -- we have our teams collaborating with our energy team to bring that into the OR suite in cataract really for next-generation (inaudible) emulsification.</p><p>So these are just a few examples around how I think really Johnson &amp; Johnsonbrings differentiated capability. We have machine-learning folks in R&amp;D and in quality who have been able to use machine learning and actually take our development for prototyping a beauty contact lens and reduce it by 34 weeks. And what used to take 3 days to quality control as a test method of beauty contact lens is now done in less than 1 hour. I don't know about that, but that's -- when Sandi talks about a science and a technology coming together, that's really what we are aiming to achieve.</p><p>So let me be clear. We have a very bold ambition to be a world leader in eye health, and I expect us to continue to outperform the market. Again, 11 quarters in, in contact lens. A good year underneath our belt in surgery. Many more years to come. I expect us to continue to evolve our business model, really to bring consumer and patient to light. To bring a very differentiated customer experience. I expect us to bring an innovation along the lifetime of patients' eye health needs. And absolutely, we intend fully to take advantage of the very best that J&amp;J has available.</p><p>So why don't I summarize a couple key themes that we talked about today. We clearly discussed the differentiation in Johnson &amp; Johnson, and we spoke about the strategic choice to be broad-based in eye health -- in health care. And we talked about the differential capabilities that J&amp;J has. I mentioned vision accessed a lot of those differentiated capabilities to turn around a large multibillion-dollar platform. So clearly, you saw that we enjoy market leadership in many platforms. But there are a few platforms that we have been underperforming, and clearly, we are dissatisfied. I think you heard from many folks, we are on it.</p><p>But I can tell you, I've been with J&amp;J for 22 years, and I know what J&amp;J looks like on our very best day. And it looks like when we are absolutely relentlessly focused on our customer, and we are obsessed with innovation and we are constantly evolving our business model ahead of the curve. And most importantly, we are maniacal on execution. And you know why do all of this? Why all of the folks that you heard today, why we do all of this? Is because we know patients are waiting. We know countless, millions and millions of patients are counting on us. And this is what drives us. And this is our purpose.</p><p>So thank you for your time on eye health. At this time, I am going to welcome Joe Wolk and my colleagues from the MD to have a little bit of a Q&amp;A panel. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Great. So as we did with this morning's panel, you'll have 2 options to ask a question. Simply raise your hand, and we ask that you wait for a microphone, so the folks on the webcast can follow along. And then you can also submit a question through our event app.</p><p>Let's see. Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.</p><p>LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. One for Ashley, one for Ciro. Ashley, you said you expect to be a world leader in eye health, but you have a few gaps in your Vision Care portfolio, such as glaucoma devices and back-of-the-eye devices. So my question is how attractive are those spaces to you?</p><p>ASHLEY A. MCEVOY: Yes, no, thanks for the question, Larry. We look for areas, obviously, with big unmet need. We look for areas that we can scale, and we look for areas that we can really improve the patient outcomes. So as I mentioned, we want to really take care of their eye health needs throughout their lifetime. Glaucoma is clearly an attractive space. Back of the eye is clearly an attractive space. We're going to look for areas that we have a differentiated capability. I mentioned as an example our access into our pharmaceutical company and how we tapped into that collaboration to be launching soon within the next 24 months, the first drug-eluting contact lens is one example.</p><p>LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: And Ciro, you expect to be above-market growth in spine and knees 2020, but both businesses took a little bit of a step back in the first quarter in terms of the growth rate. So can you talk about the pathway to that above-market growth? Should we expect a meaningful improvement in 2018 in both businesses?</p><p>CIRO ROEMER: Yes, thanks, Larry. I think what is important is what we have really worked very hard on is to increase the cadence of launches by really talking to customers and finding out what the clinical needs are that we need to solve. And as we increase the cadence of launches, but also stabilize our go-to-market models, we feel very confident that we will establish the business in 2018 and '19 and start growing above market in 2020.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Okay. Joanne Wuensch, BMO.</p><p>JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH: Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. For clarification, your Verb and Orthotaxy platforms, you put up there 2020 for market introduction. Is that U.S., worldwide? And the second half of that question is do we think of that as the robotic launch or is there a stage presence ahead of that?</p><p>MICHAEL J. F. DEL PRADO: Yes. Well, thanks for asking that question, Joanne. So 2020 is where going to be in market in major market globally. So as Peter shared, we are now in conversations with both the FDA and an in all defining bodies of Europe. And also, we are also engaging the regulatory authorities of the major markets in Asia. So we now understand what will it take from a clinical perspective, regulatory perspective to get there and we will be one of those markets by 2020. And probably, Ciro, you could address Orthotaxy?</p><p>CIRO ROEMER: Yes, for Orthotaxy, we expect to be in the market by 2020, and we will focus on launching the products in the major markets. But we will focus on the U.S. where we feel there is the biggest need at the moment.</p><p>JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH: And the second half of that question, is there a \"big robotic launch\" or how do we think about staging between now and then?</p><p>MICHAEL J. F. DEL PRADO: Yes, what we're building is we're building complete robotic systems for both Orthopaedics and us. However, we are also building a digital ecosystem, as Sandi spoke about, that would help connect our different digital systems and make it easier and make the customer experience more consistent. And that's what we're playing for, and we will leverage those capabilities, not only in Orthotaxy or Verb, but the other digital offerings of J&amp;J.</p><p>SANDRA E. PETERSON: Yes, Joanne, if I could just add a little to that, which is many of the things that Euan mentioned that are pieces of this puzzle, and Michael and Ciro also talked about, those are actually already commercialized products that are in the market. So as we think about the launch of the robotic solutions in both Orthopaedics and in surgery, many of these other things that will connect to those robotic solutions are in the market, and we are launching and scaling them and connecting them. So once the robots are launched, our goal and plan is that this whole thing will connect together.</p><p>JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH: And then just as my final question. Big picture, I think investors are worried that Johnson &amp; Johnsonis minimizing medical technology, looking for you to do some form of more dramatic M&amp;A. How would you respond to that?</p><p>SANDRA E. PETERSON: So I would hope that by the end of the day today it will be very clear to all of you that we are absolutely not minimizing medical devices or the importance of this part of our business in J&amp;J, but also for health care systems around the world. As you remember, I talked about we did 30 transactions last year-over-year worth $5 billion. We are actually on pace to have a very similar cadence in 2018. We've done a handful already, both acquisitions and investments. And we will continue to always, as we always do across all of the J&amp;J businesses, look at what's the right thing to do, whether it's a small, medium or large transaction. It's got to make sense for us to do it. It's got to be accretive to the business. It has to make sense for us to own that business, but clearly, it's got to actually drive shareholder value. So we are sort of agnostic about size, but we've clearly demonstrated in this business that doing a lot of smaller tuck-in complementary acquisitions has been very valuable to this business, and we'll keep doing that and look at small, medium and large things, Joanne.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Geoff Meacham, Barclays.</p><p>GEOFFREY CHRISTOPHER MEACHAM, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Geoff Meacham from Barclays. So I get the focus on connectivity and surgery in both ortho and vision in terms of new product innovation, but how do you guys think you could further implement technology in other segments across the portfolio to drive differentiation? And how would you rate your internal capabilities in tech versus looking externally?</p><p>SANDRA E. PETERSON: So I'll start and then I'll let my colleagues talk about that. So I think the way we think about it, it's relevant to all of our business, not just consumer and Orthopaedics. I think Michael talked about the importance of using technology to enable better surgical procedures, better connectivity and the management inside the OR. We don't talk about it that much, but if you think about our interventional portfolios, there's an immense amount of technology through navigation and imaging systems that happens for us to actually do the procedures that we do or support the procedures that are being done. So we -- technology sort of permeates all of our businesses, and it's a combination of our deep scientific expertise with the technology. As it relates to your second question, maybe I'm a little bit biased here. But I would say that we believe that we have world-class technologists inside J&amp;J, and we're able to recruit world-class technologists in the company. And that's something that we have been on a journey to do for the last 5 years. But we don't -- just like every other aspect of innovation at J&amp;J, we don't do this alone. We have partnerships with all of the big tech guys. We have partnerships and small equity investments with lots of the smaller technology companies. So we're sort of agnostic of where it comes from, and we figure out what we need to own and what makes sense for us to do and other things that we should do in partnership with other tech companies. I mean, very small example, 3D printing. We have 50 strategic partnerships with 3D printing companies, as an example, because we believe we should do it with others to make it much more successful going forward. So we feel like we are really in a good place as a health care company and probably a little bit ahead most of our peers as it relates to our knowledge of technology, but the breadth of our partnerships is what gives us that strength.</p><p>GEOFFREY CHRISTOPHER MEACHAM: And just a follow-up, and thanks for that, Sandi. Just when you look at the last segment in the eye in the innovation side, can you give us a little bit more context for your drug combos with lenses? It seems like a pretty broad platform beyond just allergy.</p><p>SANDRA E. PETERSON: Yes. So Ashley, you want to?</p><p>ASHLEY A. MCEVOY: Yes, sure. Now I mentioned Xiao-Yu's background, but I think when we look at kind of the unmet needs in eye health, we do see a lot of combinations coming to solve some of those jobs to get done. And because of the poor compliance in medicines alone, the combination of a drug delivery device can actually get better compliance and potentially better outcomes. So one example is an allergy whereby versus just allergy drops or a systemic, this is locally applied antihistamine on your eye for 8 hours and itch relief during the season when you need it, a daily disposable, a key reason why people fall out. But we clearly see application for that in areas like dry eye, as an example, or other areas, potentially, even in glaucoma.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Danielle Antalffy from Leerink.</p><p>DANIELLE JOY ANTALFFY, MD, MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND DEVICES, LEERINK PARTNERS LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Danielle Antalffy, Leerink Partners. This is another robot question, so both Michael and Ciro. I guess, you talked about improving outcomes and reducing costs, and I was wondering what sort of evidence base you're going to build prior to commercialization to prove that.</p><p>CIRO ROEMER: Yes. So -- and that's why there's a big difference between robotics and digital surgery, right? So robotics is really an extension of your human arms to be able to perform tasks that you could not do because of the limited spaces. However, digital is all about capturing the information that goes on in the operating room, take advantage of the preoperative information to be able to guide the procedure more precisely, and be able to analyze information after the procedure and feed it back to make surgeons better who are they on their best day and within the health care systems also improve that. So obviously, at launch, there will be limited clinical information. However, because of this digital ecosystem that we're building, our ability to capture information, be able to analyze that, the real world evidence immediately will be harnessed and will move very rapidly.</p><p>MICHAEL J. F. DEL PRADO: Yes. I think, what I would like to add is, when we talk to our customers, they told us a couple of things in regards to robotics. First of all, they told us, listen, we want to have to do more procedures so the robotic system is going to have to be faster than current technology. The other thing they told me is it has to be -- and we need to have better outcomes. And last but not least, we need to have a sensitivity to cost. Now we believe that with Orthotaxy we can address those 3 key demands from our customers, and we're starting to build technology but also evidence around our value proposition that we will share with you during our journey.</p><p>DANIELLE JOY ANTALFFY: And just one quick follow-up to both of you. As far as initial indications go, is it -- are you targeting one specific indication initially at 2020?</p><p>MICHAEL J. F. DEL PRADO: From our perspective, in orthopedics, we will start in knees and then we'll go to spine.</p><p>CIRO ROEMER: Yes. We will launch with multiple procedures and expand them as we launch more tools into our robot.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Great. Vamil Divan from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p><p>VAMIL KISHORE DIVAN, SENIOR ANALYST, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: So one, on cardio side, you guys have talked in the past a lot about structural heart as an area of growth, just your view on that market now in terms of the strategic opportunities and when can we see J&amp;J entering that market? And then I think at orthopedics where you mentioned sales force attrition have been a challenge in the past, maybe just looking back, what sort of drove that attrition and what have you done to stabilize that situation?</p><p>MICHAEL J. F. DEL PRADO: So well, I will take the cardiovascular side. Definitely, we are very interested in structural heart. We talked about it 2 years ago, last year, this year. We continue making investments in that area. We just participated in another round of V-Wave. And the market is very attractive, I think, the (inaudible) is definitely is going to come and will generate another episode of importance in that market, so we stay very committed to that market.</p><p>CIRO ROEMER: Yes. And in regards of sales force attrition, which I mentioned specifically for spine, I will say 2 things. First of all, every time we do a transformation restructuring there is some turbulence. But I think more importantly, if you have a good cadence of innovation, that will certainly, first of all, help with sales force attrition but more importantly, entice other good sales consultants to have a wish come in and work for you as a company. We feel very confident, for example, in spine, where we have recently launched 10 new products in the last 6 months that we have now filled the critical gaps in the portfolio and already seeing very much excitement around the sales force with the new innovation that we're bringing and the critical gaps that we have closed. So we feel very confident that moving forward, we have the sales force attrition under control.</p><p>SANDRA E. PETERSON: So let me just add one last point to Ciro's comment. I think one of the great early indicators of whether the market and the sales folks that work for competitors or ourselves, how they're feeling about our portfolio and our future, we look at what we sort of call net trade, meaning are we losing or winning the war from our competition and that has flipped. So we are -- now, more people are joining J&amp;J from our competitors than we are losing to our competitors in Medical Devices. And in particular, in our sales forces. And I think that's a really good early indicator about their confidence in our portfolio and our business, going forward.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Great. Oh, yes. David.</p><p>DAVID RYAN LEWIS: David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Sandi, just first for you and then one follow-up for Shlomi. One of the themes we've seen in the last several years have been pruning Medical Devices assets to get much more focused in the MD&amp;D business. Is it safe to say the pruning phase is over or can we take it from some of the big businesses you have or medium-sized businesses that were not a focus today, they are still candidates for further pruning to get focused?</p><p>SANDRA E. PETERSON: So what I would say to your question is, like all of our businesses and I think there was a question earlier to Jorge about that, we always look at what's the best optimization of our portfolio. There were certain businesses, we didn't have enough time, quite honestly, today to share with you how those businesses are doing, and we really wanted to focus on the 4 largest markets where we're making significant investments. So we will always look at our portfolio and what we want to do with it to make the right optimal choices. But as you know, the largest divestitures of our portfolio have already occurred.</p><p>DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Then Shlomi, if you would -- the AF market growth rate, I think, you gave was 5-year projection of 11%, that market has actually accelerated here in the last 18 to 24 months so your guidance sort of implies that market kind of slows in the out years to kind of upper single digits. So I think about your pipeline, CABANA, and the impact of ILRs and patch monitor having on your business, it surprises me to think about this business decelerating within 3 years, kind of help me understand that 11% number in context to these drivers.</p><p>SHLOMI NACHMAN: Okay. First, I don't think it will decelerate. It's -- we'll see how the things will go over the world. We do see much more pressure at least in pricing and reimbursement in different regions around the world. I do believe that the price pressure is continuing to evolve and to accelerate. And you're reaching an area, in which you have some kind of ceiling in terms of capacity. So people, there is not enough EP physicians coming to the market in a timely manner. This is why we are focusing so much about improving the efficiency of the procedure. So going from 4 hours to 2 hours, from 2 hours potentially to 1 hour. We do believe that once we're going to come with the new innovation into the market starting by the end of next year. The procedure that today takes roughly 2 hours, potentially will go down, for sure 1.5, potentially going down to in 1 hour, which means that you can double your capacity, which we has 46% of the share of the market, definitely will improve the market. So my boss always tell me to under-commit and over-deliver. So we'll continue doing that.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Glenn Novarro, RBC.</p><p>GLENN JOHN NOVARRO: Two questions. One for the group, and then one on robotics. So when you're sitting in the audience, and you see 40 to 50 new products, the number is impressive but then when you hear the word cementless and 3D printing and MIS and robotics, well, the competition has all that already, and it seems like maybe you're just catching up. So can you help us understand like what's in the portfolio that's really leapfrogging the competition? Because leapfrogging the competition, that's what gets the surgeons excited, that's what gets your sales force excited, and that's what allows you to grow faster than the market. So just point to us to what's really game-changing in that pipeline? And then the quick one on robotics, can you confirm to us that the robot is -- that the general surgery for robot is bed-mounted?</p><p>SANDRA E. PETERSON: So I'll try to give you some sense of it, and then I'll let my colleagues answer this a little bit. So when we talk about robotics, I guess, our view of it and maybe we have haven' t convinced you yet, is it is a game-changing definition of robotics in both orthopedics and in surgery. It's not a me too. And so I think that is what's going to make a significant difference. And in many of our product categories and areas, as we readily admitted, there were portfolio gaps, we had to fill those, we did a lot of that last year, through acquisitions and product launches and now we are much more focused on bigger transformational innovation, some of which you heard actually from all of the folks sitting on this panel, which they are really different and game-changing things like ablation, like some of the work we're doing in vision, the work we're doing in EP and even in orthopedics, there's some new very, very different things that nobody else has in the marketplace. So...</p><p>SHLOMI NACHMAN: Yes. Maybe I will add a few things. In our portfolio, both in Biosense and then in CERENOVUS. We'll start with Biosense. First, we are the only company that can claim, claim is an understatement, but the fluoroscopy use, in our -- we are utilizing our products is substantially less than anyone else. I mentioned 5 minutes, there are physicians today that using 0 fluo, meaning they have no lead on themselves, 0. It's important for them for longevity of their life, obviously, cancer and so on, critically important for patients. So we are the only one, and we continue moving in that direction. We're just going to launch [Visigo], a shade that is visualized by the Carto System. Again, no need for fluo at all. Second, we are coming with, hopefully, you saw it in the booth over there, the QDOT. QDOT MICRO, emitting ablation high-power short-duration, we're talking about 90 watts per second. So nobody is even close to that by a mile. Third, to talk about CERENOVUS we're coming with them but first time colonization substantially better by 22% to 25% than any of our competition. All of that and more are leapfrogging in our minds, sort of what we're going to have, and we're getting extremely good feedback from our customers. I can tell you customers are lining up to be the first to get these products which is a great place to be.</p><p>SANDRA E. PETERSON: Yes. I would just add, I think it was like 2 years ago, Peter Shen was talking about Vision, and I think he shared with you all 4 transformational programs. Again, in addition to those, I'll call them steady life cycle management substantial 2 per year, which we've been doing and 3 of those are progressing. So we are going to be launching the first light adaptive contact lens within the next 12 months. within the next 24 months the first drug-eluting allergy lens, we have a patent state of 150 patents on our smart contact lens, another 100 patents are pending. So it is our intent absolutely to start to lead and create some of these new categories.</p><p>CIRO ROEMER: Yes. I think for -- and in regards to orthopedics, what I'm most excited about is, first of all, completing the portfolio, which I don't think we need to underestimate how important that is. But I think our journey from moving from the best influence in the industry to really focusing on better outcomes together with surgeons, together with institutions and combining all the technology and the knowledge we have, not only in orthopedics, but across Medical Devices in Johnson &amp; Johnson, that's the part that excites me. And quite frankly, when we talk to our surgeons, that gets the most excitement. For example, in hips, we're going to automate the last part of hip surgery. As you know hip surgery has been done since 1940, the 2 critical steps that have been automated was the cutting of the femur head at the reaming of the acetabulum. Now we're going to automate with the ME Impactor, the last part of the surgery, a tremendous excitement among orthopedic surgeons. So getting the best influence, working with the surgeon community in the hospitals to get -- to getting out the best outcomes, which is going to help everybody is really what excites me.</p><p>CIRO ROEMER: Yes, I'll respond to the first question first before responding to your specific question on robotics. Firstly, we need to do both, right? So there's a lot of unmet needs that we need to continue to address within our current portfolio. And sometimes the adoption of advanced technology is hindered or hampered by the lack of evidence. And by demonstrating that what we're producing, what we're delivering is really superior just what you've seen in the booth with 40%, 60% reduction in various serious complications, it's important in terms of driving the adoption of technology and hence, focusing on evidence generation, filling our gaps is important. You also heard and many of you have seen our partnership now with Auris. Very important partnership, some of you described it as a marriage made in heaven because they do have the leading robotically enabled bronchoscopic system, and we do have the only therapeutic intervention tool that could be applied with their system. So you can imagine that many of our us avoid taking a scan of our lungs because if a lesion is discovered, what do you do? Watchful waiting is the standard of care today. And this partnership really opens up this new segment which is not there today, and we're very excited about that and more to come. On your second question, as you know, for competitive reasons, we will not discuss the specific embodiment of our system. We are filing more of the IP that you published in your report, a lot of that is coming because we're at that stage of development that we're now publishing what we have we've got multiple embodiments you'll see more to come. But importantly, are we able to address the unmet needs that continue to persist in the current robotic system? Firstly, reach and access, very important. Multi-quadrant reach, being able to have the capability of reaching every part of the anatomy, we're going to deliver that. Footprint is a major impediment today because it's pretty large, right? And all operating rooms are largely, what, 300 square feet. And so we're going to address that. Workflow, there's still a lot of clashing, there's a lot of positioning of members of the team because of the clashing and the movement of the arms. And lastly, advanced instrumentation because the magic moment is when an endocutter is fired or an energy device is fired and you've heard from customers that they're making compromises today because of the lack of availability of advanced instrumentation, we're going to deliver those as well.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Great. Well, I'd like to thank, not only these leaders here on the panel, but the other 3 R&amp;D leaders, Xiao Yu, Euan and Peter, for your presentations this morning as well as into this afternoon. I know it was informative for the group, I had a chance to speak with many during the break, and they certainly appreciate your candor and your insights about our business moving forward. So thank you very much. So as we set the stage and have Alex and Dominic make their way up here for our final panel of the day, I would just like to provide you with a reminder to complete the event survey. As Alex mentioned in his opening, we certainly value your feedback, not only to make events like this a little bit more meaningful for you, but also to assess our business and challenge ourselves as to how we're going forward. Alex, Dominic, welcome. I'll open the floor to any questions that you may have.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: I'm sorry, I can't see in the back, but I see a hand up. I need the transition lenses, actually.</p><p>ANTHONY CHARLES PETRONE, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I may need those as well. Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Maybe just a question on the acquisition strategy in 2018 and beyond, now that we have a new U.S. tax structure and Euro-U. S. cash has been somewhat freed up here, so how do those 2 factors play into the aperture of your lens for M&amp;A?</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: Yes. Thank you for your question. Why don't I start off, Dominic, and then you can dive in. Look, first what I'd like to do is acknowledge the work that Dominic and his team did in working with a lot of legislators and other decision-makers in Washington to help bring about what we feel is very important tax reform. I mean, the fact that we were able to lower the rate to a much more competitive rate versus the rest of the world, the fact that we were able to go to a territorial structure, the fact that we're doing the onetime repatriation. We think the combination of those things, frankly, gets our country back on a much more competitive level. And very importantly, it will help limit, if not completely remove, some of the other inversions and other things that were taking place where -- that frankly, weren't always in the best strategic interest, but were being done because of a tax or an antiquated tax structure that was in place. For us, we think the major benefit of that tax reform is the fact that frankly, it just gives us more flexibility and how not to have that entrapped cash outside the U.S. And I commend, also, our financial team who over the years, I think have done a pretty remarkable job of giving us access to some of that cash in an appropriate way and in a tax-efficient manner. But now, I think we were able to do that to an even greater degree. Fundamentally, we still need to make sure that it's the right strategy. Fundamentally, we still to make sure that it's value creating over the long term. Next, it needs to be actionable, something that we can confidently do and bring in, but we think it creates a better overall environment for us to be competitive globally in M&amp;A. And I think continue a pattern that we've set where we look or we'll look internally, we're going to look aggressively externally to continue a very solid growth rate and frankly, to access new technologies and therapeutics.</p><p>DOMINIC J. CARUSO, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON: I would just add that the benefit of not having to repatriate cash and pay a tax rate, a high tax rate on that, is obviously, as Alex said, gives us more flexibility. But the most important thing about doing an acquisition in addition to the strategic fit and what we can do with it in our hands that the previous owner can't do, is whether we're generating enough return on that investment commensurate with the risk, so that we can compensate our shareholders appropriately for using that capital. Tax is one element of that calculation, so it'll be easier to achieve that level of return. But the most important part of that calculation has to do with market growth, market penetration, technology adoption, regulatory challenges, et cetera, those still exists and we'll still use those as the primary filters to determine whether or not an acquisition is value creating.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Yes, Robbie.</p><p>ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS: Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan. When you think about investing in the different businesses, pharma has seen an outsized proportion of the investment from J&amp;J. But going forward, do you think Medical Devices and Consumer are going to see an outsized portion to help drive growth in those divisions, or how should we be thinking about the investment going forward?</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: As you heard me say in the earlier comments, we are excited about all 3 of our sectors. And we think that and hopefully, a message that you've taken away here today is that our excitement, our enthusiasm and I think our renewed confidence in our Consumer and Medical Device spaces and the opportunities that we have ahead. As has been articulated in different ways today, we're always looking at a number of different factors on where we're going to invest across the portfolio. And frankly, part of that calculus is making sure that we've got healthy businesses where we're making that investment. Because what you'll find is, regardless of your best projections, regardless of your best intentions, midsized, in particular, large sizes, they're always more complicated than you usually predict. And so if you're doing that in businesses that are already currently going through transformation, they can be a bit more challenging. I think what we've, hopefully, demonstrated to all of you today that if you look at the fundamentals of both these businesses, if you look at the improvement that we have in our innovation pipeline, our plans for execution, I think they're very well situated. And what I would say is, we remain very interested in adding onto those organically and inorganically with the caveat of it being value creating, a good strategic fit and something where we're going to minimize disruption and actually, synergistically create growth going forward.</p><p>DOMINIC J. CARUSO: I think that over long periods of time, about 50% of our growth has been enabled by an acquisition strategy and that applies across all 3 business sectors. And I think it will still apply across all 3 business sectors going forward at about 50% of our growth has and will come, no matter where it is and Consumer, Med Device for pharma from a strategic M&amp;A activity.</p><p>ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS: Just staying with the M&amp;A theme, do you think there's is an ability to go large on pharma versus smaller Medical Devices and Consumer, do you think the hurdle or complication factor is higher or lower in one division versus the other? And is there a 1-size that you're targeting for each of those businesses in M&amp;A going forward?</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: Now look, what I would say, as it relates to Pharma, we, in our study of the majority of deals that have been done in that space, the large deals have rarely been value creating over the long run. It was usual, in many cases, it was done when the companies were experiencing particular stress in one way or another. And in -- at J&amp;J, we would much rather invest in growth and an opportunity to move the businesses forward. So, look, ideally, we would love to find the next DARZALAEX, the next IMBRUVICA in our pharmaceutical portfolio, identify it early, and then rapidly ramp up to be able to reach millions of patients and create billion-dollar platforms. If we look at Medical Devices and Consumer, in some ways I was having a conversation at lunch and sometimes we're in Pharma because of the nature of the technology that you're purchasing early on, you can have more of a binary result. i.e. does the product work, or does it not work? Wherein Consumer and Medical Devices, you're buying technology but you're buying capabilities, you're buying relationships that exist, a wide range of other factors. So that your result, in some ways, could be more predictable. So we think of all those factors as we consider it, but -- and would we go after large pharma, I think it would be a very high hurdle. Will we go after midsize to larger Medical Device? It depends, if the opportunity is right, and we feel that we can openly create value, yes, we would just as we would in Consumer.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Larry?</p><p>LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: Two for you. One, could you talk about...</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: Do I get one for you after this?</p><p>LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: Please, definitely. How your thinking has evolved since you became the CEO towards the Medical Device space in general? And second, you've opened these innovation centers in places like Boston and Houston, I believe. You've hired some extremely bright and talented people, but didn't come up today, but I'm just curious, what's their mandate?</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: Yes, great questions. If you allow me, Larry, maybe I'll take it above Medical Devices though, because I think as a CEO, I've learned a lot of lessons across that field adage, I wish I knew then what I know now. And I'm sure I still have a lot more learning going forward, I hope I never stop because that's one of the best parts of the job is the opportunity to learn new technologies, businesses and situations. I think there's a few things that if I reflect on candidly or you might say, lessons learned. I think one thing is just the remarkable transformation that we're seeing with technology. I mean, frankly, it would've been hard to predict, especially somebody who would spend so much of my career in pharma where we are frequently criticized for incremental or me too innovation. And if you look at the explosion in cell-based therapies, gene-based therapies, we're actually moving from chemotherapy to cures. It was almost hard to realize even 7, 10 years ago. Or if you did, it was a significant bet that you were taking. And by the way, I only see that accelerating. In Medical Device, I think it was a little different story. I think, actually, if I go back 6 or 7 years ago, we hit a bit of a low point technology-wise. I mean, there was great pockets. There were things in TAVR, there were things in energy, there were things in EP. But if -- as you well know, if you saw what was happening in the venture community at that time, we actually saw a decrease in investment and there was concern about the amount that would be needed to be invested in clinical development, reimbursement for those things. And frankly, what I've seen over the last several years now is a recognition that technology can make significant. And I think, for robotics 4 or 7 years ago, to where we think they could be today. And some of the other transformations that we're seeing across all of our businesses where technology can make a difference, technology can be rewarded. So I think that -- I think the second issue is around business models. And I think if we look back honestly, 5 or 6 years ago, we are probably a bit over our skis in some of our transformation in Medical Devices of decision-making and where to influence decision-makers, perhaps leaving the surgeon too soon into other decision-makers, hospital administrators. And what we've found in many cases, frankly, as hospital administrators are struggling within their own departments around some of that decision-making. And the criticality of not walking away from the surgeon of having the right support systems there, for them as well I think is something that we see. And so that's why you heard a lot today, let's get that right balance of investment. Now what we would say is, we're starting to see some of that shift, but it's probably taking a bit longer. The counter to that in Consumer where 7 or 10 years ago, e-commerce was very low and now in some markets like China, you can see to being 20% or 40%. And it's still below 5% in the United States, higher in some categories, for example, like beauty, so I think that's another factor. And I would say the third or a third lesson because there's more. But the third one for me is emerging markets. If I think back 6 or 7 years ago, we had been on almost a 10-year run in emerging market growth doing this. And that was Brazil, Russia, India, China and even others. In the last few years, we've seen it get a little choppier in many of those markets. Now I still believe that, that curve has a positive slope over the long term, but we shouldn't think that it's just going to be linear, that it could have a bit more volatility that we're seeing now. So in our messaging, there was a comment earlier, do you hear as much about emerging markets, we still remain very enthusiastic about emerging markets. And it's about 25% of our business, works about a little over half of that, we're still seeing growth rates greater, but we've seen them a little bit more choppiness through that, but that doesn't take away from the secular trend that we're really excited about it. Innovation centers. So it's a great question. We just sat down actually, a couple of months ago and did a deeper dive, is as many of you know, we made the decision about 6 years ago starting, at first in our pharma group, to actually reduce some of the in-house, you might say, scientists from bricks-and-mortar to more of an external focus putting the innovation centers in place like Boston, San Francisco, San Diego, London, since then Texas, Canada, we do a lot in Israel as well where we have teams not only scientists with business development people, some cases IP groups. And their whole job is to work within the venture ecosystem. And that can be with academic centers, the venture community, early start-ups we have a few different derivatives. Well, that's our innovation center. We also had JLABS in several of those where it started out because we had some extra real estate space back in 2009 and '10, out in La Jolla, that in the midst of the depression or recession, some might say depression, we couldn't get a very good return on. So we said, \"Well, what if we rented out at a very reasonable price, we had mass spectrometers that we weren't using, we had other equipment. Let's put it to use. How does it work?\" And what we found is that there were a lot of customers, there were a lot of start-ups that were willing to do that. And we've learned a lot of lessons as we've gone along the way. I think we would see now as we probably have about 300 to 400 active deals taking place that we've been able to run to them. I think our throughput is getting better, we're learning more and more of what works, what doesn't work. And I think also from a reputational standpoint on the innovation side, it's positioned as much, much better as a partner, especially for a company our size and scale that you'd actually be willing to take that kind of risk with a new company and create that kind of environment. So we are now starting what I'd call Phase II, or IIb where we're tracking throughput on those in a much more systematic way and I think overall, what we're finding, as I think we brought about 12 projects in-house now. And I would say 2/3 of those in pharma, but several now in Medical Devices and we're starting to see a more consistent cadence. Our team now, I think, are working better together between our franchises, business development in the innovation centers, they're seen more as a natural extension of what we do in R&amp;D. So we're very pleased and encouraged by what we're seeing. We still have more work to do, but I think going forward, to take a different approach where you're just more internally focused versus having this balance wouldn't be the right move for J&amp;J.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: I think we've got time for one more question. David Lewis.</p><p>DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Sorry, Joe. I'll just sneak in 2. But they're both for Alex. I think it's okay. So Alex there were...</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: I'm still awake, David.</p><p>DAVID RYAN LEWIS: I'm still awake. you're keeping me alive. So a couple kind of related questions. There's been a lot of questions about this afternoon session, but I want to put a final point on it. A lot of investors certainly came to know J&amp;J as sort of a 3-legged stool in the old days, it was about, \"Oh, you can add a fourth leg to that school.\" So that 3-legged stool has always been relatively balanced. With the expansion of pharma the contract devices, the stool is a little about balanced today than it was maybe 7 years ago, but it doesn't sound like listen your commentary today, in isolation, that's an urgent need that has to be addressed. Do you think about the balance of the stool and does that need to be addressed?</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: Yes. Well, look, we're always looking at our business, and what I would say is the imbalance of the stool over the last few years, frankly, has been done to a remarkable success, which I wouldn't apologize for, of our pharma group. It's not because there's not belief, but I think what you've heard today is an actual increased belief and level of confidence in our other sectors. And so, yes, we are actively on an ongoing basis involved in looking for those right opportunities, and these 2 sectors are clearly a priority for that over the next several years.</p><p>DOMINIC J. CARUSO: Can I just add to that? So we don't really think that there is an appropriate balance. If you look at the pie, we don't really think that it's even appropriate for us to say, it should be balanced in this manner. Because each and every decision we make, David, is based on its own merit. So each investment decision we make is thoroughly evaluated, regardless of which sector it's in and the shape of each piece of the pie therefore is an outcome of making the best decision in front of us at any particular time.</p><p>DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Great. And just related question. Thank you, Dominic. Really, the question, Alex is, if I think over the last 10 years, I can't think of a time when the 3 independent businesses had different structural things going on. In pharmaceuticals, it's about price to value and broad net and gross pricing, Medical Device...</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: And I would just add, underlying innovation.</p><p>DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Absolutely, there is a lot going on in pharma. I said versus simply, you've mentioned Medical Devices from 7 years ago to today, the innovation cycle is starting to turn the consumer. I think Jorge did an excellent job talking about some of the brand fragmentation and millennial risk and Amazon risk going on in that segment. So the question very simply is, are you as committed today as you were when you began to become CEO of J&amp;J, that these 3 businesses, you belong together meaning these issues can be attacked more efficiently as a collective than they can be independently?</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: Absolutely. In fact, I feel much more confident sitting here today than I would have 6 years ago. And it's for all the reasons that you heard today. I think in the end, it comes down to the items that we talked about, about having the right innovation portfolio, about having the right execution plan, having the right leaders in place to bring all that together, and I think it's a very exciting time for us going forward.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Great. So Alex, Dominic, I'd like to give you the opportunity to share any closing remarks with the audience.</p><p>DOMINIC J. CARUSO: Sure.</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: Okay. Well, Joe, yes. And first of all, I just want to say a big thank you to all of you for hanging in here all day. But before we sign off, I also think it's important to acknowledge this guy sitting next to me. And as you all know, Dominic is going to be retiring in just a few months, and while we all knew it will happen sooner or later because there is thing called age, I was always it would be a little bit later than sooner, nothing against you, Joe. You had a great choice there. But as the saying goes, that -- there is a time for us and that time has come for Dominic, and I think it's pretty remarkable. He made that decision. It's pretty remarkable that Dom has served longer than any other CFO in Johnson &amp; Johnsonhistory for almost 12 years. And during that time, I can say on both a professional but also a personal level, I couldn't think of a better partner to have. He is -- epitomizes really what a credo-based leader is about. His financial stewardship, if you look at the performance across so many other challenges and opportunities, economic highs and lows, he's just -- he's been incremental in every way of helping me, helping us, helping the company just deliver pretty remarkable returns over a long period of time. And I also hope you'll agree that he's somebody that you could always trust, that Dominic's credibility, being able to depend on what he said was in fact correct, and that having that kind of integrity and knowing his commitment around the promises that he's going to make is so important in a CFO, let alone to the company. And, look, Dominic, first and foremost, I just want to thank you for everything that you've done for us, for Johnson &amp; Johnson. You've touched so much of our business, so many of our people. You've been an inspiration and great role model and just a fantastic business partner. You're going to be missed tremendously. And so thank you for your leadership, thank you for being Dominic, for who you are and for really being a great CFO for Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>DOMINIC J. CARUSO: Thank you. Thanks, Alex. Well, I didn't know where you're going there with the age. You're probably wrong, but I know -- I knew what you meant.</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: I meant that you're probably too young to retire.</p><p>DOMINIC J. CARUSO: Exactly. That's what I thought you meant. So I really appreciate those kind words, Alex, and well wishes and support. Yes, this is probably going to be my last public appearance as the CFO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, so I want to do a couple of things, take the opportunity to express sincere thanks to you, Alex, for your great leadership of Johnson &amp; Johnson, for your support of me throughout my career and quite frankly, for the valued friendship that we've developed over all these years, I'll always cherish that. I want to thank my colleagues at J&amp;J, you saw many of them today. I've had the privilege of leading the finance organization at J&amp;J for nearly 12 years. I can tell you, they are the best in the business. I can really say that having talked to all my peers in different industries that I think all the business leaders here will attest to that, who have come from different companies, we really do have an outstanding finance organization. And so thank you for supporting me and my career, the finance organization has been tremendous. Let me congratulate Joe.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Thank you, Dominic.</p><p>DOMINIC J. CARUSO: So Joe will become CFO of our great company, July 1. At July 1, Joe, you'll be sitting in this chair. Well, not this chair, the chair across the street, in my office. Joe is a strong collaborative credo-based leader, long track record of success. Joe and I go back many, many years. I know Johnson &amp; Johnsonwill be in great hands. And when I think about my own tenure as CFO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, it's just remarkable. I mean, to be associated with the company who's at the center of health and improving health for humanity is really just a privilege, quite frankly. And professionally, I've got a chance to do a lot of great things. One of the things I've had the chance to do is interact with all of you and represent our great company to you on some 46 quarterly conference calls is an example. And I'm really grateful for the relationship we've built over time. I think it's a relationship built on trust, candor, transparency and respect. And I know, I have full confidence that Joe will continue that kind of relationship with you. So my time here has been humbling and amazing. I often tell everyone that I've had the best CFO job on the planet, and people say, \"Well, of course. You're AAA-rated company, $350 billion market cap, 56 years of consecutively increasing the dividend, the financial stewardship. You're at the pinnacle of your career when you're the CFO of Johnson &amp; Johnson.\" But what I will really remember the most about my career is the honor of working alongside people who every day, every day want to positively impact the world. So I'll be watching with admiration and quite frankly, enormous confidence in our future. Thank you, Alex.</p><p><person><nameText>ALEX GORSKY</nameText></person>: Well, thank you, Dominic. Well, Dominic, thank you again. And look, the other person I'd be remiss if I didn't thank is Debbie, his wife. They were actually grade school sweethearts. And to go through that and when you look at their children, their grandchildren, the father, the family and the love that they have, it's pretty special. Especially in today's world to have that kind of family at home and let alone, your Johnson &amp; Johnsonfamily is pretty darn special, and so thanks again.</p><p>So look, as we wrap up today, I'd also be remiss if I didn't thank a few other people and that is all the J&amp;J leaders in this room. While Dominic and I get to sit up here and conclude and kind of bring this as a wrap up, I think what I said earlier today was I think what makes J&amp;J such a special place besides our credo is the quality of our leaders and in fact, the people who are running the business, who are responsible for our people each and every day, there's no way that we could do our jobs without them. And I would just like to publicly acknowledge them and ask you guys to stand for a second and join me in giving them a big round of applause. Thank you.</p><p>So look, as we wrap up today, I hope you got a lot of good information. I hope you found it informative, interesting and have a much better understanding how across all of Johnson &amp; Johnsonbut in particular these 2 business segments, our Medical Device and our Consumer segment, that we are poised for future success and growth. And if you think about what we have in our Consumer business in addition is great iconic brands, think about what we're doing around an omnichannel customer-centric approach and brands that are scientifically differentiated, what we're going to be doing in Baby and Oral Care, how we're financially managing the business, the top line as well as our margins, above-market growth as we head through the rest of 2018 and beyond. When you think about our Medical Device businesses, enhancing our current leadership positions, that's critical to start there, some areas we've got a great performers. Vision Care is a great example of that. Electrophysiology is a great example of that. What we're going to be doing in stroke that you heard from Shlomi. And clearly, our commitment to taking on areas like spine and knees and the plans that we have in place to get those in the right place. The cadence of innovation, the string of launches, meaningful launches. And yes, in some cases are going to buttress what we have, but in other cases, I would strongly argue that it's going to fulfill unmet need and allow us to reach more patients and differentiate ourselves further. And we clearly will be accelerating growth across this segment to above-market growth by 2020. We think that's a realistic goal, aggressive, but one that we are absolutely committed to. So we couldn't be more confident in the J&amp;J of today, we couldn't be more confident in the future that we have ahead. And we just want to thank you very much for joining us today and hope you enjoyed it. We look forward to seeing you again next year. Joe?</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK: Thank you, Alex. Thank you, Dominic. And Dominic, once again, congratulations on truly a distinguished career. So that concludes today's events. Thanks to those who made the trip into New Brunswick and those who viewed us on the webcast. We look forward to engaging with all of you again in the near future, specifically, July 17, for our second quarter earnings call.

Parents need accurate and complete information about the apps available to their kids and user-friendly parental controls to protect their children,\" said McAdams. \"This resolution calls on tech companies to provide that. Nothing should get in the way of keeping our kids safe from online exploitation.\"</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://mikejohnson.house.gov/media/press-releases/johnson-mcadams-introduce-proposal-protect-children-dangerous-app-content\">https://mikejohnson.house.gov/media/press-releases/johnson-mcadams-introduce-proposal-protect-children-dangerous-app-content</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHMB21984F8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJS-H8G1-DYVR-P38Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"279\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 21, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLG6</classCode><className>CHILD SAFETY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

He is the President and Chief Executive of Calvert Investments, and he joins us now from Washington D.C. John Streur, thank you so much for joining us. Where will this all end up? If you look at privacy, when you look at regulation, really, being spearheaded by, I guess, the European Union, but then also reaching across the channel and across, of course, the U.S., where does it end for a lot of these big tech companies?</p><p>JOHN STREUR, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CALVERT INVESTMENTS: Well, I think it ends in more regulation and higher costs for these companies, and that creates a significant amount of near term uncertainty in terms of how advertisers are going to respond to these changes.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Who will be the winners and who will be the losers? So, I mean, you say that you felt vindicated after you sell on Facebook. But Facebook could actually change more into something else.</p><p>STREUR: Look, I think it's (inaudible), I think Facebook's business model is fairly dependent upon their advertizing revenue. If we take a look at Facebook and Twitter, those are their primary revenue sources. So if we look at a company like Google or Amazon or other major platforms, they're showing us that they have significantly other opportunities to generate revenue, particularly cloud computing, which really came through for Google in the most recent period. So Facebook is very, very dependent and its ability to expose a large number of users to all sorts of inputs, conduct this really large scale psychological experiment and sell that information to advertisers. That's what's really coming under pressure and Facebook doesn't have a lot of other options.</p><p>TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: John, what you people invented with John Rogers on Chicago years ago in the Calvert Social Investment Fund, which at that time, folks, was absolutely revolutionary was, well, let's not buy tobacco, let's not buy this, let's not buy that. What has changed in social investment now? You were odd. Now, you're the norm. What is your day like in explaining the institutional money how to do social investment best?</p><p>STREUR: Well, that's -- thanks for the history. That's exactly right. I think what has really changed today is the amount of information that we have to work with to understand both what to buy as well as what you mentioned what not to buy. So today, our day is really all about understanding what is financially material in terms of environment performance, social impact, societal impact to companies.</p><p>KEENE: Put to rest the idea of rate of return. What is the tangible research you have, the tangible reality of rate of return or internal rate of return of social investment versus a blended SPX portfolio?</p><p>STREUR: Social investment can do anything non-social investment can do in terms of creating investment outcomes. There is really no reason to think about the return stream being different from social --</p><p>KEENE: Can you say the return stream is better? Can you say you're going to pick up 30 basis points with me?</p><p>STREUR: Well, I think you can say that. It depends on who is really applying the research though. So, as I said, we can do anything that you can do with non-social investing. We manufacture indexes at Calvert and they generally track the broad market. Sometimes we're slightly less risk, but that's the big measure. Can we create an inventory of securities that is capable to replicating the broad market returns. From there, sure, you can outperform especially if you add good active stock picking to that equation.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. John, thank you so much.

He  is the President and Chief Executive of Calvert Investments, and he joins  us now from Washington D.C. John Streur, thank you so much for joining us.  Where will this all end up? If you look at privacy, when you look at  regulation, really, being spearheaded by, I guess, the European Union, but  then also reaching across the channel and across, of course, the U.S.,  where does it end for a lot of these big tech companies?</p><p>JOHN STREUR, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CALVERT INVESTMENTS: Well, I think it ends  in more regulation and higher costs for these companies, and that creates a  significant amount of near term uncertainty in terms of how advertisers are  going to respond to these changes.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Who will be the winners and who will be the losers? So, I  mean, you say that you felt vindicated after you sell on Facebook. But  Facebook could actually change more into something else.</p><p>STREUR: Look, I think it's (inaudible), I think Facebook's business model  is fairly dependent upon their advertizing revenue. If we take a look at  Facebook and Twitter, those are their primary revenue sources. So if we  look at a company like Google or Amazon or other major platforms, they're  showing us that they have significantly other opportunities to generate  revenue, particularly cloud computing, which really came through for Google  in the most recent period. So Facebook is very, very dependent and its  ability to expose a large number of users to all sorts of inputs, conduct  this really large scale psychological experiment and sell that information  to advertisers. That's what's really coming under pressure and Facebook  doesn't have a lot of other options.</p><p>TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: John, what you people invented with John  Rogers on Chicago years ago in the Calvert Social Investment Fund, which at  that time, folks, was absolutely revolutionary was, well, let's not buy  tobacco, let's not buy this, let's not buy that. What has changed in social  investment now? You were odd. Now, you're the norm. What is your day like  in explaining the institutional money how to do social investment best?</p><p>STREUR: Well, that's -- thanks for the history. That's exactly right. I  think what has really changed today is the amount of information that we  have to work with to understand both what to buy as well as what you  mentioned what not to buy. So today, our day is really all about  understanding what is financially material in terms of environment  performance, social impact, societal impact to companies.</p><p>KEENE: Put to rest the idea of rate of return. What is the tangible  research you have, the tangible reality of rate of return or internal rate  of return of social investment versus a blended SPX portfolio?</p><p>STREUR: Social investment can do anything non-social investment can do in  terms of creating investment outcomes. There is really no reason to think  about the return stream being different from social --</p><p>KEENE: Can you say the return stream is better? Can you say you're going to  pick up 30 basis points with me?</p><p>STREUR: Well, I think you can say that. It depends on who is really  applying the research though. So, as I said, we can do anything that you  can do with non-social investing. We manufacture indexes at Calvert and  they generally track the broad market. Sometimes we're slightly less risk,  but that's the big measure. Can we create an inventory of securities that  is capable to replicating the broad market returns. From there, sure, you  can outperform especially if you add good active stock picking to that  equation.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. John, thank you so much.

He  is the President and Chief Executive of Calvert Investments, and he joins  us now from Washington D.C. John Streur, thank you so much for joining us.  Where will this all end up? If you look at privacy, when you look at  regulation, really, being spearheaded by, I guess, the European Union, but  then also reaching across the channel and across, of course, the U.S.,  where does it end for a lot of these big tech companies?</p><p> JOHN STREUR, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CALVERT INVESTMENTS: Well, I think it ends  in more regulation and higher costs for these companies, and that creates a  significant amount of near term uncertainty in terms of how advertisers are  going to respond to these changes.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. Who will be the winners and who will be the losers? So, I  mean, you say that you felt vindicated after you sell on Facebook. But  Facebook could actually change more into something else.</p><p> STREUR: Look, I think it's (inaudible), I think Facebook's business model  is fairly dependent upon their advertizing revenue. If we take a look at  Facebook and Twitter, those are their primary revenue sources. So if we  look at a company like Google or Amazon or other major platforms, they're  showing us that they have significantly other opportunities to generate  revenue, particularly cloud computing, which really came through for Google  in the most recent period. So Facebook is very, very dependent and its  ability to expose a large number of users to all sorts of inputs, conduct  this really large scale psychological experiment and sell that information  to advertisers. That's what's really coming under pressure and Facebook  doesn't have a lot of other options.</p><p> TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: John, what you people invented with John  Rogers on Chicago years ago in the Calvert Social Investment Fund, which at  that time, folks, was absolutely revolutionary was, well, let's not buy  tobacco, let's not buy this, let's not buy that. What has changed in social  investment now? You were odd. Now, you're the norm. What is your day like  in explaining the institutional money how to do social investment best?</p><p> STREUR: Well, that's -- thanks for the history. That's exactly right. I  think what has really changed today is the amount of information that we  have to work with to understand both what to buy as well as what you  mentioned what not to buy. So today, our day is really all about  understanding what is financially material in terms of environment  performance, social impact, societal impact to companies.</p><p> KEENE: Put to rest the idea of rate of return. What is the tangible  research you have, the tangible reality of rate of return or internal rate  of return of social investment versus a blended SPX portfolio?</p><p> STREUR: Social investment can do anything non-social investment can do in  terms of creating investment outcomes. There is really no reason to think  about the return stream being different from social --</p><p> KEENE: Can you say the return stream is better? Can you say you're going to  pick up 30 basis points with me?</p><p> STREUR: Well, I think you can say that. It depends on who is really  applying the research though. So, as I said, we can do anything that you  can do with non-social investing. We manufacture indexes at Calvert and  they generally track the broad market. Sometimes we're slightly less risk,  but that's the big measure. Can we create an inventory of securities that  is capable to replicating the broad market returns. From there, sure, you  can outperform especially if you add good active stock picking to that  equation.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. John, thank you so much. John Streur there, President  and Chief Executive Officer of Calvert Investment.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

The reaction to the 600-plus-page report from the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission is encouraging yet worrying in the extent to which the challenge posed by the digital platforms remains misunderstood.</p><p>Their operations, while loaded with opportunities for people and business, have the potential to undermine the market economy and the foundations of a viable democratic system. Every household with kids is at risk. The response must be set in this context. That task far transcends just another look at privacy and competition policy, though both these dimensions are critical.</p><p>ACCC chairman Rod Sims told Inquirer: \"The business model of Facebook and Google rely on customers not actually understanding what data is being collected from them or how that data is being used. This problem needs to be comprehended and then it needs to be fixed.\" The Morrison government has accepted the challenge. There are three indispensable steps in the politics, without which the project will fail. First, political bipartisanship between the Coalition and Labor is essential - just recall how the absence of bipartisanship destroyed any viable energy policy for Australia.</p><p>Second, the entire project needs an informed public providing a strong electoral mandate for a new legislated regulatory regime. And third, Australia can only work in sync with the big jurisdictions of Europe and America and become an integral player in a global response. One of our tasks is to influence the global action.</p><p>Scott Morrison and Frydenberg are positioning along these lines. Separate, but related, is the OECD work on a digital tax to be completed by the end of next year. Frydenberg and the Prime Minister could be expected to move in unison with other nations and introduce an Australian digital tax to address the activities of the digital platforms. This means the tax may be legislated this term.</p><p>There has never been a challenge like this. The fascinating question is whether the challenge of the tech giants can bring a unity in politics, with agreement on the public interest more easily achieved than usual. The ACCC report is an outstanding start to the process. It must rank as one of the best diagnoses of the tech challenge provided by any government in the world. The hope is that the ACCC analysis will influence the approach and decisions in Washington.</p><p>The unknown factors are the risks in a serious challenge to these companies and whether a new regulatory regime can do the job. Nobody thinks unilateral action by Australia can turn the tide - yet we can serve as an awakening catalyst.</p><p>An optimistic Sims said: \"I think our recommendations will have a huge impact because of their breadth. They deal with privacy, fairness and competition law, the deals these companies put to consumers, codes to enable media companies to bargain effectively with the digital platforms. Our recommendations are practical - we name the problem, then we specify the solution. And we do this across the board.\" The golden rule of reform still applies - throw sunlight on the way the public interest is betrayed. As a veteran of policy reform over 40 years, this is the method Sims uses in the report. Public awareness and education is at the heart of the ACCC strategy and it must be duplicated by the Morrison government.</p><p>The narrative history here resembles a fairytale. Remember the days of innocence when young kids in T-shirts and sneakers who didn't own a suit and looked totally benign offered a bright future that wise people guessed was too good to be true? The business model was unique - a free service driven by limitless demand with a technology as ubiquitous as anything ever invented.</p><p>That business model now looks different - it is predatory, based on monetising customer data largely in customer ignorance, abuse of market power and an astonishing indifference towards the social and cultural- consequences, many unintend-ed consequences, of the digital platforms.</p><p>The mental health problems of society are escalating towards an unprecedented crisis. US social psychologist Jonathan Haidt - one of the best analysts of contemporary society, who recently visit-ed Australia - warned that there was a \"very good chance\" US democracy would fail in the next 30 years and that digital platforms are central to this malaise. He said social media \"shreds any network of social understandings or meanings\".</p><p>There are two brands of critic-ism of the ACCC report: by economic liberals and libertarians that it is too interventionist and by tech gurus that it is a useless pop gun against the unstoppable march of technological innovation.</p><p>The first critique misreads the times and the dynamic at work. The lesson of the current age is writ large: the liberal market economy- is at risk from abuses by banks, energy companies and tech giants and effective regulation is the indispensable response. Any notion that these institutions will reform themselves is manifestly false. No rational politician would believe this. The market economy cannot survive without governments discharging their solemn task of strong regulation.</p><p>The second critique leads inexor-ably to demands for stronger action and falls prey to the \"silver- bullet\" mentality. US Democrat contender Elizabeth Warren waves a \"big stick\" and calls for the companies to be broken- up. This means a long legal delay of many years and puts too many eggs in the divestment basket-. There is no surety that break-ups will solve the problem.</p><p>In his penetrating article last week, commentator Alan Kohler analysed the options and concluded that licensing the companies is probably the \"only thing\" that makes a serious difference. Maybe - but what credibility does withdrawing a licence have, given no recent Australian government has done this for a bank or energy company?</p><p>\"Some of the comments about our report are longing for a silver bullet,\" Sims said. \"But in life there are rarely silver bullets. Our purpose- is not to kill Google or Facebook. We want to address these problems, not take the -companies out of existence.\" The ACCC report defines the strategic framework for tackling the tech giants. First, the method must be holistic - that means integ-rating the different legislative approaches of consumer, competition and privacy law. \"A siloed -approach will fail,\" the report said. \"People cannot understand the problem posed by these companies until they see its breadth,\" Sims said. The ACCC leans towards a whole-of-government strategy.</p><p>Second, the method must addres-s challenges now but also provide a permanent information stream to meet future new problems as they arise. \"Our recommendations are designed to give the government and public the ongoing- information they need to stay ahead of this game,\" Sims said.</p><p>Third, the awareness of individual customers is the enduring reform- strategy, with the report saying: \"The ACCC's view is that few consumers are fully informed of, fully understand, or effectively control, the scope of data collected and the bargain they are entering into with digital platforms when they sign up for, or use, their -services.\" This is an intolerable situation. It is idle to think such consumer -ignorance is not a fundamental part of the big-tech business model. The report said: \"There is a substantial disconnect between how consumers think their data should be treated and how it is actually treated. Digital platforms collect vast troves of data on consumers from ever-expanding sources and have significant discretion over how this user data is used and disclosed- to other businesses and organisations, both now and in the future.\" Studies show that when people are told what happens to their data, 90 per cent report they are uncomfortable with the situation. The dictum that \"you can only use my platform if you give me your data\" must be dismantled.</p><p>Frydenberg was conspicuously strong in his response to the -report. He said: \"The world has never seen before so much personally and commercially sensitive data collected, let alone aggregated and held by just two companies. Our legislative and regulatory framework did not and could not anticipate such a new paradigm. The government accepts the ACCC's overriding conclusion that there is a need for reform.\" Each month about 19.2 million Australians use Google search and 17.3 million access Facebook. The share price of both companies contain-s a hefty margin for projected future growth, estimated at 46-64 per cent of the existing share price for Google. Both companie-s generate most of their revenue from advertising, offering unique opportunities for advert-isers. The ACCC finds they have substantial market power in the supply of search services, search advertising and in dealings with established news businesses.</p><p>The high barriers to entry on these fronts underpin their market power. About 95 per cent of general searches in Australia are done through Google, which earns -almost 96 per cent of all search advert-ising revenue. Sims brands the attitude of the companies as akin to \"trust us\". He repudiates in the public interest the notion that the issues covered in the ACCC report- can be left to the companies.</p><p>The report recommends a specialist digital platforms branch be created within the ACCC to monitor and act against anti-competitiv-e conduct and consumer harm. It should be empowered by ministers to hold extended public inquiries, covering a period of at least five years, with power to compel information from companies.</p><p>The ACCC recommends action to address the vast imbalance in the bargaining relationship between- Google and Facebook on one hand and news media business on the other.</p><p>This is an asymmetrical relationship because news media businesses need Google and Facebook referrals more than each digital platform needs an individual media business's content. This issue leads directly to the attrition of journalism, with classified -advertising revenue falling from $2 billion in 2001 to $200 million in 2016 and a sharp decline in newspaper titles, the number of journalists and the breadth and depth of much reporting.</p><p>The effect of the ACCC recom-mendation is that Google and Facebook would be forced to share data and revenue more fairly from content generated by media businesses. This would involve codes of conduct governing relations betwee-n digital companies and media businesses that are policed by the Australian Communic-ations and Media Authority.</p><p>The aim is to correct the current- power imbalance with its adverse consequence for the public- interest. The intent is a more unified media regulatory framework. Further codes of conduct will govern the handling of complaints about disinformation and untrustworthy or fake news.</p><p>The justification for such actions- is undeniable. The digital platforms are changing the fundamental conditions under which people receive and manage inform-ation, penetrating to the functioning of the democratic -system.</p><p>The ACCC report said of the activities of the digital platforms: \"This may have the effect of under-mining democratic processes\" - a mild observation since the reality is that democratic processes- are already being undermined. The idea that governments have no role or responsibility to maintain the framework that sustains our democracy is untenable.</p><p>The ACCC puts a heavy emph-asis on global action, with a -summary of action taken in Britain, the EU and the US. It says co-ordination across borders is \"critical\" and the plan is for the new digital platforms branch within the ACCC to work closely with parallel teams in other countries.</p><p>\"I think there is a big catch-up job to do,\" Sims said. \"We don't doubt this. Why are we so far behind-? Well, these are relatively new companies. Their market power has grown very quickly. They came offering free services and it has taken people a while to begin to work out what is happening. And the companies have changed. These companies are not the same as they were just five years ago.\" This issue is not just about business- and technology. It goes to the way people live and interact on a daily basis. It is true that technol-ogy moves much faster than the ability of governments and regul-atory agencies to respond. It was inconceivable 15 years ago to imagine- the vast changes to be wrought by the digital companies. Their pluses were brilliantly obvious but their downsides have only slowly become more apparent.</p><p>Few doubt the magnitude of the task facing governments. Yet arguing that government should allow these companies to set their own rules in their own interests cannot be sustained in a democratic polity.The government will respond to the ACCC report by the end of the year. That will open a vast new field of public policy and political experimentation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-9602216eb4fb11e986acdef2f743c48af03e292245d747429ad6a8cbd2905710</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPX-F8P1-JD3N-51RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2235\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 3, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WM-1595ccde590148669f3f3a1a3c77a95d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-327W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402028</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-7e0fa2e16e7d466181f6d1cba7d2c8d5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-3259-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-b68cd9276d044f4599c5c9e8a6fc9132</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-3285-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YN-f966d88d6c474d87939f4d5a5a0e01fd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-327T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402030</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-20eab72367124f4bbed8ccf985988881</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1OX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-326C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-8aea29fafbb24878a705eb5639187dad</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-325F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date. Katya Adler with the latest on Brexit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SW-906360a5b9684968b66b5b9422f5755d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-320B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"780\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date. Katya Adler with the latest on Brexit.

Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-839b29f106c54084af85ea460b44c713</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-328C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-4cd201388f5f4487b7675565bc108f9c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-327N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SE-a21cbe3451e443fbb378658292f0983f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-326Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-8d8b4449ed694b89b66ae3f4dd5212a6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-3284-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm Sharanjit Leyl in Singapore, the headlines: Internet regulation - Britain follows Australia and announces a new crackdown on harmful content on the web. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing a service without providing the protection for users. In just a few hours, Israelis head to the polls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for his political survival. </p><p>I'm Kasia Madera in London. Also in the programme. \"Shameful and un-Australian\", Australia's Prime Minister lashes out at animal rights campaigners who broke into abbatoirs and held up traffic. America's college entrance scandal: actress Felicity Huffman and 13 others plead guilty. Life from our studios in Singapore and at London, this is BBC World News. It is Newsday. -- live from our studios. Good morning. It's 8am in Singapore and one o'clock in London where the UK Government has become the latest to announce new regulations for the Internet. Firms that carry child abuse images or terrorist propaganda could be fined and even have their content blocked. There'll be a new watchdog and senior managers could be held criminally responsible for any breaches of the rules. It follows Australia's decision to ban harmful content - partly motivated by the live-streaming on Facebook of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 50 people were shot dead. Critics argue the proposals threaten freedom of speech. Our Media Editor, Amol Rajan, reports. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world. Cabinet Ministers claim Britain will have the toughest Internet laws in the world. That is an exaggeration. The likes of Turkey, China, Dubai are much tougher. But Britain has sought inspiration from Germany, whose use of hate speech laws to curb online excess has been tentatively hailed as a success in the past year. Censorship is always bad, even in unfree society. It is the task and the responsibility of governments to maintain freedom of speech, but it is also the task of governments to stop using free speech if it violates other people. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. We'll hear more on internet regulation from Australia shortly. First, let's take a look at some of the day's other news. British MPs have approved legislation forcing Prime Minister Theresa May to request to delay Brexit in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit this Friday. That's as talks between the UK Government and opposition Labour Party continue as they try to break the deadlock over Brexit. Mrs May will meet the French and German leaders on Tuesday to discuss Britain's options. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, says the EU remains united but they are not actually united at the moment. About whether to grant an extension, how long for, and under which conditions because the Prime Minister may say she wants a short extension until the 30th of June, but many EU leaders disagree because they cannot see the UK really getting everything together and ratifying a Brexit deal by that date.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YL-83a323e7c30d42da8594f0ddc62277dc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-328D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400425</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YN-c69fa0250b8644dcb9ca4fa2251cf573</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-3266-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402030</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-3f4077c97ea845bf9f398e22252bd274</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-324T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. </p><p>Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend, so it is very unclear, but there are these new powers that have been passed and they have yet to be tested. What kind of solution</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EM-a2bfe983520047c395be2a4b1b08c8dc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-320X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-c50d99752fa744b48028869fe8a9bccd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-327D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-9246ca593b824444bfa42a0b4e67c971</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-326W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-e3658f9e48cd44dea651af414708d773</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-324M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-f6e978e4f9044395a470b58257bda5e4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-324Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. </p><p>Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend, so it is very unclear, but there are these new powers that have been passed and they have yet to be tested.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SW-daf9eb34eeec439eab7816e702212aaa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-329S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SE-6291643ba02c47e689ce6a7b8b06a16e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-324J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-3db564af1737499dab6a1d7a4367eb65</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-327F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-4058fca94e6342978ee442966669bf1a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-3261-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WM-1599ba6460134d65b9955ee37ceb144a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-3265-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402028</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network.

US secretary of State Mike Pompeo has barred 16 Saudis from entering the United States for the State Department described as their involvement in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department previously revoked the visas of nearly two dozen Saudi officials and froze the assets of 17 others. US President Donald Trump is removing the director of the Secret Service, the agency that provides protection for him and other top officials. </p><p>The dismissal of Randolph \"Tex\" Alles comes just a day after his boss, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left her post. Mr Alles has denied suggestions he was fired, saying he was told weeks ago to expect a 'transition in leadership'. A Hong Kong court is expected to deliver its verdict in the controversial trial of three democracy campaigners over their participation in the so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014. They're among nine activists facing colonial-era public nuisance charges in relation to the protests, which called for free elections. The charges carry jail terms of up to seven years. Nissan shareholders have voted to remove the company's former boss Carlos Ghosn from its board. The decision to sever ties with Mr Ghosn was made at a shareholders meeting. The former chairman of Nissan was re-arrested in Tokyo last week while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. He was first detained in November. The UK is the latest country to question the use of Huawei technology in its 5G network. The United States has been warning its allies that Huawei's technology could make them vulnerable to Chinese state espionage or cyber attacks - something Huawei denies. It is known as the toughest foot race on earth, the seven-day Marathon des Sables is taking place in the Sahara Desert in southern Morocco. It covers a distance of 251km, equivalent to six regular marathons. Almost 1,000 competitors are participating in this year's event, racing across inhospitable terrain in the blazing heat. The so-called ultramarathon has been held annually since 1986. As we've heard, the era of self-regulation for giant tech companies such as Facebook is coming to an end. Britain has followed Australia in announcing enforcement powers including the ability to fine companies that break the rules. But how difficult is it to police the internet? I put that question to the head of the International Cyber Policy Centre - Fergus Hanson - who joined me from Canberra a short time ago. Well, it is hugely difficult. If you think about it, just targeting Facebook and looking at these big tech companies, but really there is a whole world of much smaller companies that are almost impossible to reach. If you take the Christchurch terrorist video, that was actually disseminated largely through a group called 8Chan, which most people probably never heard of but there is a whole bunch of these little websites that are just really very difficult to reach and hard to regulate. How big an appetite is there around the world for some kind of accountability for what has happened online? We have been talking about those awful Christchurch shootings the fact they were live streamed... Shouldn't something like that not be allowed to happen again? Yes, I think you feel and hear that Christchurch shooting video really has stirred people up. It is was a horrendous attack and people I think really want to see more action taken against companies that are facilitating the sharing of these videos. The big question though is how do you do that. Are we going to start treating these companies as broadcasters and apply the same rules or will we start saying everybody is a publisher now and individuals have to start taking a bit more responsibility? Personally, I think we need to do a little bit of a mix of both. We cannot just let individuals off scott free and have no responsibility for what they are sharing online. There's been a lot of concern as well, particularly where you are in Australia, that these new rules were rushed through, a lot of concerns about censorship. That is right. In Australia, a new law has passed Parliament that essentially empowers what we call our Re-safety Commission, who are responsible for making sure that Australians feel safe online. And they have given the power to issue notices to companies saying they are hosting abhorent content which is essentially a signal that they have to remove it instantly. Unfortunately, the laws do not actually spell out how quickly they have to remove it, they were raced through Parliament, drafted over a weekend,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YL-796ee8fd1bf8457db8af8c120cc816b5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-0XP1-DY08-324S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400425</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The sequel, called The Testaments, is due to be published on Tuesday. That's all. Stay with BBC World News. </p><p>We have lots more of all of our stories on the website including what is taking place in the Lords at the moment, the prorogation of Parliament. We go to Rico to get the business news. Google competition pro. A group of 50 states and territories in the US launch an investigation into the search giant's dominance of online advertising. Alibaba's boss steps down from his role as executive chairman as he marks his 55th launch an investigation into the search giant's birthday. Good morning, Asia. Hello, world. It is a Tuesday. Glad you could join us for another exciting addition of Asia Business Report. I am Rico Hizon. We start off with the world's biggest search engine. 50 groups and territories in the United States have launched an investigation into Google's dominance of the online advertising market. A Samira Hussain reports from New York, there are a mounting number of probes of big technology giants by authorities in America. This is not something you see very often in Washington, DC, Democrats and Republicans working together. But together they stood on the steps of the Supreme Court, announcing an investigation into the business practices of the business giant Google. And well Democrats and Republicans may be from different parties we all have a common bond and that is we are charged with responsibility of protecting the citizens of our state. Visa state officials are looking at Google's search engine and is digital advertising and whether it has stifled competition by favouring its own size. This is not the only investigation to hit intact. Last week another investigation of state officials found an anti-trust look into Facebook. We decided to probe whether social media, search, and e-commerce companies have become too big. In the Federal Trade Commission continues to examine Facebook. These investigations may take a year or even longer and at the end of all of that, the landscape of big tech may not end up looking any different. Even with anti-trust enforcement, even with investigations, we still may have a few dominant firms stop and that will leave policy with another question does just do you regulate more in this space? Do you come up with neutral stray digital market that actually expand opportunities for competition? I believe that is probably where we're headed. This all comes as consumers have confidence in tech companies. They have been unable to safeguard people's information and they have been caught up in our efforts by foreign powers to influence elections. So now it is up to big tech to prove lawmakers wrong. Samira Hussain, BBC News, Washington. The troubled Japanese carmaker Nissan, the chief executive has said he will be stepping down next week stop shares are rising by on this news. He has been criticised for being overpaid as part of a bonus scheme. Although he denies any wrongdoing. The company has been embroiled in a scandal since its former boss was arrested late last year and charged over alleged financial misconduct. The latest announcement followed a meeting of the carmakers' For some time he has expressed his strongest desire to pass the baton to the next generation. Under the current circumstances board has decided his resignation to take place as soon as possible. TRANSLATION: Took a lot of time but the in-house investigation has finished. This is a big step to go to the next phase. I intended to solve all those problems before handing over the leadership. So a regret that I haven't been able to do so. Turning now to Brexit and BMW's phone as the BBC that workers at its facility in the UK could see their shifts cut in the event of a no deal exit from the European Union. Nicolas Peifer was speaking ahead of the opening of the Frankfurt motor show in Germany.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-da84683629a94170a7662bc6b853a30e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1OX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X14-H7H1-JBH6-C50V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The sequel, called The Testaments, is due to be published on Tuesday. That's all. Stay with BBC World News. </p><p>We have lots more of all of our stories on the website including what is taking place in the Lords at the moment, the prorogation of Parliament. We go to Rico to get the business news. Google competition pro. A group of 50 states and territories in the US launch an investigation into the search giant's dominance of online advertising. Alibaba's boss steps down from his role as executive chairman as he marks his 55th launch an investigation into the search giant's birthday. Good morning, Asia. Hello, world. It is a Tuesday. Glad you could join us for another exciting addition of Asia Business Report. I am Rico Hizon. We start off with the world's biggest search engine. 50 groups and territories in the United States have launched an investigation into Google's dominance of the online advertising market. A Samira Hussain reports from New York, there are a mounting number of probes of big technology giants by authorities in America. This is not something you see very often in Washington, DC, Democrats and Republicans working together. But together they stood on the steps of the Supreme Court, announcing an investigation into the business practices of the business giant Google. And well Democrats and Republicans may be from different parties we all have a common bond and that is we are charged with responsibility of protecting the citizens of our state. Visa state officials are looking at Google's search engine and is digital advertising and whether it has stifled competition by favouring its own size. This is not the only investigation to hit intact. Last week another investigation of state officials found an anti-trust look into Facebook. We decided to probe whether social media, search, and e-commerce companies have become too big. In the Federal Trade Commission continues to examine Facebook. These investigations may take a year or even longer and at the end of all of that, the landscape of big tech may not end up looking any different. Even with anti-trust enforcement, even with investigations, we still may have a few dominant firms stop and that will leave policy with another question does just do you regulate more in this space? Do you come up with neutral stray digital market that actually expand opportunities for competition? I believe that is probably where we're headed. This all comes as consumers have confidence in tech companies. They have been unable to safeguard people's information and they have been caught up in our efforts by foreign powers to influence elections. So now it is up to big tech to prove lawmakers wrong. Samira Hussain, BBC News, Washington. The troubled Japanese carmaker Nissan, the chief executive has said he will be stepping down next week stop shares are rising by on this news. He has been criticised for being overpaid as part of a bonus scheme. Although he denies any wrongdoing. The company has been embroiled in a scandal since its former boss was arrested late last year and charged over alleged financial misconduct. The latest announcement followed a meeting of the carmakers' For some time he has expressed his strongest desire to pass the baton to the next generation. Under the current circumstances board has decided his resignation to take place as soon as possible. TRANSLATION: Took a lot of time but the in-house investigation has finished. This is a big step to go to the next phase. I intended to solve all those problems before handing over the leadership. So a regret that I haven't been able to do so. Turning now to Brexit and BMW's phone as the BBC that workers at its facility in the UK could see their shifts cut in the event of a no deal exit from the European Union.

Alibaba's boss steps down from his role as executive chairman as he marks his 55th launch an investigation into the search giant's birthday. Good morning, Asia. Hello, world. It is a Tuesday. Glad you could join us for another exciting addition of Asia Business Report. I am Rico Hizon. We start off with the world's biggest search engine. 50 groups and territories in the United States have launched an investigation into Google's dominance of the online advertising market. A Samira Hussain reports from New York, there are a mounting number of probes of big technology giants by authorities in America. This is not something you see very often in Washington, DC, Democrats and Republicans working together. But together they stood on the steps of the Supreme Court, announcing an investigation into the business practices of the business giant Google. And well Democrats and Republicans may be from different parties we all have a common bond and that is we are charged with responsibility of protecting the citizens of our state. Visa state officials are looking at Google's search engine and is digital advertising and whether it has stifled competition by favouring its own size. This is not the only investigation to hit intact. Last week another investigation of state officials found an anti-trust look into Facebook. We decided to probe whether social media, search, and e-commerce companies have become too big. In the Federal Trade Commission continues to examine Facebook. These investigations may take a year or even longer and at the end of all of that, the landscape of big tech may not end up looking any different. Even with anti-trust enforcement, even with investigations, we still may have a few dominant firms stop and that will leave policy with another question does just do you regulate more in this space? Do you come up with neutral stray digital market that actually expand opportunities for competition? I believe that is probably where we're headed. This all comes as consumers have confidence in tech companies. They have been unable to safeguard people's information and they have been caught up in our efforts by foreign powers to influence elections. So now it is up to big tech to prove lawmakers wrong. Samira Hussain, BBC News, Washington. The troubled Japanese carmaker Nissan, the chief executive has said he will be stepping down next week stop shares are rising by on this news. He has been criticised for being overpaid as part of a bonus scheme. Although he denies any wrongdoing. The company has been embroiled in a scandal since its former boss was arrested late last year and charged over alleged financial misconduct. The latest announcement followed a meeting of the carmakers' For some time he has expressed his strongest desire to pass the baton to the next generation. Under the current circumstances board has decided his resignation to take place as soon as possible. TRANSLATION: Took a lot of time but the in-house investigation has finished. This is a big step to go to the next phase. I intended to solve all those problems before handing over the leadership. So a regret that I haven't been able to do so.

The sequel, called The Testaments, is due to be published on Tuesday. That's all. Stay with BBC World News. </p><p>We have lots more of all of our stories on the website including what is taking place in the Lords at the moment, the prorogation of Parliament. We go to Rico to get the business news. Google competition pro. A group of 50 states and territories in the US launch an investigation into the search giant's dominance of online advertising. Alibaba's boss steps down from his role as executive chairman as he marks his 55th launch an investigation into the search giant's birthday. Good morning, Asia. Hello, world. It is a Tuesday. Glad you could join us for another exciting addition of Asia Business Report. I am Rico Hizon. We start off with the world's biggest search engine. 50 groups and territories in the United States have launched an investigation into Google's dominance of the online advertising market. A Samira Hussain reports from New York, there are a mounting number of probes of big technology giants by authorities in America. This is not something you see very often in Washington, DC, Democrats and Republicans working together. But together they stood on the steps of the Supreme Court, announcing an investigation into the business practices of the business giant Google. And well Democrats and Republicans may be from different parties we all have a common bond and that is we are charged with responsibility of protecting the citizens of our state. Visa state officials are looking at Google's search engine and is digital advertising and whether it has stifled competition by favouring its own size. This is not the only investigation to hit intact. Last week another investigation of state officials found an anti-trust look into Facebook. We decided to probe whether social media, search, and e-commerce companies have become too big. In the Federal Trade Commission continues to examine Facebook. These investigations may take a year or even longer and at the end of all of that, the landscape of big tech may not end up looking any different. Even with anti-trust enforcement, even with investigations, we still may have a few dominant firms stop and that will leave policy with another question does just do you regulate more in this space? Do you come up with neutral stray digital market that actually expand opportunities for competition? I believe that is probably where we're headed. This all comes as consumers have confidence in tech companies. They have been unable to safeguard people's information and they have been caught up in our efforts by foreign powers to influence elections. So now it is up to big tech to prove lawmakers wrong. Samira Hussain, BBC News, Washington. The troubled Japanese carmaker Nissan, the chief executive has said he will be stepping down next week stop shares are rising by on this news. He has been criticised for being overpaid as part of a bonus scheme. Although he denies any wrongdoing. The company has been embroiled in a scandal since its former boss was arrested late last year and charged over alleged financial misconduct. The latest announcement followed a meeting of the carmakers' For some time he has expressed his strongest desire to pass the baton to the next generation. Under the current circumstances board has decided his resignation to take place as soon as possible. TRANSLATION: Took a lot of time but the in-house investigation has finished. This is a big step to go to the next phase. I intended to solve all those problems before handing over the leadership. So a regret that I haven't been able to do so. Turning now to Brexit and BMW's phone as the BBC that workers at its facility in the UK could see their shifts cut in the event of a no deal exit from the European Union. Nicolas Peifer was speaking ahead of the opening of the Frankfurt motor show in Germany.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WA-4aed3a0783ea41548a99ac7c26091b1f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X14-H7H1-JBH6-C50K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402024</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.
