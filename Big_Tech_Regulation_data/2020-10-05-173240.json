Did Apple deliver the goods when it comes to equity investors? It's such a big part of major benchmark indexes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TONY DWYER, EQUITY STRATEGIST, CANACCORD GENUITY: Well as Tom indicated, I don't comment on individual stocks, however--</p><p>TOM KEENE, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Well make an exception here, come on.</p><p>ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Come on, it's Apple.</p><p>DWYER: It's a famous but, our analyst, Mike Walkley, did put out a comment this morning that he thought, he's higher than the Street in his estimates. He thought it was fine. We've got a buy rating and a $112 target on the stock.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well as a matter of fact a number of strategists, I think of the team over at Strategas, I think of the team from Wells Fargo, pointing out that big cap technology, big boring Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, it's back. That's where the action is. Do you agree with that?</p><p>DWYER: I do, I do. We are overweight information technology. Anything really related to capital spending the companies and the financials that support that. That provide that capital, create that capital and lend the money for it. I think that's the place to be.</p><p>0708</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0709</p><p>KEENE: Let's bring it over to Tony Dwyer. You're going to be watching three iWatches for Christmas by the way. I can see it coming Dwyer.</p><p>DWYER: Four, I'll even include my wife on that.</p><p>KEENE: Four iWatches for Christmas. When you look at a trillion dollar company, that's a commitment to your bull market isn't it? Can you extrapolate out to Dow 20,000?</p><p>DWYER: Until you shut down credit, it is a levered society. Until you shut down the ability of the people at this table and people that are watching and listening to get credit the economy will move forward. And what we found historically, through making a lot of mistakes is, as long as earnings are higher, the market is higher.</p><p>KEENE: And Dwyer children just remember, Uncle Tom says the iWatch for Christmas, look for that.</p><p>FU: The green band, no less. All right Tony Dwyer of Canaccord Genuity and of course Mo Koyfman of Spark Capital.</p><p>0710</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0714</p><p>KEENE: Tony please?</p><p>DWYER: You want to be careful also. You know you hear a lot of \"it's a bubble\" because some of these big tech stocks are coming out at better valuation. Twitter, things like that--</p><p>JOHNSON: You mean like 14 times sales.</p><p>DWYER: Yeah like crazy stuff. Remember that Netscape was the initial internet company that came out in 1995. And that was doubled in price the day before and then it was, it went up to I think it doubled in actual price once it traded.</p><p>KEENE: Yeah. You're the Wall Street guy here, this is an ecumenical offering. There's like 47 firms involved with Alibaba. Does Mo Koyfman's world need your world?</p><p>DWYER: Clearly.</p><p>KEENE: Does tech need Wall Street?</p><p>DWYER: You do because you're raising capital. And again that's why I'm overweight the financials. It's those companies that provide the capital for these tech--</p><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p>DWYER: Companies--</p><p>JOHNSON: In spite of increase in regulatory environment?</p><p>0714</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0720</p><p>KEENE: Tony Dwyer of Canaccord Genuity, he's pushed it all aside. He sees higher stock prices founded simply on a good economy and better earnings. Yours is a simple calculus isn't it?</p><p>DWYER: It is. There's five thesis points through making many mistakes over my career.</p><p>KEENE: Give us one of them, we don't have time.</p><p>DWYER: I'm going to go real quick. The market correlates to the direction of earnings. So as long as the direction of earnings is positive, it's not whether you're a buyer, it's where you're a more aggressive buyer.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>DWYER: The second, that is driven, earnings are driven by economic activity. That's driven by the slope of the yield curve and availability money through lending--</p><p>KEENE: We're nowhere near recession.</p><p>DWYER: We're not even in a light year of it. So let's do this, inflation's been flat for the last four years. Fed funds has been flat for the last four years. Interest rates have been in a range for the last four years. So exactly why should we become negative if nothing fundamentally has changed?</p><p>Now prices have gone up, but not to the degree, given inflation, that should be considered worrisome in any way.</p><p>KEENE: Where does use of cash change here? All the geniuses are telling me share buyback is going to change and this, that and the other thing. I don't observe a change in use of cash.</p><p>DWYER: It's not even close. For example, corporate credit new issuance according to my buddy Brian Reynolds who's a guest here, the two days following the Labor Day holiday were like the 5th and 6th largest day of corporate credit new issuance ever. What that means is, companies are still taking in, not just earnings and retained income, but tremendous amount of cash to buy back stock.</p><p>FU: Mm-hmm.</p><p>DWYER: To shrink their share (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: And Scarlet that shows the confidence that has to be out there.</p><p>FU: The confidence and the need to take advantage of low rates while you can. FU: Mo Koyfman our guest host for the hour.</p><p>MO KOYFMAN, GENERAL PARTNER, SPARK CAPITAL: Yeah just a question on that because we tend to look up here when we look at these things. And I'm wondering down on the ground, because every time whether it was the mortgage crisis or anything else, it starts from the populous.</p><p>DWYER: Right.</p><p>KOYFMAN: What about earnings? Not by corporations but by, you know, the large, the masses in this country and how much of the spending power and the earnings being generated today is coming from leverage versus actual--</p><p>FU: Wages.</p><p>KOYFMAN: Real dollars, wages.</p><p>KEENE: This is a raging debate right now on wage growth.</p><p>KOYFMAN: Right.</p><p>DWYER: Wages are beginning to grow but let's think about an economic cycle. What creates a change in an economic cycle is Fed policy which Fed starts to tighten interest rates because wages and real growth is beginning to pick up. It's just taken four years to get there.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>DWYER: So we're still, even though duration we're not, but we're still early in the economic cycle because we're building those wage (inaudible).</p><p>KOYFMAN: That to me is the real question here, are we going to see the wage growth required to sustain this?</p><p>KEENE: Right. And Adam within this bimodal discussion of the haves and the have nots--</p><p>JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p>KEENE: The real question is can you have Dwyer's optimism with so many Americans struggling for that marginal wage growth?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well perhaps and Tony maybe you can speak to this. What we're really getting at is whether there has been enough de-leveraging at the personal level. Not the government, not corporations, but yes Mo at the personal level has there been enough de-leveraging to allow people to go out and spend again?</p><p>DWYER: I would say yes. Forget my opinion, let's look at the evidence. The evidence is in the last two months you've seen an acceleration on consumer loans. OK that's the first time this cycle. That is telling me that's de- leveraged.</p><p>JOHNSON: But has leverage come down enough that an acceleration in leveraging is actually good? Do you know what I mean?</p><p>DWYER: See I think all that data is skewed. If you're paying down credit cards it takes a lot of $2,500 payments to pay down. But if you throw the keys back to the bank and take a hit on a $400,000 house, that's going to change the leverage ratio.</p><p>So in other words it's being skewed by something that hasn't happened before which is so many people flipping their house back to the bank.</p><p>KEENE: One of the whispers here Scarlet was yesterday Oliver Chen at Citigroup saying they've been surprised how the first two weeks of September--</p><p>FU: On retail.</p><p>KEENE: Have been pretty good for retail.</p><p>FU: Well certainly at the high end that's been the case. For Wal-Mart, for Target, for some on the lower end, it's a bit of a struggle. So going on that, with this two speed America, the haves versus the have nots, are the obvious sector picks that you avoid staples and you go straight for the luxury retailers?</p><p>DWYER: No I think you actually; we're neutral on consumer discretionary as well. Again rates are poised to go up. That's going to begin to restrict credit. Today credit has been wide opened. People can buy money to buy things. And again I think it's important to remember so far it's the haves and the have nots. But all wages and aggregate hours worked, average hourly earnings, they're all beginning to pick up.</p><p>KEENE: I'll go with that. They're just starting to lift a little.</p><p>DWYER: And that's a good thing. That's a good thing.</p><p>KOYFMAN: But that's the thing we need to watch.</p><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah it is. We'll talk about haves and have nots.</p><p>0724</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0755</p><p>KEENE: Do you believe in a linkage of the markets into the mid-term election? Should we be a student of those elections?</p><p>DWYER: I'm a student of history and the elections are, if you asked anybody today, we've never seen this kind of disconnect between Congress and the president. It seems so unique right?</p><p>The Republicans impeached a sitting president during the greatest period for stock market advance in our history in the 1990s when they impeached Bill Clinton.

Did Apple deliver the goods when it comes to equity investors? It's such a big part of major benchmark indexes.</p><p/><p>TONY DWYER, EQUITY STRATEGIST, CANACCORD GENUITY: Well as Tom indicated, I don't comment on individual stocks, however--</p><p/><p>TOM KEENE, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Well make an exception here, come on.</p><p/><p>ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Come on, it's Apple.</p><p/><p>DWYER: It's a famous but, our analyst, Mike Walkley, did put out a comment this morning that he thought, he's higher than the Street in his estimates. He thought it was fine. We've got a buy rating and a $112 target on the stock.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Well as a matter of fact a number of strategists, I think of the team over at Strategas, I think of the team from Wells Fargo, pointing out that big cap technology, big boring Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, it's back. That's where the action is. Do you agree with that?</p><p/><p>DWYER: I do, I do. We are overweight information technology. Anything really related to capital spending the companies and the financials that support that. That provide that capital, create that capital and lend the money for it. I think that's the place to be.</p><p/><p>0708</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>0709</p><p/><p>KEENE: Let's bring it over to Tony Dwyer. You're going to be watching three iWatches for Christmas by the way. I can see it coming Dwyer.</p><p/><p>DWYER: Four, I'll even include my wife on that.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Four iWatches for Christmas. When you look at a trillion dollar company, that's a commitment to your bull market isn't it? Can you extrapolate out to Dow 20,000?</p><p/><p>DWYER: Until you shut down credit, it is a levered society. Until you shut down the ability of the people at this table and people that are watching and listening to get credit the economy will move forward. And what we found historically, through making a lot of mistakes is, as long as earnings are higher, the market is higher.</p><p/><p>KEENE: And Dwyer children just remember, Uncle Tom says the iWatch for Christmas, look for that.</p><p/><p>FU: The green band, no less. All right Tony Dwyer of Canaccord Genuity and of course Mo Koyfman of Spark Capital.</p><p/><p>0710</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>0714</p><p/><p>KEENE: Tony please?</p><p/><p>DWYER: You want to be careful also. You know you hear a lot of \"it's a bubble\" because some of these big tech stocks are coming out at better valuation. Twitter, things like that--</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: You mean like 14 times sales.</p><p/><p>DWYER: Yeah like crazy stuff. Remember that Netscape was the initial internet company that came out in 1995. And that was doubled in price the day before and then it was, it went up to I think it doubled in actual price once it traded.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Yeah. You're the Wall Street guy here, this is an ecumenical offering. There's like 47 firms involved with Alibaba. Does Mo Koyfman's world need your world?</p><p/><p>DWYER: Clearly.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Does tech need Wall Street?</p><p/><p>DWYER: You do because you're raising capital. And again that's why I'm overweight the financials. It's those companies that provide the capital for these tech--</p><p/><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p/><p>DWYER: Companies--</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: In spite of increase in regulatory environment?</p><p/><p>0714</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>0720</p><p/><p>KEENE: Tony Dwyer of Canaccord Genuity, he's pushed it all aside. He sees higher stock prices founded simply on a good economy and better earnings. Yours is a simple calculus isn't it?</p><p/><p>DWYER: It is. There's five thesis points through making many mistakes over my career.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Give us one of them, we don't have time.</p><p/><p>DWYER: I'm going to go real quick. The market correlates to the direction of earnings. So as long as the direction of earnings is positive, it's not whether you're a buyer, it's where you're a more aggressive buyer.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p/><p>DWYER: The second, that is driven, earnings are driven by economic activity. That's driven by the slope of the yield curve and availability money through lending--</p><p/><p>KEENE: We're nowhere near recession.</p><p/><p>DWYER: We're not even in a light year of it. So let's do this, inflation's been flat for the last four years. Fed funds has been flat for the last four years. Interest rates have been in a range for the last four years. So exactly why should we become negative if nothing fundamentally has changed?</p><p/><p>Now prices have gone up, but not to the degree, given inflation, that should be considered worrisome in any way.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Where does use of cash change here? All the geniuses are telling me share buyback is going to change and this, that and the other thing. I don't observe a change in use of cash.</p><p/><p>DWYER: It's not even close. For example, corporate credit new issuance according to my buddy Brian Reynolds who's a guest here, the two days following the Labor Day holiday were like the 5th and 6th largest day of corporate credit new issuance ever. What that means is, companies are still taking in, not just earnings and retained income, but tremendous amount of cash to buy back stock.</p><p/><p>FU: Mm-hmm.</p><p/><p>DWYER: To shrink their share (inaudible).</p><p/><p>KEENE: And Scarlet that shows the confidence that has to be out there.</p><p/><p>FU: The confidence and the need to take advantage of low rates while you can. FU: Mo Koyfman our guest host for the hour.</p><p/><p>MO KOYFMAN, GENERAL PARTNER, SPARK CAPITAL: Yeah just a question on that because we tend to look up here when we look at these things. And I'm wondering down on the ground, because every time whether it was the mortgage crisis or anything else, it starts from the populous.</p><p/><p>DWYER: Right.</p><p/><p>KOYFMAN: What about earnings? Not by corporations but by, you know, the large, the masses in this country and how much of the spending power and the earnings being generated today is coming from leverage versus actual--</p><p/><p>FU: Wages.</p><p/><p>KOYFMAN: Real dollars, wages.</p><p/><p>KEENE: This is a raging debate right now on wage growth.</p><p/><p>KOYFMAN: Right.</p><p/><p>DWYER: Wages are beginning to grow but let's think about an economic cycle. What creates a change in an economic cycle is Fed policy which Fed starts to tighten interest rates because wages and real growth is beginning to pick up. It's just taken four years to get there.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p/><p>DWYER: So we're still, even though duration we're not, but we're still early in the economic cycle because we're building those wage (inaudible).</p><p/><p>KOYFMAN: That to me is the real question here, are we going to see the wage growth required to sustain this?</p><p/><p>KEENE: Right. And Adam within this bimodal discussion of the haves and the have nots--</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p/><p>KEENE: The real question is can you have Dwyer's optimism with so many Americans struggling for that marginal wage growth?</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Well perhaps and Tony maybe you can speak to this. What we're really getting at is whether there has been enough de-leveraging at the personal level. Not the government, not corporations, but yes Mo at the personal level has there been enough de-leveraging to allow people to go out and spend again?</p><p/><p>DWYER: I would say yes. Forget my opinion, let's look at the evidence. The evidence is in the last two months you've seen an acceleration on consumer loans. OK that's the first time this cycle. That is telling me that's de- leveraged.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: But has leverage come down enough that an acceleration in leveraging is actually good? Do you know what I mean?</p><p/><p>DWYER: See I think all that data is skewed. If you're paying down credit cards it takes a lot of $2,500 payments to pay down. But if you throw the keys back to the bank and take a hit on a $400,000 house, that's going to change the leverage ratio.</p><p/><p>So in other words it's being skewed by something that hasn't happened before which is so many people flipping their house back to the bank.</p><p/><p>KEENE: One of the whispers here Scarlet was yesterday Oliver Chen at Citigroup saying they've been surprised how the first two weeks of September--</p><p/><p>FU: On retail.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Have been pretty good for retail.</p><p/><p>FU: Well certainly at the high end that's been the case. For Wal-Mart, for Target, for some on the lower end, it's a bit of a struggle. So going on that, with this two speed America, the haves versus the have nots, are the obvious sector picks that you avoid staples and you go straight for the luxury retailers?</p><p/><p>DWYER: No I think you actually; we're neutral on consumer discretionary as well. Again rates are poised to go up. That's going to begin to restrict credit. Today credit has been wide opened. People can buy money to buy things. And again I think it's important to remember so far it's the haves and the have nots. But all wages and aggregate hours worked, average hourly earnings, they're all beginning to pick up.</p><p/><p>KEENE: I'll go with that. They're just starting to lift a little.</p><p/><p>DWYER: And that's a good thing. That's a good thing.</p><p/><p>KOYFMAN: But that's the thing we need to watch.</p><p/><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Yeah it is. We'll talk about haves and have nots.</p><p/><p>0724</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>0755</p><p/><p>KEENE: Do you believe in a linkage of the markets into the mid-term election? Should we be a student of those elections?</p><p/><p>DWYER: I'm a student of history and the elections are, if you asked anybody today, we've never seen this kind of disconnect between Congress and the president. It seems so unique right?</p><p/><p>The Republicans impeached a sitting president during the greatest period for stock market advance in our history in the 1990s when they impeached Bill Clinton. People forget that because the internet wasn't around then so you can't Google it.</p><p/><p>But basically this is what happens in mid-term elections. You get this developing story of how you're going to win the next presidential election. And it doesn't--</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Here's a stat for you, thanks to Dan Clifton Tom, Strategas Research Partners yesterday who noted that going back to 1918 in mid-term elections, the incumbent president has typically lost six seats in Congress.</p><p/><p>KEENE: And this goes again Tony to pushing aside the walls of worry. You have been a resilient bull through this summer. We called it the summer of discontent. Dr. Bremmer will talk about this tomorrow.</p><p/><p>DWYER: Well let's think about one of the best years in the stock market history, following 1995 was up 34% was 1996. Osama bin Laden came onto the stage. Russia was battling the Chechen rebels and Israel was attacking Hezbollah on the West Bank. So you had very similar geopolitical events. You had similar monetary events. It's just so similar.</p><p/><p>FU: History repeating itself.</p><p/><p>DWYER: It does.</p><p/><p>0756</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>0757</p><p/><p>KEENE: Mo Koyfman thank you so much, greatly appreciate your attendance today.</p><p/><p>KOYFMAN: Good to see you guys.</p><p/><p>KEENE: See you in Uber. And Tony Dwyer, as always thank you.

Did Apple deliver the goods when it comes to equity investors? It's such a big part of major benchmark indexes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TONY DWYER, EQUITY STRATEGIST, CANACCORD GENUITY: Well as Tom indicated, I don't comment on individual stocks, however--</p><p>TOM KEENE, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Well make an exception here, come on.</p><p>ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Come on, it's Apple.</p><p>DWYER: It's a famous but, our analyst, Mike Walkley, did put out a comment this morning that he thought, he's higher than the Street in his estimates. He thought it was fine. We've got a buy rating and a $112 target on the stock.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well as a matter of fact a number of strategists, I think of the team over at Strategas, I think of the team from Wells Fargo, pointing out that big cap technology, big boring Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, it's back. That's where the action is. Do you agree with that?</p><p>DWYER: I do, I do. We are overweight information technology. Anything really related to capital spending the companies and the financials that support that. That provide that capital, create that capital and lend the money for it. I think that's the place to be.</p><p>0708</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0709</p><p>KEENE: Let's bring it over to Tony Dwyer. You're going to be watching three iWatches for Christmas by the way. I can see it coming Dwyer.</p><p>DWYER: Four, I'll even include my wife on that.</p><p>KEENE: Four iWatches for Christmas. When you look at a trillion dollar company, that's a commitment to your bull market isn't it? Can you extrapolate out to Dow 20,000?</p><p>DWYER: Until you shut down credit, it is a levered society. Until you shut down the ability of the people at this table and people that are watching and listening to get credit the economy will move forward. And what we found historically, through making a lot of mistakes is, as long as earnings are higher, the market is higher.</p><p>KEENE: And Dwyer children just remember, Uncle Tom says the iWatch for Christmas, look for that.</p><p>FU: The green band, no less. All right Tony Dwyer of Canaccord Genuity and of course Mo Koyfman of Spark Capital.</p><p>0710</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0714</p><p>KEENE: Tony please?</p><p>DWYER: You want to be careful also. You know you hear a lot of \"it's a bubble\" because some of these big tech stocks are coming out at better valuation. Twitter, things like that--</p><p>JOHNSON: You mean like 14 times sales.</p><p>DWYER: Yeah like crazy stuff. Remember that Netscape was the initial internet company that came out in 1995. And that was doubled in price the day before and then it was, it went up to I think it doubled in actual price once it traded.</p><p>KEENE: Yeah. You're the Wall Street guy here, this is an ecumenical offering. There's like 47 firms involved with Alibaba. Does Mo Koyfman's world need your world?</p><p>DWYER: Clearly.</p><p>KEENE: Does tech need Wall Street?</p><p>DWYER: You do because you're raising capital. And again that's why I'm overweight the financials. It's those companies that provide the capital for these tech--</p><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p>DWYER: Companies--</p><p>JOHNSON: In spite of increase in regulatory environment?</p><p>0714</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0720</p><p>KEENE: Tony Dwyer of Canaccord Genuity, he's pushed it all aside. He sees higher stock prices founded simply on a good economy and better earnings. Yours is a simple calculus isn't it?</p><p>DWYER: It is. There's five thesis points through making many mistakes over my career.</p><p>KEENE: Give us one of them, we don't have time.</p><p>DWYER: I'm going to go real quick. The market correlates to the direction of earnings. So as long as the direction of earnings is positive, it's not whether you're a buyer, it's where you're a more aggressive buyer.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>DWYER: The second, that is driven, earnings are driven by economic activity. That's driven by the slope of the yield curve and availability money through lending--</p><p>KEENE: We're nowhere near recession.</p><p>DWYER: We're not even in a light year of it. So let's do this, inflation's been flat for the last four years. Fed funds has been flat for the last four years. Interest rates have been in a range for the last four years. So exactly why should we become negative if nothing fundamentally has changed?</p><p>Now prices have gone up, but not to the degree, given inflation, that should be considered worrisome in any way.</p><p>KEENE: Where does use of cash change here? All the geniuses are telling me share buyback is going to change and this, that and the other thing. I don't observe a change in use of cash.</p><p>DWYER: It's not even close. For example, corporate credit new issuance according to my buddy Brian Reynolds who's a guest here, the two days following the Labor Day holiday were like the 5th and 6th largest day of corporate credit new issuance ever. What that means is, companies are still taking in, not just earnings and retained income, but tremendous amount of cash to buy back stock.</p><p>FU: Mm-hmm.</p><p>DWYER: To shrink their share (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: And Scarlet that shows the confidence that has to be out there.</p><p>FU: The confidence and the need to take advantage of low rates while you can. FU: Mo Koyfman our guest host for the hour.</p><p>MO KOYFMAN, GENERAL PARTNER, SPARK CAPITAL: Yeah just a question on that because we tend to look up here when we look at these things. And I'm wondering down on the ground, because every time whether it was the mortgage crisis or anything else, it starts from the populous.</p><p>DWYER: Right.</p><p>KOYFMAN: What about earnings? Not by corporations but by, you know, the large, the masses in this country and how much of the spending power and the earnings being generated today is coming from leverage versus actual--</p><p>FU: Wages.</p><p>KOYFMAN: Real dollars, wages.</p><p>KEENE: This is a raging debate right now on wage growth.</p><p>KOYFMAN: Right.</p><p>DWYER: Wages are beginning to grow but let's think about an economic cycle. What creates a change in an economic cycle is Fed policy which Fed starts to tighten interest rates because wages and real growth is beginning to pick up. It's just taken four years to get there.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>DWYER: So we're still, even though duration we're not, but we're still early in the economic cycle because we're building those wage (inaudible).</p><p>KOYFMAN: That to me is the real question here, are we going to see the wage growth required to sustain this?</p><p>KEENE: Right. And Adam within this bimodal discussion of the haves and the have nots--</p><p>JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p>KEENE: The real question is can you have Dwyer's optimism with so many Americans struggling for that marginal wage growth?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well perhaps and Tony maybe you can speak to this. What we're really getting at is whether there has been enough de-leveraging at the personal level. Not the government, not corporations, but yes Mo at the personal level has there been enough de-leveraging to allow people to go out and spend again?</p><p>DWYER: I would say yes. Forget my opinion, let's look at the evidence. The evidence is in the last two months you've seen an acceleration on consumer loans. OK that's the first time this cycle. That is telling me that's de- leveraged.</p><p>JOHNSON: But has leverage come down enough that an acceleration in leveraging is actually good? Do you know what I mean?</p><p>DWYER: See I think all that data is skewed. If you're paying down credit cards it takes a lot of $2,500 payments to pay down. But if you throw the keys back to the bank and take a hit on a $400,000 house, that's going to change the leverage ratio.</p><p>So in other words it's being skewed by something that hasn't happened before which is so many people flipping their house back to the bank.</p><p>KEENE: One of the whispers here Scarlet was yesterday Oliver Chen at Citigroup saying they've been surprised how the first two weeks of September--</p><p>FU: On retail.</p><p>KEENE: Have been pretty good for retail.</p><p>FU: Well certainly at the high end that's been the case. For Wal-Mart, for Target, for some on the lower end, it's a bit of a struggle. So going on that, with this two speed America, the haves versus the have nots, are the obvious sector picks that you avoid staples and you go straight for the luxury retailers?</p><p>DWYER: No I think you actually; we're neutral on consumer discretionary as well. Again rates are poised to go up. That's going to begin to restrict credit. Today credit has been wide opened. People can buy money to buy things. And again I think it's important to remember so far it's the haves and the have nots. But all wages and aggregate hours worked, average hourly earnings, they're all beginning to pick up.</p><p>KEENE: I'll go with that. They're just starting to lift a little.</p><p>DWYER: And that's a good thing. That's a good thing.</p><p>KOYFMAN: But that's the thing we need to watch.</p><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah it is. We'll talk about haves and have nots.</p><p>0724</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0755</p><p>KEENE: Do you believe in a linkage of the markets into the mid-term election? Should we be a student of those elections?</p><p>DWYER: I'm a student of history and the elections are, if you asked anybody today, we've never seen this kind of disconnect between Congress and the president. It seems so unique right?</p><p>The Republicans impeached a sitting president during the greatest period for stock market advance in our history in the 1990s when they impeached Bill Clinton. People forget that because the internet wasn't around then so you can't Google it.</p><p>But basically this is what happens in mid-term elections. You get this developing story of how you're going to win the next presidential election. And it doesn't--</p><p>JOHNSON: Here's a stat for you, thanks to Dan Clifton Tom, Strategas Research Partners yesterday who noted that going back to 1918 in mid-term elections, the incumbent president has typically lost six seats in Congress.</p><p>KEENE: And this goes again Tony to pushing aside the walls of worry. You have been a resilient bull through this summer. We called it the summer of discontent. Dr. Bremmer will talk about this tomorrow.</p><p>DWYER: Well let's think about one of the best years in the stock market history, following 1995 was up 34% was 1996. Osama bin Laden came onto the stage. Russia was battling the Chechen rebels and Israel was attacking Hezbollah on the West Bank. So you had very similar geopolitical events. You had similar monetary events. It's just so similar.</p><p>FU: History repeating itself.</p><p>DWYER: It does.</p><p>0756</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0757</p><p>KEENE: Mo Koyfman thank you so much, greatly appreciate your attendance today.</p><p>KOYFMAN: Good to see you guys.</p><p>KEENE: See you in Uber. And Tony Dwyer, as always thank you. We'll see you at Dow 20,000.</p><p>DWYER: Thank you.</p><p>0757</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Did Apple deliver the  goods when it comes to equity investors? It's such a big part of major  benchmark indexes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TONY DWYER, EQUITY STRATEGIST, CANACCORD GENUITY: Well as Tom indicated, I  don't comment on individual stocks, however--</p><p> TOM KEENE, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Well make an exception here, come  on.</p><p> ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Come on, it's Apple.</p><p> DWYER: It's a famous but, our analyst, Mike Walkley, did put out a comment  this morning that he thought, he's higher than the Street in his estimates.  He thought it was fine. We've got a buy rating and a $112 target on the  stock.</p><p> JOHNSON: Well as a matter of fact a number of strategists, I think of the  team over at Strategas, I think of the team from Wells Fargo, pointing out  that big cap technology, big boring Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, it's back.  That's where the action is. Do you agree with that?</p><p> DWYER: I do, I do. We are overweight information technology. Anything  really related to capital spending the companies and the financials that  support that. That provide that capital, create that capital and lend the  money for it. I think that's the place to be.</p><p> 0708</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 0709</p><p> KEENE: Let's bring it over to Tony Dwyer. You're going to be watching three  iWatches for Christmas by the way. I can see it coming Dwyer.</p><p> DWYER: Four, I'll even include my wife on that.</p><p> KEENE: Four iWatches for Christmas. When you look at a trillion dollar  company, that's a commitment to your bull market isn't it? Can you  extrapolate out to Dow 20,000?</p><p> DWYER: Until you shut down credit, it is a levered society. Until you shut  down the ability of the people at this table and people that are watching  and listening to get credit the economy will move forward. And what we  found historically, through making a lot of mistakes is, as long as  earnings are higher, the market is higher.</p><p> KEENE: And Dwyer children just remember, Uncle Tom says the iWatch for  Christmas, look for that.</p><p> FU: The green band, no less. All right Tony Dwyer of Canaccord Genuity and  of course Mo Koyfman of Spark Capital.</p><p> 0710</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 0714</p><p> KEENE: Tony please?</p><p> DWYER: You want to be careful also. You know you hear a lot of \"it's a  bubble\" because some of these big tech stocks are coming out at better  valuation. Twitter, things like that--</p><p> JOHNSON: You mean like 14 times sales.</p><p> DWYER: Yeah like crazy stuff. Remember that Netscape was the initial  internet company that came out in 1995. And that was doubled in price the  day before and then it was, it went up to I think it doubled in actual  price once it traded.</p><p> KEENE: Yeah. You're the Wall Street guy here, this is an ecumenical  offering. There's like 47 firms involved with Alibaba. Does Mo Koyfman's  world need your world?</p><p> DWYER: Clearly.</p><p> KEENE: Does tech need Wall Street?</p><p> DWYER: You do because you're raising capital. And again that's why I'm  overweight the financials. It's those companies that provide the capital  for these tech--</p><p> KEENE: OK.</p><p> DWYER: Companies--</p><p> JOHNSON: In spite of increase in regulatory environment?</p><p> 0714</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 0720</p><p> KEENE: Tony Dwyer of Canaccord Genuity, he's pushed it all aside. He sees  higher stock prices founded simply on a good economy and better earnings.  Yours is a simple calculus isn't it?</p><p> DWYER: It is. There's five thesis points through making many mistakes over  my career.</p><p> KEENE: Give us one of them, we don't have time.</p><p> DWYER: I'm going to go real quick. The market correlates to the direction  of earnings. So as long as the direction of earnings is positive, it's not  whether you're a buyer, it's where you're a more aggressive buyer.</p><p> KEENE: Right.</p><p> DWYER: The second, that is driven, earnings are driven by economic  activity. That's driven by the slope of the yield curve and availability  money through lending--</p><p> KEENE: We're nowhere near recession.</p><p> DWYER: We're not even in a light year of it. So let's do this, inflation's  been flat for the last four years. Fed funds has been flat for the last  four years. Interest rates have been in a range for the last four years. So  exactly why should we become negative if nothing fundamentally has changed?</p><p> Now prices have gone up, but not to the degree, given inflation, that  should be considered worrisome in any way.</p><p> KEENE: Where does use of cash change here? All the geniuses are telling me  share buyback is going to change and this, that and the other thing. I  don't observe a change in use of cash.</p><p> DWYER: It's not even close. For example, corporate credit new issuance  according to my buddy Brian Reynolds who's a guest here, the two days  following the Labor Day holiday were like the 5th and 6th largest day of  corporate credit new issuance ever. What that means is, companies are still  taking in, not just earnings and retained income, but tremendous amount of  cash to buy back stock.</p><p> FU: Mm-hmm.</p><p> DWYER: To shrink their share (inaudible).</p><p> KEENE: And Scarlet that shows the confidence that has to be out there.</p><p> FU: The confidence and the need to take advantage of low rates while you  can. FU: Mo Koyfman our guest host for the hour. </p><p> MO KOYFMAN, GENERAL PARTNER, SPARK CAPITAL: Yeah just a question on that  because we tend to look up here when we look at these things. And I'm  wondering down on the ground, because every time whether it was the  mortgage crisis or anything else, it starts from the populous.</p><p> DWYER: Right.</p><p> KOYFMAN: What about earnings? Not by corporations but by, you know, the  large, the masses in this country and how much of the spending power and  the earnings being generated today is coming from leverage versus actual--</p><p> FU: Wages.</p><p> KOYFMAN: Real dollars, wages.</p><p> KEENE: This is a raging debate right now on wage growth.</p><p> KOYFMAN: Right.</p><p> DWYER: Wages are beginning to grow but let's think about an economic cycle.  What creates a change in an economic cycle is Fed policy which Fed starts  to tighten interest rates because wages and real growth is beginning to  pick up. It's just taken four years to get there.</p><p> KEENE: Right.</p><p> DWYER: So we're still, even though duration we're not, but we're still  early in the economic cycle because we're building those wage (inaudible).</p><p> KOYFMAN: That to me is the real question here, are we going to see the wage  growth required to sustain this?</p><p> KEENE: Right. And Adam within this bimodal discussion of the haves and the  have nots--</p><p> JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p> KEENE: The real question is can you have Dwyer's optimism with so many  Americans struggling for that marginal wage growth?</p><p> JOHNSON: Well perhaps and Tony maybe you can speak to this. What we're  really getting at is whether there has been enough de-leveraging at the  personal level. Not the government, not corporations, but yes Mo at the  personal level has there been enough de-leveraging to allow people to go  out and spend again?</p><p> DWYER: I would say yes. Forget my opinion, let's look at the evidence. The  evidence is in the last two months you've seen an acceleration on consumer  loans. OK that's the first time this cycle. That is telling me that's de- leveraged.</p><p> JOHNSON: But has leverage come down enough that an acceleration in  leveraging is actually good? Do you know what I mean?</p><p> DWYER: See I think all that data is skewed. If you're paying down credit  cards it takes a lot of $2,500 payments to pay down. But if you throw the  keys back to the bank and take a hit on a $400,000 house, that's going to  change the leverage ratio.</p><p> So in other words it's being skewed by something that hasn't happened  before which is so many people flipping their house back to the bank.</p><p> KEENE: One of the whispers here Scarlet was yesterday Oliver Chen at  Citigroup saying they've been surprised how the first two weeks of  September--</p><p> FU: On retail.</p><p> KEENE: Have been pretty good for retail.</p><p> FU: Well certainly at the high end that's been the case. For Wal-Mart, for  Target, for some on the lower end, it's a bit of a struggle. So going on  that, with this two speed America, the haves versus the have nots, are the  obvious sector picks that you avoid staples and you go straight for the  luxury retailers?</p><p> DWYER: No I think you actually; we're neutral on consumer discretionary as  well. Again rates are poised to go up. That's going to begin to restrict  credit. Today credit has been wide opened. People can buy money to buy  things. And again I think it's important to remember so far it's the haves  and the have nots. But all wages and aggregate hours worked, average hourly  earnings, they're all beginning to pick up.</p><p> KEENE: I'll go with that. They're just starting to lift a little.</p><p> DWYER: And that's a good thing. That's a good thing.</p><p> KOYFMAN: But that's the thing we need to watch.</p><p> KEENE: OK.</p><p> JOHNSON: Yeah it is. We'll talk about haves and have nots.</p><p> 0724</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 0755</p><p> KEENE: Do you believe in a linkage of the markets into the mid-term  election? Should we be a student of those elections?</p><p> DWYER: I'm a student of history and the elections are, if you asked anybody  today, we've never seen this kind of disconnect between Congress and the  president. It seems so unique right?</p><p> The Republicans impeached a sitting president during the greatest period  for stock market advance in our history in the 1990s when they impeached  Bill Clinton. People forget that because the internet wasn't around then so  you can't Google it.</p><p> But basically this is what happens in mid-term elections. You get this  developing story of how you're going to win the next presidential election.  And it doesn't--</p><p> JOHNSON: Here's a stat for you, thanks to Dan Clifton Tom, Strategas  Research Partners yesterday who noted that going back to 1918 in mid-term  elections, the incumbent president has typically lost six seats in  Congress.</p><p> KEENE: And this goes again Tony to pushing aside the walls of worry. You  have been a resilient bull through this summer. We called it the summer of  discontent. Dr. Bremmer will talk about this tomorrow.</p><p> DWYER: Well let's think about one of the best years in the stock market  history, following 1995 was up 34% was 1996. Osama bin Laden came onto the  stage. Russia was battling the Chechen rebels and Israel was attacking  Hezbollah on the West Bank. So you had very similar geopolitical events.  You had similar monetary events. It's just so similar.</p><p> FU: History repeating itself.</p><p> DWYER: It does.</p><p> 0756</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 0757</p><p> KEENE: Mo Koyfman thank you so much, greatly appreciate your attendance  today.</p><p> KOYFMAN: Good to see you guys. </p><p> KEENE: See you in Uber. And Tony Dwyer, as always thank you. We'll see you  at Dow 20,000.</p><p> DWYER: Thank you.</p><p> 0757</p><p>  [*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Twitter, things like that--</p><p>JOHNSON: You mean like 14 times sales.</p><p>DWYER: Yeah like crazy stuff. Remember that Netscape was the initial  internet company that came out in 1995. And that was doubled in price the  day before and then it was, it went up to I think it doubled in actual  price once it traded.</p><p>KEENE: Yeah. You're the Wall Street guy here, this is an ecumenical  offering. There's like 47 firms involved with Alibaba. Does Mo Koyfman's  world need your world?</p><p>DWYER: Clearly.</p><p>KEENE: Does tech need Wall Street?</p><p>DWYER: You do because you're raising capital. And again that's why I'm  overweight the financials. It's those companies that provide the capital  for these tech--</p><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p>DWYER: Companies--</p><p>JOHNSON: In spite of increase in regulatory environment?</p><p>0714</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0720</p><p>KEENE: Tony Dwyer of Canaccord Genuity, he's pushed it all aside. He sees  higher stock prices founded simply on a good economy and better earnings.  Yours is a simple calculus isn't it?</p><p>DWYER: It is. There's five thesis points through making many mistakes over  my career.</p><p>KEENE: Give us one of them, we don't have time.</p><p>DWYER: I'm going to go real quick. The market correlates to the direction  of earnings. So as long as the direction of earnings is positive, it's not  whether you're a buyer, it's where you're a more aggressive buyer.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>DWYER: The second, that is driven, earnings are driven by economic  activity. That's driven by the slope of the yield curve and availability  money through lending--</p><p>KEENE: We're nowhere near recession.</p><p>DWYER: We're not even in a light year of it. So let's do this, inflation's  been flat for the last four years. Fed funds has been flat for the last  four years. Interest rates have been in a range for the last four years. So  exactly why should we become negative if nothing fundamentally has changed?</p><p>Now prices have gone up, but not to the degree, given inflation, that  should be considered worrisome in any way.</p><p>KEENE: Where does use of cash change here? All the geniuses are telling me  share buyback is going to change and this, that and the other thing. I  don't observe a change in use of cash.</p><p>DWYER: It's not even close. For example, corporate credit new issuance  according to my buddy Brian Reynolds who's a guest here, the two days  following the Labor Day holiday were like the 5th and 6th largest day of  corporate credit new issuance ever. What that means is, companies are still  taking in, not just earnings and retained income, but tremendous amount of  cash to buy back stock.</p><p>FU: Mm-hmm.</p><p>DWYER: To shrink their share (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: And Scarlet that shows the confidence that has to be out there.</p><p>FU: The confidence and the need to take advantage of low rates while you  can. FU: Mo Koyfman our guest host for the hour. </p><p>MO KOYFMAN, GENERAL PARTNER, SPARK CAPITAL: Yeah just a question on that  because we tend to look up here when we look at these things. And I'm  wondering down on the ground, because every time whether it was the  mortgage crisis or anything else, it starts from the populous.</p><p>DWYER: Right.</p><p>KOYFMAN: What about earnings? Not by corporations but by, you know, the  large, the masses in this country and how much of the spending power and  the earnings being generated today is coming from leverage versus actual--</p><p>FU: Wages.</p><p>KOYFMAN: Real dollars, wages.</p><p>KEENE: This is a raging debate right now on wage growth.</p><p>KOYFMAN: Right.</p><p>DWYER: Wages are beginning to grow but let's think about an economic cycle.  What creates a change in an economic cycle is Fed policy which Fed starts  to tighten interest rates because wages and real growth is beginning to  pick up. It's just taken four years to get there.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>DWYER: So we're still, even though duration we're not, but we're still  early in the economic cycle because we're building those wage (inaudible).</p><p>KOYFMAN: That to me is the real question here, are we going to see the wage  growth required to sustain this?</p><p>KEENE: Right. And Adam within this bimodal discussion of the haves and the  have nots--</p><p>JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p>KEENE: The real question is can you have Dwyer's optimism with so many  Americans struggling for that marginal wage growth?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well perhaps and Tony maybe you can speak to this. What we're  really getting at is whether there has been enough de-leveraging at the  personal level. Not the government, not corporations, but yes Mo at the  personal level has there been enough de-leveraging to allow people to go  out and spend again?</p><p>DWYER: I would say yes. Forget my opinion, let's look at the evidence. The  evidence is in the last two months you've seen an acceleration on consumer  loans. OK that's the first time this cycle. That is telling me that's de- leveraged.</p><p>JOHNSON: But has leverage come down enough that an acceleration in  leveraging is actually good? Do you know what I mean?</p><p>DWYER: See I think all that data is skewed. If you're paying down credit  cards it takes a lot of $2,500 payments to pay down. But if you throw the  keys back to the bank and take a hit on a $400,000 house, that's going to  change the leverage ratio.</p><p>So in other words it's being skewed by something that hasn't happened  before which is so many people flipping their house back to the bank.</p><p>KEENE: One of the whispers here Scarlet was yesterday Oliver Chen at  Citigroup saying they've been surprised how the first two weeks of  September--</p><p>FU: On retail.</p><p>KEENE: Have been pretty good for retail.</p><p>FU: Well certainly at the high end that's been the case. For Wal-Mart, for  Target, for some on the lower end, it's a bit of a struggle. So going on  that, with this two speed America, the haves versus the have nots, are the  obvious sector picks that you avoid staples and you go straight for the  luxury retailers?</p><p>DWYER: No I think you actually; we're neutral on consumer discretionary as  well. Again rates are poised to go up. That's going to begin to restrict  credit. Today credit has been wide opened. People can buy money to buy  things. And again I think it's important to remember so far it's the haves  and the have nots. But all wages and aggregate hours worked, average hourly  earnings, they're all beginning to pick up.</p><p>KEENE: I'll go with that. They're just starting to lift a little.</p><p>DWYER: And that's a good thing. That's a good thing.</p><p>KOYFMAN: But that's the thing we need to watch.</p><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah it is. We'll talk about haves and have nots.</p><p>0724</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0755</p><p>KEENE: Do you believe in a linkage of the markets into the mid-term  election? Should we be a student of those elections?</p><p>DWYER: I'm a student of history and the elections are, if you asked anybody  today, we've never seen this kind of disconnect between Congress and the  president. It seems so unique right?</p><p>The Republicans impeached a sitting president during the greatest period  for stock market advance in our history in the 1990s when they impeached  Bill Clinton. People forget that because the internet wasn't around then so  you can't Google it.</p><p>But basically this is what happens in mid-term elections. You get this  developing story of how you're going to win the next presidential election.  And it doesn't--</p><p>JOHNSON: Here's a stat for you, thanks to Dan Clifton Tom, Strategas  Research Partners yesterday who noted that going back to 1918 in mid-term  elections, the incumbent president has typically lost six seats in  Congress.</p><p>KEENE: And this goes again Tony to pushing aside the walls of worry. You  have been a resilient bull through this summer. We called it the summer of  discontent. Dr. Bremmer will talk about this tomorrow.</p><p>DWYER: Well let's think about one of the best years in the stock market  history, following 1995 was up 34% was 1996. Osama bin Laden came onto the  stage. Russia was battling the Chechen rebels and Israel was attacking  Hezbollah on the West Bank. So you had very similar geopolitical events.  You had similar monetary events. It's just so similar.</p><p>FU: History repeating itself.</p><p>DWYER: It does.</p><p>0756</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0757</p><p>KEENE: Mo Koyfman thank you so much, greatly appreciate your attendance  today.</p><p>KOYFMAN: Good to see you guys. </p><p>KEENE: See you in Uber. And Tony Dwyer, as always thank you. We'll see you  at Dow 20,000.</p><p>DWYER: Thank you.</p><p>0757</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Did Apple deliver the goods when it comes to equity investors? It's such a big part of major benchmark indexes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TONY DWYER, EQUITY STRATEGIST, CANACCORD GENUITY: Well as Tom indicated, I don't comment on individual stocks, however--</p><p>TOM KEENE, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Well make an exception here, come on.</p><p>ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Come on, it's Apple.</p><p>DWYER: It's a famous but, our analyst, Mike Walkley, did put out a comment this morning that he thought, he's higher than the Street in his estimates. He thought it was fine. We've got a buy rating and a $112 target on the stock.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well as a matter of fact a number of strategists, I think of the team over at Strategas, I think of the team from Wells Fargo, pointing out that big cap technology, big boring Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, it's back. That's where the action is. Do you agree with that?</p><p>DWYER: I do, I do. We are overweight information technology. Anything really related to capital spending the companies and the financials that support that. That provide that capital, create that capital and lend the money for it. I think that's the place to be.</p><p>0708</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0709</p><p>KEENE: Let's bring it over to Tony Dwyer. You're going to be watching three iWatches for Christmas by the way. I can see it coming Dwyer.</p><p>DWYER: Four, I'll even include my wife on that.</p><p>KEENE: Four iWatches for Christmas. When you look at a trillion dollar company, that's a commitment to your bull market isn't it? Can you extrapolate out to Dow 20,000?</p><p>DWYER: Until you shut down credit, it is a levered society. Until you shut down the ability of the people at this table and people that are watching and listening to get credit the economy will move forward. And what we found historically, through making a lot of mistakes is, as long as earnings are higher, the market is higher.</p><p>KEENE: And Dwyer children just remember, Uncle Tom says the iWatch for Christmas, look for that.</p><p>FU: The green band, no less.

So exactly why should we become negative if nothing fundamentally has changed?</p><p>Now prices have gone up, but not to the degree, given inflation, that should be considered worrisome in any way.</p><p>KEENE: Where does use of cash change here? All the geniuses are telling me share buyback is going to change and this, that and the other thing. I don't observe a change in use of cash.</p><p>DWYER: It's not even close. For example, corporate credit new issuance according to my buddy Brian Reynolds who's a guest here, the two days following the Labor Day holiday were like the 5th and 6th largest day of corporate credit new issuance ever. What that means is, companies are still taking in, not just earnings and retained income, but tremendous amount of cash to buy back stock.</p><p>FU: Mm-hmm.</p><p>DWYER: To shrink their share (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: And Scarlet that shows the confidence that has to be out there.</p><p>FU: The confidence and the need to take advantage of low rates while you can. FU: Mo Koyfman our guest host for the hour.</p><p>MO KOYFMAN, GENERAL PARTNER, SPARK CAPITAL: Yeah just a question on that because we tend to look up here when we look at these things. And I'm wondering down on the ground, because every time whether it was the mortgage crisis or anything else, it starts from the populous.</p><p>DWYER: Right.</p><p>KOYFMAN: What about earnings? Not by corporations but by, you know, the large, the masses in this country and how much of the spending power and the earnings being generated today is coming from leverage versus actual--</p><p>FU: Wages.</p><p>KOYFMAN: Real dollars, wages.</p><p>KEENE: This is a raging debate right now on wage growth.</p><p>KOYFMAN: Right.</p><p>DWYER: Wages are beginning to grow but let's think about an economic cycle. What creates a change in an economic cycle is Fed policy which Fed starts to tighten interest rates because wages and real growth is beginning to pick up. It's just taken four years to get there.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>DWYER: So we're still, even though duration we're not, but we're still early in the economic cycle because we're building those wage (inaudible).</p><p>KOYFMAN: That to me is the real question here, are we going to see the wage growth required to sustain this?</p><p>KEENE: Right. And Adam within this bimodal discussion of the haves and the have nots--</p><p>JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p>KEENE: The real question is can you have Dwyer's optimism with so many Americans struggling for that marginal wage growth?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well perhaps and Tony maybe you can speak to this. What we're really getting at is whether there has been enough de-leveraging at the personal level. Not the government, not corporations, but yes Mo at the personal level has there been enough de-leveraging to allow people to go out and spend again?</p><p>DWYER: I would say yes. Forget my opinion, let's look at the evidence. The evidence is in the last two months you've seen an acceleration on consumer loans. OK that's the first time this cycle. That is telling me that's de- leveraged.</p><p>JOHNSON: But has leverage come down enough that an acceleration in leveraging is actually good? Do you know what I mean?</p><p>DWYER: See I think all that data is skewed. If you're paying down credit cards it takes a lot of $2,500 payments to pay down. But if you throw the keys back to the bank and take a hit on a $400,000 house, that's going to change the leverage ratio.</p><p>So in other words it's being skewed by something that hasn't happened before which is so many people flipping their house back to the bank.</p><p>KEENE: One of the whispers here Scarlet was yesterday Oliver Chen at Citigroup saying they've been surprised how the first two weeks of September--</p><p>FU: On retail.</p><p>KEENE: Have been pretty good for retail.</p><p>FU: Well certainly at the high end that's been the case. For Wal-Mart, for Target, for some on the lower end, it's a bit of a struggle. So going on that, with this two speed America, the haves versus the have nots, are the obvious sector picks that you avoid staples and you go straight for the luxury retailers?</p><p>DWYER: No I think you actually; we're neutral on consumer discretionary as well. Again rates are poised to go up. That's going to begin to restrict credit. Today credit has been wide opened. People can buy money to buy things. And again I think it's important to remember so far it's the haves and the have nots. But all wages and aggregate hours worked, average hourly earnings, they're all beginning to pick up.</p><p>KEENE: I'll go with that. They're just starting to lift a little.</p><p>DWYER: And that's a good thing. That's a good thing.</p><p>KOYFMAN: But that's the thing we need to watch.</p><p>KEENE: OK.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah it is. We'll talk about haves and have nots.</p><p>0724</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0755</p><p>KEENE: Do you believe in a linkage of the markets into the mid-term election? Should we be a student of those elections?</p><p>DWYER: I'm a student of history and the elections are, if you asked anybody today, we've never seen this kind of disconnect between Congress and the president. It seems so unique right?</p><p>The Republicans impeached a sitting president during the greatest period for stock market advance in our history in the 1990s when they impeached Bill Clinton. People forget that because the internet wasn't around then so you can't Google it.</p><p>But basically this is what happens in mid-term elections. You get this developing story of how you're going to win the next presidential election. And it doesn't--</p><p>JOHNSON: Here's a stat for you, thanks to Dan Clifton Tom, Strategas Research Partners yesterday who noted that going back to 1918 in mid-term elections, the incumbent president has typically lost six seats in Congress.</p><p>KEENE: And this goes again Tony to pushing aside the walls of worry. You have been a resilient bull through this summer. We called it the summer of discontent. Dr. Bremmer will talk about this tomorrow.</p><p>DWYER: Well let's think about one of the best years in the stock market history, following 1995 was up 34% was 1996. Osama bin Laden came onto the stage. Russia was battling the Chechen rebels and Israel was attacking Hezbollah on the West Bank. So you had very similar geopolitical events. You had similar monetary events. It's just so similar.</p><p>FU: History repeating itself.</p><p>DWYER: It does.</p><p>0756</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0757</p><p>KEENE: Mo Koyfman thank you so much, greatly appreciate your attendance today.</p><p>KOYFMAN: Good to see you guys.</p><p>KEENE: See you in Uber. And Tony Dwyer, as always thank you. We'll see you at Dow 20,000.</p><p>DWYER: Thank you.</p><p>0757</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

(Canadian officials said they warned the EU exactly this would happen if they embarked on the TTIP deal simultaneously with Ceta, but were ignored.)</p><p>These days the EU and Canada are united in creating alternatives, where necessary, to US trade policy. If you\u2019re tired of the aggressive unilateralism and corporate power that dominates American trade policy, Brussels and Ottawa probably have something more transparent and multilateral for you. Behold the emergent transatlantic Axis of Nice.</p><p>To begin with, the two proposed a multilateral <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-be/knowledge/publications/e17ef991/the-eus-proposed-reform-of-isds\"> Investment Court System (ICS)</url>, intended as a more transparent and accountable alternative to most current investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) arrangements, and rewrote the investment dispute mechanism in Ceta as a model. This helped defang opposition to Ceta within Europe, which was largely based on dislike of ISDS. As it happens, Ceta       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20190723-french-parliament-approves-controversial-eu-canada-trade-deal-ceta\"> was passed</url> by the French Assembl\u00e9e Nationale this week \u2014 admittedly only by a narrow majority, but something of a miracle given where the deal was a few years ago.</p><p>Now, on a somewhat similar principle, the EU and Canada are pioneering a workaround to the US block on appointing judges to the WTO appellate body (AB). On Thursday they unveiled the <url normalizedValue=\"http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=2053\"> ad hoc solution</url> on which they have been working for some time, creating a shadow AB to rule on future cases between the two using retired AB judges. (One such judge, Jennifer Hillman, who was pulled off the AB by the US government because they didn\u2019t like the way she was voting, enthusiastically       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/J_A_Hillman/status/1154517568419352577\"> tweeted</url> on Thursday night she would be happy to serve.) Brussels and Ottawa have issued a standing invitation to other governments to participate, but decline to be drawn on exactly where those conversations have got to.</p><p>The way that the EU and Canada have gone at the appellate body initiative is quite subtle, and has some echoes of its approach to ICS. Rather than provoking the US by trying to override it, they are attempting to create an alternative from the bottom up by signing a deal between themselves and then politely inviting others to join them.</p><p>But getting an agreement between two like-minded advanced economies, which in any case have not exactly spent the past few decades locked in angry litigation with each other, does not automatically create a system capable of binding in a large and diverse collection of countries. The US remains a very powerful pole of orientation for trade policy, and the risk of being seen to contradict or anger Washington is considerable.</p><p>The experience of ICS so far shows that progress in altering a system in this way may be diplomatic but it is also painfully slow. The obvious immediate targets for ICS and the new AB system are other like-minded countries with an attachment to multilateralism, such as Japan. But on investment matters, Japan retains its preference for old-school ISDS.</p><p>Still, at least other governments can see that there is now a constructive alternative to letting the US do what it wants. And at least Canada has clearly signalled that in policy terms it is prepared to distance itself considerably from the American camp.</p><p>One more point. The European/Canadian spirit of co-operation does not mean the two countries have become a soft touch. The EU continues to signal a hard line against the extravagant demands of Boris Johnson\u2019s new government in the UK, and Canada has also taken a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-uk-trade-boris-wednesday-1.5221984\"> pretty hard-nosed approach</url> to British requests automatically to replicate the concessions of Ceta with the UK in case of a no-deal Brexit. That\u2019s the thing with Axes of Nice. They\u2019re only pleasant till you annoy them.</p><p>Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit tactics</p><p>So, Boris Johnson is UK prime minister. It doesn\u2019t get any less odd, however many times you write it.</p><p>Any idea that he was going to drop his carelessness with facts and his bombastic attitude to Brexit negotiations was swiftly dispelled within 24 hours. On Thursday Johnson repeated the figure of \u00a339bn that the UK owes the EU and could get back if it leaves without a deal. (Because the UK delayed Brexit from March to October, it is actually now <url normalizedValue=\"https://infacts.org/no-johnson-we-wont-have-39bn-if-we-crash-out/?preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=12134\"> about \u00a333bn</url>, and the money is due whichever way the UK leaves the EU.)</p><p>As for avoiding a no-deal Brexit, Johnson insisted any deal with the EU would have to involve dropping the Irish backstop, an absolute non-starter. It could be that he is playing an immensely cunning game of getting the trust of all the hardline Brexiters in his government before completely betraying them. To be fair, if anyone could manage that, it would be Johnson. His defining characteristics, apart from the life-long pantomime act often wrongly described as clowning, are vagueness and caprice and a willingness to renege completely on promises. Many Remainers secretly hoped he would become prime minister instead of Theresa May in 2016. He was the one PM who might have had the chutzpah to bounce the Tory party into a soft Brexit or even to Remain.</p><p>But even Johnson might struggle to effect a gigantic U-turn in violation of a firm pledge he made in his first day in the job. Rather more probable is that he is setting the negotiations with the EU up for failure and most likely a general election.</p><p>In reply</p><p>The move by Ottawa and Brussels has been billed as a temporary exercise \u2014 to serve as a band-aid until WTO reform can finally be settled, the appellate body mended and restored, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">writes Free Trade co-author <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Politi</emphasis></emphasis>. But that process could well take years, and one can easily see this kind of arbitration becoming a more permanent feature of the global trading system, at least for those countries that still believe there should be some independent adjudication of trade disputes. <br/></p><p>As for Washington\u2019s response, it is unlikely to put much pressure on Robert Lighthizer to reach a compromise. In fact, his answer might amount to a version of \u201clet em have it\u201d. Not only has Mr Lighthizer been deeply sceptical of the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system, but he dislikes any form of international arbitration that might deliver a ruling, especially a binding ruling, on US policies.

The Report examines the potential benefits of Big Tech presence in financial services, as well as the risks and regulatory implications it entails.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech's Expansion Into Financial Services</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The BIS observes that the activities of Big Tech companies in finance are a subset of broader financial technologies (\"Fintech\") innovation. While Fintech companies are set up to operate primarily in financial services, Big Tech companies offer financial services as part of a large set of activities. The Report notes that their entry into finance reflects strong complementarities between financial services and their core non-financial activities.</p><p>An essential by-product of tech companies' business is the large stock of user data, which they use as input to offer a wide range of services that generate further user activity and yet more data. Building on the advantages of this \"data-network-activities loop\", Big Tech companies have ventured into financial services including payments, lending, insurance and money management (see for example Facebook's recent  Project Libra). As illustrated by the Report, financial services represent only about 11% of Big Tech's revenues, as its core businesses remain focused on information technology and consulting. Nonetheless, given their size and customer reach, the BIS conceives that large tech companies' entry into finance has the potential to spark rapid change in the industry.</p><p>As noted in the Report, Big Tech's move into financial services has been most extensive in Southeast Asia and other emerging market economies (\"EMEs\"). Payments were the first financial service large tech companies offered, mainly to help overcome the lack of trust between buyers and sellers on e-commerce platforms. Services like PayPal and Alipay are fully integrated into existing e-commerce platforms. Big Tech payment platforms currently fall under two distinct types:</p><p> Overlay systems, which rely on existing third-party infrastructures, such as credit card or retail payment systems; andProprietary systems, where payments are entirely processed and settled on a system proprietary to the tech company.</p><p>The Report's findings suggest that overlay systems are used more commonly in advanced economies, as credit cards were already ubiquitous there by the time e-commerce companies came to prominence. Proprietary systems are more prevalent in economies where the penetration of other cashless means of payment is lower.</p><p>Expanding upon their e-commerce platforms, some Big Tech companies have ventured into lending, mainly to small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers. Loans offered are mainly credit lines and small loans with short maturity. The Report points out that Big Tech credit provision has made its most significant advances in EMEs, where a considerable proportion of the population remains unbanked. The BIS recognizes that, despite its substantial recent growth, Fintech credit (including Big Tech) still constitutes a very small proportion of overall credit.</p><p>Potential Benefits of Big Tech Presence in Finance</p><p>Data analytics, network externalities and interwoven activities are key features of Big Tech companies' business models. According to the Report, those features could lower barriers to provision of financial services by reducing information and transaction costs, and thereby enhance financial inclusion.</p><p>To limit losses in cases of default, banks monitor borrowers' business activities or require collateral, which can be costly. Large tech companies' access to and reliance on big data can reduce the costs relating to monitoring activities and the taking of security over collateral, and improve the efficiency of providing financial services.</p><p>In the case of credit assessment, information costs can sometimes be so prohibitive that banks refrain from offering services to borrowers who, in some cases, lack basic documentation like audited financial statements. The Report suggests that, by taking advantage of information relevant for credit quality assessment available through their digital platforms, Big Tech companies could serve enterprises that would otherwise remain unbanked. Recent BIS research also indicates that tech companies' credit scoring, when applied to small vendors, outperforms models based on traditional credit bureau ratings, but it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions.</p><p>The Report summarizes Big Tech and banks' competitive advantages and disadvantages as follows:</p><p>Big Tech companies have access to data on a large number of users and have access to technology built to collect and merge such data, while banks have data on a smaller number of users and are occasionally hampered by legacy IT systems they use to process their data. On the other hand, banks have more verifiable customer data and have access to longer data history;Big Tech companies enjoy significant network externalities due to the broad set of non-financial activities they engage in, while banks are subject to strict regulatory limits on the activities they carry out as well as the use of the data at their disposal; andBig Tech companies can provide services at lower marginal costs to a larger number of users, but are limited in funding sources and risk management expertise compared to traditional financial institutions.</p><p>Risks and Implications on Financial Regulation</p><p>The BIS signals that Big Tech's expansion into financial services provision raises various competition risks, as platforms that will have consolidated their dominant position could raise entry barriers into the sector by increasing user switching costs, hence excluding potential competitors. Another risk is tech companies' potential anticompetitive use of data, which gives rise to \"digital monopolies\". Big Tech companies could engage in price discrimination and use their data not only to assess a potential borrower's creditworthiness, but to also identify the highest rate the borrower would be willing to pay for a loan. User data review could also lead to the exclusion of high-risk groups from credit and insurance markets.</p><p>The Report advocates that Big Tech's activity in finance warrants a more comprehensive approach that encompasses not only financial regulation but also competition and data privacy concerns. The Report advocates for a functional approach to financial regulation (\"same activity, same regulation\"), noting that \"if big techs engage in activities that are effectively identical to those performed by banks, then such activities should be subject to banking rules.\"</p><p>The BIS also suggests that new regulation may also be necessary where Big Tech's activities have resulted in significant structural changes that take them outside the scope of existing financial regulation. In addition, regulators ought to examine to what extent they should encourage new entry of Big Tech companies into financial services and how user data should be treated in light of property rights.</p><p>As policy choices in connection with the entry of Big Tech in financial services involve decisions by various financial regulators, competition authorities and data protection authorities, effective achievement of regulatory objectives will be challenging. The Report envisions that coordination among different regulatory authorities, at both the national and international level, will be essential to avoid conflicting actions and regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>To view the original article click here</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The culprit: Redpath sugar factory, surrounded by signs of decay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet, has big plans to turn the waterfront into a hi-tech community embedded with sensors, with the first homes appearing in 2023. Building on former Google boss Eric Schmidt's dream of creating a town \"built from the internet up\", Sidewalk Labs promises to \"reimagine cities to improve the quality of life\". As idyllic as that sounds, it has caused a rift.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It starts here,\" says Thorben Wieditz, pointing toward a flattened plot of land that pokes out from under a flyover. \"But we found out that they are buying up all the land over there too\" - he turns, gesturing to a peninsula littered with industrial buildings. The scene is unremarkable. But within Wieditz's gaze is one of the most controversial plots of land in the western world and the latest example of an anti-Silicon Valley \"techlash\".</p><p>Opposition to Sidewalk Labs could be compared to this year's assault on Amazon, which forced it to pull out of a $5bn (\u00a33.9bn) New York development that could have brought 25,000 jobs to the city.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs, however, is not just another operational hub into which Google will move employees. It is a lab experiment to see what happens when it measures the exact movement, whims and desires of its population to shape services around them, in the hope that it could recreate the effect in different cities around the world.</p><p>Under Google, East Bayfront will take on four different layers. The first is an underground network with foliage hydration and automated replenishment for supplies, plus traffic sensors. On the surface level are smart roads that can tell cars to automatically yield to pedestrians and cyclists. Then there are smart buildings, health services, parks and shops. On top is a virtual layer of connectivity, data pulled from sensors connecting to residents' phones, wearables, vehicles and, of course, Google itself.</p><p>Everything will be measured for maximum efficiency, even a \"digitally enabled smart chute system\" that offers pay-as-you-throw services that can sort recyclable materials in homes shared by several families. Google will own this data, but city officials can access it through an app.</p><p>The transport system will, of course, be super smart: filled with driverless cars ferrying happy inhabitants to and from the shops to their homes. Or so Sidewalk Labs states. While it is hard to argue that cash-strapped public services would not benefit from the help of a company with annual revenues of $137bn, there are concerns that it will transform the role of public and private companies in a way that might ultimately harm the population.</p><p>As Dr Julie Powles of New York University School of Law argues in her paper \"Urbanism under Google\": \"If there is more demand (measured by those placing the most orders) for instant drone delivery than for a walk to the corner shop, retail will succumb.\"</p><p>But ambiguity around Sidewalk's agency in this \"digital layer\" has undermined confidence that it will be in the public interest.</p><p>How did we get to this stage? Alphabet's rich property portfolio puts it in a good position to find the perfect plot. It needed the right space, adequate transport links and absent regulation so it can forge ahead with its plans. A stretch of derelict land just a short walk from financial and \"entertainment\" district in Toronto, not restricted by data privacy laws like those in Europe or California, was just the ticket.</p><p>It partnered with Waterfront Toronto, exchanging a reported $50m to work with and submit a proposal for a 12-acre plot, which was announced in 2017. Then a curious thing happened: Waterfront Toronto, the group in charge of the redevelopment of the area, began to fall apart.</p><p>First came the leaks, one of which claimed that Google was eyeing up the surrounding 350 acres (rather than the proposed 12). Then internationally acclaimed privacy expert Ann Cavoukian threw the towel in \"to send a strong statement\" after Google said it could not commit to anonymising every bit of data it collected on Quayside.</p><p>Three further board members have been replaced, including Julie Di Lorenzo, a Toronto developer who questioned how Waterfront Toronto, \"a corporation established by three levels of democratically elected government, [has] shared values with a limited, for-profit company whose premise is embedded data collection\".</p><p>In the two years that have followed, a number of groups have organised to oppose Google's presence. Their grumbles fall into two camps. One is privacy; the other is the act of selling off public land.</p><p>The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) this month filed a lawsuit, hoping they will be able to stop the proposal from going through. But as nobody other than Sidewalk Labs knows what they plan to do, given that there has been no public consultation on the matter, it is quite difficult to poke holes in their plans.</p><p>\"Citizens and commentators and the Canadian civil liberties association are forced to speculate what data will be collected and for what purpose,\" says former Ontario attorney general and CCLA chief Michael Bryant says.</p><p>\"If the choice is being a lab rat for Google or being homeless, then you are accepting it under duress.\"</p><p>With Google's history, it is easy to see why people draw <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.assumptions.No\">www.assumptions.No</url> company has been more invested in harvesting data and digital land grabbing than Google. Most will have experienced a Google car driving around the roads, photographing residential and urban areas to pad out its maps service.</p><p>Promises Google has made in the past about acquiring companies with powerful technology - like keeping British artificial intelligence company DeepMind independent - have fallen by the wayside. DeepMind's health efforts were this year absorbed into Google Health, which does not have the same terms, conditions or principles that DeepMind's founders said they would always adhere to.</p><p>And, while the CCLA says it would be happy for Google to continue its work if there is data protection in place, there are others who believe Google has no place in Canada at all.</p><p>When he is not wearing his \"Block Sidewalk\" campaign hat, Wieditz, who has a strong German accent, is working on cracking down on \"misbehaving\" Airbnb and Uber. His concern is the lack of public consultation on handing public land to the private sector and the distrust of Google \"who avoids taxation in the countries it operates in\" along with the hypocrisy of Dan Doctoroff - the chief executive of Sidewalk Labs, and a former deputy mayor of New York City - \"telling the public what is good for them\".</p><p>\"Torontonians are afraid to fall behind,\" Wieditz says. \"They think we need to catch up, but there are global cities that have said no to big tech. Politicians and citizens shouldn't be afraid to say 'no' and slow things down because we are joining really progressive cities in the world. Nobody wants to be a guinea pig and we also don't want to develop without the infrastructure to govern it that can be applied to other communities around the world.\"</p><p>He might have a point. Sidewalk Labs offered to pay for trains on the waterfront in return for a cut of property tax revenues on all the land, suggesting that the project was not simply an altruistic experiment.</p><p>\"They want access to development fees and future tax revenues on the land. That is when people became enraged,\" he says.</p><p>However, it is not black and white. When I ask Wieditz who is funding his campaign, he brushes it off as donations from the community and labour groups. But later when I Google his email address, I find it is linked to Metal Strategies, a steel think tank. Sidewalk Labs is proposing timber frame.</p><p>In coming weeks, if not days, the finer details of the proposal shall be revealed, including the cost Google is willing to pay. But it is far from a done deal. Waterfront Toronto can still reject the proposal and is not financially bound. Once agreed, it will need to be signed off by federal and state government too.</p><p>What does the average Torontonian think? A recent poll by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, one circulated by Sidewalk Labs, suggests 54pc of the 1,246 people survey back it.</p><p>Perhaps international fascination is born of concern that Sidewalk Labs might pop up in their back gardens. Indeed, if it is successful, it will be the perfect blueprint for cities in the UK, Europe and the US.</p><p>'They think we need to catch up, but there are cities that have said no'</p><p>'We have to speculate what data will be collected and for what?'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>TOBY DEXTER FOR THE TELEGRAPH</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-149637523</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6S-7YH1-DYTY-C0YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1446\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 28, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In his first speech since he was appointed to the position for a five-year term, as well as in subsequent interviews and public pronouncements, the Commissioner asserted that the Competition Bureau should be making greater use of its existing enforcement tools, advocated for higher penalties (particularly for \"multinational tech firms\") and suggested that significant legislative changes to the Competition Act may be necessary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Commissioner's promise of more vigorous enforcement comes at a time of increasing discussion about the role of antitrust enforcement in the digital economy, particularly as it relates to \"big tech.\" In Canada, for example, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) recently released a Digital Charter, which included a letter from the Minister to Commissioner Boswell with specific suggestions on how the Bureau should enforce its mandate in the digital economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We discuss these developments and related implications in more detail below.</p><p>Increased Scrutiny of Certain Industries and Practices</p><p>The Commissioner has stated that the Bureau intends to \"vigorously enforce and promote competition in sectors of the economy that matter to Canadians.\" Key industries that the Commissioner has specifically identified as being of interest include telecom, pharmaceuticals and infrastructure.</p><p>That said, the Bureau's interest in these sectors is not new. For example, the Bureau has repeatedly stated that it is interested in pursuing enforcement in the pharmaceutical sector; however, it appears that the right case has yet to present itself (at least outside the mergers context). Earlier this year, the Bureau announced that it had discontinued an abuse of dominance inquiry with respect to allegations of below-cost pricing and exclusionary conduct by a pharmaceutical supplier in Canada.</p><p>The Bureau's interest and activity in the telecom sector is similarly long-standing. In June 2018, the Bureau was directed by the Minister of ISED to assist the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in its investigation of \"high-pressure telecom sales practices.\" The Bureau had previously pointed out that aggressive sales tactics that are not false or misleading are not within the scope of its enforcement mandate. More recently, however, the Bureau obtained orders to advance its investigation into whether Bell Canada has engaged in false or misleading representations in its marketing practices.</p><p>In addition, the Commissioner recently sought to obtain significant amounts of information from Canadian telecom companies as part of the CRTC's review of mobile wireless services. Given that the CRTC's review contemplates an assessment of mobile wireless competition, the Commissioner asked the CRTC to request certain information to allow the Bureau to conduct an economic analysis of competition in the sector. The CRTC initially denied the Bureau's information request, noting the significant overlap between the Bureau's request and the existing CRTC request for information, as well as the overly expansive nature of the Bureau's request. The CRTC accepted the most recent iteration of the Bureau's request in May and directed industry participants to respond.</p><p>The Bureau also submitted a set of comments to the CRTC in May, providing the Bureau's initial \"high-level findings\" regarding competition in mobile wireless services in Canada and considerations for designing a regulatory framework. As part of its initial findings, the Bureau noted that its review of recent public pricing data suggests that higher prices exist where there is no strong regional competitor and that factors such as network quality and population density did not explain these pricing differences. The Bureau also advocated for the need for \"a cost benefit\" analysis of requiring mandated mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) access as well as any feasible alternative options to allow the CRTC to determine the best course of action. The Bureau noted that although mandated MVNO access may be necessary to increase the affordability of wireless services, such an approach would not be without risk and, in particular, could comprise investments in 5G technologies and potentially undermine the current and future success of existing regional carriers.</p><p>We also expect the Bureau will continue to take active enforcement across all industries with respect to false or misleading representations about the use and collection of data (i.e., allegedly false or misleading privacy policies) and pricing. The Bureau's proceeding against Ticketmaster regarding its pricing practices is scheduled to be heard by the Competition Tribunal in the fall and may be an important test of the Bureau's enforcement approach in this area.</p><p>Implications</p><p> The Commissioner's statements suggest that companies in the telecom, pharmaceuticals and infrastructure sectors will be facing even more scrutiny and possible enforcement. This underscores the need for awareness of competition compliance issues and appropriate training.</p><p>Greater Use of Injunctions</p><p>The Commissioner has explained that the Bureau's active enforcement \"will include increased consideration of the use of tools such as injunction applications\" and that the Bureau will \"use these tools more frequently, as resources permit, to interrupt or halt the conduct in question, pending a full hearing.\" In the mergers context, the Bureau has previously sought interim injunctions, although not that frequently and not always successfully. The Bureau was only partially successful in its most recent (2015)  attempt to obtain an injunction in relation to a merger in the retail gas industry.</p><p>Although the Bureau's ability to seek injunctions in the mergers context is not new, the Bureau may also seek interim orders under the misleading advertising provisions or the abuse of dominance provisions of the Competition Act. For example, the Commissioner may seek a temporary order requiring a person to stop making certain representations if serious harm is likely to ensue and the balance of convenience favours the issuance of the order.</p><p>Implications</p><p> We expect the Bureau to apply for interim orders more frequently in the mergers context as well in relation to allegations of misleading representations and abuse of dominance.Given that the scope and applicability of the relevant interim order provisions remain relatively untested outside the mergers context, any attempt by the Bureau to obtain such interim orders more frequently is likely to result in increased litigation.</p><p>Increased Scrutiny of Non-Notifiable Mergers and Stringent Approach to Efficiencies Claims</p><p>Under Commissioner Boswell's leadership, the Bureau's Merger Notification Unit has been expanded to include a Merger Intelligence Unit whose focus will be on gathering intelligence in respect of mergers that were not notified. In the two months since this unit was created, the Bureau has identified two potentially problematic transactions that would not have otherwise been subject to review. In more recent speaking engagements, the Commissioner has specifically noted that the Bureau intends to closely review mergers that involve large technology firms acquiring smaller startup firms, even where notification of such transactions is not mandatory.</p><p>The Commissioner has also indicated the Bureau is rethinking its procedural approach to merger reviews where parties assert the efficiencies defence. Canada's efficiencies defence provides that a remedy may not be imposed in respect of a merger that substantially lessens competition when the efficiencies arising from the merger would outweigh the anticompetitive harm.</p><p>Although the efficiencies defence is unlikely to be relevant or prove decisive in most mergers, it has been invoked successfully in certain recent mergers. This no doubt explains the Bureau's antipathy to the provision. In this vein, Commissioner Boswell has argued that recent Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence imposes a significant burden on the Bureau to quantify the anticompetitive effects of a merger (to allow the effects to be weighed against any efficiencies). He has also argued that such an approach is ill-suited to the digital economy in which the adverse effects of mergers on dynamic competition may be especially difficult for the Bureau to quantify.</p><p>The Commissioner has said that the Bureau will issue updated guidance later this year on how it will assess efficiency claims in merger reviews. In earlier remarks, the Commissioner signalled that the Bureau may require parties to provide detailed data of expected efficiencies and commit to suspend closing while the Bureau completes its review.</p><p>Implications</p><p> Parties to non-notifiable transactions, particularly those in the tech sector involving the acquisition of smaller startups, should assess the competitive impact of any such transactions and consider the best strategy to address any antitrust risk (including in transaction documents).Given the Commissioner's express disapproval of the efficiencies defence and potentially stricter assessment of such claims in future merger reviews, in cases where the defence may play an important role in a transaction's overall success, merging parties may opt to spend less time trying to convince the Bureau of the application of the efficiencies defence. Instead, parties may choose to test the defence directly before the Competition Tribunal and appeal courts.</p><p>The Digital Charter and Competition Law Enforcement and Policy</p><p>With the release of the Digital Charter and accompanying letter to the Commissioner, it is clear that the Minister expects the Bureau to be actively involved in the digital economy. In particular, the Minister asked that the Competition Bureau work with ISED to \"consider critical issues such as: the impact of digital transformation on competition; the emerging issues for competition in data accumulation, transparency, and control; the effectiveness of current competition policy tools and marketplace frameworks; and the effectiveness of current investigative and judicial processes.\"</p><p>Participating in a panel discussion at the OECD in June 2019, the Commissioner explained that he views the guidance from the Minister as a \"major opportunity to get under the hood\" of competition policy in Canada and review the effectiveness of the Bureau's enforcement tools. While the Competition Bureau has long sought greater input into competition policy, it is clear that the Commissioner sees the Digital Charter as an opening to revisit Canada's competition legislation and enforcement tools, particularly as they relate to the digital economy.</p><p>The Commissioner also expressed the view that there are \"several gaps\" in the Canadian regime that \"don't measure up to best practices.\" In particular, the Commissioner pointed to the Bureau's lack of power to conduct market studies (including the ability to compel industry participants to produce information where a competition concern has not been specifically identified). He also expressed his view that the \"maximum fines allowed under the Act lack the teeth to deter anticompetitive behaviour particularly when you're talking about large multinational tech firms.\"</p><p>Implications</p><p> The Bureau is likely to seize the opportunity afforded under the Digital Charter to conduct a wide-ranging review of competition legislation and continue to advocate strenuously for greater financial penalties, broad market study powers and the elimination of the efficiencies defence.In the longer term, if the Commissioner is successful in obtaining market study powers, these studies could impose significant costs and burdens for Canadian businesses. Indeed, the Bureau's initial requests for information in the CRTC's review of mobile wireless services (discussed above) provide a sense of the potentially expansive and costly nature of such studies.The Commissioner's tough talk regarding the need for higher monetary penalties to be available against \"big tech\" is consistent with the Minister's recent statements in relation to violations in the privacy area by large tech firms. However, the Bureau itself does not have the power to impose any monetary penalties and Canadian courts have, to date, been reluctant to impose penalties that approach the existing maximums available under the Competition Act for non-criminal conduct. The reluctance that courts have historically displayed in imposing high penalties for non-criminal conduct may be attributed to the fact that the line between aggressive but healthy competition and anticompetitive behaviour is often difficult to discern.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The Commissioner has charted an aggressive course of action for the Competition Bureau that includes more vigorous enforcement and suggestions that significant legislative changes are necessary. Whether the Bureau will succeed in any or all of these ambitious aims remains to be seen and will depend, in part, on the Bureau's case selection and whether the political winds and courts agree that a more aggressive enforcement and policy direction is warranted.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

This will allow each nation to access the data of the other country's citizens without congressional approval.Foreign governments are not required to satisfy any minimum privacy or human rights law standards as a condition of entering a data sharing agreement.The impact on existing Canadian privacy law remains to be seen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Impact on Canada</p><p>The current data sharing agreement between the Canada Border Services Agency and Homeland Security allows the exchange of entry and exit information of travellers crossing the Canada-U.S. border on land. Additionally, Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and Privacy Act allow private sector organizations and government to disclose personal information in order to aid lawful investigations in Canada or abroad.</p><p>The introduction of the CLOUD Act may prompt the U.S. to approach Canada to establish another framework to facilitate data sharing between law enforcement agencies. However, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) illustrates the growing trend among nations seeking to provide legislative guidance on how the data of their citizens is to be treated when being transferred cross borders. Canada will be focused on maintaining its status as a country the EU deems to provide adequate privacy protections following the introduction of GDPR in May so data can continue to flow freely between the regions. Any data sharing agreement with the U.S. involving a country that has not been deemed to provide adequate privacy protections by the EU will need to be carefully drafted to ensure it is not viewed as weakening Canada's data protection regime.</p><p>Big Tech Support</p><p>While the CLOUD Act received support from technology giants such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, its introduction was met with criticism by civil liberty activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty InternationalUSA, who expressed concern over potential privacy and human rights violations.</p><p>The support of large American technology companies is not surprising. Tech giants who store personal information on servers around the world have been struggling with the uncertainty in the previous regimes regarding U.S. law enforcement requests for off-shore data. Notably, Microsoft's four-year challenge to whether a domestic U.S. warrant can be used to access emails held on a server in Ireland has been dismissed now the CLOUD Act is signed. During the hearing of that case before the Supreme Court of the United States, Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Breyer hinted that Congress is better suited than the courts to reconcile the conflict between modern technology and older legislation.</p><p>Alternative to MLAT</p><p>The CLOUD Act provides an alternative to the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) regime. MLAT requires two or more nations to set out the terms on which information could be exchanged to assist an investigation happening in at least one of the countries party to the MLAT.</p><p>In the U.S., each request under MLAT is voted on by the Senate and requires two-thirds approval to pass. In Canada, the Minister of Justice, by way of the International Assistance Group, grants approval of MLAT requests based on whether evidence of an offence or information that may reveal the whereabouts of a suspect will be found in Canada.</p><p>The CLOUD Act grants law enforcement agencies streamlined access to data which may be relevant to crime prevention and investigation. This is a change from MLAT requests which took around 10 months to process, a delay long enough that could render the requested data obsolete.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Real governments struggle to tame the beast in areas ranging from privacy and democracy to taxation and corporate clout. Facebook even has plans to launch its own cryptocurrency, called Libra.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally, though, there are signs governments are stirring themselves to meet the challenge- and not a moment too soon.</p><p>In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission slapped Facebook with a record fine of $5 billion this week for misleading its users about the privacy of their personal information. In addition, the FTC ordered the company to set up a new board-level committee on privacy and make its data practices more transparent.</p><p>That's a lot of money. But for Facebook, even a fine of that size is just the cost of doing business. It earned more than that in the last quarter alone and its stocked jumped 56 per cent last year while it weathered a storm of criticism.</p><p>The bigger potential challenge to Facebook and the rest comes from another direction. After years of leaving the big tech firms to pretty much regulate themselves, the U.S. government has launched investigations into how they have amassed so much market power and whether they've violated antitrust laws.</p><p>This is a big change. So far the tech companies have faced their biggest push-back in Europe while Washington tended to defend them as champions of innovation. But now the U.S. Justice Department and federal regulators are lining up Facebook et al in their sights.</p><p>And it isn't just about privacy, \"fake news\" and similar well-publicized concerns about social media and the health of democracy. Those are important, but the real stakes for the dominant tech companies lie in a challenge to the enormous market power they have accumulated in just a few years.</p><p>An antitrust review could put into question that power, the near-monopoly grip on key markets that lets them dominate billions of dollars in advertising revenue, squeeze out potential competitors, dictate terms of business, and avoid paying tax in many of the places they operate. Even breaking up some of the biggest companies would be a real possibility - especially if a Democrat wins the White House next year.</p><p>With all that, you might expect a lively debate among Canada's political parties on how to meet the tech challenge. For the most part, though, you'd be disappointed.</p><p>The Trudeau government brought in new rules governing election advertising online and foreign meddling in campaigns. But it had no effective response when Google simply said it won't carry any election ads rather than meet the Canadian requirements.</p><p>And Canada's privacy commissioner was left to sputter impotently when he rebuked the company for violating the privacy of 620,000 Canadian users and it brushed him off. It turns out he has no power to tell Facebook to do anything. Even if he takes the company to court and wins, the maximum fine would be a risible $100,000.</p><p>On the key issue of taxation, Canada's position is to wait to see what the big boys do. Finance Minister Bill Morneau told the Star's Heather Scoffield recently that Canada wants to see what G7 leaders decide at their summit in France next month, so there can be common rules for all.</p><p>As for the future, the best the Liberals can offer is the tepid \"digital charter\" that Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains unveiled in May. It points in the right direction on privacy and other issues, but there's no reason the government could not have moved faster in those areas.</p><p>Canadians deserve better. The trend across the developed world clearly favours reining in Big Tech, and Canada should be more than a bystander as these parallel governments are brought under control.</p><p>-Toronto Star</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MHNEWE-396560493MHNW</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MHNEWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP1-3591-DYKX-04X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460050</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Medicine Hat News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Medicine Hat News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 29, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Real governments struggle to tame the beast in areas ranging from privacy and democracy to taxation and corporate clout. Facebook even has plans to launch its own cryptocurrency, called Libra.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally, though, there are signs governments are stirring themselves to meet the challenge- and not a moment too soon.</p><p>In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission slapped Facebook with a record fine of $5 billion this week for misleading its users about the privacy of their personal information. In addition, the FTC ordered the company to set up a new board-level committee on privacy and make its data practices more transparent.</p><p>That's a lot of money. But for Facebook, even a fine of that size is just the cost of doing business. It earned more than that in the last quarter alone and its stocked jumped 56 per cent last year while it weathered a storm of criticism.</p><p>The bigger potential challenge to Facebook and the rest comes from another direction. After years of leaving the big tech firms to pretty much regulate themselves, the U.S. government has launched investigations into how they have amassed so much market power and whether they've violated antitrust laws.</p><p>This is a big change. So far the tech companies have faced their biggest push-back in Europe while Washington tended to defend them as champions of innovation. But now the U.S. Justice Department and federal regulators are lining up Facebook et al in their sights.</p><p>And it isn't just about privacy, \"fake news\" and similar well-publicized concerns about social media and the health of democracy. Those are important, but the real stakes for the dominant tech companies lie in a challenge to the enormous market power they have accumulated in just a few years.</p><p>An antitrust review could put into question that power, the near-monopoly grip on key markets that lets them dominate billions of dollars in advertising revenue, squeeze out potential competitors, dictate terms of business, and avoid paying tax in many of the places they operate. Even breaking up some of the biggest companies would be a real possibility - especially if a Democrat wins the White House next year.</p><p>With all that, you might expect a lively debate among Canada's political parties on how to meet the tech challenge. For the most part, though, you'd be disappointed.</p><p>The Trudeau government brought in new rules governing election advertising online and foreign meddling in campaigns. But it had no effective response when Google simply said it won't carry any election ads rather than meet the Canadian requirements.</p><p>And Canada's privacy commissioner was left to sputter impotently when he rebuked the company for violating the privacy of 620,000 Canadian users and it brushed him off. It turns out he has no power to tell Facebook to do anything. Even if he takes the company to court and wins, the maximum fine would be a risible $100,000.</p><p>On the key issue of taxation, Canada's position is to wait to see what the big boys do. Finance Minister Bill Morneau told the Star's Heather Scoffield recently that Canada wants to see what G7 leaders decide at their summit in France next month, so there can be common rules for all.</p><p>As for the future, the best the Liberals can offer is the tepid \"digital charter\" that Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains unveiled in May. It points in the right direction on privacy and other issues, but there's no reason the government could not have moved faster in those areas.</p><p>Canadians deserve better. The trend across the developed world clearly favours reining in Big Tech, and Canada should be more than a bystander as these parallel governments are brought under control.</p><p>The coming election campaign will be an ideal time for the federal parties to spell out how they would meet that challenge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019072555169603</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-2K11-JDH1-C39X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"670\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

However, this warrants ongoing attention from regulatory authorities.</p><p>Report details</p><p>While technological innovation has the potential to lower costs to clients of financial services, in addition to increasing market access, the range of product offerings and convenience, the FSB notes the universe of financial services providers could be materially altered by new entrants into the financial services space, including fintech firms and large, established technology companies (Big Tech). In particular, the Report notes that, despite the benefits to financial stability emanating from greater competition and diversity in lending, payments, insurance, trading and other areas of financial services, heightened competition could also put pressure on the profitability of financial institutions, which could lead to risk-taking by those institutions in order to maintain margins.</p><p>As part of the Report, the FSB analyzed the link between technological innovation and market structure (which refers to the interrelation of companies in a market that impacts their behaviour and their ability to make profits) and produced the following considerations.</p><p>Cooperation is key</p><p>The existing relationship between financial institutions and fintech firms appears to be largely complementary and cooperative in nature. For example, fintech firms have not posed a serious competitive threat to established financial institutions due to a lack of sufficient access to capital and/or a robust customer base, and partnering has allowed fintech firms to viably operate while remaining relatively small (and in some cases, unburdened by financial regulation while still benefiting from access to the customer base of the financial institutions with which they partner).</p><p>Alternatively, partner financial institutions have benefited from access to innovative technologies. However, there are exceptions to above, as some fintech firms have made significant inroads in credit provisions and payments, which may negatively affect the profitability of financial institutions in the future to the extent that technology permits a further unbundling of profitable services traditionally offered by banks and other institutions.</p><p>Impact of Big Tech firms</p><p>Of greater concern may be the competitive impact of Big Tech firms, which typically have large, established customer networks and enjoy name recognition and trust. In addition, these companies may have access to proprietary customer data generated through other services (such as social media) to tailor their offerings to individual customers' preferences. Given these Big Tech firms have strong capital positions and likely access to low-cost capital, the FSB notes such firms could very quickly achieve scale in financial services. While Big Tech firms could represent a source of increased competition, their participation in financial services may not necessarily result in a more competitive market over the longer term if Big Tech firms were to operate with lower margins (due to cross-subsidization). In particular, the FSB notes that a greater market share of Big Tech may be associated with unchanged or higher concentration, along with a change in composition away from traditional players.</p><p>The risks of third-party data service providers</p><p>The Report also notes that, while increased reliance by financial institutions on third-party data service providers for core operations (e.g., data provision, cloud storage and analytics) could reduce operational risk at the individual firm level, it could also pose risks and challenges for the financial system as a whole. For example, if high reliance on third-party service providers were to emerge, along with a high degree of concentration among service providers, then an operational failure, cyber incident, or insolvency could disrupt the activities of multiple financial institutions. As a result, the FSB notes that it will be important to continue to monitor these developments.</p><p>What's next</p><p>As a result, we expect that Canadian authorities will continue to closely monitor these developments and their financial stability implications. In fact, on February 7 at the C.D. Howe Institute, Assistant Superintendent Ben Gully said, \"[w]ith the growth in third-party relationships, risk concentrations may result when a number of financial institutions begin to rely upon a few service providers. OSFI's concern is that the dominance of a particular supplier in one area could create a co-dependence across the financial services sector. This matters because financial system resilience would ultimately rely on the operations of a potentially small number of non-financial, technologically driven, counterparts.\" We also understand that the OSFI is currently drafting a guideline on non-financial risk (with a focus on third party risk and cyber risk).</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Then, Facebook refused to implement recommendations of the federal privacy commissioner, ignoring his findings of breach of trust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, like parents who have nurtured their high-tech children in the name of economic development only to watch them grow up and take over the house without heed for consequences, policy-makers don't quite know what to do.</p><p>The most powerful companies in the world, whose market value is growing exponentially, are meeting their day of reckoning in Europe, where lawmakers are introducing regulations, taxes and fines to curtail their power.</p><p>In the United States, one of the co-founders of Facebook called last week for the breakup of the company through antitrust laws. Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren has suggested she wants to break up not just Facebook, but Google and Amazon, too.</p><p>But in Canada, we are only months away from the prime minister posing for ribbon-cutting with the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon, welcoming them to expand their footprints in Canada so they can hire handfuls of people.</p><p>\"The economic development frame has been the driver in this space,\" observes Amanda Clarke, an assistant professor at Carleton University.</p><p>Meanwhile, small businesses, especially in the retail sector, find it harder and harder to expand unless they're on Amazon's good side. Music producers and the news industry are seeing their revenues melt away to the massive advertising and publishing power of Google and Facebook, which take little responsibility for curating quality or adhering to copyright, let alone truth. And alarm bells are ringing about children of all ages, so attached to social media that they no longer know how to conduct face-to-face friendships, let alone romance.</p><p>Big Tech's effects on democracy are only a sliver of the ground-shifting effects of these U.S.-based companies and their giant tentacles.</p><p>It's clear that federal policy-makers want to take action. There has been a notable change in attitude in the past few months, with the photo ops and fawning over Big Tech replaced by a growing mortification at the breaches of privacy, the blind eyes to election interference, and the rapid spread of insidious extremism.</p><p>But the will to take action has not yet turned into a full-fledged plan. Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould rolled out a package of measures in January to take aim at foreign influence in elections. The government has passed legislation to reform rules around election advertising. And last week, MPs on the ethics committee took the extraordinary step of issuing a formal summons to Facebook executives, telling them they must appear before international hearings on data and democracy at the end of the month.</p><p>If they don't come, they could be held in contempt of Parliament - a deterrent for some, perhaps, but probably not for a company facing the likelihood of a $5-billion U.S. fine for privacy breaches.</p><p>And we wonder why they won't listen to Canada's privacy commissioner, with his lack of power to levy financial penalties.</p><p>Galvanized by the mosque attacks in Christchurch, N.Z., in mid-March, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is heading to France this week to meet with other leaders to sign on to a \"Christchurch call\" list of principles that they hope all governments will follow, and that Big Tech will endorse.</p><p>Trudeau will up the ante in a speech on Thursday at a Big Tech conference, challenging the firms to take responsibility for hatred and extremism. With an election in the offing, he will aim to show strong leadership.</p><p>But at this point, he has a narrow definition of the problems, focused on public safety, privacy and electioneering - and leaving the corporate power issues to another day. Taxation, monopolistic power in advertising, copyright, distortion of markets such as transportation and accommodation - none of those, or other unforeseen disruptions, are on the front burner.</p><p>He also has limited policy options. Canada will work with allies through the G7 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to develop \"best practices.\" But it also has to decide whether it will follow the European Union's hardball regulatory approach to disruption or the more voluntary approach of the United States.</p><p>Here's a quick idea from Clarke: Use government procurement to demand higher standards.

This week, Canada's heritage minister used it for a regulatory spat in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats,\" Steven Guilbeault said in an emailed statement to the Star's Susan Delacourt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The \"threats\" Guilbeault referred to involved some of the world's richest and most influential corporations, Facebook and Google, which have separately warned Canada's friends down under that they will suspend services in Australia or block media organizations from using their platforms if Canberra follows through with a law they don't like.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That law would force these giants of the digital age - companies that rake in tens of billions of dollars each year and control the infrastructure of the internet's most-trafficked venues - to negotiate payments to the journalism organizations that create the news content hosted on their platforms.</p><p>Canada is working on its schemes to regulate these platforms, though the government is cagey about providing particulars. Guilbeault would not agree to speak with the Star on the record this week, offering instead to speak \"on background\" without being quoted or named. The Star declined, and Guilbeault's office provided a written statement in response to questions.</p><p>There may be good reason why a politician would tread carefully on this terrain. It's proven to be tricky.</p><p>Critics charge big multinational tech companies don't pay enough taxes and that this is unfair to domestic competitors. But when several countries, including Canada, floated proposals to create special taxes on revenue that these U.S.-based digital giants reap in their jurisdictions, the Americans threatened to impose tariffs.</p><p>Others want to see modernized rules in Canada to force companies like Netflix to showcase a minimum amount of Canadian content, just like radio and television stations. But when then-heritage minister M\u00e9lanie Joly unveiled Canada's new cultural policy in 2017, she was roundly criticized because it did not create requirements for foreign players to support domestic productions.</p><p>Meanwhile, many news organizations are bleeding dollars as Facebook and Google gobble up the vast majority of all digital ad revenue in Canada, according to one dire report on the financial state of this country's news media.</p><p>Clearly there's a lot for the government to grapple with.</p><p>The way Michael Geist, University of Ottawa professor and Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law, sees it, Guilbeault could make decisions in several areas. The first involves taxation.</p><p>Geist noted how the political will to go down this route has changed since 2015, when Stephen Harper, then prime minister, warned Canadians Justin Trudeau would impose a \"Netflix tax\" on their streaming subscriptions. What he was really talking about was the application of sales tax to these subscriptions, which wasn't collected because the service was provided to Canadians by a company not based in this country.</p><p>Similarly, sales tax doesn't apply to ads purchased from foreign websites like Facebook and Google, a key point of contention for groups like Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, which argue this unfairly puts Canadian media at a disadvantage.</p><p>But while Trudeau steadfastly denied Harper's charge about the Netflix tax five years ago, things have changed. Quebec and Saskatchewan applied their provincial sales taxes to off-jurisdiction digital services in 2019. British Columbia plans to follow suit. And so does the Liberal government in Ottawa, which Guilbeault has said intends to collect federal sales tax so that \"foreign platforms will pay the same taxes as Canadian digital companies.\"</p><p>However, as Geist explains, the Liberals also promised something else during the 2019 federal election. Their policy platform called for a special, three per cent tax on revenues that large foreign digital companies raise in Canada. The New Democrats, Conservatives and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois promised similar taxes.</p><p>But after taking power, the Liberals have suggested they won't act on this pledge without other countries doing the same. Guilbeault's office pointed this week to a statement the minister posted on Twitter last December, in which he called the current tax situation \"unfair\" and said the government would address it \"in a fair, responsible manner\" as it works to \"build an international consensus\" on the issue.</p><p>\"They actually flip-flopped, in terms of which tax they seemed to be willing to move forward on,\" Geist said, pointing to the willingness to move first with the sales tax.</p><p>\"With sales taxes, it's consumers paying the sales taxes, and it's just the companies collecting and remitting,\" he said.</p><p>Opposition parties also remain supportive of additional taxes for foreign digital services. New Democrat MP Charlie Angus told the Star this week the government should make sure these companies pay their share.</p><p>\"We see Facebook threatening Australia. They are not good corporate citizens,\" Angus said. \"They need to be paying tax. It's about fairness, because so much of the revenue comes from ads but they're not paying tax back in. So it's a simple, straightforward thing.\"</p><p>Conservative MP Michelle Rempel also pointed to commitments from her party's new leader, Erin O'Toole, who called for tax changes to ensure there are taxes on digital ads bought from foreign websites like Facebook and Google. \"We're probably overdue as a country at looking at ways to ensure that companies are paying their fair share ... We're open to looking at that,\" she said.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment from the Star this week. Facebook, however, signalled in a background conversation with the Star that it is willing to pay more taxes in Canada.</p><p>The second area where Geist sees potential for federal action is in response to calls for foreign digital players to pay for Canadian content. Here, Geist said \"it's pretty clear (the government is) going to do something,\" given how Trudeau assigned Guilbeault to bring in legislation to modernize Canada's laws on broadcasting and telecommunications before the end of the year.</p><p>In his office's statement to the Star, Guilbeault said the government is committed to a \"more equitable digital regulatory framework\" in Canada. \"It is about levelling the playing field,\" he said. \"Those who benefit from the Canadian ecosystem must also contribute to it, through the Canadian broadcasting sector or the fair remuneration for the use of news content.\"</p><p>The Australian situation shows there are \"big risks\" for Ottawa if it takes a similar path, Geist said. He said the removal of quality journalism from major digital platforms would leave users with potentially less credible sources of information, and questioned the assumption that news content - which, on platforms like Facebook, is shared voluntarily by news organizations and social media users - is worth significant amounts of money to digital giants.</p><p>\"The idea that we'd have Canadian news organizations shut out of large social media platforms sure isn't helping those Canadian media organizations,\" Geist said.</p><p>In a statement to the Star, Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy at Facebook Canada, said removing news in Australia is the company's \"last choice.\" It wants to \"work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\" In Canada, that has included putting almost $9 million toward initiatives such as a program to fund jobs with The Canadian Press, he said. \"We'll continue to do more.\"</p><p>Finally, Geist outlined how there are calls for Ottawa to do something around the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms. Last year, the government earmarked $9 million for projects designed to educate people about online misinformation, and rolled out another $3.5 million to \"amplify the current efforts\" of organizations to help people assess health information online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>For Rempel, it's better to emphasize educational initiatives than to create a system where tech companies like Facebook have to police misinformation and decide what should be removed from their websites. It would also be problematic for governments to set parameters for those decisions, she said.</p><p>She recognized the complexity of the issues facing Guilbeault and the government as they try to adapt to the realities of the 21st century digital economy and said she hopes the question of how to tax and regulate web giants figures prominently in the next federal election.</p><p>\"I hope to see, and I think that some of these policies should be part of any sort of an election campaign or platform, because they're really material to competitiveness and content-creation and tech innovation in our country, and we have to get it right,\" she said.</p><p>Of course, this wouldn't be the first time these issues have figured in an election campaign. All parties agree that something should be done. Promises have been made. Yet the challenge remains.</p><p>Multinational tech giants keep getting bigger at the expense of domestic media and competitiveness. Defanging Big Tech is an ongoing series examining the challenge for governments, and how they should respond.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020090558783647</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S5-BHT1-JBTY-W3XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1545\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 5, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That's been an increasingly vocal complaint from content creators and regional governments north of the border as Netflix and Amazon continue to take full advantage of generous Canadian shooting incentives and state-of-the-art facilities in an environment that is largely free of regulation. Now, as the streaming wars intensify with the arrival of Disney+, Apple TV+, Peacock and HBO Max, pressure is mounting for the streamers to start giving back.</p><p>\"They are already spending money in Canada. All we're asking is for them to do it in a more organized way [toward] Canadian cultural content available for Canadians, and for audiences around the world,\" Steven Guilbeault, the Canadian heritage minister responsible for broadcasting, told THR while attending the Prime Time conference in Ottawa in January.</p><p>Unlike local broadcasters and cable players that put a share of their revenue toward subsidizing local TV producers, Netflix and other U.S. tech giants remain unregulated in Canada. Such local subsidies result in significant funding for Canadian TV shows like Schitt's Creek, Anne With an E and Orphan Black that sell widely into the U.S. and other world markets.</p><p>Defying long-standing calls from regional indie producers and broadcasters to impose a direct levy on the revenues of Netflix, Google and Amazon, upcoming legislation to revamp broadcast and telecom rules is expected to leave such U.S. big-tech players mostly unregulated and untaxed.</p><p>An exception to the above is an expected legislative mandate that tech giants must collect a goods and services sales tax (GST) from their customers, which Canadians routinely pay on all goods and services.</p><p>\"I think that's about fairness,\" Guilbeault says. \"Everybody is paying the GST in Canada--I don't see why some of the richest companies in the world shouldn't pay GST in Canada.\"</p><p>But it's likely GST funds will not go directly toward subsidizing Canadian content, which means that streaming services won't be going far enough to change their business models to satisfy traditional TV distributors.</p><p>\"We have long been concerned by the undue regulatory burden faced by Canadian broadcasters versus foreign internet broadcasters, and we hope the government will move forward with creating a more equitable competitive environment,\" says Doug Murphy, president and CEO of local broadcaster Corus Entertainment.</p><p>Canada has so far not shown any inclination in following France, which recently proposed a 3 percent levy on sales generated by digital giants. The U.K. and Italy are considering national plans for digital taxation as well.</p><p>Canada, by contrast, has far more at stake because so many U.S. streamers shoot their productions north of the border. The challenge for those pressuring the streamers is that few want to risk a direct confrontation with a sector that is already pumping millions into the Canadian economy (an estimated $1.4 billion in 2019 alone). Money from streaming TV's arms race flowing to Canadian programming sits well with local producers who increasingly work with American digital platforms to spread their content worldwide. But at the federal level, the issue is expected to be front and center during legislative sessions this year.</p><p>\"We're not telling them what categories of content to produce, we're not telling them where to produce it--we're just telling them that they have to take a certain amount of the money they're already spending in Canada and make sure it complies with Canadian-content requirements,\" Guilbeault says.</p><p>Netflix already appears to be making concessions. Later this year the streamer will debut its first indigenous Canadian movie, Jusqu'au Declin, directed by Patrice Laliberte in Quebec.</p><p>\"We all have a role to play in supporting the future of film and television being created in Canada,\" a rep for Netflix says in a statement. \"We look forward to working with the government as it proceeds to modernize Canada's broadcasting and telecommunications laws.\"</p><p>By opting to push for mandated spending commitments by foreign streamers over direct taxation, Guilbeault has taken his cue from Janet Yale, a former cablecaster and industry lobbyist who led a seven-member panel that in late January unveiled a 235-page report on restructuring Canada's broadcast sector for the streaming era. Yale's report argued against an extra levy on U.S. streamers operating in Canada. \"Streaming services like Netflix would have spending obligations. It's not a tax,\" Yale tells THR. \"They would directly spend and invest in content that meets Canadian-content requirements.\" Adds Brad Danks, CEO of Canadian cable channel and service OutTV, which has programs available to stream online and on Roku, Apple TV+, iOS and Android apps, \"The idea of protecting our market has gone away. The goal is to create an ecosystem that allows Canadian companies to flourish.\"</p><p>Asking foreign tech players to invest in local programming has a precedent: Netflix in 2017 negotiated a five-year deal with Ottawa to establish a production hub that avoided taxes and local content obligations. In return, the streamer committed to spending $400 million on its own content shot in Canada by 2022. In late 2019, the streamer reported that it had met that threshold three years ahead of schedule; its local expenditures included pricey shoots for The Umbrella Academy, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and Another Life.</p><p>That investment comes as Amazon, Hulu and other U.S. streaming rivals increasingly make Canada their base for ambitious original productions. Amazon, for instance, recently wrapped shooting the eightepisode sci-fi series Tales From the Loop in Morden, Manitoba.</p><p>For OutTV's Danks, Ottawa is answering criticism that its 2017 deal with Netflix gave that dominant player a pass on being regulated like domestic broadcasters. \"We're going to let people in if they play by the rules,\" Dank says. \"We'll decide where their contributions go.\"</p><p>Caption: Umbrella Academy is one of a number of pricey Netflix series to shoot in Canada.</p><p>Caption: Guilbeault</p><p>Caption: Amazon's sci-fi series Tales From the Loop recently wrapped shooting in Manitoba, Canada.</p><p>Caption: Yale</p><p>Please Note: Illustration(s) are not available due to copyright restrictions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-615493703</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 615493703</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YM5-F1Y1-JCBJ-K0KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1045\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Prometheus Global Media LLC</copyright><publicationName>Hollywood Reporter</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0018-3660</issn><volume>Vol. 426</volume><issueNumber>No. 7\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Television Broadcasting</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Arts and entertainment industries</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Forecasts and trends</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Goods and services tax</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Industry forecasts</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Laws, regulations and rules</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Streaming media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Taxation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Television broadcasting industry</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Forecasts, trends, outlooks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government regulation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government regulation (cont)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Legal issues &amp;

During this conference, female thought leaders discussed a variety of topics, including (i) big tech; (ii) killer acquisitions; (iii) information sharing; and (iv) the potential impact of elections on antitrust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Where are we Today with Enforcement against Big Tech?</p><p>The panelists explored concerns about market power in digital markets as discussed in numerous reports commissioned by antitrust agencies from around the world. The panelists also discussed calls for new 'Digital Authorities' in the reports coming from the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States.</p><p>The panelists emphasized that economists already have the tools needed to assess antitrust concerns in the context of big tech, but noted that the application of these tools may need to be re-thought in certain specific areas, such as when considering non-price effects. For example, large technology companies often offer free products to consumers on one platform and profit from selling different products on another complementary platform, which leads to winner-take-all markets where it appears difficult for new competitors to enter. That being said, panelists acknowledged that technology markets may be contestable - Facebook was a popular example.</p><p>Data, referred to as the new \"oil\", was another key topic for the panelists. However, the panelists aptly noted that data has its limits as a competitive advantage, being non-rivalrous and often less valuable with age (i.e. data can become stale). The panelists expressed reservations about the promise of data portability to resolve the problem of winner-take-all markets in big tech. While it was acknowledged as a 'nice to have' for consumers, there are challenges to be addressed in terms of balancing data portability with privacy laws.</p><p>The panelists reminded attendees that the notion that existing antitrust laws are insufficient to handle the modern technology of our time is nothing new (i.e. oil and railroads). However, a key takeaway is that regulators and the international competition bar will need to be more creative in fashioning remedies to address competition concerns in this new era of big tech.</p><p>Killer Acquisitions</p><p>The panelists took the time to define \"killer acquisitions\", also known as \"strategic acquisitions\", depending on your perspective, which are acquisitions by a large company of an innovative nascent company that may have no, or a very small, market share. The panel was quick to emphasize that such acquisitions represent only a handful of hundreds of thousands of transactions. It also cautioned against injecting hyperbolic language into antitrust policy discussions to invoke a sense of morality, as if a merger review decision was one of life and death. The panelists agreed that regardless of what we call such acquisitions, the analytical framework for evaluating them already exists. Moreover, enforcement agencies already analyze the rationale for a transaction and assess whether there is an anti-competitive purpose or effect.</p><p>The panelists acknowledged that many start-ups are created with the intent of ultimately being purchased by a larger market participant. In this regard, the panelists recognized the potential risk of chilling innovation in light of increased scrutiny of \"killer\" or \"strategic\" acquisitions in the tech space.</p><p>The highly speculative nature of post-closing discussions of what would have happened had a certain merger been blocked was emphasized by the panelists. Even with the benefit of hindsight, we will never know what would have happened if the merger review decision went the other way. Questions surrounding the probability of a new product developing into a viable alternative or whether a target could have survived without the acquisition are ones which are very difficult for regulators to assess. Furthermore, if a product survives in a killer acquisition, and continues to be available in a market but customers are not choosing it over the dominant product, does that mean the acquirer under-invested or is it because the product is inferior? The suggestion of re-opening merger decisions was not popular; panelists prefer to see stricter enforcement of existing abuse of dominance provisions.</p><p>When Conversation becomes Collusion</p><p>The panelists discussed the point at which the exchange of information becomes anticompetitive conduct - or worst of all, a cartel. All agreed that the line between lawful information exchanges and collusion is hard to pin down, in part because there is a lack of clarity both in the guidelines within jurisdictions and because of the differences between the guidelines provided by different jurisdictions. This makes information sharing particularly tricky for multinational corporations operating across jurisdictions. The panelists agreed that it would be useful to see more coordination between competition enforcement agencies in developing common guidelines on this topic.</p><p>The panelists noted that trade association meetings are particularly high risk. They recommended that companies have competition counsel present during these meetings in order to minimize the risk of competition concerns arising.</p><p>The following practical tips arose from this panel discussion:</p><p> Limit the information exchanged to historical - rather than future - information.Disseminate aggregated - rather than disaggregated - information.Prohibit sales and marketing personnel from receiving competitively sensitive information, if such information is shared at all.Always seek advice from competition counsel.</p><p>For more practical advice about information sharing, see  Mitigating the Risk of Pre-Closing Information Exchanges.</p><p>Elections</p><p>The conference closed with a lively and interactive discussion concerning the impact of the upcoming U.S. presidential and European parliamentary elections on competition law. The consensus seemed to be that politics matters less in antitrust than people may think because there is a bipartisan understanding that antitrust is about economics and that regulators need to pick cases they can win in court.</p><p>*****</p><p>Thank you to the conference chairs, moderators, panelists, sponsors and GCR for organizing an event that brings together women from the global antitrust community.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.</p><p><br/> Ms Jenna L.

Good Monday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and  it is Monday January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.  Getting tough on trade, President Trump's America First  message already being tested as Mexico and Canada have rejected a proposal  by the White House to rework a key part of the North American Free Trade  Agreement.  This comes as the Commander-in-Chief  targets Europe this  morning signaling possible payback over what he calls unfair trade policies  with the European Union.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a lot of problems with  European Union and it may work into something very big from that  standpoint, from the trade standpoint.  The European Union has treated the  United States very unfairly when it came to trade.  The European Union has  been very, very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to  be very much to their -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president will address the trade debate as well as the U.S.  economic boom during the first State of the Union Address since taking  office where it takes place tomorrow night.  We will have it for you live  9:00 p.m. Eastern right here on the Fox Business Network.  The address  comes as major indices all closed at record levels again on Friday.  </p><p>Take a look at the momentum, Dow Industrials up almost one percent, 223  points higher, S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ both up better than one percent on  Friday.  This morning a bit of a pullback from those record high levels  take a look Dow Industrials expected to be down about 55 points of the  opening of trading a quarter of a percent lower.  S&amp;P 500 also down almost  a third of a percent and the NASDAQ weaker by 22 points that's one-third of  one percent.  </p><p>It is a merger Monday of sorts on Wall Street Dr. Pepper Snapple and Keurig  Green Mountain announcing plans to merge.  Dr. Pepper Snapple shareholders  will receive 103.57 share in special cash dividends and retain 13 percent  of a combined company.  Check out the movement of stock Dr. Pepper Snapple  shares up to 35 percent right now.  Investors are also eyeing orange from  several key names this week, this is one of the busiest weeks so far for  the fourth quarter.  Lockheed Martin both earnings and revenue topped  expectations and the stock this morning is up 3 and quarter percent.  The  defense contract just have been soaring over last year.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, the market look like this, take a look, FTSE 100 up  a quarter of a percent, 16 points higher.  CAC Quarante is up a fraction  and the DAX index is down a fraction.  In Asia overnight, stocks were  mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is up one percent.  Apple  may take a bite out of the iPhone, a new report that claims the technology  giant may cut iPhone X production in half in the first quarter not doing as  well as they thought I guess.  </p><p>Is technology putting our troops in danger?  The new concern over a fitness  app that's used on devices like Fitbit.  They are basically indicating  exactly where our troops are in the Middle East plus Hillary Clinton uses  the Grammy stage to mock President Trump.  The appearance that's leaving  many feelings fire and fury this morning.  All the stories coming up this  Monday morning.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Dagen McDowell, Fox Business Network,  it's Dagen McDowell, PwC partner Mitch Roschelle, and Pollster and the  President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter.  Good to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lots to talk about today and the State of the Union.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  Oh yes.  Busy week.  </p><p>CARTER:  Whoo-hoo.  I'm really excited about the State of the Union, you  know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, me too.  We have the State of the Union, we got the FOMC  coming out on Wednesday, no interest rate increases expected yet a huge  amount of earnings and then the jobs numbers are on Friday.  So yes it's a  busy week.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  And we keep an eye on  the 10 year treasury yield because again it -- this is why trade policy and  interest rate policy inflation all of wraps up to create some concerns for  the market.  From here, you know, to talk down the dollar you heard that  from treasury secretary last week.  Again lower dollar means we are  importing inflation that means what does the federal reserve it, that means  that we could have higher interest rates this country cannot afford  significantly higher interest rates given the levels of debt that were  riding and therein lies the problem because Washington won't do anything  about these looming problems in terms of the national debt because we're  facing a tsunami.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, they're not going to do anything about it  during an election year, right?  Forget about that.  By the way, I know  that you don't want to have the treasury secretary talking down anything or  talking up anything for that matter.  And you mentioned the op-ed and the  journal the other day, but don't you in some ways Steven Mnuchin was saying  what was so obvious what every administration feels anyway from the  beginning of time that yes, a weaker dollar is better for trade, it's just  that they don't say it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can say it if you're not the treasury secretary and you can  think it if you're the treasury secretary but when it comes to the United  States dollar our dear greenback, you just say we support a strong dollar  policy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is every administration has said but they don't do things  to indicate that's really how they feel that's what I am saying, I feel  like they all think it he just said it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way President Trump can say whatever he wants but  maybe his cabinet members need to rethink that strategy.  </p><p>BARTIROMOR:  Yes, you don't think anybody believed the walk back, do you?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, not at all.  Not safe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this morning, former presidential candidate and former  Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is joining us.  He'll be with us  momentarily, Eric Trump's wife, President Trump's daughter-in-law Lara  Trump for president, senior-adviser Lara Trump is here and the COO of  Lamborghini America Alessandro Farmeschi is joining us as well, host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney as well is here weighing in.  Don't miss a  moment of it.  First now, let's kick it off with the top stories this hour.   Trump administration's trade agenda Canada and Mexico are now rejecting a  proposal from the White House to rework a key part of NAFTA.  Meanwhile,  President Trump is hinting at retaliation against the E.U. from what he  says is very unfair trade practices.  Blake Burman is live at the White  House the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, so much for all  the niceties coming out of Davos.  Maria, good morning to you as well,  President Trump giving an interview to Piers Morgan that was shot during  world the economic forum but aired for the first time yesterday and in it  the president saying that he has a lot of problems with European Union.   The president saying on the trade standpoint that, we can't get our  products in and the U.S. products come in at a very low taxable rate.  The  president saying that this could quote morph into something very big from a  trade standpoint.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>D. TRUMP:  The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly  when it came to trade, they are not the only ones by the way, I could name  many countries and places that do -- but the European Union has been very,  very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to be very  much to their detriment.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, the Wall Street journal is reporting Mexico and Canada  rejected a proposal from the U.S. to change the corporate arbitration  system that is wrapped into NAFTA, it's called the investor state dispute  settlement and that deals with arbitration claims from companies within all  three countries.  Maria, as you know when he spoke to the commerce  secretary, Wilbur Ross on set there in Davos last week.  He said things are  just beginning from the negotiating standpoint as it relates to NAFTA.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thanks very much.  We will keep following  that.  Joining us right now is former presidential candidate from Arkansas  Governor Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee.  Governor, it's good to see  you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Well, thank you Maria.  Great to  be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, your reaction here as we know that Canada and Mexico are  rejecting this proposal to rework the arbitration part of the NAFTA  agreement.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I'm sure they would but I think they also have to  understand that Donald Trump is elected in large measure because he said he  would renegotiate the trade deals make it more fair for the United States.   None of these trade deals came from Mount Sinai, they weren't on Two  Tablets of Stone, they all have the provision that they are made to be  changed and to be updated as the economy changes, as conditions change and  I think this president should be commended for saying you know what our job  is to protect America, American jobs, American economy, we are going to do  that, we want to trade that is all an important part of growth.  But it's  got to be where it's reciprocal and fair.  Bravo to the president for doing  exactly what he said something were not used to seeing politicians often  do.  </p><p>CARTER:  So governor, I have a question for you.  You know, there is so  much talk about how these trade policies -- if we don't get a deal on it  might harm U.S.  What about these other countries, if they don't do a deal  with us, is it going to hurt them as well? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Of course it would Lee.  And I think that's something that maybe  needs to be said a whole lot more.  I don't hear a lot of people saying  what you just said and thank you for saying it because some of these  countries they've got a whole lot more to lose than we do.  Because they  are utterly dependent upon our dollars buying their products and if we  decide look, you guys aren't playing fair so, you know, we'll look  elsewhere.  It's going to put them in a world of hurt, it is really a  position of strength that the president looks at.  And this is not a  president who sees America as weak, a country we have to apologize for,  even our economic strength is not a weakness it is something that we should  be proud of and we got there by capitalism.  Capitalism is a good thing, it  empowers people, it helps poor people to become not so poor people and  without it we end up like Venezuela.  I think we got a great model to say  to the rest of the world you want to be better off?  Be capitalist, it  works.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor, it is Dagen McDowell but some of these policies that  the world doesn't exist in a vacuum that these other countries when you --  you have to say these tariffs that were slapped on solar cells and washing  machines just last week that actually does impact jobs here in the United  States.  The jobs created by companies like Samsung and the very red state  of South Carolina, you have higher prices on washing machines, you've  already heard that from L.G. Electronics so again this actually is done  poorly and this is kind of a little willy-nilly side thing with the small  tariffs.  It's not -- it's not the sky is falling.  But again it can hurt  Americans if executed improperly or poorly.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Short term that may be true but long term a trade deal where  everybody is playing with the same rules is like playing the Super Bowl  where everyone has to play within same rules.  If one team gets special  treatment and the other team doesn't that is not a fair game, you don't  know who the champion is.  So short term there may be some, you know, some  pain.  But the long term is the prices are more realistically reflecting  what it cost to produce something, it does mean that Americans have a  chance to compete to make those very things.  But Americans need to make  things, we always have to be able to do some things that if we don't we  can't be free.  Provide our own energy, make our own food, be able to feed  ourselves and to be able to fight for ourselves which means we manufacture  our weaponry and items of defense.  Manufacturing is a critical part not  just of our economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But quite frankly without it, we can't be free.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we already saw L.G. get back and say look we are going to  raise prices.  Now, obviously if there are going to be tariffs on certain  products these companies just going to raise prices.  So that's going to be  a negative for consumers having said that there is real impact from this  tax plan that's very positive.  And yet house minority leader Nancy Pelosi  continues to criticize it.  She's getting a criticism from even within her  own party governor after dismissing the president's immigration plan, she's  now calling it make America white again proposal.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE, MINORITY LEADER:  That  plan is a campaign to make America white again.  </p><p>SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D) WV:  We don't need that type of rhetoric either side.   From Nancy, Paul Ryan, or anybody else and I come down this, the president  has laid out a template.  We are going to look at that template and we are  going to work with it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know governor before we get your reaction, I got to get the  panel's reaction.  I mean what --she is not doing anything that is showing  progress for her party.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean she keeps -- making America white crumbs like you said  Armageddon.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Armageddon, this pathetic little crumbs, a thousand dollars is  pathetic crumbs to her.  It's a little piece of cheese.  I think that she  is doubling down but she doesn't -- she sounds moronic and she's doubling  down on these comments.  I don't understand in what universe she thinks  that this resonates with the American people.  Let me say this again, a  thousand dollars is more than 20 tanks of gas, a thousand dollars can feed  a family of four in this country for nearly a month and she lives in a  bubble that is San Francisco.  </p><p>CARTER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely true.  Governor, your reaction?  Jump in here.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I tell you Nancy Pelosi is making Marie Antoinette look  like Mary Poppins.  Oh my gosh, to say the things that she says that is so  condescending, so insulting to working class people.  Now that's a group of  people Nancy Pelosi doesn't relate to, doesn't understand because she lives  above them but as Dagen was pointing out and I think so very graphically, a  thousand dollars to a family who has a $50,000 annual income look that is a  huge amount of money and for most families that is significant, that is a  vacation, that is being able to go to the dentist that's a lot of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but governor you know what the Republicans have some  problems of their own.  They're distancing themselves after the Steve Wynn  allegations, one of the top stories in the journal.  Wynn allegations  ripple as Republicans seek distance, in the wake of the Wall Street journal  report from former employees that there was constant or decades long  patterns of sexual misconduct.  What say you about that?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it is a horrible thing.  And I am glad that as these  things come to life, there's a severance between Steve Wynn and the  Republican Party.  But if they had known about it and it had been widely  known and then they continue the relationship that would be scandalous the  fact that they weren't aware of it, they became aware of it, they cut ties.   I am not sure what the scandal for the republicans is as much as it is a  scandal for Steve Wynn and the tragedy of the people that he abused.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we should point out that the Republicans have raised a lot  of money this year much more than on the democratic side.  But of course he  really was a kingpin in terms of raising money.  Governor, good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much.  Stay with us tomorrow.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are going to be live in Washington for the State of the  Union.  We'll be speaking with former DNC Chair Donna Brazil, past Majority  Leader Kevin McCarthy, Congressman Michael McCaul and the Head of Small  Business Administration Linda McMahon, plus former White House Chief of  Staff Josh Bolten with us as well.  We have a big show tomorrow live from  D.C. as we preview the State of the Union.  Back in a moment right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Explosions, gunfire, rocking a military base in  Afghanistan killing nearly a dozen soldiers, this is the latest in a wave  of terrorist attacks across the country.  Cheryl Casone with the details  there, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right Maria.  So at  least 11 soldiers have been killed, 16 of those wounded in an early morning  assault on military compound in Kabul.  The Islamic State group is claiming  responsibility, this comes only two days after more than a hundred people  were killed in a suicide attack in the Afghan capital.  This month alone  more than 200 people have been killed, hundreds wounded in a series of  attacks unleashed by the Taliban and the rival Isis.  </p><p>Meanwhile, a popular fitness app is revealing top secret information about  the location of U.S. military bases.  The Washington post is reporting that  the app called Strava shows heat maps which pinpoints soldiers' workouts  that they're doing their undisclosed military base even spy out posts.   Their information is now out there, it's part of Strava's GPS gathering  that is available we should say on smartphones and more importantly the  Fitbit which a lot soldiers like to wear.  </p><p>Well, it is merger Monday in the the beverage industry Dr. Pepper Snapple  and Keurig Green Mountain are teaming up, it's a great accompany with the  combined revenue of $11 billion.  Dr. Pepper Snapple's shareholders getting  a special cash dividend nearly $104 per share they will hold a 13 percent  stake in the newly formed company.  The stock is soaring in the premarket  as you can see up about 30 -- nearly 38 percent right now, huge stock to  watch today.  Now you can basically -- I guess you can get Dr. Pepper out  of your machine, I made that up.  All right.  Just kidding.  A solid joke.   All right.  </p><p>And finally this, Apple is reportedly cutting its iPhone X production in  half in the first quarter, this move following disappointing holiday sales  in Europe, the West China.  Japan's Nikkei Asia reviews that Apple slashed  in production down to 20 million units.  The publications says part of the  problem here could be the iPhone's price tag which starts at about a  thousand dollars.  Shares of Apple down more than three percent over the  last week on concerns about those iPhone sales that stock, remember the  company is reporting earnings later this week.  </p><p>And then Japan based cryptocurrency exchange coin check has announced it's  going to refund customers about $400 million that was stolen by hackers.   About 260,000 people lost their holdings of NEM, this is the world's 10th  biggest cryptocurrency last week anyway.  Meanwhile, so the U.S. credit  card companies are now expected to restrict the purchase of  cryptocurrencies in general.  Citigroup, Bank of America are reviewing the  policies for this.  Capital One already deciding it will not allow  customers to use credit cards to buy any digital currency.  Right now, one  Bitcoin worth about $11,000 right now, you'll never know when it's going to  start over.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Down from 20,000 a couple -- a week ago.  Cheryl, thank  you.  Coming up, the Grammys get political, the controversy after Hillary  Clinton makes a cameo appearance and bashes President Trump.  Then made in  the USA, how a luxury eyewear company is changing the industry by  manufacturing their products domestically.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The eyewear industry, the glasses industry in  focus this morning while eyeglasses are in essential for millions of  Americans.  95 percent of all frames are made outside the United States  according to the Alliance for American Manufacturing.  But a company in  Chicago is looking to change that, State Optical assembles all of its  eyewear here in the United States and we love made in the USA so we are  happy to welcome Scott Shapiro to the program.  State Optical company CEO  and co-founder.  Scott, great to see you.</p><p>SCOTT SHAPIRO, CEO, STATE OPTICAL:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  So we are all trying on the  glasses.  I love the way those look on you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am blonde legally and so I need a new pair of glasses because  I fall asleep in them all the time and crush them and these are -- these  are beautifully made.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  They look great on you.</p><p>CARTER:  They look great on you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you get by manufacturing in the United States?  Where  here all day having a conversation about trade and about tariffs and tell  us how this is economically positive for you.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So, first and foremost, you know, there is a lot of pride that  goes with making products here in United States.  We get to put Americans  back to work.  There is about 50 craftsmen working in our factory today  that wouldn't have those jobs if we were outsourcing that overseas.  But I  think much more importantly for our brand is it really connects the  patients or the customers with the craft of making eyewear.  You know, we  say in our factory it takes 70 steps to make one pair of glasses and over  50 percent of that has to be done by hand.  So, I think, you know, in our  industry, there is a lot of -- there is a large misconception about what a  pair of glasses should be worth, what really goes into making high quality  eyewear. And by making it here in the United States, it gives us the  opportunity to tell that story to really get people in touch with that  craft.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Scott, one of the things that we hear, see, and say all the  time and I'm curious about your perspective is finding talents.  So you  said you have 50 people in Chicago, is finding talent a challenge for your  business?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Very, very difficult.  So I think what we don't talk about a lot  talk when we talk about bringing manufacturing back to United States is the  lack of infrastructure we have here in the U.S. to make things particularly  something like eyewear.  It is a skilled -- it's a very skilled labor.  And  so everyone of those 50 craftsmen that we trained in our factory have to be  trained from step one.  None of them have any experience doing that.  And  it generally takes about six months to get someone up and running before  they can do the job on their own.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Most to the high-end eyewear that would be in the same league as  your glasses is made in Japan and you mentioned earlier in Italy.  This  retail, the ones I've got on for about $400 dollars but is your profit  margin slimmer than those manufacturers overseas because your labor costs  are more expensive here?  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  So great question.  First and foremost, I should say that most of  the product that says -- or  I won't say that, a lot of the product that  says made in Italy, made in Japan is in fact made in China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  A vast majority of product made in China and there's a lot of  ways to get around that country of origin.  But the product that is  genuinely made in Italy or made in Japan, you know, their workforce is  well-paid as well, those workers also get paid a similar wage to workers in  the United States.  So our profit margins aren't significantly worse than  theirs.  And in fact, there is a lot of benefits conveniences that we  benefit from by making frames here in United States.  So a lot of -- a lot  of advantages that offset that difference.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do people get the glasses?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So, we're in over 1100 retail locations currently.  All  independent eye care providers.  So, you mentioned you have an optometrist  across the street, they might carry the product but only independent  offices.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really great.  Scott, great to have you on the show today.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scot Shapiro.  We love your glasses.  These are beautiful.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Yes.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up.  President Trump first State of the  Union and Trump for president senior adviser Lara Trump will weigh in on  what to expect.  That's next.  And Lockheed Martin reports fourth-quarter  results, beating earnings and revenue expectations.  We break down those  numbers.  Stock is up about three percent right now.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining me this Monday.  It is Monday, January 29th.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.   President Trump gears up for his first State of the Union Address tomorrow  night.

Join us live from D.C. as we preview and  analyze the president's first State of the Union.  Plus, Hillary Clinton  making a surprise appearance at the Grammy Awards last night, taking an  opportunity to slam the president.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He had a long-time fear of  being poisoned.  One reason why he liked to like to eat at McDonald's,  nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made.  </p><p>JAMES CORDEN, HOST, GRAMMY AWARDS:  That's it.  We got it.  That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON:  You think so?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Trump family members coming up, straight ahead.   Plus, futures pointing to a weaker opening for the broader averages today  as we kick off the new week on Wall Street after another record-setter last  week.  Personal income and spending just hit the wires, both measures  rising four-tenths of one percent in the month of December.  It is a big  week for the markets because the markets are looking lower but they've got  a lot to react to this week including an FOMC meeting on Wednesday.  The  State of the Union, Tuesday night.  Apple earnings as well as Amazon  earnings on Thursday and then the jobs number on Friday.  </p><p>This all after the major indices closed at another record- high on Friday  due to strong corporate earnings.  Take a look at that market.  Dow  Industrials up 223 points Friday, NASDAQ up 95 points.  Global markets this  morning are mixed.  Take a look, European indices are edging higher in  London and in Paris but the DAX in Germany is fractionally lower.  In Asia  overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is  up one percent.  Earnings in focus on Wall Street once again.  This is the  busiest week so far for fourth-quarter earnings.  Lockheed Martin kicked  off the busiest week for the fourth quarter with a beat on earnings and  revenue.  The stock is up 3-1/4 percent surging after the defense giant  also offer an upbeat outlook for 2018.</p><p>Intel under fire again this morning.

We have a look at the new ride from Lamborghini as I speak with  the company's COO and he takes us inside those hot wheels.  All of that  coming up this morning.  But first, topping our news this half an hour.   Hillary Clinton's Grammy jab.  The former presidential candidate makes a  surprise appearance at the awards show last night to mock the president and  read from the book Fire and Fury.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  He had a longtime fear of being poisoned, one reason why he liked  to eat at McDonald's, nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely  pre-made.</p><p>CORDEN:  That's it.  We got it.  That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON:  You think so?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Joining me right now is Trump for President Senior  Adviser and the President's daughter-in-law, Laura Trump.  Great to see  you.  Thank you so much, Lara.</p><p>LARA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Your brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr. tweeted  this this morning after the Grammys.  The more Hillary goes on television  the more the American people realize how awesome it is to have Donald Trump  in office.  Lara?</p><p>L. TRUMP:  True.  It's so true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you -- did you watch the Grammys?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  You know what, Maria, I stopped watching all these shows a long  time ago for this exact reason and I think the American public as a whole  probably feels the same way.  I thought it was despicable, disgusting, and  quite frankly sad that Hillary Clinton obviously needs to validate herself  in some way.  If she's so keen on reading things, maybe she could read us  her 33,000 missing e-mails because I think I love to hear about those.  It  was just so disrespectful.  I'm so sad that this is the point that this  awards show has come to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's also -- from a marketing standpoint or a business  standpoint, not very smart because it's just making this assumption that  everybody agrees with you.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  And obviously the country does not agree because Donald  Trump is our president, they chose him November 8th, 2016.  Look at where  this country has come in a year that he's been in office.  You know, the  economy is booming, people are back to work, unemployment is at, you know,  record-lows right now and we have so much to look forward to from this  president and I think even people that didn't vote are starting to get  onboard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you make a lot of good point because the President does  have a great story to tell --  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- for the State of the Union tomorrow night.  He is preparing  for his first State of the Union tomorrow night and obviously the economy  is going to be a positive story that's going to be one thing to talk about  also foreign policy.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much are you expecting him to get into things like ISIS  being defeated.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think he should talk about it because nobody does.  We  went from 44,000 ISIS fighters, just about a year ago to under 1,000 right  now and it's really under reported but that's huge, people in this country  as of even a year ago, we're very scared about how we were going to defeat  ISIS, is it possible?  I'm sure we're going to hear about that, were going  to hear about the fact that on the world stage, the United States has  reclaimed its place as the leader.  You know, you see my father-in-law  traveled to different countries, you see the respect that he's given -- the  welcome that he's given in these different countries.  It's so great that  we have our country back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what he said when he was in Davos, also talking  about the economic strength like jobs, like the unemployment rate, where it  is and also the regulatory framework which is rolled back.  You know, it  feels like there is a big runway to this because there's a number of  sectors that have not been impacted yet form the regulatory rollback.  Is  he expecting this 0-- the good times to get even better?  I mean, in 2018  and '19, he's talking about continued economic growth.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think so, I mean, regulatory reform is obviously huge.   You're going to see these tax cuts kick in.  I mean, people next week are  going to see their paychecks higher in this country.  Thanks to Donald  Trump.  And I think he is right, this is super charged the economy, I think  2018, 2019 even there's opportunity for a lot of more growth in this  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do we have it then, economic issues in the State of the  Union perhaps an infrastructure plan?  He's going to talk about that as  well, right?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I'm excited as you are, see here what he's going to talk  about, I'm sure immigration will be on there as well.  That's such a huge  topic, you know, it feels like it's on the one yard line, we'er almost  there and it's something that's so needed and necessary in this country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will you be in the hall there tomorrow night?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  We're hoping to be there.  Yes. I think so.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this because of course, then there's some bad  news as well for the Republicans this morning and that is Las Vegas real  estate casino mogul Steve Wynn resigning as finance chair for the RNC after  reports of years of sexual misconduct here.  Wynn has denied wrongdoing we  should say but in a statement, he did not want to be a distraction, he said  to the Republican Party.  What's your take on this?  Shares of Wynn Resorts  down sharply as the company announced it will form a committee to  investigate these allegations, Lara.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  Well, I don't know too much about it to be honest with  you.  I know he resigned and Ronna, the chairwoman of the RNC who's  amazing, accepted his resignation and she's going to do what's best for the  party.  And, you know, we're sad to see him go.  He was a great supporter  of the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, at the same time, the Republican Party has been raising a  lot of money, much more than the Democrats.  And so, as you see that nest  egg getting bigger, it must tell you that business and big donors out there  are seeing more opportunity on the RNC side.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, not just -- not just big donors but a lot of the majority  of the money that we raised is small dollars, that means that the average  person in this country is supporting what the President is doing.  They  want to see him in office again for another four years in 2020 and I think  that speaks volumes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are President's plans?  I mean, when you talk with him  sort of off-line, not an official capacity but as his daughter-in-law, what  does he want to get accomplished for the next three years?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I mean it's what you heard on the campaign trail which he  is delivering on.  He -- the economy was so big to him and obviously as a  businessman that was something that, you know, was his target from the very  beginning.  Let's reboot the economy, let's get it moving, you see where we  are now, the Dow hit all-time highs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we need as a business, look, get stuff done on time, get it  under budget.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a really good lesson.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  No.  It's so true.  I mean, you look at -- I always talk about  the Wollman Rink and the story there that the city had it for so long, they  couldn't get an ice skating rink though in Central Park.  Donald Trump came  in, ahead of schedule under budget and that's what he wants to do for this  country and I think we're seeing it happens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a great point that you make because I was talking  about somebody else with that regulations.  It took 13 years to build a  bridge in Bayonne, took another 25 years to do an infrastructure plan in  Alaska.  This rollback in regulations just sort of has unleashed animal  spirits.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  Cut through the red tape, let's get it done and this  country deserves it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- but the detractors are still there, Lara.  How is the  President dealing with the media backlash, the backlash on the left when  you see Nancy Pelosi calling the $1,000 checks crumbs?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, that's just -- that's plain sad and it's ridiculous.  I  think a lot of people in this country would be thrilled to have $1,000 and  it's sad that she thinks it's crumbs.  And listen, they proved themselves  wrong every single day, they lied about these tax cuts that people are  going to see next week that it's true that the majority of people in this  country, 91 percent of people are going to be making more money.  And I  think every single day, you know, those people on the left that have been  so harsh on Donald Trump, on our president, every day they discredit  themselves and they prove themselves wrong a little bit more.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you doing in terms of the 2020 campaign at this point?   Do we have a sense of who will be running against your father-in-law?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think we ruled out Oprah.  initially we thought that was  a -- well, like a week ago.  You know what, I don't know, I love to know  who it's going to be.  I think we are just -- we're raising money as you  said, you know, and I think the president is going to be able to run on,  you know, the great job that he is doing for this country.  His track  record is going to I think easily take him into another four years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually since the Democrats are coming out with the resist  and, you know, pushing back instead of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>L. TRUMP:  That's all they have.  They have no message, they have no  leader, they have no agenda  other than resist.  And it's very obvious,  it's very transparent to people I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lara.  Great to see you.  Before you go, any updates  on baby Luke?</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, we had him on the pool down to Mar-a-Lago, so we're trying  to get him swimming.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's so great.  We have a picture, I wanted to share that  picture --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Oh, his first haircut.  Yes.  Down in Florida too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cute in his first hair cut.  Congratulations, Lara and Eric  Trump.  Good to see you.</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Coming up.  New concerns over Intel's computer  chip flaws.  Why the company reportedly warned Chinese companies it will  (INAUDIBLE) the U.S. government about the security vulnerabilities.  And  then the Lamborghini gets family friendly.  We've got the luxury  automaker's newest SUV in our plaza.  I'll talk with the COO of the  company.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big week on Wall Street even technology earnings this week,  Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, all set to report their numbers  this week.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney to  look ahead.  Stu, good morning to you.  </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  I've got  to two words.  Maybe three.  Don't disappoint because if any of these big  five and this Wednesday and Thursday when we get the big five results.  If  they really disappoint, I think you can put a crack in the market.  All the  --not all.  A backtrack again, a lot of the money going into the market has  gone into the five big tech stocks on expectation of stellar performances  each and every quarter.  If any of them falters, I think you'll see the  market overall falter, but you know, I think, Maria, there's another kind  of test coming here as well.  </p><p>What are the big tech companies going to do with the money that they're  bringing back to America and the money that they're going to get extra from  the tax cuts?  I suspect that a good chunk of it will go to stock buybacks,  and/or dividend increases.  And I think the left will go nuts about that,  that will be truly crumbs for the workers, crumbs for America, and  everything goes to the rich stockholders.  I don't agree with that point of  view, but I think that's what they're going to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I agree there's not a lot of room for error here.  These  stocks are up big time in the last year.  But, Stu, you know, my worry on  technology is the regulatory part of thing.  I think you're going to see as  Donald Trump is rolling back regulations for this economy, actually, I  think there's a new approach to technology, because these companies are  more powerful than we have ever known, today, and they're probably going to  see higher regulation, you see it happen in Europe, and I think you're  going to see it here in the U.S.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, but I want to know what kind of regulation.  It's very hard  to break up, say, an Amazon on antitrust grounds because basically what  they're doing is helping the everyday consumer and lowering prices, it's to  America's benefit that this company exists.  So, I'm not sure of what  framework they would use to regulate them and rein them in, but I do agree  with you that it's heavy pressure to do just that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because they had so much information on us.  They may be  helping the average person but we're giving something up in the process,  and that is privacy, that we've got all these data.  So, much is that data  worth to government that's overseeing all of this?  That's all I'm saying,  I just think that the regulatory environment is going to be an unknown for  these companies.</p><p>VARNEY:  And why don't I get a piece of the action?  If they know  everything about me and they sell that information to somebody else albeit  anonymously, I don't care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Where do I come in here?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You made my point.  That's exactly right.  Stu, we're going to  look at those numbers and we'll see if it cracks this market.  It's going  to be -- have to be really bad to do that.  Stuart, thank you, we'll see  you in about 10 minutes with more on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" top of the hour  right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart.  First though, Lockheed  Martin beats on fourth-quarter revenue, expects a rise in earnings this  year.  Good guidance has that stock up three percent right now.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching Lockheed  and the broader market.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   You're absolutely right.  Taking a look at Lockheed Martin which is to the  upside.  They came out with a fourth-quarter revenue.  It beat the streak.   Stock is up almost three percent, 2.79, to be precise, 345 and change.   They did so well on the higher sales F-35 fighter jet program, also raising  guidance for 2018.  And don't forget, President Trump's administration, the  Defense Department is ready to fork it out, and in fact, ready to spend  about $391 billion over 15 years to develop and buy more than 2400 of the  supersonic warplanes.  So, a winner here for Lockheed Martin and going  forward, also upside potential.  </p><p>Then there's Intel, this is an ongoing story about the security flaws;  these are critical.  The question is why China's government may have known  more before about it before even the U.S. government because it seems that  they actually let notified a small group of customers, including some  Chinese technology customers and because China's government actually  monitors those types of conversations, in fact, the Chinese government may  have known before the USA, the left out the USA government to let them know  about these security flaws.  The stock is looking down about a half of one  percent, but it's up almost 32 percent in the last 52 weeks.  So, it has  been a great performer like many of the tech stocks.</p><p>And coming up, this is great.  I love it because I'm definitely into this.   A Lamborghini for your whole family, Maria.  Checking this one out.  Cool  features of the Italian automaker's newest luxury SUV, Lamborghini, with  Maria, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As I come to you from the plaza right now, we've  got a set of hot wheels to show you because Lamborghini is roaring in and  rolling into the SUV market.  Joining me right now is the Chief Operating  Officer of Lamborghini America, Alessandro Farmeschi.  Good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much for joining us, Alessandro.</p><p>ALESSANDRO FARMESCHI, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, LAMBORGHINI AMERICA:  Good  morning.  Our pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to look at the car in a moment.  But first,  characterize what you're seeing out there in terms of -- in terms of  business and the market.  How is the reception for these new -- these new  cars?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Oh, the reception is unbelievable.  I'd say that we have  already sold out entirely the 2018.  We are receiving great, great response  from our customers here in U.S. but also worldwide, I would say.  This is a  great news, the fastest SUV in the planet.  And so -- and the only one, by  the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about it.  This is the Urus.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Urus.  And this is -- it goes 189 miles an hour?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about it.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, this is a super sports car, so it has all the feature of a  super sports car.  650 horsepower, 0-60 to -- in 3.6 seconds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>FARMESCHI:  And it has all the technology to support the performances and  the agility and the emotion, I would say, of a pure Lamborghini.  Also, in  terms of design, of a super sports car.  Therefore, this car is conceived  also not to be just a super sports car but also an SUV.  So, it has the  (INAUDIBLE) agility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Just the fact that you are into the SUV market.  I  mean, you said earlier, this can hold a couple of golf bags.  What was so  important -- why was it so important for a Lamborghini to be here, to be in  the SUV market?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Basically, what we saw is that the SUV segment is expanding  every year.  And number one, United States is having a great success.   Before, we believed that not having anything in the super sports segment in  the SUV environment, we believe that this was the perfect package to also  families, our clients, a different way of living the Lamborghini every day,  living Lamborghini during the weekends, during the holidays with their  friends so because you can host four, five people, you space for three golf  bags.  And so, I mean, this the perfect combination.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, Alessandro, I know that you reported global  sales up in the double digits, just recently you did.  You took the car at  the Detroit Auto Show.  How much does this cost?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  This cost $200,000.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  $200,000.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, we start from there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how does that fit in the overall pricing of Lamborghini?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  This is, like we say, almost in line with our Huracan.  And is  positioned at the right level to -- let me say -- offer a different product  that's not just only a super sports car but something more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It feels like a super sports car as well as a big family -- it  is very family friendly.  And this is gorgeous.  Tell us about the  interior.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Here, you can see that you have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, now, I feel like I'm in a Lamborghini.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  You immediately --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Immediately.  You're absolutely right.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  (INAUDIBLE) new seater.  So, the seats are sporty.  Also here,  the interior, you have here in the middle, all the commands like you are in  a aircraft or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  You got my iPad right here, right?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes.  These are two touchscreens and then you --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two iPads.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, yes, yes.  Two iPads, all both touchscreen so you can go  and surf here in the navi system into the infotainment system, and you can  also with the sensor levers select the driving modes; you can drive in a  comfortable way, you can have a sporty way, race way, but also this is the  new speaker.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's almost like autonomous?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  It's not exactly autonomous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not exactly autonomous because you can't stop and not --  you can't control.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  (INAUDIBLE) the driver is always at the center, because we  speak about emotions, and for us, driving the Lamborghini is key, all of  our clients want to drive their Lamborghini.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's fantastic.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  And in terms of support, the driver, we also provide the  technology to help the driver, so recently in this car, we have a full  advance driver assistance system that helps the driver in case of a  imminent crash to break the car and talk to support in case (INAUDIBLE)  situation the driver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why we talked all about autos at the CES Show,  the technology show, because technology is in all of the cars.  Alessandro,  this is beautiful, the moment I stepped in the car, I could tell you I'm in  a Lamborghini.  It's absolutely gorgeous, it's the Urus, and Alessandro  Farmeschi, it is good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once again, our thanks to Lamborghini and Alessandro Farmeschi,  thanks for showing me around this high-tech car.  Thank you, Dagen  McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, and Lee Carter.  We'll see you again tomorrow,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right  now.  Stuart, over to you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Maria, thank you very much indeed.  Now, this is not the way we  usually open the show.

Good Monday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and  it is Monday January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.  Getting tough on trade, President Trump's America First  message already being tested as Mexico and Canada have rejected a proposal  by the White House to rework a key part of the North American Free Trade  Agreement.  This comes as the Commander-in-Chief  targets Europe this  morning signaling possible payback over what he calls unfair trade policies  with the European Union.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a lot of problems with  European Union and it may work into something very big from that  standpoint, from the trade standpoint.  The European Union has treated the  United States very unfairly when it came to trade.  The European Union has  been very, very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to  be very much to their -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president will address the trade debate as well as the U.S.  economic boom during the first State of the Union Address since taking  office where it takes place tomorrow night.  We will have it for you live  9:00 p.m. Eastern right here on the Fox Business Network.  The address  comes as major indices all closed at record levels again on Friday.  </p><p>Take a look at the momentum, Dow Industrials up almost one percent, 223  points higher, S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ both up better than one percent on  Friday.  This morning a bit of a pullback from those record high levels  take a look Dow Industrials expected to be down about 55 points of the  opening of trading a quarter of a percent lower.  S&amp;P 500 also down almost  a third of a percent and the NASDAQ weaker by 22 points that's one-third of  one percent.  </p><p>It is a merger Monday of sorts on Wall Street Dr. Pepper Snapple and Keurig  Green Mountain announcing plans to merge.  Dr. Pepper Snapple shareholders  will receive 103.57 share in special cash dividends and retain 13 percent  of a combined company.  Check out the movement of stock Dr. Pepper Snapple  shares up to 35 percent right now.  Investors are also eyeing orange from  several key names this week, this is one of the busiest weeks so far for  the fourth quarter.  Lockheed Martin both earnings and revenue topped  expectations and the stock this morning is up 3 and quarter percent.  The  defense contract just have been soaring over last year.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, the market look like this, take a look, FTSE 100 up  a quarter of a percent, 16 points higher.  CAC Quarante is up a fraction  and the DAX index is down a fraction.  In Asia overnight, stocks were  mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is up one percent.  Apple  may take a bite out of the iPhone, a new report that claims the technology  giant may cut iPhone X production in half in the first quarter not doing as  well as they thought I guess.  </p><p>Is technology putting our troops in danger?  The new concern over a fitness  app that's used on devices like Fitbit.  They are basically indicating  exactly where our troops are in the Middle East plus Hillary Clinton uses  the Grammy stage to mock President Trump.  The appearance that's leaving  many feelings fire and fury this morning.  All the stories coming up this  Monday morning.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Dagen McDowell, Fox Business Network,  it's Dagen McDowell, PwC partner Mitch Roschelle, and Pollster and the  President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter.  Good to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lots to talk about today and the State of the Union.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  Oh yes.  Busy week.  </p><p>CARTER:  Whoo-hoo.  I'm really excited about the State of the Union, you  know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, me too.  We have the State of the Union, we got the FOMC  coming out on Wednesday, no interest rate increases expected yet a huge  amount of earnings and then the jobs numbers are on Friday.  So yes it's a  busy week.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  And we keep an eye on  the 10 year treasury yield because again it -- this is why trade policy and  interest rate policy inflation all of wraps up to create some concerns for  the market.  From here, you know, to talk down the dollar you heard that  from treasury secretary last week.  Again lower dollar means we are  importing inflation that means what does the federal reserve it, that means  that we could have higher interest rates this country cannot afford  significantly higher interest rates given the levels of debt that were  riding and therein lies the problem because Washington won't do anything  about these looming problems in terms of the national debt because we're  facing a tsunami.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, they're not going to do anything about it  during an election year, right?  Forget about that.  By the way, I know  that you don't want to have the treasury secretary talking down anything or  talking up anything for that matter.  And you mentioned the op-ed and the  journal the other day, but don't you in some ways Steven Mnuchin was saying  what was so obvious what every administration feels anyway from the  beginning of time that yes, a weaker dollar is better for trade, it's just  that they don't say it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can say it if you're not the treasury secretary and you can  think it if you're the treasury secretary but when it comes to the United  States dollar our dear greenback, you just say we support a strong dollar  policy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is every administration has said but they don't do things  to indicate that's really how they feel that's what I am saying, I feel  like they all think it he just said it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way President Trump can say whatever he wants but  maybe his cabinet members need to rethink that strategy.  </p><p>BARTIROMOR:  Yes, you don't think anybody believed the walk back, do you?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, not at all.  Not safe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this morning, former presidential candidate and former  Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is joining us.  He'll be with us  momentarily, Eric Trump's wife, President Trump's daughter-in-law Lara  Trump for president, senior-adviser Lara Trump is here and the COO of  Lamborghini America Alessandro Farmeschi is joining us as well, host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney as well is here weighing in.  Don't miss a  moment of it.  First now, let's kick it off with the top stories this hour.   Trump administration's trade agenda Canada and Mexico are now rejecting a  proposal from the White House to rework a key part of NAFTA.  Meanwhile,  President Trump is hinting at retaliation against the E.U. from what he  says is very unfair trade practices.  Blake Burman is live at the White  House the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, so much for all  the niceties coming out of Davos.  Maria, good morning to you as well,  President Trump giving an interview to Piers Morgan that was shot during  world the economic forum but aired for the first time yesterday and in it  the president saying that he has a lot of problems with European Union.   The president saying on the trade standpoint that, we can't get our  products in and the U.S. products come in at a very low taxable rate.  The  president saying that this could quote morph into something very big from a  trade standpoint.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>D. TRUMP:  The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly  when it came to trade, they are not the only ones by the way, I could name  many countries and places that do -- but the European Union has been very,  very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to be very  much to their detriment.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, the Wall Street journal is reporting Mexico and Canada  rejected a proposal from the U.S. to change the corporate arbitration  system that is wrapped into NAFTA, it's called the investor state dispute  settlement and that deals with arbitration claims from companies within all  three countries.  Maria, as you know when he spoke to the commerce  secretary, Wilbur Ross on set there in Davos last week.  He said things are  just beginning from the negotiating standpoint as it relates to NAFTA.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thanks very much.  We will keep following  that.  Joining us right now is former presidential candidate from Arkansas  Governor Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee.  Governor, it's good to see  you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Well, thank you Maria.  Great to  be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, your reaction here as we know that Canada and Mexico are  rejecting this proposal to rework the arbitration part of the NAFTA  agreement.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I'm sure they would but I think they also have to  understand that Donald Trump is elected in large measure because he said he  would renegotiate the trade deals make it more fair for the United States.   None of these trade deals came from Mount Sinai, they weren't on Two  Tablets of Stone, they all have the provision that they are made to be  changed and to be updated as the economy changes, as conditions change and  I think this president should be commended for saying you know what our job  is to protect America, American jobs, American economy, we are going to do  that, we want to trade that is all an important part of growth.  But it's  got to be where it's reciprocal and fair.  Bravo to the president for doing  exactly what he said something were not used to seeing politicians often  do.  </p><p>CARTER:  So governor, I have a question for you.  You know, there is so  much talk about how these trade policies -- if we don't get a deal on it  might harm U.S.  What about these other countries, if they don't do a deal  with us, is it going to hurt them as well? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Of course it would Lee.  And I think that's something that maybe  needs to be said a whole lot more.  I don't hear a lot of people saying  what you just said and thank you for saying it because some of these  countries they've got a whole lot more to lose than we do.  Because they  are utterly dependent upon our dollars buying their products and if we  decide look, you guys aren't playing fair so, you know, we'll look  elsewhere.  It's going to put them in a world of hurt, it is really a  position of strength that the president looks at.  And this is not a  president who sees America as weak, a country we have to apologize for,  even our economic strength is not a weakness it is something that we should  be proud of and we got there by capitalism.  Capitalism is a good thing, it  empowers people, it helps poor people to become not so poor people and  without it we end up like Venezuela.  I think we got a great model to say  to the rest of the world you want to be better off?  Be capitalist, it  works.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor, it is Dagen McDowell but some of these policies that  the world doesn't exist in a vacuum that these other countries when you --  you have to say these tariffs that were slapped on solar cells and washing  machines just last week that actually does impact jobs here in the United  States.  The jobs created by companies like Samsung and the very red state  of South Carolina, you have higher prices on washing machines, you've  already heard that from L.G. Electronics so again this actually is done  poorly and this is kind of a little willy-nilly side thing with the small  tariffs.  It's not -- it's not the sky is falling.  But again it can hurt  Americans if executed improperly or poorly.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Short term that may be true but long term a trade deal where  everybody is playing with the same rules is like playing the Super Bowl  where everyone has to play within same rules.  If one team gets special  treatment and the other team doesn't that is not a fair game, you don't  know who the champion is.  So short term there may be some, you know, some  pain.  But the long term is the prices are more realistically reflecting  what it cost to produce something, it does mean that Americans have a  chance to compete to make those very things.  But Americans need to make  things, we always have to be able to do some things that if we don't we  can't be free.  Provide our own energy, make our own food, be able to feed  ourselves and to be able to fight for ourselves which means we manufacture  our weaponry and items of defense.  Manufacturing is a critical part not  just of our economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But quite frankly without it, we can't be free.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we already saw L.G. get back and say look we are going to  raise prices.  Now, obviously if there are going to be tariffs on certain  products these companies just going to raise prices.  So that's going to be  a negative for consumers having said that there is real impact from this  tax plan that's very positive.  And yet house minority leader Nancy Pelosi  continues to criticize it.  She's getting a criticism from even within her  own party governor after dismissing the president's immigration plan, she's  now calling it make America white again proposal.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE, MINORITY LEADER:  That  plan is a campaign to make America white again.  </p><p>SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D) WV:  We don't need that type of rhetoric either side.   From Nancy, Paul Ryan, or anybody else and I come down this, the president  has laid out a template.  We are going to look at that template and we are  going to work with it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know governor before we get your reaction, I got to get the  panel's reaction.  I mean what --she is not doing anything that is showing  progress for her party.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean she keeps -- making America white crumbs like you said  Armageddon.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Armageddon, this pathetic little crumbs, a thousand dollars is  pathetic crumbs to her.  It's a little piece of cheese.  I think that she  is doubling down but she doesn't -- she sounds moronic and she's doubling  down on these comments.  I don't understand in what universe she thinks  that this resonates with the American people.  Let me say this again, a  thousand dollars is more than 20 tanks of gas, a thousand dollars can feed  a family of four in this country for nearly a month and she lives in a  bubble that is San Francisco.  </p><p>CARTER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely true.  Governor, your reaction?  Jump in here.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I tell you Nancy Pelosi is making Marie Antoinette look  like Mary Poppins.  Oh my gosh, to say the things that she says that is so  condescending, so insulting to working class people.  Now that's a group of  people Nancy Pelosi doesn't relate to, doesn't understand because she lives  above them but as Dagen was pointing out and I think so very graphically, a  thousand dollars to a family who has a $50,000 annual income look that is a  huge amount of money and for most families that is significant, that is a  vacation, that is being able to go to the dentist that's a lot of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but governor you know what the Republicans have some  problems of their own.  They're distancing themselves after the Steve Wynn  allegations, one of the top stories in the journal.  Wynn allegations  ripple as Republicans seek distance, in the wake of the Wall Street journal  report from former employees that there was constant or decades long  patterns of sexual misconduct.  What say you about that?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it is a horrible thing.  And I am glad that as these  things come to life, there's a severance between Steve Wynn and the  Republican Party.  But if they had known about it and it had been widely  known and then they continue the relationship that would be scandalous the  fact that they weren't aware of it, they became aware of it, they cut ties.   I am not sure what the scandal for the republicans is as much as it is a  scandal for Steve Wynn and the tragedy of the people that he abused.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we should point out that the Republicans have raised a lot  of money this year much more than on the democratic side.  But of course he  really was a kingpin in terms of raising money.  Governor, good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much.  Stay with us tomorrow.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are going to be live in Washington for the State of the  Union.  We'll be speaking with former DNC Chair Donna Brazil, past Majority  Leader Kevin McCarthy, Congressman Michael McCaul and the Head of Small  Business Administration Linda McMahon, plus former White House Chief of  Staff Josh Bolten with us as well.  We have a big show tomorrow live from  D.C. as we preview the State of the Union.  Back in a moment right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Explosions, gunfire, rocking a military base in  Afghanistan killing nearly a dozen soldiers, this is the latest in a wave  of terrorist attacks across the country.  Cheryl Casone with the details  there, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right Maria.  So at  least 11 soldiers have been killed, 16 of those wounded in an early morning  assault on military compound in Kabul.  The Islamic State group is claiming  responsibility, this comes only two days after more than a hundred people  were killed in a suicide attack in the Afghan capital.  This month alone  more than 200 people have been killed, hundreds wounded in a series of  attacks unleashed by the Taliban and the rival Isis.  </p><p>Meanwhile, a popular fitness app is revealing top secret information about  the location of U.S. military bases.  The Washington post is reporting that  the app called Strava shows heat maps which pinpoints soldiers' workouts  that they're doing their undisclosed military base even spy out posts.   Their information is now out there, it's part of Strava's GPS gathering  that is available we should say on smartphones and more importantly the  Fitbit which a lot soldiers like to wear.  </p><p>Well, it is merger Monday in the the beverage industry Dr. Pepper Snapple  and Keurig Green Mountain are teaming up, it's a great accompany with the  combined revenue of $11 billion.  Dr. Pepper Snapple's shareholders getting  a special cash dividend nearly $104 per share they will hold a 13 percent  stake in the newly formed company.  The stock is soaring in the premarket  as you can see up about 30 -- nearly 38 percent right now, huge stock to  watch today.  Now you can basically -- I guess you can get Dr. Pepper out  of your machine, I made that up.  All right.  Just kidding.  A solid joke.   All right.  </p><p>And finally this, Apple is reportedly cutting its iPhone X production in  half in the first quarter, this move following disappointing holiday sales  in Europe, the West China.  Japan's Nikkei Asia reviews that Apple slashed  in production down to 20 million units.  The publications says part of the  problem here could be the iPhone's price tag which starts at about a  thousand dollars.  Shares of Apple down more than three percent over the  last week on concerns about those iPhone sales that stock, remember the  company is reporting earnings later this week.  </p><p>And then Japan based cryptocurrency exchange coin check has announced it's  going to refund customers about $400 million that was stolen by hackers.   About 260,000 people lost their holdings of NEM, this is the world's 10th  biggest cryptocurrency last week anyway.  Meanwhile, so the U.S. credit  card companies are now expected to restrict the purchase of  cryptocurrencies in general.  Citigroup, Bank of America are reviewing the  policies for this.  Capital One already deciding it will not allow  customers to use credit cards to buy any digital currency.  Right now, one  Bitcoin worth about $11,000 right now, you'll never know when it's going to  start over.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Down from 20,000 a couple -- a week ago.  Cheryl, thank  you.  Coming up, the Grammys get political, the controversy after Hillary  Clinton makes a cameo appearance and bashes President Trump.  Then made in  the USA, how a luxury eyewear company is changing the industry by  manufacturing their products domestically.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The eyewear industry, the glasses industry in  focus this morning while eyeglasses are in essential for millions of  Americans.  95 percent of all frames are made outside the United States  according to the Alliance for American Manufacturing.  But a company in  Chicago is looking to change that, State Optical assembles all of its  eyewear here in the United States and we love made in the USA so we are  happy to welcome Scott Shapiro to the program.  State Optical company CEO  and co-founder.  Scott, great to see you.</p><p>SCOTT SHAPIRO, CEO, STATE OPTICAL:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  So we are all trying on the  glasses.  I love the way those look on you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am blonde legally and so I need a new pair of glasses because  I fall asleep in them all the time and crush them and these are -- these  are beautifully made.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  They look great on you.</p><p>CARTER:  They look great on you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you get by manufacturing in the United States?  Where  here all day having a conversation about trade and about tariffs and tell  us how this is economically positive for you.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So, first and foremost, you know, there is a lot of pride that  goes with making products here in United States.  We get to put Americans  back to work.  There is about 50 craftsmen working in our factory today  that wouldn't have those jobs if we were outsourcing that overseas.  But I  think much more importantly for our brand is it really connects the  patients or the customers with the craft of making eyewear.  You know, we  say in our factory it takes 70 steps to make one pair of glasses and over  50 percent of that has to be done by hand.  So, I think, you know, in our  industry, there is a lot of -- there is a large misconception about what a  pair of glasses should be worth, what really goes into making high quality  eyewear. And by making it here in the United States, it gives us the  opportunity to tell that story to really get people in touch with that  craft.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Scott, one of the things that we hear, see, and say all the  time and I'm curious about your perspective is finding talents.  So you  said you have 50 people in Chicago, is finding talent a challenge for your  business?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Very, very difficult.  So I think what we don't talk about a lot  talk when we talk about bringing manufacturing back to United States is the  lack of infrastructure we have here in the U.S. to make things particularly  something like eyewear.  It is a skilled -- it's a very skilled labor.  And  so everyone of those 50 craftsmen that we trained in our factory have to be  trained from step one.  None of them have any experience doing that.  And  it generally takes about six months to get someone up and running before  they can do the job on their own.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Most to the high-end eyewear that would be in the same league as  your glasses is made in Japan and you mentioned earlier in Italy.  This  retail, the ones I've got on for about $400 dollars but is your profit  margin slimmer than those manufacturers overseas because your labor costs  are more expensive here?  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  So great question.  First and foremost, I should say that most of  the product that says -- or  I won't say that, a lot of the product that  says made in Italy, made in Japan is in fact made in China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  A vast majority of product made in China and there's a lot of  ways to get around that country of origin.  But the product that is  genuinely made in Italy or made in Japan, you know, their workforce is  well-paid as well, those workers also get paid a similar wage to workers in  the United States.  So our profit margins aren't significantly worse than  theirs.  And in fact, there is a lot of benefits conveniences that we  benefit from by making frames here in United States.  So a lot of -- a lot  of advantages that offset that difference.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do people get the glasses?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So, we're in over 1100 retail locations currently.  All  independent eye care providers.  So, you mentioned you have an optometrist  across the street, they might carry the product but only independent  offices.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really great.  Scott, great to have you on the show today.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scot Shapiro.  We love your glasses.  These are beautiful.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Yes.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up.  President Trump first State of the  Union and Trump for president senior adviser Lara Trump will weigh in on  what to expect.  That's next.  And Lockheed Martin reports fourth-quarter  results, beating earnings and revenue expectations.  We break down those  numbers.  Stock is up about three percent right now.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining me this Monday.  It is Monday, January 29th.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.   President Trump gears up for his first State of the Union Address tomorrow  night.  He is expected to tout the booming U.S. economy, infrastructure,  and trade.  We are taking the show live to Washington, D.C. for full  coverage tomorrow and Wednesday.  Join us live from D.C. as we preview and  analyze the president's first State of the Union.  Plus, Hillary Clinton  making a surprise appearance at the Grammy Awards last night, taking an  opportunity to slam the president.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He had a long-time fear of  being poisoned.  One reason why he liked to like to eat at McDonald's,  nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made.  </p><p>JAMES CORDEN, HOST, GRAMMY AWARDS:  That's it.  We got it.  That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON:  You think so?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Trump family members coming up, straight ahead.   Plus, futures pointing to a weaker opening for the broader averages today  as we kick off the new week on Wall Street after another record-setter last  week.  Personal income and spending just hit the wires, both measures  rising four-tenths of one percent in the month of December.  It is a big  week for the markets because the markets are looking lower but they've got  a lot to react to this week including an FOMC meeting on Wednesday.  The  State of the Union, Tuesday night.  Apple earnings as well as Amazon  earnings on Thursday and then the jobs number on Friday.  </p><p>This all after the major indices closed at another record- high on Friday  due to strong corporate earnings.  Take a look at that market.  Dow  Industrials up 223 points Friday, NASDAQ up 95 points.  Global markets this  morning are mixed.  Take a look, European indices are edging higher in  London and in Paris but the DAX in Germany is fractionally lower.  In Asia  overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is  up one percent.  Earnings in focus on Wall Street once again.  This is the  busiest week so far for fourth-quarter earnings.  Lockheed Martin kicked  off the busiest week for the fourth quarter with a beat on earnings and  revenue.  The stock is up 3-1/4 percent surging after the defense giant  also offer an upbeat outlook for 2018.</p><p>Intel under fire again this morning.  The chip giant reportedly telling  Chinese companies about a security flaw before disclosing it to the U.S.  government.  Making a legendary sports car more friendly, family friendly  as well.  We have a look at the new ride from Lamborghini as I speak with  the company's COO and he takes us inside those hot wheels.  All of that  coming up this morning.  But first, topping our news this half an hour.   Hillary Clinton's Grammy jab.  The former presidential candidate makes a  surprise appearance at the awards show last night to mock the president and  read from the book Fire and Fury.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  He had a longtime fear of being poisoned, one reason why he liked  to eat at McDonald's, nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely  pre-made.</p><p>CORDEN:  That's it.  We got it.  That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON:  You think so?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Joining me right now is Trump for President Senior  Adviser and the President's daughter-in-law, Laura Trump.  Great to see  you.  Thank you so much, Lara.</p><p>LARA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Your brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr. tweeted  this this morning after the Grammys.  The more Hillary goes on television  the more the American people realize how awesome it is to have Donald Trump  in office.  Lara?</p><p>L. TRUMP:  True.  It's so true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you -- did you watch the Grammys?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  You know what, Maria, I stopped watching all these shows a long  time ago for this exact reason and I think the American public as a whole  probably feels the same way.  I thought it was despicable, disgusting, and  quite frankly sad that Hillary Clinton obviously needs to validate herself  in some way.  If she's so keen on reading things, maybe she could read us  her 33,000 missing e-mails because I think I love to hear about those.  It  was just so disrespectful.  I'm so sad that this is the point that this  awards show has come to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's also -- from a marketing standpoint or a business  standpoint, not very smart because it's just making this assumption that  everybody agrees with you.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  And obviously the country does not agree because Donald  Trump is our president, they chose him November 8th, 2016.  Look at where  this country has come in a year that he's been in office.  You know, the  economy is booming, people are back to work, unemployment is at, you know,  record-lows right now and we have so much to look forward to from this  president and I think even people that didn't vote are starting to get  onboard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you make a lot of good point because the President does  have a great story to tell --  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- for the State of the Union tomorrow night.  He is preparing  for his first State of the Union tomorrow night and obviously the economy  is going to be a positive story that's going to be one thing to talk about  also foreign policy.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much are you expecting him to get into things like ISIS  being defeated.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think he should talk about it because nobody does.  We  went from 44,000 ISIS fighters, just about a year ago to under 1,000 right  now and it's really under reported but that's huge, people in this country  as of even a year ago, we're very scared about how we were going to defeat  ISIS, is it possible?  I'm sure we're going to hear about that, were going  to hear about the fact that on the world stage, the United States has  reclaimed its place as the leader.  You know, you see my father-in-law  traveled to different countries, you see the respect that he's given -- the  welcome that he's given in these different countries.  It's so great that  we have our country back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what he said when he was in Davos, also talking  about the economic strength like jobs, like the unemployment rate, where it  is and also the regulatory framework which is rolled back.  You know, it  feels like there is a big runway to this because there's a number of  sectors that have not been impacted yet form the regulatory rollback.  Is  he expecting this 0-- the good times to get even better?  I mean, in 2018  and '19, he's talking about continued economic growth.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think so, I mean, regulatory reform is obviously huge.   You're going to see these tax cuts kick in.  I mean, people next week are  going to see their paychecks higher in this country.  Thanks to Donald  Trump.  And I think he is right, this is super charged the economy, I think  2018, 2019 even there's opportunity for a lot of more growth in this  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do we have it then, economic issues in the State of the  Union perhaps an infrastructure plan?  He's going to talk about that as  well, right?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I'm excited as you are, see here what he's going to talk  about, I'm sure immigration will be on there as well.  That's such a huge  topic, you know, it feels like it's on the one yard line, we'er almost  there and it's something that's so needed and necessary in this country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will you be in the hall there tomorrow night?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  We're hoping to be there.  Yes. I think so.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this because of course, then there's some bad  news as well for the Republicans this morning and that is Las Vegas real  estate casino mogul Steve Wynn resigning as finance chair for the RNC after  reports of years of sexual misconduct here.  Wynn has denied wrongdoing we  should say but in a statement, he did not want to be a distraction, he said  to the Republican Party.  What's your take on this?  Shares of Wynn Resorts  down sharply as the company announced it will form a committee to  investigate these allegations, Lara.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  Well, I don't know too much about it to be honest with  you.  I know he resigned and Ronna, the chairwoman of the RNC who's  amazing, accepted his resignation and she's going to do what's best for the  party.  And, you know, we're sad to see him go.  He was a great supporter  of the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, at the same time, the Republican Party has been raising a  lot of money, much more than the Democrats.  And so, as you see that nest  egg getting bigger, it must tell you that business and big donors out there  are seeing more opportunity on the RNC side.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, not just -- not just big donors but a lot of the majority  of the money that we raised is small dollars, that means that the average  person in this country is supporting what the President is doing.  They  want to see him in office again for another four years in 2020 and I think  that speaks volumes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are President's plans?  I mean, when you talk with him  sort of off-line, not an official capacity but as his daughter-in-law, what  does he want to get accomplished for the next three years?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I mean it's what you heard on the campaign trail which he  is delivering on.  He -- the economy was so big to him and obviously as a  businessman that was something that, you know, was his target from the very  beginning.  Let's reboot the economy, let's get it moving, you see where we  are now, the Dow hit all-time highs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we need as a business, look, get stuff done on time, get it  under budget.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a really good lesson.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  No.  It's so true.  I mean, you look at -- I always talk about  the Wollman Rink and the story there that the city had it for so long, they  couldn't get an ice skating rink though in Central Park.  Donald Trump came  in, ahead of schedule under budget and that's what he wants to do for this  country and I think we're seeing it happens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a great point that you make because I was talking  about somebody else with that regulations.  It took 13 years to build a  bridge in Bayonne, took another 25 years to do an infrastructure plan in  Alaska.  This rollback in regulations just sort of has unleashed animal  spirits.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  Cut through the red tape, let's get it done and this  country deserves it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- but the detractors are still there, Lara.  How is the  President dealing with the media backlash, the backlash on the left when  you see Nancy Pelosi calling the $1,000 checks crumbs?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, that's just -- that's plain sad and it's ridiculous.  I  think a lot of people in this country would be thrilled to have $1,000 and  it's sad that she thinks it's crumbs.  And listen, they proved themselves  wrong every single day, they lied about these tax cuts that people are  going to see next week that it's true that the majority of people in this  country, 91 percent of people are going to be making more money.  And I  think every single day, you know, those people on the left that have been  so harsh on Donald Trump, on our president, every day they discredit  themselves and they prove themselves wrong a little bit more.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you doing in terms of the 2020 campaign at this point?   Do we have a sense of who will be running against your father-in-law?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think we ruled out Oprah.  initially we thought that was  a -- well, like a week ago.  You know what, I don't know, I love to know  who it's going to be.  I think we are just -- we're raising money as you  said, you know, and I think the president is going to be able to run on,  you know, the great job that he is doing for this country.  His track  record is going to I think easily take him into another four years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually since the Democrats are coming out with the resist  and, you know, pushing back instead of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>L. TRUMP:  That's all they have.  They have no message, they have no  leader, they have no agenda  other than resist.  And it's very obvious,  it's very transparent to people I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lara.  Great to see you.  Before you go, any updates  on baby Luke?</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, we had him on the pool down to Mar-a-Lago, so we're trying  to get him swimming.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's so great.  We have a picture, I wanted to share that  picture --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Oh, his first haircut.  Yes.  Down in Florida too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cute in his first hair cut.  Congratulations, Lara and Eric  Trump.  Good to see you.</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Coming up.  New concerns over Intel's computer  chip flaws.  Why the company reportedly warned Chinese companies it will  (INAUDIBLE) the U.S. government about the security vulnerabilities.  And  then the Lamborghini gets family friendly.  We've got the luxury  automaker's newest SUV in our plaza.  I'll talk with the COO of the  company.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big week on Wall Street even technology earnings this week,  Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, all set to report their numbers  this week.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney to  look ahead.  Stu, good morning to you.  </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  I've got  to two words.  Maybe three.  Don't disappoint because if any of these big  five and this Wednesday and Thursday when we get the big five results.  If  they really disappoint, I think you can put a crack in the market.  All the  --not all.  A backtrack again, a lot of the money going into the market has  gone into the five big tech stocks on expectation of stellar performances  each and every quarter.  If any of them falters, I think you'll see the  market overall falter, but you know, I think, Maria, there's another kind  of test coming here as well.  </p><p>What are the big tech companies going to do with the money that they're  bringing back to America and the money that they're going to get extra from  the tax cuts?  I suspect that a good chunk of it will go to stock buybacks,  and/or dividend increases.  And I think the left will go nuts about that,  that will be truly crumbs for the workers, crumbs for America, and  everything goes to the rich stockholders.  I don't agree with that point of  view, but I think that's what they're going to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I agree there's not a lot of room for error here.  These  stocks are up big time in the last year.  But, Stu, you know, my worry on  technology is the regulatory part of thing.  I think you're going to see as  Donald Trump is rolling back regulations for this economy, actually, I  think there's a new approach to technology, because these companies are  more powerful than we have ever known, today, and they're probably going to  see higher regulation, you see it happen in Europe, and I think you're  going to see it here in the U.S.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, but I want to know what kind of regulation.  It's very hard  to break up, say, an Amazon on antitrust grounds because basically what  they're doing is helping the everyday consumer and lowering prices, it's to  America's benefit that this company exists.  So, I'm not sure of what  framework they would use to regulate them and rein them in, but I do agree  with you that it's heavy pressure to do just that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because they had so much information on us.  They may be  helping the average person but we're giving something up in the process,  and that is privacy, that we've got all these data.  So, much is that data  worth to government that's overseeing all of this?  That's all I'm saying,  I just think that the regulatory environment is going to be an unknown for  these companies.</p><p>VARNEY:  And why don't I get a piece of the action?  If they know  everything about me and they sell that information to somebody else albeit  anonymously, I don't care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Where do I come in here?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You made my point.  That's exactly right.  Stu, we're going to  look at those numbers and we'll see if it cracks this market.  It's going  to be -- have to be really bad to do that.  Stuart, thank you, we'll see  you in about 10 minutes with more on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" top of the hour  right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart.  First though, Lockheed  Martin beats on fourth-quarter revenue, expects a rise in earnings this  year.  Good guidance has that stock up three percent right now.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching Lockheed  and the broader market.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   You're absolutely right.  Taking a look at Lockheed Martin which is to the  upside.  They came out with a fourth-quarter revenue.  It beat the streak.   Stock is up almost three percent, 2.79, to be precise, 345 and change.   They did so well on the higher sales F-35 fighter jet program, also raising  guidance for 2018.  And don't forget, President Trump's administration, the  Defense Department is ready to fork it out, and in fact, ready to spend  about $391 billion over 15 years to develop and buy more than 2400 of the  supersonic warplanes.  So, a winner here for Lockheed Martin and going  forward, also upside potential.  </p><p>Then there's Intel, this is an ongoing story about the security flaws;  these are critical.  The question is why China's government may have known  more before about it before even the U.S. government because it seems that  they actually let notified a small group of customers, including some  Chinese technology customers and because China's government actually  monitors those types of conversations, in fact, the Chinese government may  have known before the USA, the left out the USA government to let them know  about these security flaws.  The stock is looking down about a half of one  percent, but it's up almost 32 percent in the last 52 weeks.  So, it has  been a great performer like many of the tech stocks.</p><p>And coming up, this is great.  I love it because I'm definitely into this.   A Lamborghini for your whole family, Maria.  Checking this one out.  Cool  features of the Italian automaker's newest luxury SUV, Lamborghini, with  Maria, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As I come to you from the plaza right now, we've  got a set of hot wheels to show you because Lamborghini is roaring in and  rolling into the SUV market.  Joining me right now is the Chief Operating  Officer of Lamborghini America, Alessandro Farmeschi.  Good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much for joining us, Alessandro.</p><p>ALESSANDRO FARMESCHI, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, LAMBORGHINI AMERICA:  Good  morning.  Our pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to look at the car in a moment.  But first,  characterize what you're seeing out there in terms of -- in terms of  business and the market.  How is the reception for these new -- these new  cars?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Oh, the reception is unbelievable.  I'd say that we have  already sold out entirely the 2018.  We are receiving great, great response  from our customers here in U.S. but also worldwide, I would say.  This is a  great news, the fastest SUV in the planet.  And so -- and the only one, by  the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about it.  This is the Urus.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Urus.  And this is -- it goes 189 miles an hour?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about it.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, this is a super sports car, so it has all the feature of a  super sports car.  650 horsepower, 0-60 to -- in 3.6 seconds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>FARMESCHI:  And it has all the technology to support the performances and  the agility and the emotion, I would say, of a pure Lamborghini.  Also, in  terms of design, of a super sports car.  Therefore, this car is conceived  also not to be just a super sports car but also an SUV.  So, it has the  (INAUDIBLE) agility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Just the fact that you are into the SUV market.  I  mean, you said earlier, this can hold a couple of golf bags.  What was so  important -- why was it so important for a Lamborghini to be here, to be in  the SUV market?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Basically, what we saw is that the SUV segment is expanding  every year.  And number one, United States is having a great success.   Before, we believed that not having anything in the super sports segment in  the SUV environment, we believe that this was the perfect package to also  families, our clients, a different way of living the Lamborghini every day,  living Lamborghini during the weekends, during the holidays with their  friends so because you can host four, five people, you space for three golf  bags.  And so, I mean, this the perfect combination.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, Alessandro, I know that you reported global  sales up in the double digits, just recently you did.  You took the car at  the Detroit Auto Show.  How much does this cost?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  This cost $200,000.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  $200,000.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, we start from there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how does that fit in the overall pricing of Lamborghini?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  This is, like we say, almost in line with our Huracan.  And is  positioned at the right level to -- let me say -- offer a different product  that's not just only a super sports car but something more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It feels like a super sports car as well as a big family -- it  is very family friendly.  And this is gorgeous.  Tell us about the  interior.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Here, you can see that you have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, now, I feel like I'm in a Lamborghini.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  You immediately --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Immediately.  You're absolutely right.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  (INAUDIBLE) new seater.  So, the seats are sporty.  Also here,  the interior, you have here in the middle, all the commands like you are in  a aircraft or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  You got my iPad right here, right?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes.  These are two touchscreens and then you --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two iPads.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, yes, yes.  Two iPads, all both touchscreen so you can go  and surf here in the navi system into the infotainment system, and you can  also with the sensor levers select the driving modes; you can drive in a  comfortable way, you can have a sporty way, race way, but also this is the  new speaker.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's almost like autonomous?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  It's not exactly autonomous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not exactly autonomous because you can't stop and not --  you can't control.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  (INAUDIBLE) the driver is always at the center, because we  speak about emotions, and for us, driving the Lamborghini is key, all of  our clients want to drive their Lamborghini.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's fantastic.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  And in terms of support, the driver, we also provide the  technology to help the driver, so recently in this car, we have a full  advance driver assistance system that helps the driver in case of a  imminent crash to break the car and talk to support in case (INAUDIBLE)  situation the driver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why we talked all about autos at the CES Show,  the technology show, because technology is in all of the cars.  Alessandro,  this is beautiful, the moment I stepped in the car, I could tell you I'm in  a Lamborghini.  It's absolutely gorgeous, it's the Urus, and Alessandro  Farmeschi, it is good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once again, our thanks to Lamborghini and Alessandro Farmeschi,  thanks for showing me around this high-tech car.  Thank you, Dagen  McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, and Lee Carter.  We'll see you again tomorrow,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right  now.  Stuart, over to you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Maria, thank you very much indeed.  Now, this is not the way we  usually open the show.

Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday January 29th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Getting tough on trade, President Trump's America First message already being tested as Mexico and Canada have rejected a proposal by the White House to rework a key part of the North American Free Trade Agreement. This comes as the Commander-in-Chief targets Europe this morning signaling possible payback over what he calls unfair trade policies with the European Union.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I had a lot of problems with European Union and it may work into something very big from that standpoint, from the trade standpoint. The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly when it came to trade. The European Union has been very, very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to be very much to their --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The president will address the trade debate as well as the U.S. economic boom during the first State of the Union Address since taking office where it takes place tomorrow night. We will have it for you live 9:00 p.m. Eastern right here on the Fox Business Network. The address comes as major indices all closed at record levels again on Friday.</p><p>Take a look at the momentum, Dow Industrials up almost one percent, 223 points higher, S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ both up better than one percent on Friday. This morning a bit of a pullback from those record high levels take a look Dow Industrials expected to be down about 55 points of the opening of trading a quarter of a percent lower. S&amp;P 500 also down almost a third of a percent and the NASDAQ weaker by 22 points that's one-third of one percent.</p><p>It is a merger Monday of sorts on Wall Street Dr. Pepper Snapple and Keurig Green Mountain announcing plans to merge. Dr. Pepper Snapple shareholders will receive 103.57 share in special cash dividends and retain 13 percent of a combined company. Check out the movement of stock Dr. Pepper Snapple shares up to 35 percent right now. Investors are also eyeing orange from several key names this week, this is one of the busiest weeks so far for the fourth quarter. Lockheed Martin both earnings and revenue topped expectations and the stock this morning is up 3 and quarter percent. The defense contract just have been soaring over last year.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the market look like this, take a look, FTSE 100 up a quarter of a percent, 16 points higher. CAC Quarante is up a fraction and the DAX index is down a fraction. In Asia overnight, stocks were mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is up one percent. Apple may take a bite out of the iPhone, a new report that claims the technology giant may cut iPhone X production in half in the first quarter not doing as well as they thought I guess.</p><p>Is technology putting our troops in danger? The new concern over a fitness app that`s used on devices like Fitbit. They are basically indicating exactly where our troops are in the Middle East plus Hillary Clinton uses the Grammy stage to mock President Trump. The appearance that's leaving many feelings fire and fury this morning. All the stories coming up this Monday morning.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Dagen McDowell, Fox Business Network, it's Dagen McDowell, PwC partner Mitch Roschelle, and Pollster and the President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter. Good to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lots to talk about today and the State of the Union.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: Oh yes. Busy week.</p><p>CARTER: Whoo-hoo. I'm really excited about the State of the Union, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, me too. We have the State of the Union, we got the FOMC coming out on Wednesday, no interest rate increases expected yet a huge amount of earnings and then the jobs numbers are on Friday. So yes it's a busy week.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. And we keep an eye on the 10 year treasury yield because again it -- this is why trade policy and interest rate policy inflation all of wraps up to create some concerns for the market. From here, you know, to talk down the dollar you heard that from treasury secretary last week. Again lower dollar means we are importing inflation that means what does the federal reserve it, that means that we could have higher interest rates this country cannot afford significantly higher interest rates given the levels of debt that were riding and therein lies the problem because Washington won't do anything about these looming problems in terms of the national debt because we're facing a tsunami.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you know, they're not going to do anything about it during an election year, right? Forget about that. By the way, I know that you don't want to have the treasury secretary talking down anything or talking up anything for that matter. And you mentioned the op-ed and the journal the other day, but don't you in some ways Steven Mnuchin was saying what was so obvious what every administration feels anyway from the beginning of time that yes, a weaker dollar is better for trade, it's just that they don't say it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You can say it if you're not the treasury secretary and you can think it if you're the treasury secretary but when it comes to the United States dollar our dear greenback, you just say we support a strong dollar policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is every administration has said but they don't do things to indicate that's really how they feel that's what I am saying, I feel like they all think it he just said it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way President Trump can say whatever he wants but maybe his cabinet members need to rethink that strategy.</p><p>BARTIROMOR: Yes, you don't think anybody believed the walk back, do you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, not at all. Not safe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- this morning, former presidential candidate and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is joining us. He'll be with us momentarily, Eric Trump's wife, President Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump for president, senior-adviser Lara Trump is here and the COO of Lamborghini America Alessandro Farmeschi is joining us as well, host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney as well is here weighing in. Don't miss a moment of it. First now, let's kick it off with the top stories this hour. Trump administration's trade agenda Canada and Mexico are now rejecting a proposal from the White House to rework a key part of NAFTA. Meanwhile, President Trump is hinting at retaliation against the E.U. from what he says is very unfair trade practices. Blake Burman is live at the White House the very latest. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, so much for all the niceties coming out of Davos. Maria, good morning to you as well, President Trump giving an interview to Piers Morgan that was shot during world the economic forum but aired for the first time yesterday and in it the president saying that he has a lot of problems with European Union. The president saying on the trade standpoint that, we can't get our products in and the U.S. products come in at a very low taxable rate. The president saying that this could quote morph into something very big from a trade standpoint.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>D. TRUMP: The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly when it came to trade, they are not the only ones by the way, I could name many countries and places that do -- but the European Union has been very, very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to be very much to their detriment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Meantime, the Wall Street journal is reporting Mexico and Canada rejected a proposal from the U.S. to change the corporate arbitration system that is wrapped into NAFTA, it's called the investor state dispute settlement and that deals with arbitration claims from companies within all three countries. Maria, as you know when he spoke to the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross on set there in Davos last week. He said things are just beginning from the negotiating standpoint as it relates to NAFTA.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Blake, thanks very much. We will keep following that. Joining us right now is former presidential candidate from Arkansas Governor Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee. Governor, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well, thank you Maria. Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, your reaction here as we know that Canada and Mexico are rejecting this proposal to rework the arbitration part of the NAFTA agreement.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, I'm sure they would but I think they also have to understand that Donald Trump is elected in large measure because he said he would renegotiate the trade deals make it more fair for the United States. None of these trade deals came from Mount Sinai, they weren't on Two Tablets of Stone, they all have the provision that they are made to be changed and to be updated as the economy changes, as conditions change and I think this president should be commended for saying you know what our job is to protect America, American jobs, American economy, we are going to do that, we want to trade that is all an important part of growth. But it's got to be where it's reciprocal and fair. Bravo to the president for doing exactly what he said something were not used to seeing politicians often do.</p><p>CARTER: So governor, I have a question for you. You know, there is so much talk about how these trade policies -- if we don't get a deal on it might harm U.S. What about these other countries, if they don't do a deal with us, is it going to hurt them as well?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Of course it would Lee. And I think that's something that maybe needs to be said a whole lot more. I don't hear a lot of people saying what you just said and thank you for saying it because some of these countries they've got a whole lot more to lose than we do. Because they are utterly dependent upon our dollars buying their products and if we decide look, you guys aren't playing fair so, you know, we'll look elsewhere. It's going to put them in a world of hurt, it is really a position of strength that the president looks at. And this is not a president who sees America as weak, a country we have to apologize for, even our economic strength is not a weakness it is something that we should be proud of and we got there by capitalism. Capitalism is a good thing, it empowers people, it helps poor people to become not so poor people and without it we end up like Venezuela. I think we got a great model to say to the rest of the world you want to be better off? Be capitalist, it works.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Governor, it is Dagen McDowell but some of these policies that the world doesn't exist in a vacuum that these other countries when you -- you have to say these tariffs that were slapped on solar cells and washing machines just last week that actually does impact jobs here in the United States. The jobs created by companies like Samsung and the very red state of South Carolina, you have higher prices on washing machines, you've already heard that from L.G. Electronics so again this actually is done poorly and this is kind of a little willy-nilly side thing with the small tariffs. It's not -- it's not the sky is falling. But again it can hurt Americans if executed improperly or poorly.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Short term that may be true but long term a trade deal where everybody is playing with the same rules is like playing the Super Bowl where everyone has to play within same rules. If one team gets special treatment and the other team doesn't that is not a fair game, you don't know who the champion is. So short term there may be some, you know, some pain. But the long term is the prices are more realistically reflecting what it cost to produce something, it does mean that Americans have a chance to compete to make those very things. But Americans need to make things, we always have to be able to do some things that if we don't we can't be free. Provide our own energy, make our own food, be able to feed ourselves and to be able to fight for ourselves which means we manufacture our weaponry and items of defense. Manufacturing is a critical part not just of our economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But quite frankly without it, we can't be free.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we already saw L.G. get back and say look we are going to raise prices. Now, obviously if there are going to be tariffs on certain products these companies just going to raise prices. So that's going to be a negative for consumers having said that there is real impact from this tax plan that's very positive. And yet house minority leader Nancy Pelosi continues to criticize it. She's getting a criticism from even within her own party governor after dismissing the president's immigration plan, she's now calling it make America white again proposal. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE, MINORITY LEADER: That plan is a campaign to make America white again.</p><p>SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D) WV: We don't need that type of rhetoric either side. From Nancy, Paul Ryan, or anybody else and I come down this, the president has laid out a template. We are going to look at that template and we are going to work with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know governor before we get your reaction, I got to get the panel's reaction. I mean what --she is not doing anything that is showing progress for her party.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean she keeps -- making America white crumbs like you said Armageddon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Armageddon, this pathetic little crumbs, a thousand dollars is pathetic crumbs to her. It's a little piece of cheese. I think that she is doubling down but she doesn't -- she sounds moronic and she's doubling down on these comments. I don't understand in what universe she thinks that this resonates with the American people. Let me say this again, a thousand dollars is more than 20 tanks of gas, a thousand dollars can feed a family of four in this country for nearly a month and she lives in a bubble that is San Francisco.</p><p>CARTER: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's absolutely true. Governor, your reaction? Jump in here.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, I tell you Nancy Pelosi is making Marie Antoinette look like Mary Poppins. Oh my gosh, to say the things that she says that is so condescending, so insulting to working class people. Now that's a group of people Nancy Pelosi doesn't relate to, doesn't understand because she lives above them but as Dagen was pointing out and I think so very graphically, a thousand dollars to a family who has a $50,000 annual income look that is a huge amount of money and for most families that is significant, that is a vacation, that is being able to go to the dentist that's a lot of things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but governor you know what the Republicans have some problems of their own. They're distancing themselves after the Steve Wynn allegations, one of the top stories in the journal. Wynn allegations ripple as Republicans seek distance, in the wake of the Wall Street journal report from former employees that there was constant or decades long patterns of sexual misconduct. What say you about that?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, it is a horrible thing. And I am glad that as these things come to life, there's a severance between Steve Wynn and the Republican Party. But if they had known about it and it had been widely known and then they continue the relationship that would be scandalous the fact that they weren't aware of it, they became aware of it, they cut ties. I am not sure what the scandal for the republicans is as much as it is a scandal for Steve Wynn and the tragedy of the people that he abused.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we should point out that the Republicans have raised a lot of money this year much more than on the democratic side. But of course he really was a kingpin in terms of raising money. Governor, good to see you, sir. Thank you so much. Stay with us tomorrow.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are going to be live in Washington for the State of the Union. We'll be speaking with former DNC Chair Donna Brazil, past Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Congressman Michael McCaul and the Head of Small Business Administration Linda McMahon, plus former White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten with us as well. We have a big show tomorrow live from D.C. as we preview the State of the Union. Back in a moment right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Explosions, gunfire, rocking a military base in Afghanistan killing nearly a dozen soldiers, this is the latest in a wave of terrorist attacks across the country. Cheryl Casone with the details there, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right Maria. So at least 11 soldiers have been killed, 16 of those wounded in an early morning assault on military compound in Kabul. The Islamic State group is claiming responsibility, this comes only two days after more than a hundred people were killed in a suicide attack in the Afghan capital. This month alone more than 200 people have been killed, hundreds wounded in a series of attacks unleashed by the Taliban and the rival Isis.</p><p>Meanwhile, a popular fitness app is revealing top secret information about the location of U.S. military bases. The Washington post is reporting that the app called Strava shows heat maps which pinpoints soldiers' workouts that they're doing their undisclosed military base even spy out posts. Their information is now out there, it's part of Strava's GPS gathering that is available we should say on smartphones and more importantly the Fitbit which a lot soldiers like to wear.</p><p>Well, it is merger Monday in the the beverage industry Dr. Pepper Snapple and Keurig Green Mountain are teaming up, it's a great accompany with the combined revenue of $11 billion. Dr. Pepper Snapple's shareholders getting a special cash dividend nearly $104 per share they will hold a 13 percent stake in the newly formed company. The stock is soaring in the premarket as you can see up about 30 -- nearly 38 percent right now, huge stock to watch today. Now you can basically -- I guess you can get Dr. Pepper out of your machine, I made that up. All right. Just kidding. A solid joke. All right.</p><p>And finally this, Apple is reportedly cutting its iPhone X production in half in the first quarter, this move following disappointing holiday sales in Europe, the West China. Japan's Nikkei Asia reviews that Apple slashed in production down to 20 million units. The publications says part of the problem here could be the iPhone's price tag which starts at about a thousand dollars. Shares of Apple down more than three percent over the last week on concerns about those iPhone sales that stock, remember the company is reporting earnings later this week.</p><p>And then Japan based cryptocurrency exchange coin check has announced it's going to refund customers about $400 million that was stolen by hackers. About 260,000 people lost their holdings of NEM, this is the world's 10th biggest cryptocurrency last week anyway. Meanwhile, so the U.S. credit card companies are now expected to restrict the purchase of cryptocurrencies in general. Citigroup, Bank of America are reviewing the policies for this. Capital One already deciding it will not allow customers to use credit cards to buy any digital currency. Right now, one Bitcoin worth about $11,000 right now, you'll never know when it's going to start over.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Down from 20,000 a couple -- a week ago. Cheryl, thank you. Coming up, the Grammys get political, the controversy after Hillary Clinton makes a cameo appearance and bashes President Trump. Then made in the USA, how a luxury eyewear company is changing the industry by manufacturing their products domestically. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The eyewear industry, the glasses industry in focus this morning while eyeglasses are in essential for millions of Americans. 95 percent of all frames are made outside the United States according to the Alliance for American Manufacturing. But a company in Chicago is looking to change that, State Optical assembles all of its eyewear here in the United States and we love made in the USA so we are happy to welcome Scott Shapiro to the program. State Optical company CEO and co-founder. Scott, great to see you.</p><p>SCOTT SHAPIRO, CEO, STATE OPTICAL: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. So we are all trying on the glasses. I love the way those look on you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I am blonde legally and so I need a new pair of glasses because I fall asleep in them all the time and crush them and these are -- these are beautifully made.</p><p>SHAPIRO: They look great on you.</p><p>CARTER: They look great on you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you get by manufacturing in the United States? Where here all day having a conversation about trade and about tariffs and tell us how this is economically positive for you.</p><p>SHAPIRO: So, first and foremost, you know, there is a lot of pride that goes with making products here in United States. We get to put Americans back to work. There is about 50 craftsmen working in our factory today that wouldn't have those jobs if we were outsourcing that overseas. But I think much more importantly for our brand is it really connects the patients or the customers with the craft of making eyewear. You know, we say in our factory it takes 70 steps to make one pair of glasses and over 50 percent of that has to be done by hand. So, I think, you know, in our industry, there is a lot of -- there is a large misconception about what a pair of glasses should be worth, what really goes into making high quality eyewear. And by making it here in the United States, it gives us the opportunity to tell that story to really get people in touch with that craft.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Scott, one of the things that we hear, see, and say all the time and I'm curious about your perspective is finding talents. So you said you have 50 people in Chicago, is finding talent a challenge for your business?</p><p>SHAPIRO: Very, very difficult. So I think what we don't talk about a lot talk when we talk about bringing manufacturing back to United States is the lack of infrastructure we have here in the U.S. to make things particularly something like eyewear. It is a skilled -- it's a very skilled labor. And so everyone of those 50 craftsmen that we trained in our factory have to be trained from step one. None of them have any experience doing that. And it generally takes about six months to get someone up and running before they can do the job on their own.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Most to the high-end eyewear that would be in the same league as your glasses is made in Japan and you mentioned earlier in Italy. This retail, the ones I've got on for about $400 dollars but is your profit margin slimmer than those manufacturers overseas because your labor costs are more expensive here?</p><p>SHAPIRO: So great question. First and foremost, I should say that most of the product that says -- or I won't say that, a lot of the product that says made in Italy, made in Japan is in fact made in China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>SHAPIRO: A vast majority of product made in China and there's a lot of ways to get around that country of origin. But the product that is genuinely made in Italy or made in Japan, you know, their workforce is well-paid as well, those workers also get paid a similar wage to workers in the United States. So our profit margins aren't significantly worse than theirs. And in fact, there is a lot of benefits conveniences that we benefit from by making frames here in United States. So a lot of -- a lot of advantages that offset that difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where do people get the glasses?</p><p>SHAPIRO: So, we're in over 1100 retail locations currently. All independent eye care providers. So, you mentioned you have an optometrist across the street, they might carry the product but only independent offices.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really great. Scott, great to have you on the show today. Thank you so much.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Scot Shapiro. We love your glasses. These are beautiful.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Coming up. President Trump first State of the Union and Trump for president senior adviser Lara Trump will weigh in on what to expect. That's next. And Lockheed Martin reports fourth-quarter results, beating earnings and revenue expectations. We break down those numbers. Stock is up about three percent right now. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining me this Monday. It is Monday, January 29th. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. President Trump gears up for his first State of the Union Address tomorrow night. He is expected to tout the booming U.S. economy, infrastructure, and trade. We are taking the show live to Washington, D.C. for full coverage tomorrow and Wednesday. Join us live from D.C. as we preview and analyze the president's first State of the Union. Plus, Hillary Clinton making a surprise appearance at the Grammy Awards last night, taking an opportunity to slam the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He had a long-time fear of being poisoned. One reason why he liked to like to eat at McDonald's, nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made.</p><p>JAMES CORDEN, HOST, GRAMMY AWARDS: That's it. We got it. That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON: You think so?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Reaction from Trump family members coming up, straight ahead. Plus, futures pointing to a weaker opening for the broader averages today as we kick off the new week on Wall Street after another record-setter last week. Personal income and spending just hit the wires, both measures rising four-tenths of one percent in the month of December. It is a big week for the markets because the markets are looking lower but they've got a lot to react to this week including an FOMC meeting on Wednesday. The State of the Union, Tuesday night. Apple earnings as well as Amazon earnings on Thursday and then the jobs number on Friday.</p><p>This all after the major indices closed at another record- high on Friday due to strong corporate earnings. Take a look at that market. Dow Industrials up 223 points Friday, NASDAQ up 95 points. Global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look, European indices are edging higher in London and in Paris but the DAX in Germany is fractionally lower. In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is up one percent. Earnings in focus on Wall Street once again. This is the busiest week so far for fourth-quarter earnings. Lockheed Martin kicked off the busiest week for the fourth quarter with a beat on earnings and revenue. The stock is up 3-1/4 percent surging after the defense giant also offer an upbeat outlook for 2018.</p><p>Intel under fire again this morning. The chip giant reportedly telling Chinese companies about a security flaw before disclosing it to the U.S. government. Making a legendary sports car more friendly, family friendly as well. We have a look at the new ride from Lamborghini as I speak with the company's COO and he takes us inside those hot wheels. All of that coming up this morning. But first, topping our news this half an hour. Hillary Clinton's Grammy jab. The former presidential candidate makes a surprise appearance at the awards show last night to mock the president and read from the book Fire and Fury.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: He had a longtime fear of being poisoned, one reason why he liked to eat at McDonald's, nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made.</p><p>CORDEN: That's it. We got it. That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON: You think so?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Joining me right now is Trump for President Senior Adviser and the President's daughter-in-law, Laura Trump. Great to see you. Thank you so much, Lara.</p><p>LARA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Your brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr. tweeted this this morning after the Grammys. The more Hillary goes on television the more the American people realize how awesome it is to have Donald Trump in office. Lara?</p><p>L. TRUMP: True. It's so true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did you -- did you watch the Grammys?</p><p>L. TRUMP: You know what, Maria, I stopped watching all these shows a long time ago for this exact reason and I think the American public as a whole probably feels the same way. I thought it was despicable, disgusting, and quite frankly sad that Hillary Clinton obviously needs to validate herself in some way. If she's so keen on reading things, maybe she could read us her 33,000 missing e-mails because I think I love to hear about those. It was just so disrespectful. I'm so sad that this is the point that this awards show has come to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's also -- from a marketing standpoint or a business standpoint, not very smart because it's just making this assumption that everybody agrees with you.</p><p>L. TRUMP: Yes. And obviously the country does not agree because Donald Trump is our president, they chose him November 8th, 2016. Look at where this country has come in a year that he's been in office. You know, the economy is booming, people are back to work, unemployment is at, you know, record-lows right now and we have so much to look forward to from this president and I think even people that didn't vote are starting to get onboard.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you make a lot of good point because the President does have a great story to tell --</p><p>L. TRUMP: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- for the State of the Union tomorrow night. He is preparing for his first State of the Union tomorrow night and obviously the economy is going to be a positive story that's going to be one thing to talk about also foreign policy.</p><p>L. TRUMP: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How much are you expecting him to get into things like ISIS being defeated.</p><p>L. TRUMP: Well, I think he should talk about it because nobody does. We went from 44,000 ISIS fighters, just about a year ago to under 1,000 right now and it's really under reported but that's huge, people in this country as of even a year ago, we're very scared about how we were going to defeat ISIS, is it possible? I'm sure we're going to hear about that, were going to hear about the fact that on the world stage, the United States has reclaimed its place as the leader. You know, you see my father-in-law traveled to different countries, you see the respect that he's given -- the welcome that he's given in these different countries. It's so great that we have our country back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's what he said when he was in Davos, also talking about the economic strength like jobs, like the unemployment rate, where it is and also the regulatory framework which is rolled back. You know, it feels like there is a big runway to this because there's a number of sectors that have not been impacted yet form the regulatory rollback. Is he expecting this 0-- the good times to get even better? I mean, in 2018 and '19, he's talking about continued economic growth.</p><p>L. TRUMP: Well, I think so, I mean, regulatory reform is obviously huge. You're going to see these tax cuts kick in. I mean, people next week are going to see their paychecks higher in this country. Thanks to Donald Trump. And I think he is right, this is super charged the economy, I think 2018, 2019 even there's opportunity for a lot of more growth in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So do we have it then, economic issues in the State of the Union perhaps an infrastructure plan? He's going to talk about that as well, right?</p><p>L. TRUMP: Well, I'm excited as you are, see here what he's going to talk about, I'm sure immigration will be on there as well. That's such a huge topic, you know, it feels like it's on the one yard line, we'er almost there and it's something that's so needed and necessary in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Will you be in the hall there tomorrow night?</p><p>L. TRUMP: We're hoping to be there. Yes. I think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this because of course, then there's some bad news as well for the Republicans this morning and that is Las Vegas real estate casino mogul Steve Wynn resigning as finance chair for the RNC after reports of years of sexual misconduct here. Wynn has denied wrongdoing we should say but in a statement, he did not want to be a distraction, he said to the Republican Party. What's your take on this? Shares of Wynn Resorts down sharply as the company announced it will form a committee to investigate these allegations, Lara.</p><p>L. TRUMP: Yes. Well, I don't know too much about it to be honest with you. I know he resigned and Ronna, the chairwoman of the RNC who's amazing, accepted his resignation and she's going to do what's best for the party. And, you know, we're sad to see him go. He was a great supporter of the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, at the same time, the Republican Party has been raising a lot of money, much more than the Democrats. And so, as you see that nest egg getting bigger, it must tell you that business and big donors out there are seeing more opportunity on the RNC side.</p><p>L. TRUMP: Well, not just -- not just big donors but a lot of the majority of the money that we raised is small dollars, that means that the average person in this country is supporting what the President is doing. They want to see him in office again for another four years in 2020 and I think that speaks volumes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what are President's plans? I mean, when you talk with him sort of off-line, not an official capacity but as his daughter-in-law, what does he want to get accomplished for the next three years?</p><p>L. TRUMP: Well, I mean it's what you heard on the campaign trail which he is delivering on. He -- the economy was so big to him and obviously as a businessman that was something that, you know, was his target from the very beginning. Let's reboot the economy, let's get it moving, you see where we are now, the Dow hit all-time highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do we need as a business, look, get stuff done on time, get it under budget.</p><p>L. TRUMP: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a really good lesson.</p><p>L. TRUMP: No. It's so true. I mean, you look at -- I always talk about the Wollman Rink and the story there that the city had it for so long, they couldn't get an ice skating rink though in Central Park. Donald Trump came in, ahead of schedule under budget and that's what he wants to do for this country and I think we're seeing it happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's a great point that you make because I was talking about somebody else with that regulations. It took 13 years to build a bridge in Bayonne, took another 25 years to do an infrastructure plan in Alaska. This rollback in regulations just sort of has unleashed animal spirits.</p><p>L. TRUMP: Yes. Cut through the red tape, let's get it done and this country deserves it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And -- but the detractors are still there, Lara. How is the President dealing with the media backlash, the backlash on the left when you see Nancy Pelosi calling the $1,000 checks crumbs?</p><p>L. TRUMP: Well, that's just -- that's plain sad and it's ridiculous. I think a lot of people in this country would be thrilled to have $1,000 and it's sad that she thinks it's crumbs. And listen, they proved themselves wrong every single day, they lied about these tax cuts that people are going to see next week that it's true that the majority of people in this country, 91 percent of people are going to be making more money. And I think every single day, you know, those people on the left that have been so harsh on Donald Trump, on our president, every day they discredit themselves and they prove themselves wrong a little bit more.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you doing in terms of the 2020 campaign at this point? Do we have a sense of who will be running against your father-in-law?</p><p>L. TRUMP: Well, I think we ruled out Oprah. initially we thought that was a -- well, like a week ago. You know what, I don't know, I love to know who it's going to be. I think we are just -- we're raising money as you said, you know, and I think the president is going to be able to run on, you know, the great job that he is doing for this country. His track record is going to I think easily take him into another four years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Actually since the Democrats are coming out with the resist and, you know, pushing back instead of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>L. TRUMP: That's all they have. They have no message, they have no leader, they have no agenda other than resist. And it's very obvious, it's very transparent to people I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Lara. Great to see you. Before you go, any updates on baby Luke?</p><p>L. TRUMP: Well, we had him on the pool down to Mar-a-Lago, so we're trying to get him swimming.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's so great. We have a picture, I wanted to share that picture --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>L. TRUMP: Oh, his first haircut. Yes. Down in Florida too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cute in his first hair cut. Congratulations, Lara and Eric Trump. Good to see you.</p><p>L. TRUMP: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Coming up. New concerns over Intel's computer chip flaws. Why the company reportedly warned Chinese companies it will (INAUDIBLE) the U.S. government about the security vulnerabilities. And then the Lamborghini gets family friendly. We've got the luxury automaker's newest SUV in our plaza. I'll talk with the COO of the company. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Big week on Wall Street even technology earnings this week, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, all set to report their numbers this week. Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney to look ahead. Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. I've got to two words. Maybe three. Don't disappoint because if any of these big five and this Wednesday and Thursday when we get the big five results. If they really disappoint, I think you can put a crack in the market. All the --not all. A backtrack again, a lot of the money going into the market has gone into the five big tech stocks on expectation of stellar performances each and every quarter. If any of them falters, I think you'll see the market overall falter, but you know, I think, Maria, there's another kind of test coming here as well.</p><p>What are the big tech companies going to do with the money that they're bringing back to America and the money that they're going to get extra from the tax cuts? I suspect that a good chunk of it will go to stock buybacks, and/or dividend increases. And I think the left will go nuts about that, that will be truly crumbs for the workers, crumbs for America, and everything goes to the rich stockholders. I don't agree with that point of view, but I think that's what they're going to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I agree there's not a lot of room for error here. These stocks are up big time in the last year. But, Stu, you know, my worry on technology is the regulatory part of thing. I think you're going to see as Donald Trump is rolling back regulations for this economy, actually, I think there's a new approach to technology, because these companies are more powerful than we have ever known, today, and they're probably going to see higher regulation, you see it happen in Europe, and I think you're going to see it here in the U.S.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, but I want to know what kind of regulation. It's very hard to break up, say, an Amazon on antitrust grounds because basically what they're doing is helping the everyday consumer and lowering prices, it's to America's benefit that this company exists. So, I'm not sure of what framework they would use to regulate them and rein them in, but I do agree with you that it's heavy pressure to do just that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because they had so much information on us. They may be helping the average person but we're giving something up in the process, and that is privacy, that we've got all these data. So, much is that data worth to government that's overseeing all of this? That's all I'm saying, I just think that the regulatory environment is going to be an unknown for these companies.</p><p>VARNEY: And why don't I get a piece of the action? If they know everything about me and they sell that information to somebody else albeit anonymously, I don't care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: Where do I come in here?</p><p>BARTIROMO: You made my point. That's exactly right. Stu, we're going to look at those numbers and we'll see if it cracks this market. It's going to be -- have to be really bad to do that. Stuart, thank you, we'll see you in about 10 minutes with more on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart. First though, Lockheed Martin beats on fourth-quarter revenue, expects a rise in earnings this year. Good guidance has that stock up three percent right now. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching Lockheed and the broader market. Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. You're absolutely right. Taking a look at Lockheed Martin which is to the upside. They came out with a fourth-quarter revenue. It beat the streak. Stock is up almost three percent, 2.79, to be precise, 345 and change. They did so well on the higher sales F-35 fighter jet program, also raising guidance for 2018. And don't forget, President Trump's administration, the Defense Department is ready to fork it out, and in fact, ready to spend about $391 billion over 15 years to develop and buy more than 2400 of the supersonic warplanes. So, a winner here for Lockheed Martin and going forward, also upside potential.</p><p>Then there's Intel, this is an ongoing story about the security flaws; these are critical. The question is why China's government may have known more before about it before even the U.S. government because it seems that they actually let notified a small group of customers, including some Chinese technology customers and because China's government actually monitors those types of conversations, in fact, the Chinese government may have known before the USA, the left out the USA government to let them know about these security flaws. The stock is looking down about a half of one percent, but it's up almost 32 percent in the last 52 weeks. So, it has been a great performer like many of the tech stocks.</p><p>And coming up, this is great. I love it because I'm definitely into this. A Lamborghini for your whole family, Maria. Checking this one out. Cool features of the Italian automaker's newest luxury SUV, Lamborghini, with Maria, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. As I come to you from the plaza right now, we've got a set of hot wheels to show you because Lamborghini is roaring in and rolling into the SUV market. Joining me right now is the Chief Operating Officer of Lamborghini America, Alessandro Farmeschi. Good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for joining us, Alessandro.</p><p>ALESSANDRO FARMESCHI, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, LAMBORGHINI AMERICA: Good morning. Our pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to look at the car in a moment. But first, characterize what you're seeing out there in terms of -- in terms of business and the market. How is the reception for these new -- these new cars?</p><p>FARMESCHI: Oh, the reception is unbelievable. I'd say that we have already sold out entirely the 2018. We are receiving great, great response from our customers here in U.S. but also worldwide, I would say. This is a great news, the fastest SUV in the planet. And so -- and the only one, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's talk about it. This is the Urus.</p><p>FARMESCHI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Urus. And this is -- it goes 189 miles an hour?</p><p>FARMESCHI: Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us about it.</p><p>FARMESCHI: Yes, this is a super sports car, so it has all the feature of a super sports car. 650 horsepower, 0-60 to -- in 3.6 seconds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow!</p><p>FARMESCHI: And it has all the technology to support the performances and the agility and the emotion, I would say, of a pure Lamborghini. Also, in terms of design, of a super sports car. Therefore, this car is conceived also not to be just a super sports car but also an SUV. So, it has the (INAUDIBLE) agility.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Just the fact that you are into the SUV market. I mean, you said earlier, this can hold a couple of golf bags. What was so important -- why was it so important for a Lamborghini to be here, to be in the SUV market?</p><p>FARMESCHI: Basically, what we saw is that the SUV segment is expanding every year. And number one, United States is having a great success. Before, we believed that not having anything in the super sports segment in the SUV environment, we believe that this was the perfect package to also families, our clients, a different way of living the Lamborghini every day, living Lamborghini during the weekends, during the holidays with their friends so because you can host four, five people, you space for three golf bags. And so, I mean, this the perfect combination.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you, Alessandro, I know that you reported global sales up in the double digits, just recently you did. You took the car at the Detroit Auto Show. How much does this cost?</p><p>FARMESCHI: This cost $200,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO: $200,000.</p><p>FARMESCHI: Yes, we start from there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And how does that fit in the overall pricing of Lamborghini?</p><p>FARMESCHI: This is, like we say, almost in line with our Huracan. And is positioned at the right level to -- let me say -- offer a different product that's not just only a super sports car but something more.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It feels like a super sports car as well as a big family -- it is very family friendly. And this is gorgeous. Tell us about the interior.</p><p>FARMESCHI: Here, you can see that you have --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, now, I feel like I'm in a Lamborghini.</p><p>FARMESCHI: You immediately --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Immediately. You're absolutely right.</p><p>FARMESCHI: (INAUDIBLE) new seater. So, the seats are sporty. Also here, the interior, you have here in the middle, all the commands like you are in a aircraft or --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. You got my iPad right here, right?</p><p>FARMESCHI: Yes. These are two touchscreens and then you --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Two iPads.</p><p>FARMESCHI: Yes, yes, yes. Two iPads, all both touchscreen so you can go and surf here in the navi system into the infotainment system, and you can also with the sensor levers select the driving modes; you can drive in a comfortable way, you can have a sporty way, race way, but also this is the new speaker.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, it's almost like autonomous?</p><p>FARMESCHI: It's not exactly autonomous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's not exactly autonomous because you can't stop and not -- you can't control.</p><p>FARMESCHI: (INAUDIBLE) the driver is always at the center, because we speak about emotions, and for us, driving the Lamborghini is key, all of our clients want to drive their Lamborghini.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's fantastic.</p><p>FARMESCHI: And in terms of support, the driver, we also provide the technology to help the driver, so recently in this car, we have a full advance driver assistance system that helps the driver in case of a imminent crash to break the car and talk to support in case (INAUDIBLE) situation the driver.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, which is why we talked all about autos at the CES Show, the technology show, because technology is in all of the cars. Alessandro, this is beautiful, the moment I stepped in the car, I could tell you I'm in a Lamborghini. It's absolutely gorgeous, it's the Urus, and Alessandro Farmeschi, it is good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>FARMESCHI: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Once again, our thanks to Lamborghini and Alessandro Farmeschi, thanks for showing me around this high-tech car. Thank you, Dagen McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, and Lee Carter. We'll see you again tomorrow, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.

An interim report is expected in June.</p><p>Bains released a \"digital charter\" last week looking at the issues of security and privacy as Canada looks at overhauling outdated legislation.</p><p>The Trudeau government has also said it will decide before the election whether to allow Chinese equipment maker Huawei to supply equipment for Canada's new networks despite U.S. opposition.</p><p>\"Cyber security is not a specific company or country issue, it's truly a global issue,\" Huawei Canada's chief security officer Olivera Zatezalo told delegates in a separate panel on cyber security at Monday's conference. \"We want to work together on the issue. And we'd like to ensure you all, we have a commitment to comply with Canadian government regulations.\"</p><p>Yale said after her speech that members of her panel are going to keep their minds \"open and independent of the political machinations that may be going on around us.\"</p><p>\"And what I said today was to encourage everybody, when they see our final report, to think not just about whether our recommendations align with their short-term interests, whoever they are,\" she said.</p><p>\"Think about what it's going to take for Canada to have a successful future that leverages digital technology, on the one hand, (and) addresses our cultural sovereignty and enhances the rights of digital citizens and digital consumers. That's the goal.\"</p><p>Yale said the panel has already met with 150 individuals and groups across the country in 11 communities and has received more than 2,000 written submissions.</p><p>\"Our job is to drill down on the tough questions facing Canada's communications sector and come up with concrete recommendations to update the legislative framework,\" said Yale. \"These are issues that matter to people. It doesn't take a lot to spark their passions.\"</p><p>The interim report will be more \"what we heard\" and not \"what we think,\" warned Yale.</p><p>\"Over the next couple of months my panel colleagues and I will turn from the task of analyzing input to the even more challenging matter of making up our minds and offering our prescriptions for future legislative change.\"</p><p>Issues that are being looked at include the rollout of 5G wireless network technology and the efficient introduction of infrastructure, how to better support the creation and production of Canadian content, improving the rights of digital consumers, and ensuring diverse and independent news sources.</p><p>One key issue is whether the panel will recommend a \" Netflix tax\" requiring the streaming platform to contribute a portion of their revenues to creating Canadian content, as well as collecting federal and provincial sales taxes from consumers.</p><p>\"Our stories are outstanding and our storytellers remarkable.

This sets out a timeline to autonomous flights and surveys the extensive regulatory changes needed to ensure responsible and safe use of AI, particularly of machine learning (ML). The report is a useful summary of the challenges for any company using ML, especially those working on applications that could cause physical harm or even death, such as self-driving cars and medical devices. Key challenges to all companies include achieving robust, predictable and explainable AI performance and recruiting AI specialists in a highly competitive market. Matt Hervey explores these in this blog post.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last year, the EU High Level Expert Group on AI published its Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, setting out general requirements, such as human oversight, robustness and safety, privacy, transparency, fairness, societal and environment wellbeing and accountability. EASA's report builds on the Guidelines and, in section G, examines in greater detail the complexities of regulating safety-critical AI. These include difficulties in defining intended function, avoiding unpredictable behaviour, the lack of standard methods to evaluate the operational performance of ML, the complexity of the architectures and algorithms and the possibility of adaptive, ever-changing, software.</p><p>The regulatory challenges are immense. EASA's report expressly states the need \"for a shift in paradigm to develop specific assurance methodologies to deal with learning processes\" and notes that explainability of AI (a key challenge) is the subject of several research initiatives - or, in other words, an unresolved problem.</p><p>The report also acknowledges the \"utmost importance\" of ensuring EASA's personnel have the right level of AI expertise. It notes: \"Contrary to industry personnel, the Agency staff is not directly exposed or involved in the development of AI. This poses the risk of having a knowledge gap between EASA and industry experts, which could be detrimental to the fulfilment of the EASA core safety functions.\" In fact, a shortage of AI specialists is also a problem for industry and has been identified as a key challenge to the adoption of AI. In December, LinkedIn identified \"AI Specialist\" among the top three fastest-growing jobs, in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. Reuters has reported that demand for AI specialists is outstripping supply by an increasing margin. Companies need to compete for skilled graduates and some may struggle to match the salaries offered by \"Big Tech\" and the finance sector. It is important to build ties with centres of academic excellence, for example through sponsorship of research projects and offering internships.</p><p>EASA plans to release its guidance for aviation from 2021 onwards:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"304\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"104\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Level</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">First guidance</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Final guidance</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Certification</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1: Crew assistance/augmentation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2021</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2026</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2022-2025</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2: Human/machine collaboration</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2022</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2026</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2025-2030</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">3: Autonomous commercial air transport</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2028</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2035+</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Its guidance will be critical reading for the aviation industry.

Unofficially, it is the world's largest gathering of artificial intelligence experts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Element AI Inc., the conference is a coming-out party of sorts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, he is determined to make it hard to miss the name and brand of his Montreal-based artificial-intelligence software company. At Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, the company has persuaded the airport authority to superimpose \"AI\" in Element's corporate purple over the terminal's \"Montreal\" sign. When the conference's 8,000 guests arrive at their hotels, many are welcomed by greeters in Element AI T-shirts. The company is throwing a giant party in Old Montreal and Mr. Gagn\u00e9 is hosting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a G7 event at its headquarters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The CEO speaks of all this as though he's defending a castle: \"This conference is on our turf and there's no way we'll let all the foreign organizations that are already invading from all fronts across Canada just own this place,\" says the perennially unshaven Mr. Gagn\u00e9, wearing a suit jacket, Element T-shirt, jeans and sneakers.</p><p>Think big, spend big and be loud about it: that might as well be Mr. Gagn\u00e9's motto. The Canadian technology industry is in the midst of a boom and is teeming with AI startups, but few have launched with a bigger splash than Element, a software company that is not yet three years old. The company launched in October, 2016, with a big vision and a global superstar on its founding team: Yoshua Bengio, the University of Montreal professor known as one of the godfathers of \"deep learning,\" the foundational science behind today's AI revolution.</p><p>Element set out to build a Canadian AI company to rival the world's biggest tech giants. \"The dream was, 'The next Google is going to be Canadian,' \" Dr. Bengio said in an interview.</p><p>Big names brought their chequebooks: Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp., Tencent Holdings Ltd., mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments, plus a South Korean conglomerate, a Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund and several Canadian investors, provided US$102million in financing in Spring, 2017. It was an unheard-of amount for a brand-new Canadian company and enabled Element to hire 500 employees, including 100 PhDs. \"Clearly, I've been a factor in attracting capital, attracting talent,\" Dr. Bengio said. \"But it's not only that.\"</p><p>Element has positioned itself as a global business star and thought leader on emerging issues around AI. The startup called itself \"an unprecedented Quebec success story\" in a submission to Quebec Finance Minister \u00c9ric Girard this year and attracted generally flattering media coverage. A 2018 headline from Fortune magazine asked, \"Can This Startup Break Big Tech's Hold on AI?\" and Fast Company in May named Mr. Gagn\u00e9 one of the world's 100 most creative people in business.</p><p>Element has also become the self-appointed representative of Canada's AI sector, lobbying federal politicians and government officials 85 times since the start of 2018 - startups rarely do direct lobbying - securing $5-million in federal aid and landing two photo-ops with the Prime Minister.</p><p>And there's more money on the way. Sources familiar with the company's plans say it is close to raising another US$100-million to US$250-million from a group of investors that includes pension fund manager Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, the Quebec government and a global consulting firm. Early backers already provided tens of millions of dollars in capital this spring.</p><p>But some are not buying into the hype. One financier who looked at an investment in Element last year, but passed, said: \"I just didn't believe the story ... the math is not clear, the product road map is not clear, the only thing that's clear is [its strategy to] 'Hire as many people as we can.' \" The skepticism is widely shared across the fledgling Canadian AI sector. Although no one will speak on the record, several rival AI entrepreneurs complain Element's rampant hiring has squeezed the market for scarce talent, while its progress is at odds with its claims to be Canada's premier AI company. Element doesn't yet have a proven track record of delivering products, said one AI entrepreneur in Eastern Canada who questioned whether the company even has a viable business model, and yet it's draining the AI ecosystem.</p><p>In response to its critics, Element has unveiled ambitious product rollout plans: It is developing seven products during its fiscal year ending next Jan. 31, Mr. Gagn\u00e9 says, with three set for general availability by summer's end.</p><p>But Element has experienced setbacks on two of its flagship products in development and shed senior staff charged with taking them to market. Other products promised by the company are still in early stages and unlikely to be released for months. According to Public Services and Procurement Canada, Element as of early this year did not yet qualify among the top level of AI suppliers entitled to bid for government business because it hadn't delivered at least five successful AI projects. Startups consume cash, but with its big roster of expensive engineering talent, Element is burning through it at an unusually high rate.</p><p>Element can attract talent. But can it build a sustainable business?</p><p>The stakes are high. AI is infiltrating many industries and will change how people work, travel and get information, and how businesses operate as self-teaching algorithms replace human efforts. It's still early days in this transformation, but AI is already confronting governments and regulators with issues such as data sovereignty, privacy and built-in machine biases.</p><p>For its proponents, Element AI is Canada's bet to build a giant company and capture some of the value in this country, where many of the big AI breakthroughs happened. \"I am tired of Canada acting like the world's greatest poker player walking into casino after casino with two aces in its hands and folding halfway through,\" said Matt Ocko, an Element AI board member and managing partner at Data Collective, a Silicon Valley firm that was an early investor in the company. \"I want to see Canada have a massive ... win.\" Canada already risks falling behind: Chinese rivals Megvii Technology Ltd., and SenseTime Group Ltd. have already raised more than $1-billion each. Mr. Gagn\u00e9 knows that if he wants Element to be the flag-carrier for Canada's AI industry, he still has a lot to prove. \"It's really the year of execution for us,\" he said.</p><p>Element's beginnings date to 2015, sparked in part by a conversation Mr. Gagn\u00e9 had with a troubled Dr. Bengio. Mr. Gagn\u00e9 had just taken a job as entrepreneur-in-residence with a Montreal venture-capital firm, Real Ventures, which had backed his previous tech startup, optimization software developer Planora Inc. Mr. Gagn\u00e9 was responsible for developing Real's strategy to invest in the fledgling AI sector.</p><p>Meanwhile, his friend Dr. Bengio was getting worried about the state of the AI field he had helped create. U.S. tech giants such as Google, Apple and Facebook were realizing the commercial potential of AI breakthroughs made by Canadian academics and their students, and hiring as much academic talent as possible, including fellow deep-learning pioneer Geoff Hinton, a professor at University of Toronto.</p><p>Dr. Bengio suggested they create a company that would anchor a thriving domestic AI sector and help Canadian universities retain their academics. Their first plan, seeded by Real, was to build a core AI platform and fund an incubator that could spin off startups to deliver machine-learning tools to businesses that could perform functions such as reading and processing insurance applications or detecting and responding to anomalies on production lines. Key to that plan was quickly amassing top-tier AI talent. \"Think about how much money is being invested in China and in Silicon Valley,\" Dr.</p><p>Bengio said. \"There's no way we're going to succeed if we don't push on the gas as much as is reasonable.\"</p><p>To Mr. Gagn\u00e9, that meant aiming larger than the typical \"lean startup\" approach by young technology companies of stretching scant resources to get their first products to market. \"We knew it was not going to happen by scraping and bootstrapping your way and getting one solution and hiring a few folks\" at a time.</p><p>He and his co-founders, including his spouse, Anne Martel, research scientist Nicolas Chapados and Real partner Jean S\u00e9bastien Cournoyer, felt their company had to get big, fast.</p><p>Element's founders aimed to establish their so-called \"supercredibility,\" a notion championed by visionary Silicon Valley entrepreneur Peter Diamandis in his 2015 book, Bold: How to Go Big, Create Wealth and Impact the World. Mr. Diamandis implored entrepreneurs to be brash and unapologetic, acting like they had already succeeded.</p><p>Some of the basic principles of supercredibility include: \"Start at the top, and build your way up\" \"When forced to compromise, ask for more\" \"If you can't win, change the rules\" and, \"If you can't change the rules, then ignore them.\"</p><p>\"We really wanted to make a dent,\" Mr. Gagn\u00e9 said. \"The notion of impact, from the start, was one of the criteria that we wanted to make sure we had.\"</p><p>When Element launched, Dr. Bengio was front and centre, although his time spent on the company would be limited to an advisory role and board membership due to his other commitments. \"I am a very busy person,\" he said.</p><p>But the timing was perfect. The market was growing aware of the vast potential for AI to help companies derive new insights and make predictions by mining vast troves of their data. Money poured into the sector. Against that backdrop, Dr. Bengio's involvement anointed Element with supercredibility. Element was flooded with CVs from AI scientists and seasoned executives and more than 20 requests a day from potential customers \"from literally every corner of the globe\" asking how they could use AI in their business, said Naomi Goldapple, one of Element's earliest hires. (Ms. Goldapple spoke to The Globe last December, when she was a director of industry solutions.</p><p>She recently left the company and declined to comment further.)</p><p>Weeks later, Microsoft announced it was investing an undisclosed amount in Element, one of its first venture deals in AI. Calls followed from other prospective investors, including Data Collective's Mr. Ocko. His company was \"looking for the strongest independent concentration of self-sustaining AI talent that could actually drive product outcomes for global companies. Element AI met that set of criteria,\" he said. It wasn't a Chinese company subject to state influence, nor within the gravitational pull of AI-savvy, data-rich Silicon Valley giants that other corporations might be loath to work with. That was \"reinforced for us by Yoshua Bengio's position as co-founder and his unambiguous moral stature as the only truly prominent AI researcher who had not sold out,\" Mr. Ocko said.</p><p>The founding team set out to raise US$40-million in venture capital, a sizable sum for a fledgling Canadian company. Mr. Ocko encouraged them to think bigger and raise enough \"to be a global champion for Canada and a magnet for capital and talent to Canada.\" The founders decided to \"be as ambitious as we can [and] take the money,\" Mr. Cournoyer said in 2017. The ensuing financing announced in June, 2017. was one of the largest early-stage rounds for a nascent company in Canada.</p><p>But Element's path forward was fuzzy. It abandoned plans to be a startup factory that spun off AI businesses after determining large corporations weren't yet ready to deal with a slew of AI startups and still needed to wrap their heads around what AI could do for them.</p><p>Instead Element decided to build those businesses in-house. It dabbled with different ways of helping corporate customers devise AI implementation strategies; most of its work for the first two years involved consulting to Canadian and multinational companies to address specific problems using AI.</p><p>The strategic shifts and consulting focus left observers wondering why investors would shell out so much for a company that did custom piecework, since consultants typically generate lower margins and command lower valuations than software sellers. \"We created a lot of confusion in the market,\" Mr. Gagn\u00e9 acknowledges.</p><p>But Mr. Ocko insists the plan was always that Element would evolve into a product company. \"That was going to take some time\" for Element to experiment and build out AI-based products that met customer needs, Mr. Ocko said.</p><p>In early 2018, Element decided to focus on two sectors: financial services and supply chain/logistics. Those target industries were rife with data, repetitive and paper-based processes and deep-pocketed companies willing to embrace AI, making them ideal targets for standardized AI products. Last July, Mr. Gagn\u00e9 told his staff he didn't want any proposals going out for work \"that didn't have eventual licence-recurring revenue attached to it for a product.\"</p><p>Starting in late 2018, Element began to reveal its product strategy and some early customers. It was working with investor GIC Private Ltd., the Singapore sovereignwealth fund, to develop a tool that automatically and frequently rebalanced investment portfolios. Another investor, National Bank of Canada, agreed to work with Element to develop a program that would help cybersecurity operators do their jobs by taking on some of the routine tasks of threat detection. The company signed up Gore Mutual, a property and casualty insurer in Cambridge, Ont., and financial-services giant HSBC to develop products for their industries. But it won't be until 2020 that the first products are ready to go to market.</p><p>Element has been quiet about its financial performance but a confidential document prepared for prospective investors last year and obtained by the Globe offers a rare glimpse.</p><p>As of June, 2018, the company had generated $4.7-million in revenue (primarily from consulting projects) for 19 customers including Maple Leaf, Barrick, L'Or\u00e9al and Hyundai. Sources briefed on Element's financial performance say revenue in the fiscal year ended Jan.</p><p>31, 2019, totalled less than $10-million. Mr. Gagn\u00e9 declined to comment on financial performance except to say 90 per cent of revenues as of last December were for non-recurring business. He added results are on track with plans; Mr. Ocko said Element's revenues reflected in signed contracts covering future years is \"dramatically ... larger\" than $10-million.</p><p>While that might be an impressive output for many startups, context is important. Software startups typically stretch resources and hire prudently until they build a \"minimum viable product\" that they take to market. Once they generate sales and market acceptance, they hire engineers and product designers to build out the offering and sales and marketing people to generate revenue.</p><p>Element took the reverse approach, snapping up machinelearning research scientists and marketers and amassing a big internal infrastructure before it had products in market. Element \"has lots of applied research scientists that think about and develop AI algorithms, but those aren't the same people that write software and intimately understand a use case and a particular problem you're trying to solve,\" one recent insider said.</p><p>As a result, Element is an expensive company to run, even in Montreal, where costs are lower than in the Bay Area. And that's before it has commercially ready products to sell.</p><p>Aside from the normal startup accoutrements - staff are treated to a free kombucha and latte bar as well as complimentary lunches, snacks and carbonated water on tap at its Park Ex neighbourhood headquarters - the company also pays for things other startups can't afford.</p><p>That includes a 71-person fundamental research team led by 13 applied research scientists doing basic research whose main purpose is producing work \"to have academic impact,\" said Dr. Chapados, Element's chief science officer. \"Normally, investing in fundamental research is the stuff of very large corporations,\" he acknowledges.</p><p>(Element has filed more than 50 patent applications.)</p><p>The company also compensates 24 outside AI academic \"fellows\" to provide occasional advice or feedback when needed. It maintains offices in Toronto, Seoul, Singapore and has a 20-person London operation that does pro bono work to deliver \"AI for good\" - a keen interest of Dr. Bengio's. Element also advises a South Korean AI venture fund and partners with Singapore institutions to help develop their local startup sector.</p><p>Element does extensive lobbying (it hired a head of public policy and government relations early last year long before it had a chief financial officer) and even has a \"brand guru,\" also rarities for earlystage companies.</p><p>Element has so many employees that by early 2019 it was no longer defined as a \"small business,\" meaning it qualified for significantly lower research and development tax credits than companies with fewer than 500 people. (By comparison Shopify Inc. only reached the 500-employee mark the year it surpassed US$100-million in revenues.) That prompted Element to ask Quebec s Finance Minister to reconsider the rules, saying it was still a startup \"in hypergrowth mode.\"</p><p>Outsiders estimate Element's \"burn rate\" exceeds $5-million a month. The burn \"is pretty high,\" said Ms. Martel, Element's senior vice-president of operations, without confirming the amount. \"It's higher than a typical startup, definitely.\" Said Mr. Gagn\u00e9: \"If burn equals risk, then yes, we're taking more risk. ... It's an ambitious play, we never shy away from saying that.\"</p><p>Anchored by the belief that it needed to offer a full range of AI tools, and not just a single product to corporate customers, Element set out to launch seven products this year. \"Yes, we could sell one product at a time but we wanted to sell very quickly a suite of products to be able to penetrate larger organizations ... that can help [solve] many of their problems,\" Ms. Martel said, calling it a \"contrarian, bold [strategy that] makes sense. Our expectation is that the revenue will also follow once we're in place in all these organizations.\"</p><p>With the market for AI solutions still nascent, Mr. Gagn\u00e9 acknowledged that the revenue potential of its offerings isn't clear. Selling to large corporations typically takes a long time, and it's hard enough for most startup to build a business around a single product, let alone seven.</p><p>Element has already had some product setbacks.</p><p>In January, Element staff told The Globe and Mail during a product demonstration at its headquarters that its cybersecurity project with National Bank was in the advanced prototype stage and close to being sellable once it had been \"trained\" on National Bank data. But within a few months, The Globe has learned, the company quietly shelved the flagship project this past spring and parted ways with many of the business leaders hired to take the product to market. Element declined to comment on the status of the project and referred questions to the bank, which also declined to comment.</p><p>Element has also had some challenges developing a program to help the clogged Port of Montreal to develop software that would ease congestion by predicting wait times for truck drivers delivering or picking up loads. The predictions, available to truckers through the port's smartphone app, would come from mining data sources, including vessel arrival times, train manoeuvres and weather.</p><p>Element has worked with the port authority since early 2017 and progress on the client side has been slower than expected, Ms. Goldapple said in January. When the port expanded operating hours last fall, that threw things off for months because Element's algorithms were relying on historical data; testing is still ongoing and will only conclude later this year.</p><p>The port authority's director of information technology, Serge Montpetit, said the product had the potential to make his operation more effective. \"We want to be a smart port,\" he said. \"We're creating history here, we're at the beginning of something.\"</p><p>But is this a smart product for Element AI? The company hasn't worked out pricing yet but the cost would have to come out of the port's information technology budget, which is less than $10-million and already covers everything from business software to cellphones and computers. And it's not clear whether the product can be sold in a standardized form to other customers - ports are typically distinctive, depending on geography, local dynamics and differing operating and ownership models.</p><p>Asked how much he thought Element's product would have to be altered for each customer, Mr. Montpetit replied \"my guess is 30 per cent\" - a high amount that would hurt margins because of the work required with each sale. Element insiders also expressed doubt about the size of the potential market for the port product, which Mr. Gagn\u00e9 acknowledged would be highly customized and sold to operators that \"don't have a super large IT budget.\"</p><p>The company's foray into financial services may be more promising.</p><p>Gore is Element's lead customer on a product that automates the intake and uploading of data from insurance applications for home, automobile and commercial insurance policies. Gore's chief information officer, Sean Christie, said the software will save the insurer money, increase its efficiency, reduce errors and provide the opportunity to capture and use more information from application forms. \"It's a slam-dunk business case for us. If they can price the product in the right space, they will be very successful.\"</p><p>But with a pilot project under way, Element will only be ready to market the product near year's end. The project with GIC is in the early stages and Element hasn't yet started to deploy the product with the Singapore fund.</p><p>And while HSBC's head of transformation for global banking and markets, Chuck Texeira, said the Britain-based bank picked Element AI after \"scour[ing] the world to find the best AI firms,\" it won't be until 2020 that the parties determine what products they will pursue together.</p><p>Nearly three years in, Element is still a work in progress. Then again, the entire AI ecosystem is. With deep-pocketed backers, Element still has the means to improve on its outcomes to date, and some observers in the Montreal investment community expect it will sharpen its focus and make staffing changes necessary to commercialize products in the months ahead with a greater sense of urgency.</p><p>\"Element AI is not a perfect company,\" Mr. Ocko said. \"They are still for all intents and purposes a startup. They have a long way to go to be a global export champion for Canada. ... They will make mistakes.</p><p>They have made mistakes.\" But Mr. Ocko says he's \"very happy\" with the company's progress toward commercialization. \"Anyone who had a bad attitude about the company is going to be gravely disappointed.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20190720rbcdelementcover</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM3-BH21-F06S-30PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

She's sung or recorded hundreds of songs on albums, and created music for film and television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But despite her success, the digital economy has meant it's getting decidedly harder, not easier, to make a living as an indie musician in Canada as Mulholland has found in the past two decades she's been in the business. And that has implications for all Canadian artists trying to survive in the gig economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I played on so many Juno-nominated albums, and I toured all over the world and I thought I wasn't working hard enough, or maybe I wasn't good enough,\" says Mulholland. \"But the reality is the framework is broken and we need to fix it.\"</p><p>Mulholland is heartened that recent legislation by European lawmakers on digital copyright laws would give a boost to musicians, writers, publishers and film and television producers. Artist groups are hoping the European Union lead may provide a footprint to the future.</p><p>The legislation means that big online platforms such as Facebook and Google must filter out copyrighted content and share more revenue with creators, leading to a potential windfall of billions of dollars.</p><p>At stake is the future of an artistic middle class in Canada. A creative cluster of artists who once were able to support themselves relatively comfortably are now struggling. That has implications for Canadian cities. Metropolitan areas that fail to keep and attract creative residents tend to stagnate and are less desirable to live in, according to the thesis of University of Toronto professor Richard Florida's book Rise of The Creative Class.</p><p>\"Arts are such a huge economic driver, but it can be unappreciated,\" says Mulholland, who provided testimony to a federal heritage committee on the subject.</p><p>Overall, there is no question the middle class is getting squeezed.</p><p>An Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report in April showed that millennials in Canada are faring particularly poorly with just 59 per cent attaining middle-class status, compared with the baby boom generation at 67 per cent when they were in their 20s.</p><p>The situation is especially bleak for artists. Statistics Canada lumps together weekly salaries for workers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sectors, showing they have fallen behind the national average. The average salary was $601.31 in 2018, up a mere $20 from four years earlier. The national average, meanwhile, is $1,001.18, up by $66 from 2018. But if you drill down into the numbers, looking specifically at artists, the numbers can be shocking.</p><p>A study by the Writers Union of Canada says a Canadian author's average annual income from writing is $9,380, a 27 per cent drop from a decade ago when it was $12,789. The union calls it a \"cultural emergency.\"</p><p>\"Regardless of the platform, workers should be compensated for their work,\" says Christine Peet, president of the Professional Writers Association of Canada.</p><p>A poll by Ekos Research for The Canadian Press in 2017 found that 47 per cent of Canadians defined themselves as middle class. That's compared to 70 per cent in 2002 - a significant drop. The percentage who identified themselves as poor doubled from about 5 per cent to more than 10 per cent.</p><p>The plight of the middle class was part of the election platform Prime Minister Justin Trudeau campaigned on before he was elected. He defined the middle class then as a family of four earning $90,000. There is no precise definition of what constitutes middle class, but economists typically use median income as a marker. According to Statistics Canada, that's $92,700 for families and $33,000 for individuals. But in the digital economy, many artists don't achieve anywhere close to those numbers.</p><p>It's especially infuriating for artists who see their work shared with little or no compensation.</p><p>\"So many people think the internet should be completely free, but people forget that someone wrote that story and have a right to be compensated,\" says writer's association president Peet.</p><p>A study by the News Media Alliance, which represents 2,000 U.S.-based newspapers, estimates Google made $4.7 billion (U.S.) alone in 2018 - nearly as much as the entire United States news industry took in from digital advertising.</p><p>A bill before U.S. lawmakers, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, would give publishers a four-year antitrust exemption. That means under that proposal they would be allowed to negotiate with platforms over splitting revenues.</p><p>But the EU so far has gone the furthest. Besides requiring filters for copyrighted works such as music, it is also protecting writers by implementing a \"link tax\" that would grant publishers the copyright over their work if it is shared online or aggregated on platforms like Google.

She's sung or recorded hundreds of songs on albums, and created music for film and television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But despite her success, the digital economy has meant it's getting decidedly harder, not easier, to make a living as an indie musician in Canada as Mulholland has found in the past two decades she's been in the business. And that has implications for all Canadian artists trying to survive in the gig economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I played on so many Juno-nominated albums, and I toured all over the world and I thought I wasn't working hard enough, or maybe I wasn't good enough,\" says Mulholland. \"But the reality is the framework is broken and we need to fix it.\"</p><p>Mulholland is heartened that recent legislation by European lawmakers on digital copyright laws would give a boost to musicians, writers, publishers and film and television producers. Artist groups are hoping the European Union lead may provide a footprint to the future.</p><p>The legislation means that big online platforms such as Facebook and Google must filter out copyrighted content and share more revenue with creators, leading to a potential windfall of billions of dollars.</p><p>At stake is the future of an artistic middle class in Canada. A creative cluster of artists who once were able to support themselves relatively comfortably are now struggling. That has implications for Canadian cities. Metropolitan areas that fail to keep and attract creative residents tend to stagnate and are less desirable to live in, according to the thesis of University of Toronto professor Richard Florida's book Rise of The Creative Class.</p><p>\"Arts are such a huge economic driver, but it can be unappreciated,\" says Mulholland, who provided testimony to a federal heritage committee on the subject.</p><p>Overall, there is no question the middle class is getting squeezed.</p><p>An Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report in April showed that millennials in Canada are faring particularly poorly with just 59 per cent attaining middle-class status, compared with the baby boom generation at 67 per cent when they were in their 20s.</p><p>The situation is especially bleak for artists. Statistics Canada lumps together weekly salaries for workers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sectors, showing they have fallen behind the national average. The average salary was $601.31 in 2018, up a mere $20 from four years earlier. The national average, meanwhile, is $1,001.18, up by $66 from 2018. But if you drill down into the numbers, looking specifically at artists, the numbers can be shocking.</p><p>A study by the Writers Union of Canada says a Canadian author's average annual income from writing is $9,380, a 27 per cent drop from a decade ago when it was $12,789. The union calls it a \"cultural emergency.\"</p><p>\"Regardless of the platform, workers should be compensated for their work,\" says Christine Peet, president of the Professional Writers Association of Canada.</p><p>A poll by Ekos Research for The Canadian Press in 2017 found that 47 per cent of Canadians defined themselves as middle class. That's compared to 70 per cent in 2002 - a significant drop. The percentage who identified themselves as poor doubled from about 5 per cent to more than 10 per cent.</p><p>The plight of the middle class was part of the election platform Prime Minister Justin Trudeau campaigned on before he was elected. He defined the middle class then as a family of four earning $90,000. There is no precise definition of what constitutes middle class, but economists typically use median income as a marker. According to Statistics Canada, that's $92,700 for families and $33,000 for individuals. But in the digital economy, many artists don't achieve anywhere close to those numbers.</p><p>It's especially infuriating for artists who see their work shared with little or no compensation.</p><p>\"So many people think the internet should be completely free, but people forget that someone wrote that story and have a right to be compensated,\" says writer's association president Peet.</p><p>A study by the News Media Alliance, which represents 2,000 U.S.-based newspapers, estimates Google made $4.7 billion (U.S.) alone in 2018 - nearly as much as the entire United States news industry took in from digital advertising.</p><p>A bill before U.S. lawmakers, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, would give publishers a four-year antitrust exemption. That means under that proposal they would be allowed to negotiate with platforms over splitting revenues.</p><p>But the EU so far has gone the furthest. Besides requiring filters for copyrighted works such as music, it is also protecting writers by implementing a \"link tax\" that would grant publishers the copyright over their work if it is shared online or aggregated on platforms like Google. That means platforms would have to pay to host links to news articles.</p><p>It's a controversial move that has garnered major protests and critics say it will limit open access to the internet.</p><p>\"It limits the ability for internet users to create and share content online,\" argues Canadian advocacy group Open Media.</p><p>But publishers say it is not just a matter of survival, it's the right thing to do. John Hinds, president and CEO of News Media Canada, which represents newspaper publishers, argues that online platforms \"repurpose and aggregate stories and often don't pay anything for it. They essentially steal it.\" A link tax, he says, would put an end to that.</p><p>Hinds argues that most people might think twice before repurposing a copyrighted photograph but don't hesitate to circulate news articles.</p><p>\"It's great to have a paywall. But what happens when they can go behind the paywall and grab the information and dump it on the web? Every other form of intellectual property seems to get some consideration except for news.\"</p><p>To the disappointment of lobbyists such as Hinds, the copyright review by Industry Canada released in June did not recommend a link tax. Instead, it bounced the issue back to Heritage Canada to do a study \"to investigate the remuneration of journalists, the revenues of news publishers, the licences granted to online service providers and copyright infringement\" on their platforms.</p><p>\"Not only do they not recommend a link tax, they just want further discussion,\" says Hinds. \"It's really frustrating because we need action soon.\"</p><p>Still, publishers have hope the idea of a link tax isn't dead yet, especially since it is being introduced in the EU - but for Canadians, it's unlikely to come before the federal election.</p><p>The tax was first introduced in Spain in 2014, requiring services to pay a fee to the Spanish Newspaper Publishers' Association.

She's sung or recorded hundreds of songs on albums, and created music for film and television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But despite her success, the digital economy has meant it's getting decidedly harder, not easier, to make a living as an indie musician in Canada as Mulholland has found in the past two decades she's been in the business. And that has implications for all Canadian artists trying to survive in the gig economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I played on so many Juno-nominated albums, and I toured all over the world and I thought I wasn't working hard enough, or maybe I wasn't good enough,\" says Mulholland. \"But the reality is the framework is broken and we need to fix it.\"</p><p>Mulholland is heartened that recent legislation by European lawmakers on digital copyright laws would give a boost to musicians, writers, publishers and film and television producers. Artist groups are hoping the European Union lead may provide a footprint to the future.</p><p>The legislation means that big online platforms such as Facebook and Google must filter out copyrighted content and share more revenue with creators, leading to a potential windfall of billions of dollars.</p><p>At stake is the future of an artistic middle class in Canada. A creative cluster of artists who once were able to support themselves relatively comfortably are now struggling. That has implications for Canadian cities. Metropolitan areas that fail to keep and attract creative residents tend to stagnate and are less desirable to live in, according to the thesis of University of Toronto professor Richard Florida's book Rise of The Creative Class.</p><p>\"Arts are such a huge economic driver, but it can be unappreciated,\" says Mulholland, who provided testimony to a federal heritage committee on the subject.</p><p>Overall, there is no question the middle class is getting squeezed.</p><p>An Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report in April showed that millennials in Canada are faring particularly poorly with just 59 per cent attaining middle-class status, compared with the baby boom generation at 67 per cent when they were in their 20s.</p><p>The situation is especially bleak for artists. Statistics Canada lumps together weekly salaries for workers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sectors, showing they have fallen behind the national average. The average salary was $601.31 in 2018, up a mere $20 from four years earlier. The national average, meanwhile, is $1,001.18, up by $66 from 2018. But if you drill down into the numbers, looking specifically at artists, the numbers can be shocking.</p><p>A study by the Writers Union of Canada says a Canadian author's average annual income from writing is $9,380, a 27 per cent drop from a decade ago when it was $12,789. The union calls it a \"cultural emergency.\"</p><p>\"Regardless of the platform, workers should be compensated for their work,\" says Christine Peet, president of the Professional Writers Association of Canada.</p><p>A poll by Ekos Research for The Canadian Press in 2017 found that 47 per cent of Canadians defined themselves as middle class. That's compared to 70 per cent in 2002 - a significant drop. The percentage who identified themselves as poor doubled from about 5 per cent to more than 10 per cent.</p><p>The plight of the middle class was part of the election platform Prime Minister Justin Trudeau campaigned on before he was elected. He defined the middle class then as a family of four earning $90,000. There is no precise definition of what constitutes middle class, but economists typically use median income as a marker. According to Statistics Canada, that's $92,700 for families and $33,000 for individuals. But in the digital economy, many artists don't achieve anywhere close to those numbers.</p><p>It's especially infuriating for artists who see their work shared with little or no compensation.</p><p>\"So many people think the internet should be completely free, but people forget that someone wrote that story and have a right to be compensated,\" says writer's association president Peet.</p><p>A study by the News Media Alliance, which represents 2,000 U.S.-based newspapers, estimates Google made $4.7 billion (U.S.) alone in 2018 - nearly as much as the entire United States news industry took in from digital advertising.</p><p>A bill before U.S. lawmakers, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, would give publishers a four-year antitrust exemption. That means under that proposal they would be allowed to negotiate with platforms over splitting revenues.</p><p>But the EU so far has gone the furthest. Besides requiring filters for copyrighted works such as music, it is also protecting writers by implementing a \"link tax\" that would grant publishers the copyright over their work if it is shared online or aggregated on platforms like Google. That means platforms would have to pay to host links to news articles.</p><p>It's a controversial move that has garnered major protests and critics say it will limit open access to the internet.</p><p>\"It limits the ability for internet users to create and share content online,\" argues Canadian advocacy group Open Media.</p><p>But publishers say it is not just a matter of survival, it's the right thing to do. John Hinds, president and CEO of News Media Canada, which represents newspaper publishers, argues that online platforms \"repurpose and aggregate stories and often don't pay anything for it. They essentially steal it.\" A link tax, he says, would put an end to that.</p><p>Hinds argues that most people might think twice before repurposing a copyrighted photograph but don't hesitate to circulate news articles.</p><p>\"It's great to have a paywall. But what happens when they can go behind the paywall and grab the information and dump it on the web? Every other form of intellectual property seems to get some consideration except for news.\"</p><p>To the disappointment of lobbyists such as Hinds, the copyright review by Industry Canada released in June did not recommend a link tax. Instead, it bounced the issue back to Heritage Canada to do a study \"to investigate the remuneration of journalists, the revenues of news publishers, the licences granted to online service providers and copyright infringement\" on their platforms.</p><p>\"Not only do they not recommend a link tax, they just want further discussion,\" says Hinds. \"It's really frustrating because we need action soon.\"</p><p>Still, publishers have hope the idea of a link tax isn't dead yet, especially since it is being introduced in the EU - but for Canadians, it's unlikely to come before the federal election.</p><p>The tax was first introduced in Spain in 2014, requiring services to pay a fee to the Spanish Newspaper Publishers' Association. That was met with immediate pushback from the platforms. Google decided to pull out of Spain and removed Spanish language newspapers from the service internationally.</p><p>If Canada adopts a link tax, pushback from the tech giant is also be a possibility, warned Richard Gingras, head of Google's news division, in an interview. In fact, he warns that adopting the tax could be more harmful than helpful to publishers.</p><p>\"It depends on the very specific circumstances that would cause us to shut down Google News in any country,\" says Gingras. \"Those suggested approaches (a link tax) don't hold up. Google search is a useful tool for publishers to find new audiences. They want to be found on Google to build their audience base. The days of print when you put news boxes on street corners to find an audience are over.\"</p><p>However, Hinds says there is strength in numbers.</p><p>\"Google is so big and powerful they will crush any single country. Only if you have an international standard, and the European Union is the start of this, can you make a fair deal. On your own you're not powerful enough. Giving publishers the right to their own content is absolutely necessary to the health of the industry.\"</p><p>Given the recent recommendations by Industry Canada and another Canadian Heritage committee report, it's doubtful Ottawa will tackle copyright legislation with any kind of urgency, leaving it to the next sitting government. But artists and publishing groups argue time is of the essence as creators are increasingly having trouble making a living wage.</p><p>Graham Henderson, president and CEO of Music Canada, a lobby group that represents major Canadian music publishers, calls this \"the value gap,\" or the disparity between the value of creative content to consumers and the revenues returned to artists and businesses who create it in the digital age.</p><p>That gap could be worth billions of dollars for Canadian artists, he argues.</p><p>\"The origins of the value gap extend back more than two decades to a time when countries around the world, including Canada, began adapting and interpreting laws created in another era to protect telephone companies in the then-dawning digital marketplace,\" he argued to legislators in a submission. \"The impact of those laws today is that wealth has been diverted from creators into the pockets of massive digital intermediaries and what little is left over for creators is concentrated into fewer and fewer hands.\"</p><p>Mulholland's friend, fellow musician Danny Michel, described in a viral blog post what it was like to eke out an existence by detailing to the dollar his remuneration from music sites.</p><p>\"Everywhere I go, musicians are quietly talking about one thing: how to survive,\" said Michel.</p><p>Despite being in the Top 20 charts on CBC Radio 2 and 3 for 10 weeks, and climbing to No. 3, Michel said his hit song \"Purgatory Cove\" earned him just $44.99 on the popular music streamer Spotify.</p><p>\"This is simply unsustainable,\" he says. \"My album sales have held steady for the last decade until dropping 95 per cent due to music-streaming services.\"</p><p>Mulholland, who has her own record label, says she sees those effects on her artists every day, and it's corrosive. But she has hope.</p><p>\"I know what people aren't making. I get my own statements and see those numbers and it's disheartening,\" she says. \"Things can be bleak. But I am optimistic that this can be worked out. That other countries have already acknowledged what is happening out there. And I'm hopeful that Canada will see the urgency.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Over that time, they've been begging the federal government to help them survive by forcing the tech giants to share their revenue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, the Liberals are pledging to do just that. But will that help actually materialize, and will it be enough?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault first raised hopes in the Canadian news industry earlier this month in interviews where he labelled the refusal by tech companies to share ad revenues with publishers as \"immoral and unacceptable.\" He also voiced support for Australia's ongoing effort to force such payments and decried Facebook's obstinance there, in particular, as \"bullying.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then, just this past Wednesday, the government doubled down on its stance in the throne speech, which was delivered by Gov. General Julie Payette.</p><p>\"Web giants are taking Canadians' money while imposing their own priorities. Things must change and will change,\" she read. \"The government will act to ensure their revenue is shared more fairly with our creators and media and will also require them to contribute to the creation, production and distribution of our stories, on screen, in lyrics, in music and in writing.\"</p><p>The speech lacked specifics, however, leaving some in the embattled media industry to wonder if their optimism might be misplaced.</p><p>\"They've talked about them paying their fair share, but the language has been very ambiguous,\" says Daniel Bernhard, executive director at journalism and broadcasting advocacy group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. \"I remain hopeful, but I wouldn't call myself expectant or optimistic.\"</p><p>Bernhard points out that the government has been talking tough about the tech industry without meaningful action for years. Until that changes, the Canadian news industry's collective eyes will remain glued to Australia.</p><p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission - or ACCC - is in the process of finalizing a code of conduct bill for a parliamentary vote. The rules would require the tech companies to negotiate terms for hosting snippets of news stories on their platforms. If agreements cannot be reached, an arbitrator would determine payments.</p><p>The rules would also require the companies to provide reasonable advance notice of changes to algorithms that would affect news rankings and presentations, to give publishers an adequate chance to adjust their offerings.</p><p>Google has responded by informing users in Australia that the new terms would degrade some of its services. Facebook has gone further by threatening to remove local and international news from its platforms there, which includes Instagram.</p><p>In its assessment published earlier this month, the Dallas-based International News Media Association suggested the companies are making threats because Australia's rules could easily be emulated in other countries.</p><p>\"Because of the global nature of the Big Tech platforms, the highest bar for regulation becomes a global standard,\" the organization said in a blog post. \"The outcome in Australia will become the new bar for every country's publishers seeking an equitable financial relationship with Facebook and others.\"</p><p>The ACCC is being supported by Australian news organizations such as Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. The Canadian government has similarly been lobbied by Canadian publishers including The Globe and Mail, Postmedia and Toronto Star parent Torstar, who in May collectively penned an open letter urging immediate action that would force revenue sharing.</p><p>Advertising revenue at news organizations has been in decline for years and has been exasperated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the publishers said. Conversely, ad revenue has been climbing for the tech companies. Facebook, for example, posted ad revenue of $17.7 billion (U.S.) in the first quarter of 2020, up 17 per cent from $15 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Together, Google and Facebook accounted for 78.3 per cent of the $7.6 billion online advertising market in Canada and about 42 per cent of the total $14 billion in ad spend across all media in 2018, according to the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project (CMCRP).</p><p>At the crux of the dispute are the news-story snippets displayed on Facebook and other online platforms. News publishers say these summaries count as content that they have paid to produce and that are being used to draw users to the platforms.</p><p>\"It's driving eyeballs to their site so they can sell ads,\" says John Hinds, president and chief executive of News Media Canada, a trade association that represents daily, weekly and community newspapers of which all Torstar papers are members and pay fees. \"Their business model is based on monetizing our content and we don't get any payment for it.\"</p><p>Facebook says Australia's proposed rules overestimate the value of news content on its platform, which is dwarfed by the traffic it sends back to publishers. The company says it sent 2.3 billion clicks to Australian news websites in the first five months of 2020.</p><p>In both Australia and Canada, the company says it would prefer to support news creation through the various programs it funds.</p><p>In Canada, for example, the company says it has invested $9 million over the past three years in partnerships, including programs with The Canadian Press, the Canadian Journalism Foundation and the Ryerson School of Journalism.</p><p>\"Removing news in Australia is not the outcome we've been working towards, it is our last choice,\" says Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy for Facebook Canada. \"We want to work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\"</p><p>Other media observers say Australia's approach doesn't address the larger issue, which is that Facebook and Google have too much power when it comes to advertising and competition in general. Governments could be better served by looking at ways to curtail that dominance, which could include further enforcing privacy and antitrust laws.</p><p>\"There's an absolute need to deal with this,\" says Dwayne Winseck, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Carleton University and head of the CMCRP. \"The data and privacy protection part of it is for real and the Australian approach doesn't deal with any of it.\"</p><p>Critics of both the Australian and Canadian stances also say that the countries' respective news industries are only going to hurt themselves by pushing for revenue sharing. If Facebook makes good on its threat to pull news, publishers could see declines in traffic.</p><p>\"If you lose those referrals for which they pay nothing, it seems likely to have an impact on the bottom line,\" says Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law at the University of Ottawa. \"It'll be discouraging for many news organizations to find that their content is easily replaceable.\"</p><p>Google supports that view, saying that news-related queries account for a fraction of overall searches and therefore ad revenue. In Canada, news-related queries accounted for just 1.5 per cent of overall searches and $9 million in revenue from clicks on ads against those queries last year. Conversely, the company says it sends users to news sites 24 billion times a month globally.</p><p>A recent analysis by University of Quebec at Montreal media professor Jean-Hugues Roy suggests such numbers overstate the overall value the platforms deliver to news organizations. Facebook, for example, earns between 35 and 58 times more from news it hosts than publishers do from traffic sent their way, he wrote in a blog post.</p><p>Though many community papers support the Canadian government's stance, some newer, online-first publishers oppose the revenue-sharing plan and don't want to see the tech platforms block snippets because both would likely involve someone having to decide what qualifies as a news organization.</p><p>\"I certainly wouldn't be comfortable with Facebook making that determination,\" says Jesse Brown, publisher of independent news organization Canadaland. \"I have just as many problems with government making that determination.\"</p><p>Either way, media watchers don't expect the Canadian government to act quickly despite its tough posturing, which will likely leave Australia to do the heavy lifting.</p><p>\"Canadian governments have not had a great track record at striking out boldly to set a standard for cultural information,\" says Jeffrey Dvorkin, former director of the journalism program at the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus. \"They're going to wait to see whose heads get chopped off first.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020092659028615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6104-JT31-F103-3017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

News publishers say these summaries count as content that they have paid to produce and that are being used to draw users to the platforms.</p><p>\"It's driving eyeballs to their site so they can sell ads,\" says John Hinds, president and chief executive of News Media Canada, a trade association that represents daily, weekly and community newspapers of which all Torstar papers are members and pay fees. \"Their business model is based on monetizing our content and we don't get any payment for it.\"</p><p>Facebook says Australia's proposed rules overestimate the value of news content on its platform, which is dwarfed by the traffic it sends back to publishers. The company says it sent 2.3 billion clicks to Australian news websites in the first five months of 2020.</p><p>In both Australia and Canada, the company says it would prefer to support news creation through the various programs it funds.</p><p>In Canada, for example, the company says it has invested $9 million over the past three years in partnerships, including programs with The Canadian Press, the Canadian Journalism Foundation and the Ryerson School of Journalism.</p><p>\"Removing news in Australia is not the outcome we've been working towards, it is our last choice,\" says Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy for Facebook Canada. \"We want to work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\"</p><p>Other media observers say Australia's approach doesn't address the larger issue, which is that Facebook and Google have too much power when it comes to advertising and competition in general. Governments could be better served by looking at ways to curtail that dominance, which could include further enforcing privacy and antitrust laws.</p><p>\"There's an absolute need to deal with this,\" says Dwayne Winseck, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Carleton University and head of the CMCRP. \"The data and privacy protection part of it is for real and the Australian approach doesn't deal with any of it.\"</p><p>Critics of both the Australian and Canadian stances also say that the countries' respective news industries are only going to hurt themselves by pushing for revenue sharing. If Facebook makes good on its threat to pull news, publishers could see declines in traffic.</p><p>\"If you lose those referrals for which they pay nothing, it seems likely to have an impact on the bottom line,\" says Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law at the University of Ottawa. \"It'll be discouraging for many news organizations to find that their content is easily replaceable.\"</p><p>Google supports that view, saying that news-related queries account for a fraction of overall searches and therefore ad revenue. In Canada, news-related queries accounted for just 1.5 per cent of overall searches and $9 million in revenue from clicks on ads against those queries last year. Conversely, the company says it sends users to news sites 24 billion times a month globally.</p><p>A recent analysis by University of Quebec at Montreal media professor Jean-Hugues Roy suggests such numbers overstate the overall value the platforms deliver to news organizations. Facebook, for example, earns between 35 and 58 times more from news it hosts than publishers do from traffic sent their way, he wrote in a blog post.</p><p>Though many community papers support the Canadian government's stance, some newer, online-first publishers oppose the revenue-sharing plan and don't want to see the tech platforms block snippets because both would likely involve someone having to decide what qualifies as a news organization.</p><p>\"I certainly wouldn't be comfortable with Facebook making that determination,\" says Jesse Brown, publisher of independent news organization Canadaland. \"I have just as many problems with government making that determination.\"</p><p>Either way, media watchers don't expect the Canadian government to act quickly despite its tough posturing, which will likely leave Australia to do the heavy lifting.</p><p>\"Canadian governments have not had a great track record at striking out boldly to set a standard for cultural information,\" says Jeffrey Dvorkin, former director of the journalism program at the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus. \"They're going to wait to see whose heads get chopped off first.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020092658966956</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XP-GPW1-JDH1-C434-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is already undertaking a similar investigation.</p><p>The competition bureau was responding to questions by the Star as to whether a similar action will be undertaken by the federal agency responsible for monitoring and regulating competition in Canada. Recent steps, including the hiring this month of its first Chief Digital Enforcement Officer, indicate that the agency is bulking up to take on the big technology companies.</p><p>And experts say it is only a matter of time before Canada joins the United States and the European Union in antitrust investigations.</p><p>\"This is a big deal and we should be paying attention because this will impact Canada,\" said professor Mihkel Tombak, Hatch Chair in Technology Management at the University of Toronto and an expert in antitrust issues. \"I think it's inevitable that the Canadian authorities here will be looking at how they should be taking a more aggressive stance.\"</p><p>In Canada, it will be up to the competition bureau to determine whether an investigation is warranted. And one former commissioner says she thinks the agency will eventually have to follow the lead of European and U.S. counterparts.</p><p>\"I think regulators are very interested in the issue and that the competition bureau will eventually do something, the question is what?\" said Melanie Aitken, co-head of the Antitrust Group at law firm Bennett Jones and the former Canadian Commissioner of Competition in an interview. \"These are really tough decisions facing the competition commissioner.\"</p><p>The scope of the conversation around these issues in the U.S. and elsewhere is broad, but Aitken says defining the issues will be paramount.</p><p>\"Some think it's a privacy issue, others may think it's a data protection or competition problem. And certainly a privacy issue can relate to a competition issue. A lot of people are trying to get their arms around what can be legitimately addressed. And what mechanisms or tools to use to do so.\"</p><p>The U.S. did not mention which tech companies would be under investigation. But this month, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion for mishandling user information. In Europe, Amazon is already under an antitrust investigation by the EU's Competition Commission announced last week. And critics of big tech have been more vocal than ever, calling for the break up of some companies.</p><p>\"The EU has been more aggressive on investigating these companies, but the U.S. is following suit,\" says U of T's Tombak. \"What often happens in competition cases is that companies get prosecuted in other jurisdictions and Canadians take a similar path.\"</p><p>The big question, says Tombak, is if the big firms are \"stepping over the line\" and choking off small firms that contribute to innovation.</p><p>\"It's not illegal to be in a dominant position. You may be dominant because you're really good. But if you're abusing that position, that's a problem.\"</p><p>The competition bureau's Albert said the bureau could not confirm whether an official investigation into technology firms was underway.</p><p>\"The bureau is required by law to conduct its work confidentially,\" said Albert.</p><p>However, he pointed out that the bureau is working closely with the federal innovation department and policy-makers to \"take a look under the hood\" of digital competition policy and recently hosted a forum looking at that subject in May.</p><p>In July, the bureau hired former IBM executive George McDonald as its first Chief Digital Enforcement Officer. McDonald will \"boost our digital intelligence gathering skills,\" said Albert.</p><p>Given the more limited Canadian resources to investigate tech giants, lawyer Aitken, who was also on the steering committee of the International Competition Network, says the bureau may do more \"surgical strikes\" addressing narrower issues at the most egregious offenders.</p><p>\"I think the bureau will more likely be looking at discreet behaviours or acquisitions rather than embarking on a massive investigation, which is possible in the United States, which is more resource capable,\" said Aitken.</p><p>Tech giants have traditionally been given a hands-off approach by antitrust regulators focused on pricing at least in respect to acquisitions of competitors. In the usual scenario, if one company gobbles up a competitor in the market, competition is reduced and pricing may go up. But products offered by companies such as Facebook and Google are seemingly free. However, that thinking has shifted.</p><p>\"A typical analysis of mergers and antitrust is whether prices go up,\" said Aitken. \"But often with these powerful platforms you're not really going to find price effects ... So how to determine the material effect on competition so as to block a merger will be a real challenge for the competition authorities.\"</p><p>U of T's Tombak says one wider issue to be considered is whether antitrust legislation will impact innovation overall.</p><p>\"Do big firms contribute disproportionately to innovation? The jury is still out.\"</p><p>Tombak says Canadian regulators have traditionally been more moderate than their U.S. or European counterparts with antitrust legislation.</p><p>\"Our corporate culture is to nudge them to do the right thing rather than haul them to court,\" says Tombak. \"Here in Canada we like to talk and work things out.\"</p><p>In some cases that hasn't worked too well. The Canadian Privacy Commissioner announced this year it is taking Facebook to court over privacy violations and \"refusing to implement recommendations to address deficiencies.\"</p><p>Former competition bureau commissioner Aitken says, in her experience, which includes high-profile litigation against the Toronto Real Estate Board over opening up the Multiple Listing Service, and challenging Visa and Mastercard over card acceptance rules, getting compliance from companies through enforcement remains one of the most important tools for Canadian regulators.</p><p>\"Advocacy is important. But it alone doesn't get you far. You need to have the resources and the right tools to back them up. That's a powerful way to correct behaviour.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is already undertaking a similar investigation.</p><p>The competition bureau was responding to questions by the Star as to whether a similar action will be undertaken by the federal agency responsible for monitoring and regulating competition in Canada. Recent steps, including the hiring this month of its first Chief Digital Enforcement Officer, indicate that the agency is bulking up to take on the big technology companies.</p><p>And experts say it is only a matter of time before Canada joins the United States and the European Union in antitrust investigations.</p><p>\"This is a big deal and we should be paying attention because this will impact Canada,\" said professor Mihkel Tombak, Hatch Chair in Technology Management at the University of Toronto and an expert in antitrust issues. \"I think it's inevitable that the Canadian authorities here will be looking at how they should be taking a more aggressive stance.\"</p><p>In Canada, it will be up to the competition bureau to determine whether an investigation is warranted. And one former commissioner says she thinks the agency will eventually have to follow the lead of European and U.S. counterparts.</p><p>\"I think regulators are very interested in the issue and that the competition bureau will eventually do something, the question is what?\" said Melanie Aitken, co-head of the Antitrust Group at law firm Bennett Jones and the former Canadian Commissioner of Competition in an interview. \"These are really tough decisions facing the competition commissioner.\"</p><p>The scope of the conversation around these issues in the U.S. and elsewhere is broad, but Aitken says defining the issues will be paramount.</p><p>\"Some think it's a privacy issue, others may think it's a data protection or competition problem. And certainly a privacy issue can relate to a competition issue. A lot of people are trying to get their arms around what can be legitimately addressed. And what mechanisms or tools to use to do so.\"</p><p>The U.S. did not mention which tech companies would be under investigation. But this month, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion for mishandling user information. In Europe, Amazon is already under an antitrust investigation by the EU's Competition Commission announced last week. And critics of big tech have been more vocal than ever, calling for the break up of some companies.</p><p>\"The EU has been more aggressive on investigating these companies, but the U.S. is following suit,\" says U of T's Tombak. \"What often happens in competition cases is that companies get prosecuted in other jurisdictions and Canadians take a similar path.\"</p><p>The big question, says Tombak, is if the big firms are \"stepping over the line\" and choking off small firms that contribute to innovation.</p><p>\"It's not illegal to be in a dominant position. You may be dominant because you're really good. But if you're abusing that position, that's a problem.\"</p><p>The competition bureau's Albert said the bureau could not confirm whether an official investigation into technology firms was underway.</p><p>\"The bureau is required by law to conduct its work confidentially,\" said Albert.</p><p>However, he pointed out that the bureau is working closely with the federal innovation department and policy-makers to \"take a look under the hood\" of digital competition policy and recently hosted a forum looking at that subject in May.</p><p>In July, the bureau hired former IBM executive George McDonald as its first Chief Digital Enforcement Officer. McDonald will \"boost our digital intelligence gathering skills,\" said Albert.</p><p>Given the more limited Canadian resources to investigate tech giants, lawyer Aitken, who was also on the steering committee of the International Competition Network, says the bureau may do more \"surgical strikes\" addressing narrower issues at the most egregious offenders.</p><p>\"I think the bureau will more likely be looking at discreet behaviours or acquisitions rather than embarking on a massive investigation, which is possible in the United States, which is more resource capable,\" said Aitken.</p><p>Tech giants have traditionally been given a hands-off approach by antitrust regulators focused on pricing at least in respect to acquisitions of competitors. In the usual scenario, if one company gobbles up a competitor in the market, competition is reduced and pricing may go up. But products offered by companies such as Facebook and Google are seemingly free. However, that thinking has shifted.</p><p>\"A typical analysis of mergers and antitrust is whether prices go up,\" said Aitken. \"But often with these powerful platforms you're not really going to find price effects ... So how to determine the material effect on competition so as to block a merger will be a real challenge for the competition authorities.\"</p><p>U of T's Tombak says one wider issue to be considered is whether antitrust legislation will impact innovation overall.</p><p>\"Do big firms contribute disproportionately to innovation? The jury is still out.\"</p><p>Tombak says Canadian regulators have traditionally been more moderate than their U.S. or European counterparts with antitrust legislation.</p><p>\"Our corporate culture is to nudge them to do the right thing rather than haul them to court,\" says Tombak. \"Here in Canada we like to talk and work things out.\"</p><p>In some cases that hasn't worked too well. The Canadian Privacy Commissioner announced this year it is taking Facebook to court over privacy violations and \"refusing to implement recommendations to address deficiencies.\"</p><p>Former competition bureau commissioner Aitken says, in her experience, which includes high-profile litigation against the Toronto Real Estate Board over opening up the Multiple Listing Service, and challenging Visa and Mastercard over card acceptance rules, getting compliance from companies through enforcement remains one of the most important tools for Canadian regulators.</p><p>\"Advocacy is important. But it alone doesn't get you far. You need to have the resources and the right tools to back them up. That's a powerful way to correct behaviour.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

The Bureau noted that more Canadians are shopping via eCommerce. Canadians spent $57.4 billion in eCommerce purchases in 2018, while they spent just $18.9 billion in 2012.   The Bureau said \u201careas of interest\u201d in its probe include the capability of third-party merchants to be successful on the eCommerce retailer\u2019s marketplace without advertising on the Canadian platform or harnessing Fulfillment by Amazon.   In addition, the Bureau is interested in current or former Amazon procedures that could affect the willingness of third-party merchants to provide merchandise at a lower cost on other channels like digital marketplaces or their own sites.   Furthermore, the Bureau is interested in strategies or efforts by Amazon that could move shoppers to buy merchandise \u201cit offers for sale over those offered by competing sellers.\u201d   The Bureau noted that merchants and businesses can privately share their experiences with it through email.   In early August, news surfaced that New York Attorney General  Letitia James  was becoming a part of other probes into the market power of Amazon. Her office was teaming with the attorney general of California and the Federal Trade Commission to look into the matter.   And, in August, Rep. David Cicilline (D-Rhode Island)  said in closing remarks to a Big Tech hearing, \u201cThese companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up; all need to be properly regulated and held accountable. We need to ensure the antitrust laws, first written more than a century ago, work in the digital age.\u201d   However, as PYMNTS has previously noted, Big Tech companies are in competition aggressively with each other in lieu of functioning in the fashion of monopolies with a specific segment locked up.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    New PYMNTS Report: The CFO\u2019s Guide To Digitizing B2B Payments \u2013 August 2020     The CFO\u2019s Guide To Digitizing B2B Payments, a PYMNTS and Comdata collaboration, examines how companies are updating their AP approaches to protect their cash flows, support their vendors and enable their financial departments to operate remotely.

It is brutal realpolitik in action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The finance ministers from the world's richest democracies are wrestling with a deeply disruptive two-headed beast that is actively undermining the established global order, in the form of increasingly powerful and pervasive Big Tech as well as the unpredictable and vengeful Donald Trump.</p><p>Morneau's approach is to keep his head down and look for a global alliance to come to the rescue.</p><p>In the current circumstances, while it's not very satisfying, that's probably the best we can do.</p><p>It has come to this.</p><p>France, in contrast, is not leaving anything to chance. The French government has just passed a 3-per-cent tax on revenues of large tech companies.</p><p>And since France is hosting the finance ministers this week, as well as the subsequent summit of G7 leaders next month in Biarritz, the move is deliberately provocative.</p><p>The Americans vowed immediately to unleash trade retaliation against France in response And Canada, according to unnamed French officials quoted by international media covering the Chantilly meeting, has tried to avoid getting caught up in the trans-Atlantic tiff, pleading an inability to act decisively due to the coming election.</p><p>Publicly, and not surprisingly, that's not how Morneau puts it.</p><p>France, he says, will stand down with its unilateral measures as soon as global powers can come together and figure out how to deal with corporate powerhouses that don't pay tax in many countries despite reaping profits there.</p><p>\"That approach won't prevail if we can get to an international agreement.</p><p>\"I have a high level of confidence that we're moving towards an international agreement that can make sense,\" Morneau said in a phone interview from Chantilly.</p><p>Unilateral action by some countries could prompt others to race to the bottom, he said, and defeat the purpose of forcing digital giants to pay their fair share of tax. Instead, the G7 will drive the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to quickly establish digital tax rules for all. And then Canada can move ahead.</p><p>\"We do need to make sure that the large digital companies - as well as any other company for that matter - are paying their fair share of tax,\" Morneau said.</p><p>\"What we want to make sure of is that companies pay their fair share of tax in the place where they create their value. So, if a company is getting value out of the Canadian economy, we don't want them to be paying tax somewhere else. We want them paying tax in Canada.\"</p><p>He has a similar approach to Libra, Facebook's proposal for a cryptocurrency that has alarmed financial regulators and privacy advocates around the world. Morneau says he sees eye to eye with the G7 that Libra raises serious questions, and he agrees regulators need to protect consumer safety. But in a hat tip to the American penchant for free markets, he adds that Canada would never stand in the way of technological advances.</p><p>\"What we're walking away with here is that we have significant concerns over how this has been put forward right now. We're obviously never going to say that we shouldn't have technological progress,\" Morneau said.</p><p>The G7's main preoccupation these days, however, is to boost global growth - which is in the doldrums, lately, especially in advanced economies that are dealing internally with aging workforces and are also exposed to international trade.</p><p>The trade war between the United States and China has crushed supply chains for many companies and injected massive amounts of uncertainty into business decision-making, slowing economic activity everywhere.</p><p>Canada's cautious approach means no tirade against destructive protectionism. Morneau's interventions at the G7 meetings will focus on domestic measures his government has taken to promote the middle class and use fiscal policy for inclusive growth.</p><p>\"We have to realize that trade, global trade, is in fact an issue that is presenting some challenges to global growth. That's the environment we find ourselves in. We need to recognize the challenge,\" he said.</p><p>\"In the absence of making immediate progress, which is very much a U.S.-China discussion, we need to be focusing on investing (in) the future for Canadians.\"</p><p>The strategy - focus on what you can control; look for help from global alliances; and be ever vigilant not to poke the bear called Trump - has meant Canada has been able to keep the door mostly open with the United States.</p><p>On the diplomatic front, Morneau met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday and had a frank discussion with him about Buy America. The two countries' governments are still talking frequently.</p><p>On the trade front, Canadian exports to the United States were at a record high in May, fuelling growth in the Canadian economy almost against all odds.</p><p>While global diplomacy these days is not all whipping cream and lace, for Canada at least, it could be a lot worse.</p><p>Twitter: @hscoffield</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019071855091872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKN-F8C1-DY91-K0ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

Officially, the event is known as the 32nd Neural Information Processing Systems conference. Unofficially, it is the world's largest gathering of artificial intelligence experts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Element AI Inc., the conference is a coming-out party of sorts. In fact, he is determined to make it hard to miss the name and brand of his Montreal-based artificial intelligence software company. At Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, the company has persuaded the airport authority to superimpose \"AI\" in Element's corporate purple over the terminal's \"Montreal\" sign. When the conference's 8,000 guests arrive at their hotels, many are welcomed by greeters in Element AI T-shirts. The company is throwing a giant party in Old Montreal, and Mr. Gagn\u00e9 is hosting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a G7 event at its headquarters.</p><p>The CEO speaks of all this as though he's defending a castle: \"This conference is on our turf and there's no way we'll let all the foreign organizations that are already invading from all fronts across Canada just own this place,\" says the perennially unshaven Mr. Gagn\u00e9, wearing a suit jacket, Element T-shirt, jeans and sneakers.</p><p>Think big, spend big, and be loud about it: that might as well be Mr. Gagn\u00e9's motto. The Canadian technology industry is in the midst of a boom and is teeming with AI startups, but few have launched with a bigger splash than Element, a software company that is not yet three years old. The company launched in October, 2016, with a big vision and a global superstar on its founding team: Yoshua Bengio, the University of Montreal professor known as one of the godfathers of \"deep learning,\" the foundational science behind today's AI revolution.</p><p>Element set out to build a Canadian AI company to rival the world's biggest tech giants. \"The dream was, 'The next Google is going to be Canadian,' \" Dr. Bengio said in an interview.</p><p>Big names brought their chequebooks: Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp., Tencent Holdings Ltd., mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, plus a Korean conglomerate, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund and several Canadian investors, provided US$102-million in financing in spring, 2017. It was an unheard-of amount for a brand-new Canadian company and enabled Element to hire 500 employees including 100 PhDs. \"Clearly I've been a factor in attracting capital, attracting talent,\" Dr. Bengio said. \"But it's not only that.\"</p><p>Element has positioned itself as a global business star and thought leader on emerging issues around AI. The startup called itself \"an unprecedented Quebec success story\" in a submission to Quebec Finance Minister Eric Girard this year and attracted generally flattering media coverage. A 2018 headline from Fortune magazine asked, \"Can This Startup Break Big Tech's Hold on AI?\" and Fast Company in May named Mr. Gagn\u00e9 one of the world's 100 most creative people in business.</p><p>Element has also become the <url normalizedValue=\"https://thelogic.co/news/element-ai-seeking-to-shape-national-policy-is-lobbying-ottawa-more-than-every-other-artificial-intelligence-company-in-canada-combined/\">https://thelogic.co/news/element-ai-seeking-to-shape-national-policy-is-lobbying-ottawa-more-than-every-other-artificial-intelligence-company-in-canada-combined/</url>, lobbying federal politicians and government officials 85 times since the start of 2018 - startups rarely do direct lobbying - securing $5-million in federal aid and landing two photo-ops with the Prime Minister.</p><p>And there's more money on the way. Sources familiar with the company's plans say it is close to raising another US$100-million to US$250-million from a group of investors that includes pension fund manager Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, the Quebec government and a global consulting firm. Early backers already provided tens of millions of dollars in capital this spring.</p><p>But some are not buying into the hype. One financier who looked at an investment in Element last year, but passed, said: \"I just didn't believe the story   the math is not clear, the product road map is not clear, the only thing that's clear is [its strategy to] 'Hire as many people as we can.'\"</p><p>The skepticism is widely shared across the fledgling Canadian AI sector. Though no one will speak on the record, several rival AI entrepreneurs complain Element's rampant hiring has squeezed the market for scarce talent, while its progress is at odds with its claims to be Canada's premier AI company. Element doesn't yet have a proven track record of delivering products, said one AI entrepreneur in eastern Canada who questioned whether the company even has a viable business model, and yet it's draining the AI ecosystem.</p><p>In response to its critics, Element has unveiled ambitious product rollout plans: It is developing seven products during its fiscal year ending next Jan. 31, Mr. Gagn\u00e9 says, with three set for general availability by summer's end.</p><p>But Element has experienced setbacks on two of its flagship products in development and shed senior staff charged with taking them to market. Other products promised by the company are still in early stages and unlikely to be released for months. According to Public Services and Procurement Canada, Element as of early this year did not yet qualify among the top level of AI suppliers entitled to bid for government business because it hadn't delivered at least five successful AI projects. Startups consume cash, but with its big roster of expensive engineering talent, Element is burning through it at an unusually high rate.</p><p>Element can attract talent. But can it build a sustainable business?</p><p>The stakes are high. AI is infiltrating many industries and will change how people work, travel and get information, and how businesses operate as self-teaching algorithms replace human efforts. It's still early days in this transformation, but AI is already confronting governments and regulators with issues such as data sovereignty, privacy and built-in machine biases.</p><p>For its proponents, Element AI is Canada's bet to build a giant company and capture some of the value in this country, where many of the big AI breakthroughs happened. \"I am tired of Canada acting like the world's greatest poker player walking into casino after casino with two aces in its hands and folding halfway through,\" said Matt Ocko, an Element AI board member and managing partner at Data Collective, a Silicon Valley firm that was an early investor in the company. \"I want to see Canada have a massive   win.\"</p><p>Canada already risks falling behind: Chinese rivals Megvii Technology Ltd., and SenseTime Group Ltd. have already raised more than $1-billion each. Mr. Gagn\u00e9 knows that, if he wants Element to be the flag-carrier for Canada's AI industry, he still has a lot to prove. \"It's really the year of execution for us,\" he said.</p><p>Element's beginnings date to 2015, sparked in part by a conversation Mr. Gagn\u00e9 had with a troubled Dr. Bengio. Mr. Gagn\u00e9 had just taken a job as entrepreneur-in-residence with a Montreal venture capital firm, Real Ventures, which had backed his previous tech startup, optimization software developer Planora Inc. Mr. Gagne was responsible for developing Real's strategy to invest in the fledgling AI sector.</p><p>Meanwhile, his friend Dr. Bengio was getting worried about the state of the AI field he had helped create. US tech giants such as Google, Apple and Facebook were realizing the commercial potential of AI breakthroughs made by Canadian academics and their students, and hiring as much academic talent as possible, including fellow deep learning pioneer Geoff Hinton, a professor at University of Toronto.</p><p>Dr. Bengio suggested they create a company that would anchor a thriving domestic AI sector and help Canadian universities retain their academics. Their first plan, seeded by Real, was to build a core AI platform and fund an incubator that could spin off startups to deliver machine-learning tools to businesses that could perform functions such as reading and processing insurance applications or detecting and responding to anomalies on production lines. Key to that plan was quickly amassing top-tier AI talent. \"Think about how much money is being invested in China and in Silicon Valley,\" said Dr. Bengio. \"There's no way we're going to succeed if we don't push on the gas as much as is reasonable.\"</p><p>To Mr. Gagn\u00e9, that meant aiming larger than the typical\"lean startup\" approach by young technology companies of stretching scant resources to get their first products to market. \"We knew it was not going to happen by scraping and bootstrapping your way and getting one solution and hiring a few folks\" at a time.</p><p>He and his co-founders, including his spouse Anne Martel, research scientist Nicolas Chapados, and Real partner Jean S\u00e9bastien Cournoyer, felt their company had to get big, fast.</p><p>Element's founders aimed to establish their so-called \"supercredibility,\" a notion championed by visionary Silicon Valley entrepreneur Peter Diamandis in his 2015 book, Bold: How to Go Big, Create Wealth and Impact the World . Mr. Diamandis implored entrepreneurs to be brash and unapologetic, acting like they had already succeeded. Some of the basic principles of supercredibility include: \"Start at the top, and build your way up\"; \"When forced to compromise, ask for more\"; \"If you can't win, change the rules\"; and, \"If you can't change the rules, then ignore them.\"</p><p>\"We really wanted to make a dent,\" said Mr. Gagn\u00e9. \"The notion of impact, from the start, was one of the criteria that we wanted to make sure we had.\"</p><p>When Element launched, Dr. Bengio was front and centre, though his time spent on the company would be limited to an advisory role and board membership due to his other commitments. \"I am a very busy person,\" he said.</p><p>But the timing was perfect. The market was growing aware of the vast potential for AI to help companies derive new insights and make predictions by mining vast troves of their data. Money poured into the sector. Against that backdrop, Dr. Bengio's involvement anointed Element with supercredibility. Element was flooded with CVs from AI scientists and seasoned executives and more than 20 requests a day from potential customers \"from literally every corner of the globe\" asking how they could use AI in their business, said Naomi Goldapple, one of Element's earliest hires. (Ms. Goldapple spoke to the Globe last December when she was a director of industry solutions. She recently left the company and declined to comment further.)</p><p>Weeks later, Microsoft<url normalizedValue=\"https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/microsoft-investment-in-element-ai-bolsters-montreals-status-as-ai-hub/article33294325/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;service=mobile\">https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/microsoft-investment-in-element-ai-bolsters-montreals-status-as-ai-hub/article33294325/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;service=mobile</url> it was investing an undisclosed amount in Element, one of its first venture deals in AI. Calls followed from other prospective investors, including Data Collective's Mr. Ocko. His company was \"looking for the strongest independent concentration of self-sustaining AI talent that could actually drive product outcomes for global companies. Element AI met that set of criteria,\" he said. It wasn't a Chinese company subject to state influence, nor within the gravitational pull of AI-savvy, data-rich Silicon Valley giants that other corporations might be loath to work with. That was \"reinforced for us by Yoshua Bengio's position as co-founder and his unambiguous moral stature as the only truly prominent AI researcher who had not sold out,\" Mr. Ocko said.</p><p>The founding team set out to raise US$40-million in venture capital, a sizable sum for a fledgling Canadian company. Mr. Ocko encouraged them to think bigger and raise enough \"to be a global champion for Canada and a magnet for capital and talent to Canada.\" The founders decided to \"be as ambitious as we can [and] take the money,\" Mr. Cournoyer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/element-ai-closes-landmark-102-million-financing/article35302597/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/element-ai-closes-landmark-102-million-financing/article35302597/</url>. The ensuing financing announced in June, 2017. was one of the largest early-stage rounds for a nascent company in Canada.</p><p>But Element's path forward was fuzzy. It abandoned plans to be a startup factory that spun off AI businesses after determining large corporations weren't yet ready to deal with a slew of AI startups and still needed to wrap their heads around what AI could do for them. Instead Element decided to build those businesses in-house. It dabbled with different ways of helping corporate customers devise AI implementation strategies; most of its work for the first two years involved consulting to Canadian and multinational companies to address specific problems using AI.</p><p>The strategic shifts and consulting focus left observers wondering why investors would shell out so much for a company that did custom piecework, since consultants typically generate lower margins and command lower valuations than software sellers. \"We created a lot of confusion in the market,\" Mr. Gagn\u00e9 acknowledges.</p><p>But Mr. Ocko insists the plan was always that Element would evolve into a product company. \"That was going to take some time\" for Element to experiment and build out AI-based products that met customer needs, Mr. Ocko said.</p><p>In early 2018 Element decided to focus on two sectors: financial services and supply chain/logistics. Those target industries were rife with data, repetitive and paper-based processes and deep-pocketed companies willing to embrace AI, making them ideal targets for standardized AI products. Last July, Mr. Gagn\u00e9 told his staff he didn't want any proposals going out for work \"that didn't have eventual licence-recurring revenue attached to it for a product.\"</p><p>Starting in late 2018, Element began to reveal its product strategy and some early customers. It was working with investor GIC Private Ltd., the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, to develop a tool that automatically and frequently rebalanced investment portfolios. Another investor, National Bank of Canada, agreed to work with Element to develop a program that would help cybersecurity operators do their jobs by taking on some of the routine tasks of threat detection. The company signed up Gore Mutual, a property and casualty insurer in Cambridge, Ont.,and financial services giant HSBC to develop products for their industries. But it won't be until 2020 that the first products are ready to go to market.</p><p>Element has been quiet about its financial performance but a confidential document prepared for prospective investors last year and obtained by the Globe offers a rare glimpse.</p><p>As of June, 2018, the company had generated $4.7-million in revenue (primarily from consulting projects) for 19 customers including Maple Leaf, Barrick , L'Oreal and Hyundai. Sources briefed on Element's financial performance say revenue in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2019, totalled less than $10-million. Mr. Gagn\u00e9 declined to comment on financial performance except to say 90 per cent of revenues as of last December were for non-recurring business. He added results are on track with plans; Mr. Ocko said Element's revenues reflected in signed contracts covering future years is \"dramatically   larger \" than $10-million.</p><p>While that might be an impressive output for many startups, context is important. Software startups typically stretch resources and hire prudently until they build a \"minimum viable product\" that they take to market. Once they generate sales and market acceptance, they hire engineers and product designers to build out the offering and sales and marketing people to generate revenue.</p><p>Element took the reverse approach, snapping up machine-learning research scientists and marketers and amassing a big internal infrastructure before it had products in market. Element \"has lots of applied research scientists that think about and develop AI algorithms, but those aren't the same people that write software and intimately understand a use case and a particular problem you're trying to solve,\" said one recent insider.</p><p>As a result, Element is an expensive company to run, even in Montreal where costs are lower than in the Bay Area. And that's before it has commercially ready products to sell.</p><p>Aside from the normal startup accoutrements - staff are treated to a free kombucha and latt\u00e9 bar as well as complimentary lunches, snacks and carbonated water on tap at its Park Ex neighbourhood headquarters - the company also pays for things other startups can't afford.</p><p>That includes a 71-person fundamental research team led by 13 applied research scientists doing basic research whose main purpose is producing work \"to have academic impact,\" said Dr. Chapados, Element's chief science officer. \"Normally, investing in fundamental research is the stuff of very large corporations,\" he acknowledges. (Element has filed more than 50 patent applications.)</p><p>The company also compensates 24 outside AI academic \"fellows \" to provide occasional advice or feedback when needed. It maintains offices in Toronto, Seoul, Singapore and has a 20-person London, U.K., operation that does pro bono work to deliver \"AI for good\"-- a keen interest of Dr. Bengio's. Element also advises a Korean AI venture fund and partners with Singapore institutions to help develop their local startup sector.</p><p>Element does extensive lobbying (it hired a head of public policy and government relations early last year long before it had a chief financial officer) and even has a \"brand guru,\" also rarities for early-stage companies.</p><p>Element has so many employees that by early 2019 it was no longer defined as a \"small business,\" meaning it qualified for significantly lower research and development tax credits than companies with fewer than 500 people. (By comparison Shopify Inc. only reached the 500-employee mark the year it surpassed US$100 million in revenues.) That prompted Element to ask Quebec's Finance Minister to reconsider the rules, saying it was still a startup \"in hypergrowth mode.\"</p><p>Outsiders estimate Element's \"burn rate\" exceeds $5-million a month. The burn \"is pretty high,\" said Ms. Martel, Element's senior vice-president of operations, without confirming the amount. \"It's higher than a typical startup, definitely.\" Said Mr. Gagn\u00e9: \"If burn equals risk, then yes, we're taking more risk   It's an ambitious play, we never shy away from saying that.\"</p><p>Anchored by the belief that it needed to offer a full range of AI tools, and not just a single product to corporate customers, Element set out to launch seven products this year. \"Yes, we could sell one product at a time but we wanted to sell very quickly a suite of products to be able to penetrate larger organizations   that can help [solve] many of their problems,\" Ms. Martel said, calling it a \"contrarian, bold [strategy that] makes sense. Our expectation is that the revenue will also follow once we're in place in all these organizations.\"</p><p>With the market for AI solutions still nascent, Mr. Gagn\u00e9 acknowledged that the revenue potential of its offerings isn't clear. Selling to large corporations typically takes a long time, and it's hard enough for most startup to build a business around a single product, let alone seven.</p><p>Element has already had some product setbacks. In January, Element staff told The Globe and Mail during a product demonstration at its headquarters that its cybersecurity project with National Bank was in the advanced prototype stage and close to being sellable once it had been \"trained\" on National Bank data. But within a few months, The Globe has learned, the company quietly shelved the flagship project this past spring and parted ways with many of the business leaders hired to take the product to market. Element declined to comment on the status of the project and referred questions to the bank, which also declined to comment.</p><p>Element has also had some challenges developing a program to help the clogged Port of Montreal to develop software that would ease congestion by predicting wait times for truck drivers delivering or picking up loads. The predictions, available to truckers through the port's smartphone app, would come from mining data sources, including vessel arrival times, train manoeuvres and weather.</p><p>Element has worked with the port authority since early 2017 and progress on the client side has been slower than expected, Ms. Goldapple said in January. When the port expanded operating hours last fall, that threw things off for months because Element's algorithms were relying on historical data; testing is still ongoing and will only conclude later this year.</p><p>The port authority's director of information technology, Serge Montpetit, said the product had the potential to make his operation more effective. \"We want to be a smart port,\" he said. \"We're creating history here, we're at the beginning of something.\"</p><p>But is this a smart product for Element AI? The company hasn't worked out pricing yet but the cost would have to come out of the port's information technology budget, which is less than $10 million and already covers everything from business software to cellphones and computers. And it's not clear whether the product can be sold in a standardized form to other customers - ports are typically distinctive, depending on geography, local dynamics and differing operating and ownership models.</p><p>Asked how much he thought Element's product would have to be altered for each customer, Mr. Montpetit replied \"my guess is 30 per cent\" - a high amount that would hurt margins because of the work required with each sale. Element insiders also expressed doubt about the size of the potential market for the port product, which Mr. Gagn\u00e9 acknowledged would be highly customized and sold to operators that \"don't have a super large IT budget.\"</p><p>The company's foray into financial services may be more promising. Gore is Element's lead customer on a product that automates the intake and uploading of data from insurance applications for home, automobile and commercial insurance policies. Gore's chief information officer Sean Christie said the software will save the insurer money, increase its efficiency, reduce errors and provide the opportunity to capture and use more information from application forms. \"It's a slam-dunk business case for us. If they can price the product in the right space, they will be very successful.\"</p><p>But with a pilot project under way, Element will only be ready to market the product near year's end. The project with GIC is in the early stages and Element hasn't yet started to deploy the product with the Singapore fund. And while HSBC's head of transformation for global banking and markets, Chuck Texeira, said the UK-based bank picked Element AI after \"scour[ing] the world to find the best AI firms,\" it won't be until 2020 that the parties determine what products they will pursue together.</p><p>Nearly three years in, Element is still a work in progress. Then again, the entire AI ecosystem is. With deep-pocketed backers, Element still has the means to improve on its outcomes to date, and some observers in the Montreal investment community expect it will sharpen its focus and make staffing changes necessary to commercialize products in the months ahead with a greater sense of urgency.</p><p>\"Element AI is not a perfect company,\" said Mr. Ocko. \"They are still for all intents and purposes a startup. They have a long way to go to be a global export champion for Canada   They will make mistakes. They have made mistakes.\" But Mr. Ocko says he's \"very happy\" with the company's progress toward commercialization. \"Anyone who had a bad attitude about the company is going to be gravely disappointed.\"</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canadas-element-ai-is-making-a-high-stakes-gamble-it-can-be-a-world/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canadas-element-ai-is-making-a-high-stakes-gamble-it-can-be-a-world/</url> The viewing of this article is only available to Globe Unlimited subscribers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20190718ellipsis_TMIGTT26W5BWJOYZLJ76WYYTJQ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKY-NC11-JCS0-V2NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3987\"/><timeReceived>6:44 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Sonoda is busy cutting his latest movie, a thriller about brothers who steal a stash of money and face unintended consequences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But despite looming production deadlines, he intends to make time to attend candidate meetings ahead of Canada's federal election in October.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This election is just too important,\" says Sonoda in an interview. \"As a filmmaker, I personally want to see Canadian creators continue to be able to tell stories in the digital age. The playing field is changing so quickly and so fast nothing is guaranteed and I want our elected officials to know that.\"</p><p>Canada's film and television industry is launching what it says is an unprecedented \"first of its kind\" campaign ahead of the election, asking party candidates whether they support Canadian content that is under threat from foreign digital platforms.</p><p>\"It's democracy at work, our members live and work across the country and we think it's an important enough topic that our leaders should be considering this,\" said Dave Forget, national executive director of the Directors Guild of Canada in an interview. \"This is a crucial intersection where culture meets economics. It's about telling Canadian stories in a $9 billion annual industry with 180,000 jobs at stake.\"</p><p>The political pressure campaign, launched Thursday with the websites justask.2019.ca and jeminplique2019.ca, is a coalition of cast, crew and creators including the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA) The Directors Guild of Canada and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE).</p><p>\"This is really a critical time for the industry,\" says Forget. \"If the government doesn't act now and modernize the legislation, it puts the creation of Canadian content at risk. Most Canadians would agree that we should have the ability to tell stories to ourselves, and our stories to the world.\"</p><p>The push by the unions is partly in reaction to foreign digital platforms such as Netflix and Amazon and other players who are not required under legislation to contribute to Canadian content.</p><p>The \"Just Ask\" campaign encourages film and television workers to pledge to attend one election-related event before the October election to ask at least one key industry-related question.</p><p>The top \"suggested question\" on the website is if candidates \"Support both legislation and regulation requiring all players that benefit from the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications systems to invest in the creation of original Canadian programming.\"</p><p>This is a contentious issue in the industry. Currently, foreign digital streamers such as Netflix are not required to contribute to the Canadian Media Fund, which invests in local programming. However, domestic cable and satellite providers have to contribute 5 per cent of their revenues into Canadian programming.</p><p>Read more:</p><p>Canada's competition bureau 'monitoring' tech giants for anti-competitive behaviour</p><p>Why Canada must regulate Big Tech: 'The 20th century tools we have for protecting a free society won't work for 21st century giants'</p><p>Canadian actor Simu Liu on his groundbreaking role as Marvel superhero Shang-Chi</p><p>Other suggested topics include funding and tax credits for arts and culture, copyright protection, support of public broadcasting and promoting diversity and protections for precarious workers.</p><p>Toronto director Sonoda, who has directed episodes of The Trailer Park Boys, This Hour Has 22 Minutes, and Murdoch Mysteries, says Canadian stories make an impact not just domestically, but around the world.</p><p>\"When I travel and tell people I'm Canadian, I've had people say I love the Trailer Park Boys without knowing I directed it,\" says Sonoda. \"That's the power of having our own culture on the screen. You can't make that show anywhere else but Nova Scotia.\"</p><p>Other Canadian shows that are currently making a splash globally are Schitt's Creek with four Emmy Award Nominations, and the critically acclaimed Anne With An E. and Letterkenny.</p><p>Sonoda is currently making heist caper Things I Do For Money, set in Hamilton about two Japanese-Canadian cello playing brothers.</p><p>\"We can't tell the stories we tell without the specificity and the regional voices we have in Canada,\" said Sonoda.</p><p>Although his federal riding is Spadina-Fort York, Sonoda says he intends to go to other ridings to question candidates about their position on Canadian culture and the digital economy.</p><p>\"I think we need to have our voices heard in as many places as possible.\"</p><p>A federal review panel is currently looking at ways to create new regulations, but their report won't be available till January 2020, months after the election.</p><p>Netflix, meanwhile, has already said it would be unfair for Ottawa to force it to contribute to the fund.</p><p>\"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" they argued in a submission to the federal panel.</p><p>The Liberals have been criticized for not doing enough for Canadian culture after former heritage minister Melanie Jolie, unveiled a deal in 2017 that Netflix would spend $500 million on production, but with no obligation to contribute to the Canadian Media Fund.</p><p>\"Whatever the results of the upcoming election, the federal government should understand and support the success of the industry,\" said IATSE director of Canadian affairs John Lewis in a statement.</p><p>The political winds do seem to be shifting already as the major parties and regulatory players try to form a digital strategy on Canadian content in the era of big technology and online streaming.</p><p>\"We have to come up with a model so that everyone who is deriving benefit from the system contributes,\" Ian Scott, the influential chair of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission told the Star in an earlier interview.</p><p>And in an emailed statement to the Star on the issue of Canadian culture and content, Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez said he expects all players will eventually have to contribute.</p><p>\"The end goal is clear: if you benefit, you contribute,\" said Rodriguez. \"We will take all appropriate measures to ensure that all players including the web giants offering meaningful levels of Canadian content in their catalogues, contribute to the creation of Canadian content, and promote Canadian content and make it easily accessible on platforms.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

It's about telling Canadian stories in a $9-billion annual industry with 180,000 jobs at stake.\"</p><p>The campaign launched Thursday with the websites justask.2019.ca and jeminplique2019.ca and includes a coalition of cast, crew and creators.</p><p>The campaign includes the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA) The Directors Guild of Canada and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE).</p><p>\"This is really a critical time for the industry,\" says Forget. \"If the government doesn't act now and modernize the legislation it puts the creation of Canadian content at risk. Most Canadians would agree that we should have the ability to tell stories ourselves, and our stories to the world.\"</p><p>The push by the unions is partly in reaction to foreign digital platforms such as Netflix and Amazon and other players who are not required under legislation to contribute to Canadian content.</p><p>The \"Just Ask\" campaign encourages film and television workers to pledge to attend one election-related event before October to ask at least one key industry-related question.</p><p>The top \"suggested question\" on the website is if candidates \"support both legislation and regulation requiring all players that benefit from the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications systems to invest in the creation of original Canadian programming.\"</p><p>This is a contentious issue in the industry. Currently, foreign digital streamers such as Netflix are not required to contribute to the Canadian Media Fund which invests in local programming. However, domestic cable and satellite providers have to contribute 5 per cent of their revenues to Canadian programming.</p><p>Other suggested topics include funding and tax credits for arts and culture, copyright protection, support of public broadcasting and promoting diversity and protections for precarious workers.</p><p>\"Creative industry workers are seeking candidates from all political parties to just ask them where they stand on supporting a strong Canadian film and TV industry,\" said ACTRA President David Sparrow in a statement.</p><p>Sparrow said original Canadian programming such as Schitt's Creek (recently nominated for four Emmys) Letterkenny and Anne with an E have found audiences globally.</p><p>\"Whatever the results of the upcoming election, the federal government should understand and support the success of the industry,\" said John Lewis, IATSE director of Canadian Affairs in a statement.</p><p>A federal review panel is currently looking at solutions, but their report won't be available until January 2020, months after the election.</p><p>Netflix, meanwhile, has already said it would be unfair for Ottawa to force it to contribute to the fund.</p><p>\"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" they argued in a submission to the federal panel.</p><p>The Liberals have been criticized for not doing enough for Canadian culture after former Heritage Minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly unveiled a deal in 2017 that Netflix would spend $500 million on production, but with no obligation to contribute to the Canadian Media Fund.</p><p>The political winds do seem to be shifting already as the major parties and regulatory players try to form a digital strategy on Canadian content in the era of big technology and online streaming.</p><p>\"We have to come up with a model so that everyone who is deriving benefit from the system contributes,\" Ian Scott, the influential chair of the Canadian-Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission told the Star in an earlier interview.</p><p>Read more:</p><p>Canada's competition bureau 'monitoring' tech giants for anti-competitive behaviour</p><p>Why Canada must regulate Big Tech: 'The 20th century tools we have for protecting a free society won't work for 21st century giants'</p><p>Canadian actor Simu Liu on his groundbreaking role as Marvel superhero Shang-Chi</p><p>And in an emailed statement to the Star on the issue of Canadian culture and content, Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez said he expects that all players will eventually have to contribute.</p><p>\"The end goal is clear: if you benefit, you contribute,\" said Rodriguez. \"We will take all appropriate measures to ensure that all players including the web giants offering meaningful levels of Canadian content in their catalogues contribute to the creation of Canadian content, and promote Canadian content and make it easily accessible on platforms.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

As the world changes so much, this is certainly a place where people can make their home.\u201d</p><p>The investment office is an arm of the Ministry of Economic Development and Growth and the Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science.</p><p>Andrew Guy speaks to foreign journalists at the Ontario Investment and Trade Centre (Courtesy)</p><p>In January, a group of Canadian technology company founders, executives and investors called for Ottawa, Canada\u2019s capital, to provide temporary residency to the people displaced by a US order banning the entry of visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries, Reuters reported.</p><p>On March 6, Trump signed a revised, and somewhat toned down, executive order which reinstated his ban on immigration from some Muslim-majority countries.</p><p>In the January letter to their government, the Canadian companies said a number of people in the tech community had been affected by Trump\u2019s January 2017 executive order.</p><p>\u201cCanadian tech companies understand the power of inclusion and diversity of thought, and that talent and skill know no borders,\u201d more than 200 industry players who signed the letter said, as reported by Reuters. \u201cMany Canadian tech entrepreneurs are immigrants, are the children of immigrants, employ and have been employed by immigrants.\u201d</p><p>US immigration policies and a potential change to the way work visas for foreign workers are issued \u201cwill be closely watched\u201d by the tech community globally, Randall Lane, the editor of Forbes recently said in an interview with The Times of Israel.</p><p>The high-tech community in the US has expressed concern that Trump\u2019s immigration policies will hurt its technological edge. Trump\u2019s administration has also drafted an executive order that would change the way H-1B work visas are issued for foreign workers, Bloomberg reported in January. And tech companies depend on these to employ thousands of workers each year.</p><p>Inception LifeBank, Mississauga, Ontario, which stores cord blood for Canadian parents (Courtesy)</p><p>With a highly educated population \u2014 67 percent of Ontario\u2019s adult population has completed post-secondary education \u2014 with a GDP that is larger than that of Sweden or Austria, and with its export ties to some of the largest global markets, Ontario has the infrastructure to host a significant startup scene. Last year a delegation of Canadian officials visited Israel to learn how it is done in the Startup Nation.</p><p>\u201cThere is a thriving, growing tech scene in Canada, driven in some degree already by tech entrepreneurs who have immigrated to Canada,\u201d David Shore, the Canadian representative of the Jerusalem-based crowdfunding venture capital firm OurCrowd, said in an email interview. \u201cIf the US has a more closed-door policy, Canada is a natural friendly alternative destination.\u201d</p><p>Several years ago, Canada implemented a startup visa program designed to encourage tech entrepreneurs to move to Canada, he said. \u201cCanada has established longstanding immigration policies that are designed to attract the best of global talent.\u201d</p><p>A lab worker at the McEwen Centre for Regenerative Medicine in Toronto, Canada (Courtesy)</p><p>The country has a highly skilled, highly educated workforce, a strong local capital environment and significant tax benefits for R&amp;D, Shore said. Wages tend to be lower in Canada relative to Silicon Valley and the exchange rate versus the US dollar also helps. OurCrowd has already made investments in two Canadian technology companies: Wave, which has developed a suite of apps for accounting, and Influitive, which has created a marketing platform. \u201cOurCrowd continues to actively look for new investment opportunities in Canada, \u201d Shore said.</p><p>Even so, Shore added, Trump\u2019s policies are \u201cunlikely\u201d to impact Silicon Valley \u201cdue to the already massive concentration of both capital and technology companies there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may have an effect on peripheral centers, as tech entrepreneurs think \u2018the Valley or nothing.'\u201d And in those cases, Canada could be an alternative.</p><p>To take its place on the global tech scene, Ontario is touting its vast research and university facilities and its diversified populations, aiming to get the province, which is larger geographically than France and Spain combined, identified as a tech and startup hub, along the lines of Silicon Valley, Boston, New York, and Tel Aviv.</p><p>Their efforts have been fruitful \u2014 venture capital investment in Canadian companies set new highs in 2016, according to a Thomson Reuters report on the industry. A total of 459 Canadian companies closed 571 rounds of financing totaling $3.7 billion. This represented both a 15-year high in dollars invested and a 36% increase over 2015, a year-on-year jump not seen since the year 2000 when VC investment more than doubled over 1999, the report said.</p><p>Even so, the amount is still lower than the close to $5 billion Israeli tech companies raised that year, according to Israel\u2019s IVC Research Center, or the whopping $69.1 billion invested VC funds in the US, down from 2015\u2019s peak of $79.3 billion. Global VC activity declined 24% year-over-year in 2016, according to a KPMG report.</p><p>A lab in the MaRs building in Toronto (Courtesy)</p><p>\u201cIn 2016, Canada bucked the downward VC investment trend experienced by many of its Americas counterparts, driven significantly by late Q4\u201916 deals,\u201d the KPMG report said. \u201cDespite quarterly fluctuations in activity, the Canadian VC market is clearly maturing and becoming an appealing area for US VCs able to invest beyond the border.\u201d</p><p>In 2016, Canada saw numerous large investments, including the Americas\u2019 biggest funding round during the fourth quarter: a Series A raise of $225 million by Toronto-based BlueRock Therapies backed by Bayer and Versant Ventures. The deal was the fourth largest globally in the fourth quarter of the year, according to KPMG.</p><p>Based on the work of Dr. Gordon Keller and Dr. Michael Laflamme, BlueRock seeks to use stem cells to regenerate heart muscle in patients who have had a heart attack or suffer from chronic heart failure. \u201cThe idea is to make whole organ transplant obsolete, and repair organs will stem cells,\u201d Keller told the group of foreign journalists, including this one, who were hosts of the Ontario government.</p><p>Researchers at the Canada McMaster Stem Call Research Institute in Toronto (Courtesy)</p><p>The BlueRock deal, and a funding round by Hubba Inc. led by Goldman Sachs, \u201cillustrate how the country is gaining attention on the investment radar of international VC investors and corporates,\u201d the KPMG report said.</p><p>\u201cWe have long way to go compared to Israel,\u201d in terms of the number of startups being generated in Canada, said Jon Rogers, the chief operating officer of Toronto-based XOR Labs, a medical device company that is developing a technology to repair lungs \u2014 and in future other human organs as well \u2013 to make them better suited for organ transplants. \u201cBut the government is making a push to make the country more innovative, and take better advantage of the great research available here.\u201d</p><p>As an R&amp;d company, XOR gets federal support which allows the startup to claim back 40 percent of everything the company spends on R&amp;D, in cash, he said.</p><p>The company, which is in the process of raising some CAD15 million to develop its product, has grown from five employees to 10 in the past year and \u201ccould easily\u201d double again in a year\u2019s time, Rogers said.</p><p>Ontario is an attractive place to set up a startup, he said, because of its strong research facilities, and \u201cunlike the US which is thinking in, we are thinking out.\u201d</p><p>Creating a startup ecosystem in MaRs</p><p>To create a vibrant startup ecosystem, Ontario has set up the MaRs building, which prides itself as being the largest urban innovation hub in the world. Located in downtown Toronto, it is surrounded by local hospitals and just minutes away from the University of Toronto, the Ontario Brain Institute, the McMaster University, the Ontario Cancer Institute and the SickKids hospital.</p><p>Toronto\u2019s MaRs building is a tech hub (Courtesy)</p><p>\u201cToronto was not considered an innovation center, but MaRs has put us on the map,\u201d said Cory Mulvihill, in charge of policy and public affairs at MaRS. \u201cWe have investors coming here because they know medical assets are coming out of here.\u201d</p><p>Set up some 15 years ago, the initiative, a joint venture of the governments of Ontario and Canada, the City of Toronto and the University of Toronto, is today home to 100 startups and a total of some 200 entities including academic research bodies, VC funds and more established players who work in the fields of health, energy and environment, finance, commerce and education. The complex doubled its capacity a year ago and is now a 1.5 million sq. ft. complex, said Mulvihill.</p><p>The idea is to create a space in which the players can rub shoulders in coffee shops and take part in workshops and mentorship programs, to enable them to scale globally and also have a societal impact, he said.</p><p>The recent deals in Canadian companies \u201cshow the huge amount of momentum. And we expect that to continue,\u201d Mulvihill said.</p><p>Life sciences and regenerative medicine is a field in which Canada can make a global impact, researchers and government officials believe. Ontario\u2019s universities and research centers, at which insulin was discovered in 1922 and the first Alzheimer\u2019s gene was identified in 1995, already have a history of discovery and innovation. Now, the aim is to make Ontario a global leader in regenerative medicine, using stem cells, first discovered at Toronto\u2019s Princess Margaret Hospital, to revolutionize the treatment of degenerative diseases. This includes using the cells to repair damaged tissues and organs, like hearts, lungs or blood damaged by disease or reprogram the immune system to fight multiple sclerosis, for example.</p><p>\u201cWe aim to make Ontario a global leader in the development and commercialization of stem cell therapies,\u201d said Duncan Stewart, the president and scientific director of the Ontario Institute for Regenerative Medicine (OIRM), which aims to promote stem cell and regenerative medicine in Canada. \u201cWe have the potential to address the most chronic degenerative diseases, and our regulatory environment is more favorable than that in the US or Europe. We have here an opportunity to create an international cell therapy and manufacturing clinical trial hub.\u201d</p><p>A lab worker at the MaRs Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto (Courtesy)</p><p>Over 200 research programs are underway in Ontario, including stem cell biologists, tissue engineers and clinicians, and some teams are already focused on translating the clinical discoveries into products.</p><p>\u201cWe have had some successes, but we are at very early stages,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe potential is huge.\u201d Just as the cost of computers decreased as the technology improved, so will costs of stem cell therapies decline as the technology advances, he said.</p><p>Tissue Regeneration Therapeutics (TRT) is a biotechnology company that has discovered the richest source of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs): stem cells that are stored in the tissue that surrounds the vein and the arteries within the umbilical cord. These cells have powerful regenerative, anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties. The company has patented the process by which the MSCs are extracted. TRT is now in the process of looking for strategic international pharma partners, the founder, Prof. John Davies, told reporters.</p><p>\u201cRegenerative medicine is where we can set ourselves apart and be leaders in this space,\u201d said Michael May, the president and CEO of the Center for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine (CCRM), a nonprofit, public-private consortium that aims to help researchers accelerate the commercialization of the discoveries by helping build manufacturing capabilities, enabling clinical trials and creating a supportive regulatory network.</p><p>Set up in 2012, the organization currently has 70 employees and has helped launch six portfolio companies in the past 1.5 years. It is now setting up what it says is the world\u2019s first regenerative medicine venture fund, aiming to raise some $150 million.</p><p>A lab at the McEwen Centre for Regenerative Medicine in Toronto (Courtesy)</p><p>\u201cThe VC fund is a critical piece of the equation if you want to create a viable industry,\u201d May said. \u201cWe have solid companies and the manufacturing industry is maturing. These successes need to be told so we can raise risk capital so we can grow. The momentum is happening now.\u201d</p><p>May will be coming to Israel in May to set up CCRM in Israel to work with eight Israeli institutions, including Tel Aviv University, Hadassah Hospital, the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. The cooperation is part of a memorandum of understanding signed by Ontario and Israel last year, May said.</p><p>The fields of healthtech and biotech \u201cstood out as an investor priority in all regions of the world\u201d in 2016, and the trend is expected to continue in 2017, the KPMG report said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/88/148932993202.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/88/148932993202.jpg</url></p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned anti-Semitic acts that took place in Canada following Donald Trump's election in the US.

That\u2019s an increasingly urgent question given the activities of Victoria-based AggregateIQ, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, not to mention Russia, in recent elections in Europe and the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Canada needs to prepare itself for the 2019 federal election, and the Canadian government is starting to talk more seriously about how to address the risks we face.</p><p>The issues of disinformation, hate speech and targeted manipulation of voters are complicated, and the policy solutions are not yet clear. What is clear is that Canada needs new inspiration.</p><p>Canada often looks to the U.S. government as either a leader or partner. This time, Canada should look to Europe.</p><p>Canada\u2019s electoral rules, norms and procedures bear more similarity to many European countries than to the United States. Like them, we keep our election campaigns short. We have strict rules about campaign financing. We also face the same problem: our citizens use social media platforms created in the U.S. by CEOs who are often unresponsive to non-American concerns about data privacy or electoral interference.</p><p>There are at least three areas where Canada can take inspiration from Europe.</p><p>First, data privacy. Online giants like Google and Facebook have accumulated huge amounts of data about our lives that are used to design and target political messages. Calling this \u2018data\u2019 is too neutral \u2014 it is, instead, the digital records of the lives we live. It can include the routes we took when walking through our cities, the websites we visited to research our hobbies and fears, and the emotions we revealed in our vocabulary choices.</p><p>Unlike the U.S., Europe is taking action to give citizens some control over the records of their lives. In May, a new framework for data security will come into force in the European Union.</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires all organizations that collect and process data to have people\u2019s clear and explicit consent. It also gives people the right to know what data about them is being collected, the right to get a copy of that data to take elsewhere and the right to demand that personal data is erased.</p><p>Facebook, Google and other platforms are retooling their activities to meet the GDPR\u2019s provisions, at least for European citizens.</p><p>Canada can follow in the wake of GDPR and implement similar provisions. Indeed, the Canadian privacy commissioner has been calling for updates to our \u201carchaic privacy laws\u201d to ensure meaningful, informed consent for the collection and use of our data, and to give us a right to demand the removal of inaccurate or outdated information.</p><p>Second, preventing online harassment. Our democracy is corroded by online threats, hate and harassment of public figures and ordinary citizens. Twitter and other social media platforms can be toxic, particularly for women, Indigenous Canadians and minorities.</p><p>This toxic environment can exclude groups that already face marginalization in public debates, and can poison conversations among citizens with different views.</p><p>The U.S. commitment to freedom of speech, including the absence of hate speech laws, makes it very unlikely it will pursue policies to address these issues.</p><p>The EU, and especially Germany, is taking a different tack. In 2017, Germany enacted a law to force online platforms to remove \u201cobviously illegal\u201d posts that contravened German hate speech law within 24 hours or risk fines of up to 50 million euros ($77.6 million).</p><p>While there are valid concerns that the law overreaches and may induce private companies to overzealously censor content, it has forced social media platforms to take a serious look at how to quickly address problematic content. The new German government has proposed some fixes to address these issues.</p><p>Canada need not take the German approach. But we can follow Germany\u2019s lead of making clear and strong demands about how our own laws on hate speech, defamation and harassment are enforced online.</p><p>Third, empowering democratic discourse through civic media. It\u2019s not enough to crack down on manipulative or threatening content online. To act as democratic citizens, we need access to diverse, accurate and public-oriented information and conversations.</p><p>Most European countries spend more on public broadcasters than Canada, and provide direct and indirect support to other journalism organizations to maintain robust media ecosystems. Only a few weeks ago, 71.6 per cent of Swiss citizens voted in a referendum to keep funding their public broadcaster.</p><p>European countries also convinced Google to commit tens of millions of dollars a year to support news media. A new High Level Expert Group set up by the European Commission to advise them on \u201cfake news\u201d argued that it is critical to \u201csafeguard the diversity and sustainability of the European news media ecosystem\u201d through public funding of journalism and supporting civil society groups like fact-checkers, computer scientists and technology innovation centres.</p><p>The Canadian government recognizes that public-oriented journalism needs support and committed $50 million over five years to support local journalism, though it\u2019s not clear this will have a significant or sustainable impact.</p><p>Furthermore, it\u2019s not just journalism that needs support. We also need more and better civic apps, fact-checking organizations and digital literacy programs.</p><p>Europe does not have all the answers for Canada. Some European policies may not work or may not fit the Canadian context.</p><p>But Europeans are taking digital manipulation of democracy seriously. Canada is a small market that cannot hope to sway big tech companies on its own. Working with Europe, which has an economy larger than the U.S. economy, could be the only way for Canada to create change. Canada should look to Europe for ideas and for a negotiating partner.</p><p>Chris Tenove is a postdoctoral research fellow at the school of public policy and global affairs / graduate school of journalism, and Heidi J.

He recommended that MPs revise Canadian laws, such as the the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and the Privacy Act, to recognize that privacy as a human right that underlies and protects other rights.</p><p>\"A rights-based law would not be an impediment to innovation; to the contrary, good privacy laws are key to promoting trust in both government and commercial activities,\" Mr. Therrien wrote in a statement accompanying the report.</p><p>Canada lags behind jurisdictions such as Europe in modernizing privacy regulation in today's data-driven economy. The European Union spent years working on its consumer-first General Data Protection Regulation before data-misuse and data-breach scandals from companies such as Facebook Inc. and Equifax Inc. revealed the consequences of unchecked data collection. The subsequent backlash and growing public distrust of Big Tech's data usage has prompted other jurisdictions, such as Canada, to catch up before further data scandals emerge.</p><p>Justin Trudeau's Liberals unveiled details of a \"digital charter\" to rein in tech giants' power <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-ottawa-launches-new-digital-charter-to-protect-canadians-personal/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-ottawa-launches-new-digital-charter-to-protect-canadians-personal/</url>, which recommended fines and data-collection restrictions for companies that violate privacy laws. But the proposal was thin on details about financial penalties or the types of behaviour that could lead to a fine.</p><p>Mr. Therrien's report urges Parliamentarians to develop \"consequential penalties for non-compliance with the law,\" and to ensure proactive industry inspections to ensure companies adhere to the law. It also suggests that the public sector should only allow \"privacy-invasive activities\" in such cases where there is a \"pressing and substantial purpose and where the intrusion is proportional to the benefit gained.\"</p><p>The report <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2019/nr-c_191210/\">https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2019/nr-c_191210/</url> Statistics Canada for having collected credit histories and proposing to collect transaction information from banks without consumers' consent.

I was hoping to learn something new about Tim Hortons'location surveillance efforts by asking one of its technology partners what it had about me.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Back in June, I'd reported that the coffee chain had been tracking me and countless other customers through its mobile ordering app.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Tim Hortons itself wasn't doing the data analytics work to process GPS signals and figure out where I lived and worked, as well as whenever I visited one of its competitors. Instead, Tim Hortons'parent company, Restaurant Brands International Inc., contracted that work out to New York-based Radar Labs Inc.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was curious as to whether there was additional information about me in Radar's servers, since it was handling the raw data behind Tim Hortons'tracking efforts.</p><p>But other than some additional detail suggesting phones can capture altitude, there wasn't much new in the spreadsheets I received. I really only learned what I already knew: Tim Hortons had been tracking me. I also learned how frustrating it can be to try to figure out where your data goes.</p><p>The much more important conclusion to come out of the whole process of trying to find out what data a particular company had on me is that Canada's Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) is fundamentally flawed.</p><p>The act is largely toothless, legal experts have said, with the only real penalty for violating the law being a potential loss of reputation.</p><p>\"Reputational harm is currently the bigger risk, as opposed to pure legal risk,\" University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist said when I interviewed him about PIPEDA in July. \"The law itself doesn't have enough teeth.\"</p><p>In theory, the right to access your data under PIPEDA should be a key component of how Canadians protect their privacy and prevent corporations from abusing the information they collect.</p><p>In practice, technology systems are built in a way to frustrate transparency, and companies do not face any real penalties when they ignore the law.</p><p>My investigation of the location tracking done by Tim Hortons on its customers started in October 2019, when my phone received an alert that said the company's app had checked my location in the background - in other words, I was not using the app at the time.</p><p>After I filed a request for all of my personal information that Tim Hortons held, a right that every Canadian has under PIPEDA, I received a trove of data indicating that the app was indeed tracking me.</p><p>Radar Labs was processing the data, turning raw location co-ordinates into insights, such as inferring where I lived and worked, as well as details about when I visited the location of one of the coffee chain's competitors.</p><p>The app even tracked me on vacation all the way to Amsterdam and Morocco.</p><p>On the same day my initial story about this tracking was published, I filed a follow-up request to Radar Labs, because its website seemed to indicate that it might be holding a much larger stash of location data on me.</p><p>The data RBI had already sent me appeared to be pulled directly from the company's servers, recording only the insights that Radar Labs had sent it. But Radar's website states that when clients use its technology, Radar receives a steady stream of location data from phones as often as every three to five minutes.</p><p>I asked Radar directly to see everything it had, but the company never directly responded.</p><p>Yet PIPEDA states: \"An organization shall respond to a request with due diligence and in any case not later than thirty days after receipt of the request.\"</p><p>More than two months later, I still haven't received a formal response from Radar.</p><p>However, 28 days after I sent my request, I received an email from RBI that said, \"Radar referred your request to RBI. Your access request relates to personal information collected through the Tim Hortons app and, accordingly, RBI will provide you with a response.\"</p><p>RBI unilaterally gave itself another 30 days to respond, setting a new deadline of Aug. 11.</p><p>At 8:27 p.m. on Aug. 11, RBI sent me another email that said, \"We conducted a thorough analysis of your data in Radar's custody and found no additional data beyond what we have already provided to you.\"</p><p>As part of that email, I received two spreadsheets of data. \"The data in the attached files includes both the data previously provided to you and any new information in Radar's custody collected between November 1, 2019 through June 12, 2020,\" RBI's email said.</p><p>The main takeaway from the data sent to me in August was the same conclusion I arrived at months ago: the Tim Hortons app on my phone was silently logging location co-ordinates and other data on my phone in an effort to track me.</p><p>The only new thing I could find was that it might be possible for a company to log my altitude if it had the right access.</p><p>One of the new spreadsheets that arrived from Tim Hortons included columns labelled \"floorlevel,\" \"altitude\" and \"verticalaccuracy,\" but two of those columns were completely devoid of data. And the altitude column only had spotty data, with many spreadsheet lines left empty, and recorded numbers ranging from 39.79999924 up to 292.5195313, which might measure feet or metres above sea level, but it's not clear.</p><p>\"The floor level and vertical accuracy fields are empty in our response to your access request because those fields are not associated with the platform upon which your device operates,\" Duncan Fulton, Tim Hortons chief corporate officer, said in a response to a follow-up question. \"We confirm that we never used altitude data to attempt to ascertain your (or anyone else's) vertical location within a multi-storey building.\"</p><p>But, it turns out, some phones have built-in barometers and other sensors that can track altitude.</p><p>Along with longitude and latitude co-ordinates, and the data possibly recording elevation, the spreadsheets contained what could charitably be called a lot of gibberish.</p><p>One column labelled \"projectguid\" had the same string of numbers and letters - \"5b45b3e7-cacf-4f33-bb60-ea5d20b21dec\" - for each row and a different column, simply labelled \"_id,\" had information such as \"5d4e9a70fd4dd2002744e8d7\" in each line.</p><p>I repeatedly tried reaching out to Radar, but the only response was a terse email from chief executive and company co-founder Nick Patrick, who told me I should only be talking to Tim Hortons.</p><p>Tim Hortons said some of those numbers are unique identifiers for specific locations. Some of the numbers also appeared in the older files sent to me by Tim Horton.</p><p>\"The 24-character entries you cited (e.g. 593083c28f27e8a156bd63d4) are Radar's unique identifiers to identify a location based on the applicable latitude and longitude co-ordinates, which were also included in our prior response,\" Fulton said in an email. \"Unique identifiers are used because locations may sometimes not have a specific street address.\"</p><p>PIPEDA specifically anticipated this kind of thing, and the law states, \"The requested information shall be provided or made available in a form that is generally understandable. For example, if the organization uses abbreviations or codes to record information, an explanation shall be provided.\"</p><p>But there's little recourse if an organization doesn't comply.</p><p>If I think a company has violated the privacy law, I can file a complaint to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, and perhaps there might be a subsequent investigation. There might even be a report that would name and shame the company in question.</p><p>As a result of my investigation, Tim Hortons has already taken the public relations hit about its location-tracking practices, and the privacy commissioner has now launched its own probe.</p><p>Ultimately, we'd still probably need to just take Radar Labs'word, via RBI in this case, that it has nothing else on me in its servers.</p><p>Since first reporting on the Tim Hortons app, I've heard whispers from multiple sources about the grey market of companies buying and selling user data, perhaps even the same companies that publicly claim they never sell such data.</p><p>There is no evidence to suggest that Radar or Tim Hortons engage in such practices, and I'm not suggesting they do. But until I requested my data from Tim Hortons, I had no idea that Radar Labs even held any data on me, because the app and the privacy policy don't reveal which third-party service providers Tim Hortons uses.</p><p>The point is that technology companies design their services in ways that make it impossible for a user to know what's really going on behind the scenes.</p><p>Key questions remain: How can I have any hope of controlling where my data winds up if I don't even know who has my data? How can I consent to something when I don't know it's happening? None of this is unique to Tim Hortons. Technology systems today are built to provide a clean user interface and hide the guts of the system. The public doesn't know what is happening behind the facade, whether it's Tim Hortons doing location tracking, or Google LLC and Facebook Inc. using every possible scrap of data to target ads.</p><p>However, public trust is the casualty when consumers know they're being used, but not how they and their data are specifically being used. And if we don't know how our technology works, we suspect the worst.</p><p>For example, in spite of assurances to the contrary from every privacy expert in the country, a Leger poll recently found that 52 per cent of Canadians do not believe the federal government that its recently introduced COVID-19 app doesn't track location.</p><p>Only 20 per cent of Canadians said they'll install the app, which could be a critical tool for tracing the spread of infection if there was enough public buy-in.</p><p>This lack of trust in technology is becoming a life-ordeath issue.</p><p>Globally, regulating big tech remains one of the great unsolved problems of our time, but no one has come up with an answer, other than a few hand slaps and inconsequential fines.</p><p>PIPEDA certainly isn't cutting it. The promise of transparency falls short, and we're all the worse for it.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jmcleod@postmedia.com\">jmcleod@postmedia.com</email> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.
